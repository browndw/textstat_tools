INT. APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small New York City apartment, sparsely furnished. MIRANDA PRESLEY, 21, sits on the floor amid moving boxes and suitcases packing to move out. She's sorting through a stack of old record albums, looking through them as she piles them in a box. We catch sight of some relics from the disco era as well as several classic country albums - Donny Osmond and the “Saturday Night Fever” soundtrack mixed in with Patsy Cline and Hank Williams and Elvis. After a brief look, she piles them in a box and closes the lid. She looks outside her window and sees the sun coming up; she's been up all night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda goes over to the window and opens it. It's barely light out, but already the sound of someone's radio filters in. We hear a car alarm going off in the distance. Miranda drags a large, full trash bag over to the window, looks down, and heaves it out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MIRANDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trash bag falls from a fifth-floor window and into a dumpster overflowing with about ten huge trash bags; Miranda's thrown out a lot of stuff. The garbage truck arrives just as the bag lands in the dumpster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MIRANDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun's all the way up now. It's a bright June morning. Two teenage boys sit on the stoop next to Miranda's building. They have a boom box, and we hear loud street music. Miranda comes out of her building carrying a moving box. She wears Levi's cut off mid-thigh, sneakers, and a black leather jacket over a white y-shirt. She carries the box down the front steps and drops it on a pile on the sidewalk in front of a waiting cab. The cab driver just leans against his car, watching her work.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what would be great? If you could just stand there, watching me carry all these boxes out by myself. Don't carry out any yourself, don't hold the door for me, and whatever you do, don't put them in your cab. And if you could possible start the meter running now. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
She leans over and peers into the cab. The meter's running. She smiles at the cab driver, who doesn't seem to understand English.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perfect. Good job. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
She gives him a thumbs up. He smiles and gives her one back. She goes back for another box
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the cab parked in from of a luxury high-rise apartment building. The cab driver leans again the car, waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELLEN DALY'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large, expensively furnished apartment. Miranda's boxes are piled in the hallway. ELLEN DALY, 43, and immaculately dressed socialite, looks with mild distaste at the boxes cluttering her hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . I just never imagined there would be this much, Miranda.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda stands in the living room, looking at pictures of Ellen and a family that doesn't include Miranda - a respectable, clean-cut husband and two perfect little boys. There is one small picture of Miranda; she looks like she's still in high school.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should see how much I threw out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen walks in and sits on the couch. She sits formally; she doesn't exactly radiate warmth. Miranda turns away from the photos.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can ship them to me as soon as I get an apartment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I should keep them in storage until you come back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not coming back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>

Ellen looks at her like she doesn't believe her, but she'll go along.

<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom, I told you, I'm moving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen occupies her hands by compulsively straightening the books on her coffee table, which were already pretty straight.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Saying you're going to do something and actually doing it are two entirely different things. I hate to see you give up everything to go and pursue this . . . fantasy you have about being a . . . country singer. Have you taken a moment to stop and look at your behavior?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll do it on the bus, O.K.?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Ellen assumes the role of the voice of reason.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you father made Nashville sound very romantic. I wish he were here now to see you acting this way. He could tell you how difficult it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not what he'd tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sadly, remembering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy would tell me I can anything in the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, he probably would, but in the real world, the chances of making it are a million to one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can I pass up a one in a million opportunity?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles. Ellen doesn't.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't expect you to understand why I have to do this. I just want you to send me my stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<ELLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really think you should think about this for a few days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLEN>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(determined)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been thinking about it my whole life. It's time for me to do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda's saying this more for her own benefit; her mother doesn't seem to be listening.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to go. My cab is waiting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to her mother and kisses her on the cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda comes out of the building and crosses the sidewalk to the cab. She talks to the driver, not expecting him to understand
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mother thinks she can control my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Surprisingly, the driver speaks, with a heavy foreign accent.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She stills sees you as a little girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda looks only mildly surprised that the driver has understood everything she has said. She gets in the cab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a simple country ballad. A Greyhound bus travels through the mountains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda sits in a window seat, asleep, resting her head against her jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda's in the same seat, awake now, staring out the window into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRUCK STOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bus is making a rest stop. (We see that the destination sign reads “Nashville”.) Passengers walk around, stretching their legs. Miranda leans against a wall, checking her watch, impatient.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NASHVILLE GREYHOUND STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We still hear the country music. Miranda comes into the terminal, carrying a huge suitcase and a guitar. She squints at the light, reaches into her jacket pocket, pulls out her sunglasses and puts them on. She looks around. A man in a cowboy hat sits on a bench. He gives Miranda a friendly smile and an almost tip of the hat. She looks at him like she's trying to figure out what species he is and drags her stuff outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GREYHOUND STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda looks around and spots a taxi across the street. She puts her index and middle fingers inside her mouth of whistles. Everyone within earshot turns and looks at her. The taxi driver looks up from his newspaper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TAXI - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda gets in the back of the cab. The driver closes the trunk and gets in front.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda hands him a newspaper clipping.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know where this is? Lucy's Café?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'd have to take away my license if I didn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to drive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close on a guitar case. Then another, and another, separated by a row of blue-jeaned knees and cowboy boots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we see faces, some young, some not-so-young, some hopeful, some weary. All are patient, lined up against a brick wall, an incongruous sight at any mini-mall but this one.
</DIRECTION>
<FEMALE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O.K. Listen up. Gentlemen, ladies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEMALE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone in line quiets down. They turn their attention to LUCY JENKINS, 30's, the owner of Lucy's Café.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you go in, make sure you take an application. No one tries out without filling one of these out. Hurry it up, doors close at 3:05. Anyone not inside by 3:05 gets locked out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>

Lucy goes back inside. The line files in.

The driver turns to talk to Miranda. DRIVER You a songwriter?
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. DRIVER Lucky for you. Town's full of them. I'm a songwriter myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a singer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
The driver reacts to this silently; she's not lucky after all. INT. LUCY'S CAFÉ -DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cozy restaurant with small tables, country music memorabilia on the walls, and a small stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lucy stand on the stage with a stack of completed applications in her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you all for coming today. When I call your name, come right up on stage. Pretend like you're in a hurry, we got all day but there's a lot of people want to be famous here. If it's your first time here, you should know: if you don't pass, it just means I don't think you're ready. Go home and keep at it and come back again. Don't give up unless you can't stand to listen to your own material. All right, let's get to it.

Lucy looks at the first application.

INT. LUCY'S CAFÉ - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A young man takes the stage, sits on the stool and begins singing a mediocre country ballad, slightly out of tune.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LUCY'S CAFÉ - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda, carrying her guitar in one hand and her suitcase in the other, gets out of the cab and heads for the entrance of Lucy's
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the same time, JAMES WYNN, 23, gets out of his pick-up truck in Lucy's parking lot. James is good-looking in a somewhat dangerous way. He picks up his guitar case and strides over to Lucy's, getting there just before Miranda. He tries the door. It's locked.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's locked?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
James looks at her, the way she's dressed, the huge suitcase she carries. He looks amused.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was your bus late?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
She gives him the same attitude back.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As a matter of fact . . .

</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's a long way from . . . New York City.

	Yes it is. Who are you? The psychic welcoming committee?

	James Wynn. The door is locked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>

	Miranda Presley. I'll just knock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
She goes up to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, don't. Lucy doesn't let anyone in late. That'll set me back a month. We'll have to get in some other way.

	I'm sure there's a secret underground tunnel.

INT. LUCY'S CAFÉ - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another young songwriter auditions. This one plays the fiddle and has a friend backing him up on guitar. He's energetic, but the song isn't very good.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lucy sits in the back of the crowded room. She reveals no expression as she watches the songwriter, but we see her head shake “no” slightly as she makes a notation on his application and places it in what is presumably the reject pile
</DIRECTION>

Miranda sits on the sidewalk outside the café. James locks her suitcase in his truck and comes and sits down next to her.

INT. LUCY'S CAFÉ - DAY Onstage, a woman with teased blond hair, fringed cowboy shirt, and matching white cowboy hat and boots, stands with her guitar, dancing around as she sings off-key.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LUCY'S CAFÉ - DAY Miranda knocks quietly on the door. No answer. She knocks a little louder. The door opens. She gives James a look. A face appears from inside; it belongs to LINDA LUE LINDEN, 20, a sweetly attractive Southern belle. She puts her finger to her lips and lets them in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blond woman finishes and steps off the stage. Lucy calls out the next name.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick Reynolds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
NICK REYNOLDS, early 30's, gets up to and goes to the stage. James and Miranda sit down with Linda Lue at a table near the door. Linda Lue finds some blank applications on the next table and hands them to James and Miranda.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick takes the stage. He wears a baseball cap with a trucking company logo. He sits at the microphone and addresses the room.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, I'm Nick Reynolds. I'm from Memphis, originally. This one's called “Shoot me up, run me down, take me back,” and it's dedicated to you, Lucy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Lucy seems unmoved by the sentiment. A few auditioners smile knowingly. Nick starts to play. He seemed like a pretty soft-spoken guy up till now, but he was apparently saving his personality for his performance. The song is humorous, about cartoonishly extreme devotions to a woman who won't pay him any attention. Nick's fellow musicians are a good audience, laughing in the appropriate places.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lucy doesn't laugh at the song; she matter-of-factly moves Nick's application into the “yes” pile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: LUCY (O.S.) Next. Linda Lue Linden.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, I'm Linda Lue, from Briar Hill, Alabama. I jut finished this one, it's called “Heaven knocked on my door.”
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
Linda Lue starts her song; she has a sweet voice, but it's weak. Her song is cute, using silly metaphors. She's not awful, but she's not especially good, either.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Onstage, a young singer, eyes closed beneath his cowboy hat, sings a heartfelt ballad. He's pretty good. While he's performing, James takes his and Miranda's completed applications over to Lucy's table. He presents them confidently, as if he has no doubt she'll accept them. Lucy raises any eyebrow at him, but takes the applications.
</DIRECTION>

Kyle seems to be more than just a little nervous; he barely manages to raise his head high enough to sing into the mike. He sings without confidence, his voice cracking. The songs sounds like it might actually be good if he wasn't butchering it. Lucy stares at Kyle, deep in thought, holding his application. Miranda watches him too, listening closely to his song.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Howdy. James Wynn, from Austin, Texas. I call this one “Friends no more.”
	</DIALOGUE>

He strums the guitar and starts to sing. His voice is strong, and he's a charismatic performer. His song is great too (a ballad, e.g. “It Only Hurts Me When I Cry”). The audience is drawn into his performance.

	Hi, I'm Miranda Presley from New York City.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to play. She didn't mention the name of her song, but that's all right because we already know this song. It's “Desperado”. Miranda closes her eyes as she starts the lyrics
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She has a beautiful voice, very distinctive, and the song sounds great. Just as she finishes the first verse, we hear:
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me. Excuse me. Miranda? Honey, do you have another song?
	</DIALOGUE>

Miranda hops off the stage, spirit intact.

Lucy shakes her head in wonder at the girl and walks up to the microphone.

<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now. I'm going to read off the names of the people who passed for next month's performances. If I read your name, come see me to sign up for which night you want to play. Nancy Butterworth, Nick Reynolds, Tom Mortenson, Ricky Hogan, James Wynn. . . .

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you make it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
He seems a little startled by her directness.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too bad. I liked your song.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her skeptically; is she making fun of him?
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I liked yours too. Always have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
She laughs, then starts to sing Kyle's song a cappella. If we didn't know it before, we now know it's a beautiful song. She sings just the first verse and stops. Kyle stares at her, drawn into her singing, hearing his song the way it should be. Even after she stops, he stares at her. Finally, he grins.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it exactly. How did you know that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda doesn't see what he's so excited about.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I did was sing it on key.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you going to Red's? A bunch of us are going to Red's. For a beer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
Kyle looks like it's important to him that she goes.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That sounds like fun.

INT. REDS BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda, James, Kyle and Linda Lue sit together at a table. We see quite a few familiar faces from Lucy's audition at surrounding tables. Everyone has a bottle of beer except for Linda Lue, who drinks a Shirley Temple.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(to Linda Lue)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't even tell me; you have least. . . three relatives who have died of consumption.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Linda Lue seems pleased with Miranda's accuracy.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's four if you count Eddie. He was my mother's second cousin on her mother's side. He was found at the bottom of my inflatable play pool. I found him, actually.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(Whispering, to James)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The bottom of the pool?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
Linda Lue goes on cheerfully, oblivious of the stunned reaction.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I noticed you have your suitcase. Do you have a place to stay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda just looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a real cute motel room, with two beds. There's even a pool, shaped like a guitar. We could share it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
(To Miranda, pointedly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She has a pool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've known me fifteen minutes and you want me to move in? I could be a serial killer, for all you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I can see that you're not. I'm an excellent judge of character. I've got a touch of the power.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda doesn't want to ask what the power is.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My grandmother can tell when a tornado is coming, a week in advance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
Linda Lue nods; she knows exactly what he means.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some things are beyond our comprehension.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Kyle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me see your palm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
He gives it to her.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you, you got a real strong heart line, see it here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that good?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sure, but it can also be a little dangerous. My cousin Lester, he had a similar heart line, and he threw himself in front of a speeding train in the name of love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda smirks.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My cousin Leon did the very same thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't that a coincidence. You want me to do yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
Linda Lue reaches for Miranda's hand. Miranda drops the parasol and lets her have it.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I'm going to meet with a bizarre premature death, I'd just as soon not know about it
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Linda Lue looks up from Miranda's palm and answers her gravely.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at Miranda's hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, well I envy you this life line. You're going to make your mark. People will remember you when you're gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda pulls her hand back.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not saying it'll be soon. Don't you want me to read your heart line?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda doesn't offer her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, let me see your heart line.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda holds out her hand. James pretends to examine it.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will remain unmarried until the age of 60 . . . at which time you will wed a series of men with one common characteristic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Namely?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
He squints at her palm.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They will all be named Bubba. Sometimes it will be a nickname, or a middle name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda carefully extracts her hand from James'. He looks at her suggestively, as if she's fighting the impulse to jump him. She answers with a “get real” look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music on the jukebox has stopped. Miranda reaches for her guitar. She starts to play a song. James watches her, hears the opening chords, and reaches for his guitar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
James starts playing the same song as Miranda, “I don't know why you don't want me.” Miranda begins to sing.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the right time, and though I feel fine tonight. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>

	It's the right place, I've got the new face tonight. . .

<JAMES>

(singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know why you don't want me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
Kyle and Linda Lue join in. Soon the other hopefuls from the audition are singing along, commiserating abut their rejection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda Lue has apparently had a hand in the decorating of this room; it's hard to believe the motel provided matching floral chintz drapes, bedspreads, and pillows, or a framed photo of Loretta Lynn. Linda Lue's dog, of the tiny furry white variety, sits on his own floral pillow. Miranda throws her suitcase on one of the beds.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can have either bed. I've been using this one . . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
She points to the one Miranda has not chosen.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . but you can take whichever you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda leaves her suitcase where it is and looks around. There are several stacks of Bibles in the room. She lifts the cover of one, verifying what it is, and decides not to deal with this information.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this the extra, the Loretta Lynn suite?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
She flops down on the bed, her eyes closed. Linda Lue's dog comes over and sniffs Miranda, then settles in next to her. Miranda opens her eyes, sees the dog, and closes them again. The phone rings. Linda Lue picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Hi, Mama. . . Well, I just got in this second, Mama. . . Things are real good. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
Linda Lue sits up straight, her right hand flat on her bed. Without looking down, she crosses her fingers, first on her right hand, then on her left, the one holding the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(brightly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I passed my audition.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda's eyes open; she tilts her head back and looks at Linda Lue upside down. She's surprised at the lie but, then again, she really doesn't give a shit. Miranda gets up and opens her suitcase. She takes out a pair of jeans.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I was waiting for you take a breath, Mama, so I could get a word in. . . Yeah, just like Loretta. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
Linda Lue rolls her eyes at Miranda, who's changing into the jeans.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only prettier.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda smiles. She pulls a black leather-bound notebook out of her suitcase and picks up her guitar. Linda Lue covers the mouthpiece with her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you going somewhere?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just going to go to that coffee shop across the street.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
She takes her motel room key off the table and puts it on a chain around her neck, next to several other keys and a locket.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it's late. Don't you want to go to bed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not tired. I'll be quiet when I come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Linda Lue is perplexed.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, all right. I'll be seeing you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodnight, Scarlett.

Miranda leaves.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda is settled into a booth, a full cup of coffee in front of her, circling classifieds in a newspaper. She doesn't seem to be finding too much. Linda Lue enters the coffee shop, wearing a frilly pink robe over flowered pajamas with feet and furry bedroom slippers. Her hair is pulled back with a pink band. She looks like an exceptionally tall five-year-old. She spots Miranda and pads over to her table. Miranda looks at her and puts down her paper.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I remember to give the spare room key?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Annette, I've got a hot tip that Frankie and his friends are going to crash your slumber party. You don't want to miss that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Linda Lue sits down across from her.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you hate me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could anyone possibly hate you? You're Miss Congeniality.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was hoping we could be great friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know if that's such a fabulous idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda glances down at Linda Lue's foot, which sticks out from under the table.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(noticing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your pajamas have feet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Linda Lue waits for an answer.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I came here to be alone. Nothing personal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Linda Lue looks hurt. Miranda smiles at her kindly.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing personal. I swear. Cross my heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Linda Lue draws herself up and speaks with conviction.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some people aren't exactly the people you they are when you first meet someone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
She gets up and pads out of the coffee shop. Miranda watcher her go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun's just coming up. Miranda's still in her booth, her head resting on her arm, asleep. The waitress comes up with a pot of coffee and touches her on the arm.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More coffee, honey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda looks up, then out the window, squinting at the sun.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
The waitress leaves. Miranda puts a couple dollars on the table, picks up her stuff, and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda enters the darkened motel room. The mess she left has been cleaned up; apparently Linda Lue unpacked for her. Miranda pulls off her jeans, removes her bra without taking off her t-shirt, and crawls into bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, in the other bed, Linda Lue opens her eyes, sees Miranda, and stretches. She gets out of bed, picks up her robe and goes to the bathroom. The dog jumps off Linda Lue's bed and goes to sleep with Miranda.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda's still in bed, asleep. The air conditioner hums. There's a knock on the door. Miranda reaches for the clock; it's 3:10. She gets out of bed and walks over to the dresser. She opens a drawer, finds a pair of boxer shorts and puts them on. Another knock.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's here at this ungodly hour?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
She opens the door. It's Kyle, holding his guitar. She looks out at him sleepily, her hair a mess, pillow marks on her face. The dog stands at her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. You look good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you, getting ready to go out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
The dog growls at Kyle.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm thinking there's some reason you're here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just saw Linda Lue. She said you'd be asleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at the dog, who continues a low growl.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. Let me know if she says anything else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to close the door.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. I wanted to ask you something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
She open the door again. The dog steps up the growl.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that your dog?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him; of course it's not her dog.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not my question. Will you help me with my singing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that your question?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O.K.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?

</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now?

</KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
She nods, tolerant of his excitement.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. I'll even make you dinner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
She closes the door. The dog stops growling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING ROOF - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kyle and Miranda sit in beach chairs on the roof of his apartment building, with their guitars. There's a grill next to Kyle; he's barbequeing something for dinner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kyle's finishing up a song, a beautiful ballad (e.g. “Keep me from blowing away”). His voice is tentative, and he watches his fingers as he plays.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. Now start the song again, but instead of singing, tell me about your guitar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Kyle starts to strum the chords to the song.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want to know about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, some kind of amusing anecdote about how your daddy traded a pig for it, or the ghost of Hank Williams Sr. Left it on your front porch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Kyle has started to watch his fingers again. He looks up, decides not to let her get to him.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mom gave me this guitar. She said she could tell I had a lot of creative energy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about your dad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, what about him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything. Keep playing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The first time I came to Nashville, I was here four months before I ran out of money and had to turn around and come back home. I thought he'd want me to give it up, since I hadn't made it. But he just put me back to work on the ranch. Said he could use me until I was ready to give it another go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Letting life teach you its own lessons, realizing your dreams weren't the same as his dreams.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Kyle laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop me if you've heard my life story before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw that episode of Gunsmoke. Anyway, the important thing is you're playing the guitar without looking at your fingers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
He stops playing.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I don't have to watch my fingers. It's part of my style.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, don't do it anymore. Now, look at me and sing some of the words.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Kyle starts to play again, looking Miranda in the eye. He stops, and starts the song over. He opens his mouth, then shuts it again. Finally, he stops playing.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's personal. It's part of me. You and me, here alone, my singing to you is practically like stripping down naked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda raises her eyebrows, as if he might actually disrobe.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't it like that for you, singing one of your songs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It seems to me that this is a rather serious handicap for an aspiring performer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to be a performer. I'd have to be insane to think I could ever make a dime with this voice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you wanted to learn to sing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do. So I can sing on writer's night. I can't get my songs recorded if nobody hears them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that the only way to get them heard?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've done about a hundred demos, me songs with other singers. Vince Gill put a song of mine on hold last summer, was thinking about putting it on his new album, but he didn't end up cutting it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda picks up her guitar.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, maybe if you see yourself as an actor, like it's not really you. Play the part in the song.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to strum a few chords. She looks Kyle in the eye as she sings, acting as if the words were meant for him. The sun is setting behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>

Miranda considers the potential truth of this.

INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda sits at the same table as the day before, a cup of coffee in front of her. She's been sleeping; she raises her head from where it was resting on her arm and squints at the daylight. She sticks a finger in her coffee; it's cold. She gets our of her both.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - MORNING

Miranda comes in and gets ready for bed. Linda Lue isn't in her bed. We hear water running, then singing as she finishes her shower. The dog jumps into Miranda's bed.

	Hey, Buster.

Linda Lue thinks. Miranda picks up the dog, puts him on a different part of the bed, and gets in.

	Well, he would have told me. We discuss practically everything.

</MIRANDA>
<LINDA_LUE>

Linda Lue nods. MIRANDA (CONT'D) Don't most motel rooms have one Bible?

Linda Lue hops up and takes a Bible from one of the piles.

	Yes, I thought it was funny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These really are misprints, they're just mostly upside down, though. But here's a booklet that's supposed to be on how to accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior, and see, it's all recipes for fun desserts you can make with Cool Whip. I didn't make that up, swear to God.

The receptionist smiles and holds out her left hand, revealing her wedding ring.

<RECEPTIONIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's how I met my husband. I'm afraid I'm going to have to tell you what I tell everyone: when you're rich and famous, you can look back on this and thank God people like me no longer have any control over you life.

A receptionist pulls out a large cardboard box and shows it to Miranda; we see that it's filled to overflowing with tapes.

Miranda open the door at another company and finds a four-piece band auditioning for an expressionless receptionist in the waiting area. Miranda turns to leave, hoping she doesn't look as ridiculous as that.

	So he told me to come back after they closed and “try out”, in quotes and italics, because he's be alone and his wife is like in Tulsa and I was like, “Yeah! Absolutely! I'll be back. Is there any possibility you could gain some more weight by tonight, because I would fine that really sexy.”

Nick knows very well what Darcy's going to do.

	Darcy's a singer. She met Rodney Crowell right in the very establishment, slipped him a tape, which is against the rules, and now she's singing back-up on his tour. Nick's a sucker for a happy ending, but they're few and far between, if you ask me.

	No apology necessary. Just don't pull that again. You're welcome to try out anytime with something of your own.

Miranda looks confused. She turns to Kyle.

	Not too many people know this, but Nashville has a giant magnet - it's right under this very parking lot - that pulls things in. People, pick-up trucks, old Roy Orbison eight-tracks. It pulled you here. Turn left.

She turns to look at him, but can't because of the bandana.

My theory about you is that you've got this stray piece of hillbilly lodged in you, probably in one of your shoulders. You were smart not to fight it.

	Well, I woke up a few weeks ago and it was really hot out and sunny and there were kids everywhere. It was the first day of summer vacation, and it was just like every other day to me. I wanted to be out, like they were. I just wanted out. And I thought, nothing's holding me here, I can do whatever the hell I want. And if I don't do it now, I'll keep going forever doing what I think I have to do when actually the only thing that's definite about my life is that I'm in it. I'm the fucking lead. I left the next day.

EXT. HILLSIDE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Miranda and James lie on their stomachs in the back of his pick-up truck, looking off into the distance.

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got a strange idea of a good time.

	It's better this way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
We see that they are watching a drive-in movie, except they're not at the drive-in; they're parked overlooking the drive-in. They have a good view of the screen, but no speaker. It's a clear summer night, just barely dark out. The movie is “Love Story.”
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You can make up your own story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
James sits up and reaches for his guitar. He starts to strum the guitar, nods in the direction of the screen and sings the first line of a song, making it up as he goes along. He plays, waiting for Miranda to do the second line. She doesn't. He keeps making up lines, making the song about the characters in the movie. Suddenly, Miranda comes up with a line of her own; it's just as good as one of James'. She makes up the chorus and they sing together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda rolls over on her back and stares at the sky, her head flopped out the back of the truck.

	Last month, I punched a record producer in the face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard you shot him. Only he was a label executive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, you should never believe rumors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I met this producer in Austin, who wanted to do some demos with me, try and get me a record deal. then as soon as we got into the studio, he started changing my songs, fucking with them so they'd sound more like everyone else. We had a fundamental difference of opinion. And he was a dick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you punched him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe in doing what you feel like doing at any moment in time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's it like, when you sing something you wrote?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you write songs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I think I might try it, though. This singing thing isn't really working out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The first time I played one of my songs and people connected with it, it was like sex. Well, not exactly. Like the first time you kiss someone and your heart kind of flips, except it doesn't make you feel weak, it makes you feel strong. If you think it's something you want to do, you should try it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>

Miranda walks down the sidewalk toward Lucy's. she passes a laundromat. Inside, a man sits on a washing machine playing his guitar and singing while his clothes spin in the dryer. Miranda stops and listens to him a moment; he's not bad. She continues down the sidewalk and goes inside Lucy's

INT. LUCY'S CAFÉ - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two singers perform on stage. We see Miranda moving through the crowd, working as a waitress. She's not having an easy time; she sets a beer in front of a customer and he indicates that it's not what he ordered and makes her take it back. She carries the bottle back to the bar, where Nick sits at his usual post.

INT. STUDIO - NIGHT

Miranda is in a recording studio, singing the last few lines of a ballad (e.g. “Is there life out there?”) over a guitar track recorded earlier. Kyle is in the booth alone, operating the board.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. MUSIC ROW - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kyle and Miranda come out of the building where they were recording. The walk down the sidewalk, Kyle carrying Miranda's guitar. Miranda looks down, not stepping on cracks.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what are you going to do with the demo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll put it on a list of available songs, and if someone comes in and wants something like this, they might listen to it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it? That's how you're getting it heard? That's a great song, better than most of the stuff on the radio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They all sound that way at first, when you're the only one who's ever hear it.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No wonder I can't get anything recorded? No wonder I'll be just another guy who never did what he said he was going to? No wonder I work in a record store? Because I didn't push my songs on every singer I met?

(seems to realize something)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I did that, for awhile, but those songs weren't that good . . .

Miranda stops walking. She turns and looks at Kyle.

<KYLE>

Miranda looks guilty. She begins an apology.

Kyle sits down on the curb. Miranda sits next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(realizing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. No wonder. How can I expect anyone else to get excited about my songs if I don't? I shouldn't just sit back and wait for someone to find my songs; I should do something to get my songs heard

He tries to think of an idea.

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you should - we should - take this song to Wynonna and get her to listen to it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
She stands up. Kyle remains sitting. She tilts her head - a gesture for him to come on, then stars walking away.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, right now?

</KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up and follows her.

<DIRECTION>
There's a car parked in the circular driveway. Kyle and Miranda approach the car, trying to be inconspicuous.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure this is the right house? She parks right out front? Anyone could break into her car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess we're the only ones who thought of it. It's her house. I came to a party here once.

</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're in her social circle, but we have to lurk around at dawn to give her a tape.

Kyle puts his hand on her wrist to stop her.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O.K. Time to go.

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was a joke. He got probation.

She carefully inserts the slim jim between the car window and the door. She moves it around expertly, and after a few seconds the door lock clicks. Kyle jumps.

</KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda rolls her eyes at him.

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How else is she going to know whose song it is?

</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But she'll know I broke into her car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course she will. That's the one drawback to the plan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe I didn't think of that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>

The alarm continues to blare. A light comes on inside the house. Kyle looks up and sees it. Miranda follows his gaze and sees it too.

Miranda sits in her usual booth, but this time she's awake. She has her guitar next to her and her notebook open in front of her, trying to write a song. It doesn't seem to be going too well, most of what she's written has been crossed out. She reads what she still ahs and crosses that out too.

EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda and Kyle walk along the strip on night clubs and souvenir shops. It's a warm night, and they pass musicians playing on the sidewalk for tips. They pass an open bottle of champagne back and forth, drinking straight out of the bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's lucky for both of us that my song was so good, or we'd be in jail right now.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Kyle walks over to one of the street musicians and borrows his guitar. He leans against a wall and begins to play; Miranda and the musician watch him. He starts to sing; it's the love song he did at the auditions, the one Miranda sang to him in the parking lot. Kyle does it a lot better than when he auditioned; he looks right a Miranda and sings the words to her. He finishes, showing no signs of embarrassment, and hands the guitar back to the musician.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, buddy.

Miranda doesn't answer.

She seems affected by this, but only for a moment. She pulls away from him.

	Just once, I'd like a sober man to call me beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>

	It's not just that, it's you. I didn't even care that I got arrested, really, because I was with you. You know how I got better at that song?

Miranda's look says she doesn't want to know.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>

</KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
Kyle moves toward her. She moves away, starts walking again, trying to lighten the mood.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you realize there's a song for everything that happens in life? Sometimes there are dozens for one moment in time, like now. Yours could be that REO Speedwagon song about wanting to be more than friends, and mine could be “Baby don't get hooked on me.”
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've always hated that song.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>

INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - NIGHT

James and Miranda come up to a gate, carrying their guitars. James walks up to the window and watches a plan taxi up to the gate. Miranda plops down in a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you're mistaken about how easy it is to amuse me. It's harder than this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
James walks over and sits next to her. He takes out his guitar.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not here to amuse you, we're her to get you some inspiration. Look at him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
He points at an old man carrying a small bunch of daisies. The man stands looking expectantly at the gate. Miranda looks at him, unimpressed.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Waiting for his wife. The woman he married when she was barely seventeen. The woman he loves just as much today as the day he met her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could write a song from that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Not me. I don't write about everlasting love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say he's waiting for Gregor, his thirty- year-old Dutch lover. They met in Venice last Valentine's day, and have been apart since then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come?

</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Howard over there had to have his wife killed, and her collection of exotic parrots converted into hatbands.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should be a touching reunion. Not a country song, though. What about him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
James points at a man, about 35, who looks anxiously out the window at the plane.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He married his high school sweetheart, they have a lovely home and a wonderful marriage, or so everyone think. She's returning from a Mary Kay convention.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or so she says. That has possibilities.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
He plays a few chords and sings a line about the American Dream gone wrong.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and passengers start coming into the gate area. The old man searches each face, almost as if he's frightened. Suddenly his face lights up. A short blue-eyed woman comes to him, her smile just like his. He holds her tightly, his fist clenching the daisies behind her back. Nearby, a young couple kisses passionately.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
James looks at Miranda; he told her so. Miranda stars at the old couple, who break apart as if slightly embarrassed. The man picks up the woman's bags. He's forgotten to give her the flowers. The young couple continues to kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man who was looking out the window is standing on the edge of the crowd of passengers, searching for someone.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
Finally the man sees who he he's looking for; a five-year-old girl gets off the plane, holding the stewardess' hand. The little girl sees him and breaks free of the stewardess. She yells “Daddy!” and runs to her father, who kneels down and catches her, lifting her in his arms. She wraps her little legs around him and hugs his neck tightly; you couldn't find an inch of space between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The father closes his eyes for a moment, smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
James looks at Miranda, who stares at the father and daughter. She looks like she's about to cry. She turns away, embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
She picks up her guitar and walks quickly away from the crowded gate, down the corridor. James hurries to catch up with her.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>

</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>

	O.K. You don't have to tell me.

<DIRECTION>
Miranda steps at an empty waiting area and takes a seat. James sits next to her.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate that. Someone goes away for two weeks and it's like the end of the fucking world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong with missing someone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you know they're coming back, you have no right to miss them. It's not like they're dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
They sit there a little while, James sensing that Miranda's really upset about something.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember when my grandfather died. I kept waiting for him to come to Sunday dinner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>

</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>

	That's my dad.

</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
One side has a black and white photo of her father, a handsome man with a wide grin. The other side has a black and white photo of Elvis pouting. James tries a little joke.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He looks just like Elvis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>

	That is Elvis. He gave me this when I was ten. My decitennial accolade, he called it. He raised me since I was five. Just me and him.

EXT. MOTEL POOL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
James sits in a deck chair. Miranda sits on the diving board, dangling her toes in the water. It's a hot summer night; she wears a t-shirt and shorts. She has her guitar, and is singing “Bad Medicine”, which she's transformed from pop/metal to country. She does the first verse, then:
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I get married, I'm going to have them play “Bad Medicine” as I walk down the aisle. The Bon Jovi version.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda climbs off the diving board and sets her guitar in a chair. She goes over to the pool stops and starts to climb in fully dressed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
James starts to play something; it's the song he started writing earlier, in the airport, about living the American dream, but only on the surface. He has a few really good lines. By the he's done, Miranda has gotten all the way into the pool, except for her head. She's been watching him intently the whole time he's been singing. James puts down his guitar and sits at the edge of the pool.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you always stay up all night?

	If I was afraid on the dark, I wouldn't spend so much time in the dark, would I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
James pulls off his shirt and starts to climb into the pool. Miranda ducks underwater and comes back up.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nightmares?

</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not since I was eight.

</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd you do then, when you a nightmare?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would wake up my dad, he'd come get me, and he'd let me stay up all night. We'd light candles and make cookies and play poker. We used to crank call foreign countries. I learned the twist at four in the morning. Then when it got light out, I'd go to bed and miss half a day of school. My dad once wrote a not for me; “Miranda was unavoidably late to school today due to a slight pterodactyl crisis at home. The problem has been remedied and it is unlikely that this will happen again.”
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
They move around the shallow end of the pool, not approaching each other.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you've been sleeping during the day since he died?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At first, I couldn't sleep at all, then the only time I could even remember what he looked like was in the middle of the night. I sometimes think about what I'll say when I see him again, and if I'll recognize him, then I realize I won't see him again at all.

<DIRECTION>
James moves toward her, trying to seduce her. It's not clear if she's going to respond.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we go out, and we break up, I probably won't. I'll be just another girl you used to go out with. And someday there'll be so many you won't know which one I was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
James backs away from her.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to say we'll be together in a year? Because I can't say that.

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>

James gets out of the pool; he's angry and he's leaving. He picks up his shirt and starts to walk away, then stops and turns to Miranda.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to have to ask you to tell me why.

</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>

Miranda sits on the top step on the pool. She looks away from him an tells him the truth.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been trying to write a song. Just one song, to prove I can do it. Not even a good song. And you, you see two strangers at an airport and you turn it into something so. . . incredible. Your song was incredible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, you're jealous? I might not even finish that song. I have a song I started three years ago that's not done yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not jealous. I'm overwhelmed. I just can't give you that, see?

INT. LUCY'S CAFÉ - NIGHT

Later that night. The performances are over, and only a few songwriters hang around, making arrangements to get together and write. Miranda puts the last chair up. She goes over to Lucy, who's counting receipts at one of the tables.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>

</LUCY>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I always thought I wanted to be a singer, then I came hear and realized I like to sing, but it doesn't seem like enough. But songwriting's so different; I just don't know if it's worth it to try. It comes so easily to some people, like James.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what's in this case?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
She points to the glass case on the wall behind her, which contains tacked-up papers with handwriting on them: pages torn from notebooks, cocktail napkins, an air- sickness bag. Miranda looks and shakes her head no. Lucy stand up and examines the writing.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are all songs, by my songwriters. They're not all hits, but they're special songs. “Like a miracle, some golden words roll off of someone's tongue.” Some of the took ten minutes, some if them took years. Every one of these songwriters would tell you it's worth it. You write a song like one of these, and you can't ever give up again. You know what it feels like to be special, and there's nothing and no one that can give you that same kind of special.

Lucy sits back down to get back to work.

</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
She gestures toward the dance floor, where they're doing an elaborate country step.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on and show me how.

</MIRANDA>

He hesitates only a moment before getting up and escorting Miranda and Linda Lue to the dance floor.

<DIRECTION>
INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda, Kyle and Linda Lue are on the dance floor. Linda Lue and Kyle are expertly performing the steps. Linda Lue smiles flirtatiously at the guy next to her; she seems to be in her element. Miranda stands in between them, trying to follow. She smacks Linda Lue on the arm to get her attention away from the cowboy. Linda Lue does it slowly to demonstrate, then smiles and nods when Miranda gets it right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We watch the dancing for awhile - a dance floor full of people performing intricate steps in rapid, perfect unison, having the time of their lives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
James finishes a song. Miranda, Kyle and Linda Lue are still on the dance floor. They stand and applaud.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O.K. Thank you. We're going to do one more for you all tonight. I've got a special guest singer on this number.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>

He looks straight and Miranda and smiles.

	Her name's Miranda Presley and I think you're gonna like her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>

Miranda just stands there, disbelieving.

	Go on up, Miranda.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miranda, get on up here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda shakes her head. The other band members lean into their microphones and chorus her name, taunting her. She smiles and climbs onstage. The band starts the song. James takes off his guitar; he takes her hand and speaks into her ear.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know this one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda realized they're playing “Hooked on a feeling”. She laughs. The bassist hands her a microphone. James starts to sing, then Miranda comes in, grinning, not nervous at all once she starts to sing. We haven't heard the song quite like this before; the sound couldn't be more country. They're both having a good time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Couples start to dance. Linda Lue watches, standing still among the dancers, smiling like a sentimental fool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kyle stares at James and Miranda, his expression serious, his broken heart on his sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The song ends and the audience applauds enthusiastically. James hugs Miranda.

James, Miranda, Linda Lue, and Kyle come out into the parking lot. James holds a business card in his hands.

	Yeah. He's a good manager, been around for twenty years. He has a good reputation.

He takes Miranda's hand and pulls her over to his truck. He looks into her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have the feeling that no matter how conclusively we decide not to be attracted to each other, forces beyond our control will pull us together?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
He moves slowly toward Miranda.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think the entire universe is controlled by magnets, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes and no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
He's standing right next to her now, and she's not moving away.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was the question?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her. She doesn't resist.

<DIRECTION>
INT. JAMES' BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A country love song plays on the stereo. James leads Miranda by one hand into the darkened bedroom. Miranda chatters nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've been thinking about moving out of the motel, but we don't have any furniture, and the dog seems to like it, and they wrap the glasses in cellophane, even though Lou always washes them again before she lets me drink out of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
They're standing at the foot of the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need for you to shut up now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm trying to picture you as Earlene Mandrell, and you don't sound a think like her.

</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, lucky for me, you sound exactly like Jim Nabors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really need for you to shut up now.

He kisses her on the neck and unbuttons her shirt. She responds, undoing his belt buckle. They fall onto the bed and continue to make love.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAMES' BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Later that night. James wakes up and looks around. He notices Miranda is gone, then hears music from another room. He gets up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAMES' KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda sits at the kitchen table, quietly playing guitar, wearing a loose denim shirt that must be James'. Her notebook is open in front of her and she writes something down, then looks up and sees James standing in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I'll start staying up all night. The best things in my life happen after dark. He passes by her, pulling back her shirt to kiss her shoulder, and sits at the table. She keeps playing quietly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lucy told me you'd break my heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess you didn't believe her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I just decided to risk it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's your song coming?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have one line.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Every song starts with one line.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know if it's any good. My dad always said I could do anything. I keep thinking about this song he wrote for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you remember it? She nods.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me hear it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda plays the song. The lyrics are about a father's unending devotion to his daughter. She stops after the first chorus.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a nice line, about falling out of the sky and landing in love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
He's hesitant, like he's searching for something nice to say.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that the only thing you liked?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just. . . well, devotion is a tricky theme. Of course a parent's devoted to his child. You have to have a point of

<JAMES>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Every song doesn't have to be about something you can relate to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A good song has something to say, even to people who haven't been in that situation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(hurt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it's not a good song, because you don't like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just telling you what I thought. I've spent half my life writing songs, I know something about it. I thought you were trying to learn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
She stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you had thought about it, you would have realized this wasn't a good example.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
She picks up her notebook and walks out of the kitchen. James looks like he's realizing his mistake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda has decorated her half of the room; there are photos of Lyle Lovett and Jon Bon Jovi over her bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda sits in her bed, the dog on her lap. She looks terrible. She rummages through the drawer of her nightstand and pulls out a cassette. She puts it in the player on top of the nightstand and presses play. We hear a man's voice, speaking.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I gave Fish-head four gallons of ice cream for dinner, just like you said. Of was that supposed to be one can of cat food? I couldn't remember, and Fish-head insists that she always has ice cream on Thursday. She also said to tell you she misses you, and she caught a giant spider that I thought looked a lot like that Billy Warren kid you think is so cute. I told her you'd be home soon. Remember, if you get homesick, just keep your chin up. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda hits the fast-forward button. When she hits play again, we hear her father singing, the same song she played for James. We hear the second verse this time. Miranda is visibly upset. She raises her chin; apparently she takes that literally. She doesn't cry. She hits the stop button, her chin still in the air. She reaches for her notebook and opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Kyle's pick-up pulls up outside a house. He and Miranda get out.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many people will be here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five or six. Everyone just plays something they're working on. Don't worry, no one's going to insult your song. They'll only say what they like about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if they don't say anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are so many things a person can do with her life. That girl in “Flashdance” was a welder.

	Do you think they'll notice if I play ‘Livin' on a Prayer”?

INT. NICK'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kyle and Miranda sit in Nick's kitchen, with Nick and three other musicians, KEVIN, ERICA, and JOE. They're sitting in a circle around the small kitchen table. There's a tape recorder on the table. Everyone has a beer and one or two of the guys smoke cigarettes. Erica has the only guitar in the room, and she sings a song, substituting la's for one of the lines. Kevin sings a line she might use there. Erica sings it back, changing a few words.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Later that night. Nick has the guitar now, and he sings a song that's uncharacteristically sober for him. It's an apology to a woman he betrayed; he admits that he had no excuse to hurt her. The tape recorder is on, recording Nick's performance. Miranda watches him intently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone's laughing. It must be getting late, because they're getting a little giddy. Joe sings a song about how broke he is and they all join in the chorus
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda takes the guitar from Kyle and begins to play her song. She's a little shy about it but manages to perform pretty well. Her song isn't bad; it has a nice melody, but the lyrics are not especially moving. All she has is the first verse.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like that last line.

	I'm not sure what it means.

INT. LUCY'S CAFÉ - DAY The weekly audition is in progress. Miranda and Linda Lue share a table. Nick sits at the bar. Lucy sits at her usual table in back. Kyle is onstage, doing a nice job with one of the songs we've heard before. He finishes triumphantly, breathes a sigh of relief, and walks back to the table.

	Miranda Presley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda takes the stage. She introduces herself quickly and sings the song she sang at Nick's house. She's left in the line that the other musicians liked. It's the most evocative line in the song, and it seems out of place with the rest of the lyrics. Luc

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi there. I'm Linda Lue, from Alabama. This song is called “I went looking for Jesus.”
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>

Linda Lue begins to sing; her song is about misprinted Bibles, and, true to her style, it's unrelentingly cute. Miranda glances at Lucy to get her reaction, but is unable to read her expression.
</DIRECTION>

James walks over and sits next to Miranda. She's surprised to see him. Kyle isn't happy to see him. They speak in low voices.

Miranda's eyes widen; she looks around as if someone might have heard.

JAMES (CONT'D)

Well, we did. And then I was a jerk. I should have just kept my mouth shut. I'm sorry. I should have told you then. . .

	Look, it wasn't that big a deal. You've apologized. Let's forget it, O.K.?

Lucy appears behind them and shushes him. They look at her guiltily. She leaves. James reaches for Miranda's hand. She's reluctant to give it to him, but he gives her a pleading look and gently takes her hand, placing it palm up in his left hand. With his right, he spells something onto her hand with his finger. When she realized what the message is, she turns and watches him finish spelling. He looks into her eyes. She closes her hand into a fist, turns away, and pulls it under her other arm, hugging herself. She watches Linda Lue finishing up her song. James, recognizing the impact his message had, reaches across Miranda to take her hand again. She lets him take it in his. James smiles.

INT. RECORDING STUDIO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
James is in the recording studio with a band of session musicians. DOUG ROBERTS, the manager who gave James his card at the Roadhouse, sits in the booth with the engineer. The musicians are all in their thirties and forties; most of them look like somebody's father. They're doing one of the songs we've heard James do before, but this version seems to lack energy. James is clearly dissatisfied with the way things are going, but is trying to be patient. He stops singing in the middle of the song and cuts the band.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need to bring up the snares.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
(over microphone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They sound fine in here.

<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This tempo's all wrong.

</JAMES>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. It sounds great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not deaf. I can tell how it sounds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
From the way he says this, we know he hates the way it sounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll just get it down once this way, o.k. James?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. That's not the way I wrote it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
James looks determined. Doug leaves the booth and comes into the studio to talk some sense into James. The musicians watch, uninterested. They've seen this before.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	James, I know you feel strongly about your song. You should, it's your baby. But I've been doing this since you were a baby. I know what a hit sounds like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
Doug's matter is soothing, condescending.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what shit sounds like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't sound like shit. It sounds like what every country radio station is looking for. I have to think in terms of radio play.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I record this the way I wrote it, or I don't record it at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
The musicians start to take notice; the fight is finally heating up.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm already taking a big risk with you. . .

<JAMES>

James stands face to face with Doug.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does everyone know about me?

</JAMES>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got a hell of an attitude for a pretty boy with a couple of good songs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
This is just part of Doug's act, the way he keeps singers in line, but James' anger flashes. Before Doug can see it coming, James punches him in the eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The musicians look at each other, entertained. James walks out.

INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda, wearing her t-shirt and boxer shorts with a glittery pair of high heels, paces the floor with a Bible balanced on her head.

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pledge allegiance, to the flag, of the United States. . .

Linda Lue calls to her from the bathroom.

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's highly unlikely I'll be reciting the pledge of allegiance.

Linda Lue sticks her head out the bathroom door, pulling rollers out of her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Much less with a Bible on my head.

</LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda puts her arms straight out at her sides and the Bible falls off her head.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would think this is exactly the kind of thing you'd be doing. I still think you should learn that tap dance to “Dixie.” Come on out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Linda Lue throws open the bathroom door and strikes a pose in the doorway, one arm raised, head thrown back. She wears a low-cut sequined gown and heavy make-up and has her curled hair piled on top of her head. Miranda gasps.

<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>

<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think so? Is it enough?

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. It's enough.

</MIRANDA>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not too much?

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You look perfect. Except. . . let me try one thing.

She reaches up and loosens a few strands of Linda Lue's hair so they fall around her face. Miranda steps back and appraises her work.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better. Wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>

Miranda reaches to the dressing table and gets a Q-tip. She runs the Q-tip under Linda Lue's eye, removing some of the eyeliner, then does the same for the other eye.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you do, follow some kind of eyeliner diagram in the beauty queen handbook?

<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be on stage, I want them to see my eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They will see your eyes. On the other girls, all they'll see is eyeliner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
They turn to face the mirror and look at themselves, standing side by side. Linda Lue gets a little emotional.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're my best friend, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda's emotional too, but embarrassed. She turns away from the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well that's cause you're such a sap, Lou.

EXT. ERNEST TUBB RECORD SHOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A record store with a small outdoor stage behind it, where free “jamborees” are held at night. There's an all-night miniature golf course next door, and Miranda and Linda Lue's motel is just across the parking lot. It's a warm night, and people are playing golf, sitting in the adjacent picnic area or on top of their cars in the parking lot, listening to the music. This is a traditional country music affair; the band is also made up of older musicians, all men, and includes a banjo an fiddle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda and Linda Lue sit on top of a picnic table. James walks up to them
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>

James takes her hands to help her down off the table. Miranda says goodbye to Linda Lue.

INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
James and Miranda are at the check-out stand, buying chee-tos and suzy-q's and Dr. Pepper.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only six hours to kill.

</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll drive by the gate. I thought you would want to see it at night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
They walk out of the supermarket. James stops by the gumball machines. He puts a quarter in one of the machines and turns the dial. He looks at the prize, puts it in his jacket pocket, and tries another quarter. This time he takes the prize out of the plastic bubble. He goes to Miranda and takes the grocery store back from her. He sets the bag on the ground and kneels in front of Miranda.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
James takes her left hand and shows her the prize - it's a gold colored ring with a blue plastic star.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda looks around, embarrassed. The checkers, two middle-aged women (one white, one black), are both watching with smiles on their faces.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They think you're proposing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>

James doesn't reply. He tries to put the ring on her ring finger, but it doesn't fit. He puts it on her pinky.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Get up.

(loudly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say yes. I can't live without you.

One of the checkers says, ‘how romantic.” They ignore a customer trying to buy a six- pack.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>

(loudly, angrily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I said yes. Is that what you want? Are you happy now?

</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
James acts overjoyed; he smiles gleefully and hugs Miranda.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy? I'm the happiest man on earth!

He looks at her and smiles stupidly until she finally has to drop the act and laugh. They grab the groceries and run out of the store, leaving the checkers bewildered.

EXT. GRACELAND - NIGHT

James' truck is parked across the street. James and Miranda sit in the back, eating chee-tos, looking at the gate.

	His aunt still lives there.

He looks at Miranda; she has no idea.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I was a kid, my dad used to take me out every weekend. Told my mom we were having a boys' night out, going bowling or to the movies, or the rodeo, if there was one. Then we'd go to his girlfriend's house; for a long time he was seeing my fifth-grade health teacher.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda studies him, looking for signs of sadness at the memory and finding none.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'd sit in the car, we had a blue Pontiac, and he'd leave me the keys, and I'd listen to the radio.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One night, I taught myself how to drive in that car, waiting for my dad. The antenna had this bend in it. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(motions with his hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . and no matter what I did I couldn't get one damn FM station in that car. So I'd sit there and listen to the country music station and stare at the house. I never could take my eyes off the house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
He takes Miranda's hand, his eyes still on Graceland.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just like all those damn cheating songs. And all my life, people would tell me, “James, you're just like your father.” And I never said it but I thought, no I'm not. I never lie. I don't pretend to be a great guy. The high point of my father's life was a football game in high school. No way was I going to be just like him. But now I wonder if I can help I it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda looks confused.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes I feel like I'm going to spend the rest of my life with everyone thinking I'm someone I'm not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's hard to think about what you're going to do for the rest of your life. You have to pick one thing. What if it doesn't work out? James nods.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look stupid. You're a failure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>

Miranda takes his chin in her hand and turns his face toward her. She kisses him.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think you could ever be a failure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
She climbs out of the truck bed. She reaches inside the truck and turns on the radio, tuning it to a slow song (e.g. “Asking us to dance”). She climbs back up into the back and stands next to James, holding her hand out to him. He slowly gets up, his eye
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
locked with hers, and takes her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They start to dance underneath the stars, holding each other close. James pulls her closer, tight against him, until they aren't dancing anymore.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm scared.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So am I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
The song plays on as they hold on to each other. Finally, James pulls away until he isn't touching Miranda anymore. He takes his hand and moves it along her arm, from the shoulder down to her wrist, without touching her.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you feel that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.

The skies have become cloudy. There's lightning in the distance. Elvis comes on the radio and it begins to sprinkle.

Miranda plays her role low-key, convincingly bitchy.

<JAMES>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get married.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
She seems to consider this, then come to her senses.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't get married as a joke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not a joke. We're in love. What the hell, let's get married.

</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>

<JAMES>

</MIRANDA>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd be afraid to tell you how much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
James seems happy with this answer. He notices something behind Miranda, outside the window. Mary is back with her husband. He's a huge black man with a lumbering gait. He wears a black raincoat and carries a black bible. Their skinny teen-age son is with them.

<JAMES>

	Oh my god.

</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Raymond comes up to the truck and puts his face against the passenger window. It's a frightening sight. Miranda covers her mouth. James reached over and turns Miranda's face towards his.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marry me, Miranda
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The frozen foods section has been selected as the wedding site. Mary and Selma drape pastel toilet paper over the aisles. Raymond stacks some crates to use as a podium, placing one behind for him to stand on. Mary's son leans against the freezer, flipping through a Playboy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
James is in the toiletries section, putting gel in his hair. Miranda comes up next to him and takes a toothbrush and toothpaste.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have chee-tos stuck in my teeth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, this is exactly how I pictured my wedding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, mine too. Except. . . oh, shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
She quickly walks away, then back to James. She takes off her ring and puts it in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	The ring. See you at the altar. Aisle twelve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda hurries away.
</DIRECTION>

She goes to the frozen food section. Raymond has discovered his son reading Playboy.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYMOND>
<DIRECTION>
(bellowing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Benjamin, I have told you that pornography will guarantee you reservation in the depths of hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<DIRECTION>
He gives special enunciation to the word “pornography”. Ben seems unconcerned. He puts down the magazine, revealing the Metallica logo on his t-shirt. Raymond hands Miranda a piece of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYMOND>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's your marriage license. Can't no one tell you for certain that's not the genuine article.

</RAYMOND>
<MIRANDA>

	Thank you.

<BEN>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want a lesson from the master. Before your honeymoon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
She gives him a look.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have a Bon Jovi tape?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bon Jovi's for girls, man. I ain't a girl. My sister likes Bon Jovi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does your sister have a Bon Jovi tape?

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's time for the ceremony. Raymond stands behind his podium, towering over James. Selma and Mary stand off to the side, beaming.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ben, where are you? Get out here and be a witness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coming
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
There's a click, then music comes over the supermarket sound system. It's “Bad Medicine.” Ben escorts Miranda up the aisle until she is standing next to James, the runs back and cuts the music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raymond being the ceremony. He's a fundamentalists preacher and, apparently, even his wedding ceremony is delivered with the threat of fire and brimstone.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYMOND>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dearly beloved. . .
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
TIME CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Later in the ceremony. Sweat drips down Raymond's face as he towers over Miranda and James.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you, James, take this woman to be your wife, to love and treasure like gold, forsaking all others, turning your back on earthly temptations, or you will surely know the fires of hell in the inferno of eternal damnation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<DIRECTION>
Raymond glares down at James, pointing his finger. James didn't think it was a question, but it seems safer to answer.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
James slips the ring on her finger. Raymond draws a deep breath and pulls back.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And do you, Miranda, take James to be your husband. . . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda seizes the opportunity to cut this short.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then by the power vested in my by Almighty God, his son, our savior, the baby Jesus, and the state of Tennessee, I hereby pronounce you man. . .

<DIRECTION>
It's morning. James and Miranda are inside Graceland. The tour guide describes the room in a loud, rehearsed voice. Miranda leans against James and gazes dreamily at Elvis' stuff.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had this dream that we got married.

</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>

INT. THEATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The theater where the beauty pageant is being held. Linda Lue is onstage, doing a scene from “Coal Miner's Daughter”. Someone read the other parts woodenly from off-stage. Linda Lue is an extremely emotional actress and several women in the audience wipe tears from their eyes at the end of her performance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THEATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pageant's nearly over. There are five girls on stage: Linda Lue is one of them. Miranda and James slink into the darkened theater and take two empty seats next to Kyle.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where were you two?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We picked up a hitchhiker that turned out to be the ghost of Elvis. Had to take him to Graceland. She's a finalist?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was the best one. People were crying when she did her scene.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So she's going to win?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I think that redhead is married to at least one of the judges.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>

On stage, Linda Lue walks over to stand next to the host.
</DIRECTION>

</LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
The host chuckles.
</DIRECTION>
<HOST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, it is. Now, Louise, here's your question: Which do you consider more important, family or career?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOST>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By family you mean the family I plan to have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<HOST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOST>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well in that case, I would say neither. My friends are more important to me than my career, whatever that may turn out to be, and my career is more important to me than a husband and a bunch of screaming kids.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>

The host clears his throat.

<HOST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. A very good answer.

Linda Lue stands among a group of contestants, holding a bouquet of roses. Miranda come up to her and hugs her.

	Congratulations. Personally, I thought you should have won.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<LINDA_LUE>

Miranda laughs.

<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you see my talent?

<MIRANDA>

	No. James and I got married. We got here late.

	. . . . we've all been waiting for, here's the new one from Wynonna.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEE_JAY>
<DIRECTION>
The song starts; it's Wynonna Judd, singing Kyle's song. Kyle realizes what it is, lets out a whoop and turns up the radio. In his excitement, he also puts his foot on the gas and runs right into another truck. Even after the accident, he's still grinning and listening to the radio. He opens his door but stays in his truck. The driver he hit gets out, more surprised by the accident than angry. He approaches Kyle, looking at him curiously. Kyle beams at him. He points at the radio.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my song.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
The driver doesn't say anything. He leans against Kyle's truck so he can hear the song, and listens appreciatively. Then he calls out to the people who are gathering around because of the accident.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's his song. He's got a song on the radio!

INT. JAMES' BEDROOM - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Kyle's song continues over:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
James and Miranda in bed. Miranda's wide awake, staring at the ceiling. James is still asleep. He stretches, waking up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda turns and closes her eyes, pretending to be asleep. James looks a little surprised to find Miranda in his bed; we see the memory of the wedding coming back to him. Now it's his turn to stare at the ceiling. He reaches over and takes Miranda's hand; the situation is serious but at least they're in it together. She doesn't look at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAMES' BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
James is alone in the bathroom. He opens the medicine cabinet and has to search for his shaving cream. He looks down and sees two tubes of toothpaste resting on opposite sides of the sink. He closes the medicine cabinet and starts at the sight of his own reflection, as if he's looking at himself for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAMES' KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda looks in the refrigerator, which is nearly empty. She lifts the lid on a pizza box, takes out a slice and takes a bite. She sits down at the kitchen table and looks out at the quiet street. Her eyes move down to her hands. She holds them in front of her and examines them, like someone else's hands. She touches the ring James gave her, which looks cheap in the bright morning light. She twists it off her finger and holds it in her fist, drawing her knees up to her chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MUSIC ROW - DAY
</DIRECTION>

James pulls his truck up outside one of the houses, the office for Doug Roberts' management company. He stays inside the truck, looking at the building.

She holds out her left hand. There's a diamond ring on her finger. Miranda smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>

<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I changed my mind.

</LUCY>

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It kind of happened when he wasn't looking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<LUCY>

</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>

</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're just taking off? Day after tomorrow. And you aren't going to ask me if I want to come.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
James is surprised that she's upset. He looks around to see if anyone is looking at them. No one is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAMES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What are you going to do, quit your job so you can hang around and watch me record all day? I thought you'd want to stay here.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(loudly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fact that we're married doesn't mean that you get to decide what I want.

</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Now a few people turn to look.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does it mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
She's getting progressively louder, and so is James. Lucy notices that they're fighting.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not even sure we are married, so if you want out, just let me know. I can tear up the certificate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't pull this on me. You're the one who's leaving. Maybe you've gotten what you wanted out of this. You proved to yourself that you could commit to something. Well, a commitment lasts more than two days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
They notice everyone staring at them and lower their voices.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think you've got me all figured out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you can only commit to one thing at a time. I guess we know what your one thing is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the one who can't see past two months from now. I don't think you can see this marriage in a week from now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just don't think there'll be anything to see.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hurt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You asked me to marry you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>

She twists the ring off her finger and holds it in her fist, looking like she might throw it. Instead she drops her fist, turns around, and walks away. James watches her for only a second before he turns and leaves.

Miranda sleeps in her old bed. In the other half of the room, Linda Lue is packing to leave. The dog climbs in her suitcase and she pulls him out and sets him on the bed. It looks like she's almost done. Her side of the room now looks like a typical tacky motel room; no floral bedspread, no picture of Loretta Lynn. Miranda opens her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you. I thought you were going to sleep through my departure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And miss the opportunity to see another piece of my life crumble away?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Linda Lue looks concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want to tell me what happened with you and James?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
Mirada sits up.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think the marriage just woke him up. We realized he didn't want to be with me for the rest of his life. The wedding thing was a big mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
(meaningful)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you didn't have any second thoughts of your own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's the one who left me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Linda Lue sits next to her on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I tell you a story?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many people die in this story?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just one. When my Aunt Lydia was eighteen, she was engaged to marry Henry Esterbrook. However, the week before the wedding, Henry eloped with Marianna Fine. Aunt Lydia was so devastated she thought she'd rather be dead than be without Henry, so she decided to hang herself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Has it occurred to you that this story is completely inappropriate for this situation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's more. Lydia went to the hardware store to buy a length of good strong rope, she couldn't have weighed less than two hundred pounds, and the man that sold her that rope turned out to be her destiny. She married him that summer. My Uncle Ernie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which one of them dies?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My Uncle Ernie was bitten by a poison centipede later that same year. He died instantly. But that is beside the point and you know it. There is someone out there for everyone, and even if your head doesn't know it, your heart does.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So her heart led her to the hardware store.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just like yours took to Memphis. Remember the night I met you? I read your palm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. But you didn't read my heart line.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Linda Lue gives her a knowing look.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes people want to be surprised.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>

Linda Lue reaches for Miranda's hand. Miranda lets her take it. Linda Lue examines it; we get the idea she may inventing the reading.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, it's the same as before. You are not one to settle for the easiest thing - I think that's true. A challenging relationship. . . that can be very romantic; to me that seemed like you and James, both of you so pig-headed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't helping.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The important thing to know is to follow your heart. Don't go against what it's telling you, and don't bury anything that ain't dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda pulls her hand back.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's going to die now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Linda Lue smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA_LUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one that you don't kill with your own two hands. You know, maybe next week would be a better time for me to leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA_LUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, honestly, I couldn't stand you or Mr. Buster Dog another day. Go to Hollywood and tell them who the hell you are.

Linda Lue hugs her, then gets up and closes her suitcase.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda Lue and the dog are gone. Miranda sits cross-legged on her bed, her notebook open in front of her. We hear Pam Tillis passionately singing “Maybe it was Memphis.”
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda picks up a piece of paper that looks like her marriage certificate. She folds it in half and cuts it into a heart shape. She unfolds it, and cuts the heart into pieces with a jagged break. She positions them on a page of her notebook.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a knock at the door. Miranda opens it to find Kyle standing there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RED'S BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kyle leads Miranda out of the bar; she's a little tipsy. They pass a man in a cowboy hat standing on the sidewalk, singing for tips. Miranda sings along with him.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know how productive this was . . .

<MIRANDA>

Kyle's just trying to get her into the car without incident.

<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get you home.

</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This whole thing. What's the matter with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. You are perfect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. There's something wrong with me. Nobody wants me. Nobody cares about me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
She's really getting upset. Kyle wraps his arms around her, holding her like a child.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(soothing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I care. I want you.

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you love me?

</MIRANDA>

Kyle loosens his hold on her; he has to protect himself now.

Kyle pulls away from her altogether.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>

She pulls him to her slowly and kisses him, passionately. He kisses her back, then breaks away gently and looks at her, quietly angry.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn it, Miranda, what do you want me to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I want you to stay in love with me always, and I want you to get over me and be my friend forever.

	Sometimes you hear a song on the radio, and it's just the song you wanted to hear right then. It's like a gift. Then it's over, and you're just glad you heard it. You don't want them to play it again right away. You'll hear that song again, or another one that's just the perfect song when you hear it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'm like that song, the first one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<KLYE>

	No, you are nothing like that first one. You're like if there was only one song in the world I could hear for the rest of my life, what song would that be. You're that song.

	Maybe the needle's just stuck.

<DIRECTION>
Kyle realizes something, sadly. KYLE (CONT'D) That's why James'll come back
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda won't allow herself to hope for this.

	No he won't. It's o.k. This kind of thing happens to me all the time.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Miranda. What are you going to do when he comes back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda sits down on the curb. Kyle sits next to her.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going to be here. I'm going back home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
This is the last thing Kyle wants to hear.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is your home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know how hard it was to leave New York? I had wanted to do it for years and then my father died, and I just did it, left everything behind. I think I thought I could pay him back, for giving up his dream. Now I know he would've given it up sooner or later anyway. When you think you have a dream, all it does is give you hope that you can have something good, then you find out you can never have that. Maybe it wasn't even there to be had.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't think that. You can't live your life thinking that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kyle, all the signs are pointing in the same direction. Away from Nashville. Away from country music. At some point, I have to pay attentions. I have to start again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could do that here. You didn't come here because of your father. You came here to write songs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Saying you're going to do something and actually doing it are two different things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have them inside you. What if you go to New York and you never get them out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't make me feel any worse. This is all I have left.

	A different highway. We see James in his truck, heading out of Nashville in a different direction.

</EXT_HIGHWAY_DAY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda fumbles through her backpack until she finds what she was looking for; a Bon Jovi cassette. She takes the tape out of its case and pops it in her walkman. She presses play. We hear what she hears, but it's not Bon Jovi. It's country music - her father singing one of his songs. Miranda is startled. She quickly hit stop, taking out the tape to look at it. Verifying what it is, she puts it back in her walkman and hits play.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAMES' TRUCK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
James is driving, absently singing “Bad Medicine” to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GREYHOUD BUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda stares out the window, the tape still going in her walkman. We hear what's on the tape - now it's a letter from her father.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_ON_TAPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . . that one was your favorite when you were two, you probably don't remember. And that concludes the musical portion of our program. I hope they're teaching you how to skin rattlesnakes at that camp, I've been setting snake traps all over the yard. I used Ding-Dongs for bait. I expect to have about thirty-seven by the time you come home. So don't worry about me, I'm doing fine without you. I'll miss you now, and you can miss me when you get home. That way I'll be there. Chin up.

That's the end of the tape. Miranda listens to the silence. She raises her chin, then lowers it and gives into her tears.

	</DIALOGUE>
</INT_JAMES_TRUCK_DAY>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>

The Greyhound is stopped at the truck stop. Miranda gets off. She puts on her sunglasses and looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
James pulls over and lets the hitchhiker out at a gas station. The old man waves as the truck pulls back onto the highway. James drives in the same direction as before for about ten seconds, then pulls a U-turn and heads back toward Nashville.

Miranda sits in a booth in the coffee shop, looking out the window as her bus pulls away.

INT. JAMES' BEDROOM - DAY

James goes through a dresser, opening and closing drawers. They're all empty. He goes into the kitchen and finds a house key on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda has fallen asleep on the table. The waitress comes by and touches her arm. Miranda raises her head and squints at her.

The waitress fills her coffee cup. Miranda looks down at the table. Her notebook is open; the page is filled with words. She looks at them, as if for the first time. She doesn't seem sure if she likes what she sees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LUCY'S CAFÉ - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
James comes into the café and finds Lucy and Nick's engagement party in progress. A singer onstage dedicates a song to the happy couple, who sit at a table near the back. James looks around for Miranda and, not seeing her, goes over to Lucy and Nick.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>

James finds this little consolation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LUCY'S CAFÉ - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Later that night. Kyle is onstage, performing a love song for Lucy and Nick. James has moved to the bar; he faces away from the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda walks in, carrying her guitar. She finds Lucy and goes to her. Lucy is happy to see her. They have a brief conversation, which we don't hear because Kyle is singing. We now that Lucy tells her James is here, because Miranda looks over to where he sits. She looks apprehensive, then takes a deep breath and regains her resolve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kyle finishes his song. Lucy comes onstage and speaks into the microphone.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kyle Davidson. Thank you, Kyle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone applauds as Kyle climbs off the stage. He sees Miranda waiting to go on and grins, surprised and glad that she's back. He hugs her, and we see from the look on his face that he knows he's really lost her now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The applause dies down.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, this next performer is kind of special to me, and I'm real glad she could make it here tonight. Here she is, Miranda Presley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
James turns around. Miranda sits on the stool and positions the stand so that she can read the pages she tore from her notebook. She looks nervous, but determined. She doesn't look at James.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda begins to play. She begins to sing the lyrics, looking down and reading them. The song she's written is beautiful, and expresses a personal journey. She's realized that she has to accept her painful emotions before she can experience joy. The song hardly resembles the one she auditioned with earlier, but the one line she said she didn't understand is still there, and fits perfectly in the new version of the song.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The audience recognizes the beauty of this song. Most just enjoy it, but we see pride on the faces of Nick, Lucy, and Kyle. James looks like someone who'd fallen in love all over again. Miranda realizes that everyone is listening to what she has to say, and she loves it. She looks at James, letting him know the man she loves in the song is him. She finishes the song, and there's a pause before everyone applauds. James' seat is now empty. She smiles triumphantly and gets off the stage. She's looking for James but she doesn't see him. People are congratulating her, but she's starting to worry. Suddenly, someone takes her hand. She looks next to her and sees James.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(relieved)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you had left.
	</DIALOGUE>

</JAMES>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>

<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
She looks; it's a thin silver wedding ring.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I figured out the best thing to do with the rest of my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES>
<DIRECTION>
She holds the ring out to him. Confused, he takes it back. She presents him her left hand, and he slips it on her finger. They kiss. When they break apart, James notices something behind Miranda. He puts his hands on her shoulders and turns her around to look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lucy opens up the case where she keeps original copies of special songs, and pins Miranda's song up next to them. Miranda watches, smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
