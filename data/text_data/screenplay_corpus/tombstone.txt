<V_O_NARRATION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The economic explosion following the Civil War created an unprecedented nation-wide market for beef. Previously worthless cattle running wild throughout Texas were gathered into herds And driven north to the railheads In Kansas. Fortunes were made as Cowtowns sprang up on the Prairies, wide-open centers of Commerce and vice, their streets Choked with heavily-armed young Men fresh from the cattle drives. In those days the correct term For a cowhand was 'drover'. 'Cowboy', like 'cowpoke', was originally an insult implying deviant sexuality and was rarely used. But these invading drovers were a wild breed for soon shootings and wholesale drunken riots became so frequent that ordinary citizens literally could not walk down the street. In fact at their height the cowtowns had higher murder rates than modern New York or Los Angeles and there Was no law but that of the gun.

Burning daylight, hard reality. A squad of uniformed MEXICAN RURALES rides through the Sonora desert, sabres glinting in the sun. Approaching the mouth of a rocky canyon their hard- bitten CAPTAIN signals them to stop, leaning down to study a jumble of hoofprints on the ground.

But suddenly GUNFIRE erupts from the shadows all around them, blasting them from the saddle, each powder flash lighting up the canyon for an instant, freezing each victim in the moment of his death. Then, just as abruptly the firing stops, leaving only the Captain, the young Rurale, and a 3rd Rurale alive. Dazed and bloody, they struggle to their feet as 6 armed FIGURES emerge from the shadows, walking into the moonlight toward them. With broad-brim hats swept up in front, silk scarves and red sashes, high boots and silver- studded gunleather, they look like 17th century pirates. These are the Cowboys: OLD MAN CLANTON, the ageless, white- bearded leader; CURLY BILL BROCIUS, 2nd-in-command, smiling, bull-necked; IKE and BILLY CLANTON, the old man's sons; FLORENTINO, a Mexican half-breed; and JOHNNY RINGO, dark, Byronic, with an air of something very strange.

INT. - PRESCOTT SALOON - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A handsomely appointed saloon. At a corner table, the pot is so rich 2 players have folded leaving ED BAILEY, a big, sullen, tough-looking gambler, facing gaunt, elegant DOC HOLLIDAY. Full of southern refinement and languid, almost feline grace. Doc has such unerring style and aplomb that he makes his constant tubercular coughing sound as if he's merely clearing his throat. Bailey leans forward, seething with impatience:
</DIRECTION>
<BAILEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said that's 500 to you, Holliday. In or out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAILEY>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>

KATE HORONY, Doc's voluptuous Hungarian consort enters, refilling his engraved silver stirrup cup. She has a faint accent:

Doc leans forward, revealing an ivory gun-butt under his coat.

<DIRECTION>
Now a Cheshire cat smile we will soon come to know very well steals over Doc's face as he takes out his nickel-plated .38 Colt Lightning and .45 Peacemaker and lays them on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There, now we can be friends Again. But remember, Ed, Friendship is trust-so please Don't hurt me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
Doc bats his eyelashes. Bailey jumps up, boiling. A long, sweaty moment, then Bailey LUNGES. Doc spring up, grabbing him by the hair and jabbing his fist into Bailey's armpit. Bailey screams and doubles over. Doc gives him two more blows, so light they hardly seem capable of the effect they're having. But as he turns to give him another we suddenly SEE that there's a KNIFE in Doc's hand. The bartender reaches for the shotgun under the bar. Kate pulls a Derringer from her muff and puts it to his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Touch that gun, I burn you down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>

<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does it hurt? A lot? Good.

</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
Eyes gleaming cruelly, Doc blows his cigarette smoke into Bailey's face. Bailey sinks to the floor in a fetal position. Kate gathers up the pot as Doc retrieves his guns, looking around the room. Then both back up to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, good evening then.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small cottage at the edge of town. As the Earps drive up we SEE a sobbing woman sitting splay-legged in the middle of the street while her husband tries to comfort her. 3 small children stand alongside them, watching in stunned silence as Cowboys FRANK STILLWELL, cocky, arrogant, and PETE SPENCE, lean, dark, heave their furniture and belongings out of the cottage into the street while snarling things like, shut up...deadbeats...move it! The Earps stop, staring at this scene in shock, Allie looking ready to fight. Virgil restrains her, Stillwell looks up:

EXT. - ALLEN STRESS, TOMBSTONE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unlike the dreary, weather-beaten western towns in movies, Tombstone is new and colorful, part town, part mining camp, a wild mixture of brightly painted wooden storefronts and half- finished stone buildings rimmed by clusters of tents and shanties, all perched atop a hill with a magnificent view of the desert and the purple Dragoon mountains beyond. We HEAR the vibrant din of hammers and saws, player pianos, hurdy- gurdys, clip-clopping horses' hooves, and pealing laughter as the Earps drive up Allen Street, the main drag, lined with saloon after saloon, sidewalks bustling with drovers, miners, Chinamen, and sullen gun-toting hard-cases. They pull up in front of the Grand Hotel and step down. JOHNNY BEHAN, handsome, well-dressed, wearing an ornate crescent-shaped gold sheriff's badge and a ready smile walks up and shakes hands:
</DIRECTION>
<BEHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

EXT. - ORIENTAL SALOON - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We feel the sensual delight of going from hot sun into cool dark as Wyatt enters, going up to the ornate mahogany bar. Though a large, handsome saloon complete with gaming tables, it has only a few patrons on hand. The Lilly and the Rose is on the player piano as bartender MILT JOYCE appears:
</DIRECTION>
<JOYCE>

Joyce points to the faro table in the corner where JOHNNY TYLER, an unshaven plug-ugly with a big D.A. Colt .45 carried ostentatiously in a shoulder holster, deals to a couple of scruffy-looking drifters.
</DIRECTION>
<JOYCE>

</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
Wyatt steps forward suddenly, eyes cold and hard like a shark. Suddenly realizing he's in way over his head. Tyler shrinks back reflexively, his hand moving toward his gun. The other players scatter. Wyatt nods, his voice calm and steady:
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead. Skin it. Skin that Smoke wagon and see what happens.

</WYATT>
<TYLER>

Tyler goes pale, all pretense of courage gone. Wyatt slaps him again.
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said throw down, boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
Another slap. Tyler stays frozen, blood dripping down his chin.
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gonna do something or just Stand there and bleed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
Tyler's done. Wyatt plucks his gun away, handing it to Joyce.
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I didn't think so. Here, Milt. Keepsake, hang it over the Bar. All right, youngster. Out You go...

Wyatt takes Tyler by the ear, dragging him across the room like an unruly child. At the door he gives the ear a twist.
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And don't come back. Ever.

Tyler winces. Wyatt shoves him out into the street then turns to Joyce casually:

Down the block, unseen by the Earps, a wild-eyed Tyler is advancing on them with a sawed-off shotgun. He is within 20 feet when suddenly:

As if on cue, a bullet WHIZZES past Behan's head. Everyone ducks. More GUNFIRE as a man holding a bloody hand to his throat reels out the door of the nearby Crystal Palace, his gun firing wildly like a sputtering engine before he pitches face first onto the sidewalk, dead. Immediately 2 more men appear: a staggering DRUNK with a bullet hole in his shoulder; and TURKEY CREEK JACK JOHNSON, a leathery plainsman with his gun at the ready. A crowd forms as the drunk raises his pistol, bellowing.

McMasters tips his hat shyly, exits as the 1st actress returns with her key. They exchange looks....

A full house, pandemonium. Curly Bill, Ringo and their Cowboy entourage form a block in the center Rows while BILLY BREKENRIDGE, Behan's bespectacled, slightly effeminate little Deputy makes his timid way down the aisle, looking for a seat midst the off fist-fight and yelling match. 2 cocky young Cowboys, BILLY GROUNDS and ZWING HUNT, call out to him:

The curtain goes up. PROFESSOR GILLMAN, a 3rd rate juggler in white tie, tailcoat, and black tights steps out and starts tossing Indian clubs in the air. The audience starts groaning but the Professor's rictus-like smile never changes. Having seen enough, Frank Stillwell stands up and shouts:

More music and another card reads: Selections From the Bard of Mr. Romulus Fabian, Tragedian in Excelsis. The curtain rises and Fabian steps out, a purple velvet cloak wrapped resplendently about him like a toga. In the audience, Curly Bill's mouth drops:

	<DIALOGUE>
	Prettiest man I ever saw

The curtain falls. Another card: Faust - or the Devil's Bargain and the orchestra whirls into Danse Macabre by Saint-Saens, the rising curtain revealing a wild pained backdrop, all black and red, covered with weird, Beardsley- esque designs and images of death and damnation. A light comes up, revealing an ancient white-bearded scholar sitting alone with his books. Then a hooded Satan dances across the stage, slender and lissome in paned black doublet and breeches and black hose, tempting the old man with images of wealth and youth in the form of a shimmering blonde ballerina. The old man succumbs, signing Satan's contract. The audience watches in rapt attention, especially the Cowboys:

Satan makes a flourish. A flash-pad EXPLOSION transforms the old scholar into a young student. The ballerina flits by. The student offers her gold. They dance, swirling about the stage in a mad waltz with Satan hovering behind them, mirroring their every move like a puppet master. Finally, having gotten all his gold, the Ballerina drifts away leaving the young student alone, lost in bitterness as he changes back into the old scholar sitting with his books. Satan appears over him, exultant and triumphant, ready to collect the debt as the curtain falls with a final crashing chord. Thunderous cheering and applause. The curtain rises again and the performers come out for bows, all except Satan.

Ringo looks at Doc, holding his gaze while suddenly whipping out his .45. Everyone but Doc flinches. Ringo does a dazzling series of twirls and tricks, his nickel-plated pistol flashing like a blaze of silver fire, finally slapping it back into his holster with a flourish. Cheers and hoots. Doc rolls his eyes, hooks a finger through the handle of his silver cup, then launches into an exact duplication of Ringo's routine using a cup instead of a gun. The room bursts into laughter. Doc shrugs. Ringo lets a strange little hint of a smile cross his face then exits with the others. White exhales, turns to Wyatt:

Wyatt grunts and nods, perturbed. Outside the others mount up but Curly Bill stands drugged-up in the middle of the street, arms out, head back, eyes closed, luxuriating in the moonlight.
</DIRECTION>
<CURLY_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy, I feel great! Full of that Hop I got from Chinky. I feel Just capitol! You boys go ahead. I'm gonna stick around awhile, Howl at the moon.

</CURLY_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
The others shrug and ride off. Curly Bill pulls his pistol, spinning it. Back inside the Oriental it's late, few patrons remain. A few beats then suddenly everyone jumps as GUNSHOTS echo from outside. White goes to the window, looks outside:
</DIRECTION>
<WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Curly Bill. He's over across the Street shootin' out the lights.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE>
<CLUM>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BEHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Outside Curly Bill starts taking potshots at a passerby's feet, making him dance down the street and scurry for cover. Curly Bill cackles. Inside White turns uneasily to Wyatt:
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you just leave it alone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I gotta do something. I don't Suppose you'd card-

</WHITE>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None of my business, Fred.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
Wyatt keeps dealing, Doc keeps playing. White draws himself up and exits. Outside, Curly Bill reloads and keeps shooting. White steps out into the street. We feel a sense of inverted terror as he draws his gun and we SEE that his hand is trembling. He crosses the street, coming up behind Curly Bill:
</DIRECTION>
<WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Curly? Come on now, boy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE>
<DIRECTION>
Curly Bill spins around. White's gun stares him in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<CURLY_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, howdy, Fred!

</CURLY_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
Back in the bar, Wyatt puts his cards down, looks over at Doc.
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>

</WYATT>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will or you won't. Don't look To me. I'm going to sleep.

</DOC>

Doc lays his head down on the keys, passes out. Wyatt frowns for a moment. Finally he stands, turning to Morgan:
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go wake up Virgil.

<DIRECTION>
(turns to Joyce)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Milt, lend me a sidearm, will you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
Joyce hands him a Colt from under the bar. Outside White covers Curly Bill, trembling harder now. An adrenaline rush in a man White's age is hard to look at, he seems so frail, so vulnerable. Even his voice has a quavering edge to it:
</DIRECTION>
<WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hand that over. Come on now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE>
<CURLY_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why sure, dad. I'm only in fun. Here she is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURLY_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
With a reassuring smile, Curly Bill holds his pistol out butt- first. White reaches for it, visibly relieved. But quick as a snake's tongue Curly Bill spins it around and FIRES POINT BLANK into White's chest, blowing him over backward, the blast so close it sets his clothes on fire. Curly Bill turns just as Wyatt flashes into frame and SLAMS him over the head with his pistol barrel, laying him out in a groaning heap. Wyatt glances at White lying semi-conscious in the street, chest heaving, eyelids fluttering, making weak little bird-like sounds, smoke rising from his smoldering shirt and vest. Clum runs up:
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put his clothes out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
Clum pats the embers out in White's clothes but as Wyatt starts to haul Curly Bill up he suddenly finds himself surrounded by Ike, Billy Clanton, and six other Cowboys.
</DIRECTION>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>

<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Swear to God, Mister, step aside Or we'll tear you apart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<DIRECTION>
The Cowboys tense up, ready for action. Wyatt holds his ground, his hard, steady gaze zeroing in on Ike:
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You. Come here a second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
Ike steps up, full of brass. Without warning Wyatt jabs the muzzle of his pistol into his forehead, snapping his head back. Wyatt cocks the pistol. The other Cowboys hush. Ike freezes. Wyatt's eyes bore into him.
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You die first, get it? The others Might get me in a rush but before That I'm gonna make your head Into a canoe. Understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
Ike stands stock still. Billy steps forward, undaunted:
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's bluffin'! Let's rush him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
This is it. The Cowboys poise themselves, ready to start, but:
</DIRECTION>
<O_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you, you simpleton, you're next.
	</DIALOGUE>
</O_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Again a hush. Doc stands behind Wyatt, still drunk, but with his .38 trained on Billy. Billy sneers:
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell, he can't hit nothin'. He's So drunk he's probably seein' Double.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Doc pulls out his .45, training it, too, on Billy:
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have two guns. One for each of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
Billy pauses, chastened. Suddenly there's another commotion as Virgil and Morgan bull their way through the crowd from behind with shotguns.
</DIRECTION>
<VIRGIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, look out! Break it up. Go home, all of you, go home now...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIRGIL>
<DIRECTION>
This breads the group's will and things suddenly calm down dramatically as the Cowboys disperse. Wyatt lowers his pistol, heaving a sigh of relief as he pulls the still-groggy Curly Bill to his feet and hauls him reeling toward the jail.
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, you...

Later. As the Earps and Doc step out on the sidewalk we can see the semi-conscious Curly Bill through the front door of the jail laying in one of the cells, holding a bloody kerchief to his head. Wyatt closes the door, locks it, gives Clum the keys.

Armed with a borrowed pistol and carbine, Wyatt gallops through the desert on one of his other big blacks, eyes scanning the tracks beneath him. He rides up and stops at a well near a large ranch house. He dismounts, studying tracks as rancher HENRY HOOKER rides up, strong, noble-looking, like something from a Frederic Remington canvas. Wyatt nods. Hooker nods back.

Billy steps back, poised. Ike and Swilling do the same. 3 more Cowboys move up behind him. The scene seems on the brink of explosion when Curly Bill suddenly STREAKS into frame on his buckskin mare, majestic and 10 times life size as he pulls back and SKIDS to a stop in front of Wyatt, raising a giant roostertail of dust, making everyone but Wyatt recoil.

Old Man Clanton leads 4 other Cowboys with a herd through the rocky canyon, slipping a flask and singing as the first shot RINGS OUT from the rocks above, becoming a FUSILLADE. When the dust settles, all are dead except the Old Man who lies pinned under his horse, semi-conscious. FIGURES emerge from the shadows. It's the Rurales led by the same Young Rurale from before. He bends down to the dazed Old Man, speaking carefully:

Wyatt is up on his stallion, riding along the foot of a high hill. Coming to a cut, he suddenly stops. Josephine is 100 yards up ahead, gorgeously impressive in a black velvet riding habit, riding side-saddle through the cut on a pretty mare.
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hell...
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Looking for an escape, Wyatt turns up a narrow trail on the side of the cut. He follows it as it winds around the hill then abruptly drops back down and comes out on the other side of the cut right in front of Josephine. She waves. He groans:
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'm an oak all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
He takes off at a dead run. Catching up, the horses find their rhythm, breaking into a smooth gallop, flying over a jet black plain of volcanic ash into a rolling meadow carpeted with yellow desert poppies, so bright it almost hurts your eyes to look at them. Coming off a rise the desert floor shears off into a wide crevice. Josephine heads right at it.

A crack of her crop and she streaks toward it. Wyatt grits his teeth and follows suit. The sound of their hoofbeats stops for a long instant as they take the jump together, sailing through the air side-by-side, Josephine giggling like a little girl. They light on the other side and gallop on....

EXT. - DESERT - MAGIC HOUR

They pull up at a huge desert stone formation, a canopy of white sandstone with vermillion streaks swirling through it looming over them like a giant oyster shell. Wyatt dismounts, helping Josephine. He takes his long duster from his saddle and lays it on a wide, table-shaped rock for them to sit on.

The vacant lot starts to come into view and the Earps are fighting nerves now. Fists clenched, gritting their teeth, eyes darting all over the street, they look all too human and nothing like their legend. It's only Doc, bringing up the rear, who couldn't care less. Wyatt narrows his eyes:

The Earps quicken their step as Behan enters Fly's gallery. Seeing the approaching Earp party, the Cowboys glance around at each other, setting themselves. Now at the end of the sidealk, the Earps can see that the Cowboys are still armed and their relief evaporates. Wyatt mutters under his breath:

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, great. Disarmed my ass...

The Earps slow their step, gathering themselves. This is it, no turning back now. The Cowboys spread out. As the Earps get closer and closer, it seems as if the very air is electric with tension. But as they step into the street and fan out for their final approach, they suddenly do look like their legend, 4 tall figures in long black coats advancing in a line, grim and unstoppable, a fleeting moment in time frozen forever in our minds. Finally they stop. The 2 groups are facing each other, perhaps 20 feet apart. Doc raises the shotgun, the Cheshire cat smile spreading over his face. Virgil steps forward, his face set, holding up Doc's cane:
</DIRECTION>
<VIRGIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've come to arrest you. Throw Up your arms!

A weird moment of confusion where nobody seems to know what to do. Then Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury SLAP their hands to their guns. The Earps instantly tense up, hands on their pistols. Virgil waves his hands frantically, afraid they've misunderstood:
</DIRECTION>
<VIRGIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold! I don't want that!

<DIRECTION>
Suddenly realizing what's happening, Fuller and Claiborne bolt and dash into Fly's gallery. Everyone else stands frozen, breath short, pulses pounding, each staring into the other's wide-open eyes. Then something in Billy Clanton's eyes seems to go dead and Wyatt groans under his breath as the awful realization hits him:
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
Billy and Frank jerk their pistols and the scene EXPLODES, everything happening in SPLIT SECONDS as Wyatt draws and FIRES, knocking Frank down with a gutshot. Morgan FIRES, blowing Billy back against the wall of the Harwood house. Tom darts for the cover behind his horse as Ike dives onto Wyatt shrieking like a woman:

Wyatt hurls him aside. Ike sprints for the gallery. Tom FIRES over his saddle at Doc who tries for a shot but is blocked by the horse. Billly bounces back up, howling, and FIRES, the bullet piercing Virgil's calf. He drops to one knee. Tom FIRES again. Doc FIRES one barrel into the air, the BLAST making the horse rear up, exposing Tom for a split second. Doc FIRES again. Tom's side EXPLODES into red mist, the full charge of red mist, the full charge of buckshot SLAMMING him into the Harwood house. Tom drops his gun and teeters into the street, talking eerie little mincing steps, already dead but still moving, like a chicken with its head cut off. Billy FIRES again, dropping Morgan with a hole in his shoulder.

Doc pull his Lightning and FIRES DOUBLE ACTION 1-2-3 times, hitting Billy in the abdomen while Frank bounds back into the fight, FIRING wildly. Virgil gets up, FIRING BACK. The whole scene now bathed in thick smoke, the fight starts swirling into the street, each man jockeying for position. Inside the gallery, Behan and Fuller watch at the window as Ike dives in. He snatches Fuller's pistol and FIRES through the window. Ike's bullets WHIZ past Wyatt's ear. He spins around, calling to Doc:
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Behind us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
In a flashing move taking less than a heartbeat, Doc pivots, replacing the .38 in this right hand with his big .45, then with one pass of his left hand RAPID FIRES quick as a machine gun burst 1-2-3-4-5 times, the bullets RIPPING through the gallery, showering Ike and the rest with splinters and broken glass.
</DIRECTION>
<BEHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Behan hauls Ike up and they dash out the back door, Fuller and Claiborne right behind, all frantically running for their lives. Outside Billy gets to his knees, seemingly indestructible, and FIRES at Wyatt, Wyatt RETURNS FIRE. Eyes wild and bulging, a bloody hand clutching his wounds, Frank staggers across the lot, bearing down on Doc through the smoke:
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>

<DIRECTION>
Doc opens his arms, giving Frank a clear shot at his chest. Frank FIRES. The bullet grazes Doc's holster. Frank trudges closer, about to fire again but Doc DRILLS him through the heart while in the next millisecond Morgan FIRES from his prone position on the ground, the big .45 BLAST carrying away the top of Frank's head. As the last shot echoes through the hills, Frank flops limply to the ground like a rag doll while out in the street his brother Tom finally runs out of steam and pitches face first in the dirt, leaving only Billy, leaning against the Harwood house, legs splayed out in front of him, absolutely shot to pieces, clicking his empty gun and wailing piteously as the smoke clears:
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More cartridges! Somebody load my gun...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
He keeps repeating it with sinking volume as townspeople step timidly into the street. Fly bends down and takes Bill's gun from his hand and the fight is officially over, having lasted only some 20 seconds. Wyatt helps Morgan to his feet as Behan strides briskly onto the scene, addressing Wyatt:
</DIRECTION>
<BEHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. You're all under Arrest.

Wyatt looks at him in utter disbelief. Finally:

More bystanders arrive, a crowd scene rapidly developing. The Earp women run up from the west end of Fremont. Josephine fights her way through the crowd from the east. She and Wyatt catch sight of each other. She grins, tears in her eyes. He nods, smiling. Seeing the whole thing, Behan fumes. And so does MATTIE who turns and walks away while Allie and Lou run to their men, hugging them. Meanwhile Doc stands over Frank's body, fingering the graze over his thigh, jeering under his breath:

With his good arm Morgan SLUGS Behan in the mouth. Behan drops like a leaf, as much to avoid a further injury as from the blow. Morgan turns to Josephine, leading her away. Across the street Curly Bill and Ringo share a flask, watching, Ringo looking even odder than usual. Curly Bill chuckles:

An adobe rancho in the Sonora desert, small, humbly furnished. Inside a Mexican family, 3 children, a husband and young wife eat dinner. Suddenly Curly Bill and Ringo BURST IN, guns drawn, shouting in Spanish. Everyone freezes and as the children start crying we feel the family's sense of inner terror.

	God, it's a cold night. Come up To the fire, Mattie.

Suddenly there's a KNOCK at the door. Louisa looks out the window. Outside is the tall silhouette of a WOMAN in a dark cloak.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It looks like a woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUISA>
<DIRECTION>
Allie opens the door. Josephine enter, breathless, comes into the parlor. Mattie sits up in shock. The others gather round.

<JOSEPHINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, I know it's awful me Coming here, but listen, I can't Say why, but I think something is-

Another KNOCK. Allie goes to the window. There's a weird sense of déjà vu as outside we again see a cloaked woman's SILHOUETTE.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLIE>

	Now who in... It's another woman.

Allie starts to open the door but Josephine suddenly leaps up and:
</DIRECTION>
<JOSEPHINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Look out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSEPHINE>
<DIRECTION>
With her dancer's quickness she dashes across the parlor, grabbing Allie and pulling her to the floor just as a tremendous SHOTGUN BLAST rips through the open doorway. The chandelier overhead explodes, showering the screaming women with broken glass and a harsh MALE VOICE cuts through the air as the shrouded figure dashes into the darkness:

Virgil nods, exiting with a wave. Wyatt and Morgan keep playing, hardly noticing as moments later, Florentino walks out....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. - CORNER OF ALLEN & 5TH STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Virgil turns off Allen onto 5th, the wind whipping his coattails. He glances up as Florentino walks by, crossing 5th and ducking into a doorway. Virgil stops. SOMETHING seems to be moving in the shadows of an unfinished building on the opposite side of 5th....

</MORGAN>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That didn't sound like thunder.

Moments later Virgil walks back in, pale, hatless, a blank look on his face. He moves with odd, shuffling steps, holding himself sideways. Wyatt and Morgan exchange puzzled glances, then:
</DIRECTION>

	Virgil?

</WYATT>
<VIRGIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wyatt...

</VIRGIL>
<DIRECTION>
Virgil does an unsteady stutter-step, his face taking on a pleading, almost childlike look of panic. But as he turns his body toward Wyatt we suddenly see that his whole left side is in bloody shreds, his left arm dangling unnaturally by a few gory ribbons of flesh. His voice is a frightened sob:
</DIRECTION>
<VIRGIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wyatt!

</VIRGIL>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to swoon. Wyatt rushes over and grabs him as....

INT- HOTEL ROOM (VIRGIL) - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The hotel room where they've taken Virgil. He's on the bed, wrapped in bandages, semi-conscious. Wyatt and Morgan stand in the doorway with Doc and the women. Allie is at Virgil's side, hands over her mouth as Dr. Goodfellow speaks in somber tones:
</DIRECTION>
<DR_GOODFELLOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid your husband's been Very badly hurt. I had to remove The entire left elbow joint. What That means is, well I'm afraid-

She starts wailing. Suddenly alert, Virgil sits up, taking her in his big right arm, pulling her close, his voice calm, reassuring:
</DIRECTION>
<VIRGIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, don't worry, honey. I Still got one arm left to hug you with.
	</DIALOGUE>

She buries her face in his chest and sobs. He holds her, rocking her back and forth. Wyatt turns away, shutting his eyes.

Virgil lies in bed, staring blankly into space. Wyatt sits at his side, hands over his face while Allie hovers in the b.g.

Wyatt stands, backing away. He turns pleadingly to Mattie standing in the doorway. She looks away. He walks out....

</MORGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Morgan pulls back his vest, revealing Virgil's badge. Wyatt drops into a corner chair, defeated. Morgan makes a shot, leaving only the 8 ball. A few beats. Seeing Wyatt's misery, Morgan softens, poking him with the cue. Wyatt looks up. Morgan taps the middle pocket. Wyatt shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<MORGAN>

<MORGAN>

<DIRECTION>
Morgan has to lean over the table but he sinks the 8 ball, looking over at Wyatt in triumph. Wyatt applauds, rolling his eyes just as a BULLET SPANGS into the wall by his head. Wyatt dives for the floor as ANOTHER SHOT pierces the window. Wyatt jumps up, bounding to the door to see several FIGURES cash into the darkness. Wyatt turns back and freezed. Morgan lies across the table with one leg dangling over the edge, jerking and shuddering involuntarily. Wyatt rushes to him. The dog whines as Doc rushes in with Kate and McMasters. Wyatt is trembling.

The curious crowd outside, watching through the windows. Morgan is on the pool table, lying on his side with his shirt pulled up. The dog cowers in the corner, whining while Dr. Goodfellow digs into the wound with a steel probe, making Morgan writhe in perfect agony. The doctor turns to Wyatt:
</DIRECTION>
<DR_GOODFELLOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_GOODFELLOW>
<DIRECTION>
Wyatt takes Morgan in his arms. The doctor probes. Morgan jerks violently. Suddenly we hear a blood-curdling SCREAM. Louisa is in the doorway, tearing her hair, lost in utter hysterics.
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no, get her out of her! Jesus!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
And now the whole scene sinks into hellish confusion with the dog whimpering, Louisa shrieking as others restrain her, and Morgan gives a violet jerk, breaking Wyatt's grip. The doctor snarls, about at the end of his rope.
</DIRECTION>

Tears well up in Wyatt's eyes. He touches his brother's face. Morgan's eyelids start fluttering. Wyatt squeezes his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morgan? Morgan!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
The dog starts howling, long and loud and pitiful-and in the next moment the air is FILLED with howls as every dog and coyote for miles joins in the mourning. Wyatt backs away from his dead brother and trudges out onto the sidewalk, staring at the blood on his hands. Standing in the crowd across the street, Josephine sees Wyatt and starts for him. Behan grabs her. She wrenches free and with the whole town watching, starts running toward Wyatt. Seeing her, Wyatt backs away in horror, shaking his head:
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, get away, get away from me...

</WYATT>
<JOSEPHINE>

<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whore! Filthy whore! Get away From me!

She pauses, unable to believe her ears, then runs away crying. Fuming with rage, Kate starts after Wyatt. Doc pulls her back:
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't you see why he did it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
The howls continue as Wyatt trudges down the street alone. Suddenly he doubles over, clutching his abdomen in agony, staring at his bloody hands....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. - ALLEN STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wagon bearing Morgan's pine coffin waits in the street, hitched and ready. Virgil is up front with the women, arm in a sling, pale. Doc and Kate wait on horses nearby. Finished loading, Wyatt looks around. People line the street, watching in silence. Clum and his wounded wife turn away from the window of their lodgings next door, unable to meet his gaze. The very air feels charged with paranoia and recrimination, as if the whole town has suddenly become morally radio-active. Bystanders gape as Josephine steps out of the hotel, regal and impervious as a queen, wearing a gawking scorn like a mink coat, her little white dog scampering after her. Passing Behan, he gives her nasty look and spits. She doesn't even break stride. Lounging in front of the Crystal Palace with the other Cowboys, Stillwell gives Curly Bill an enquiring look.
</DIRECTION>
<CURLY_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naw, she's nobody. Wyatt junked her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURLY_BILL>

Passing Wyatt, she doesn't even glance at him. Doc sighs:
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so she walked out of our Lives forever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
Without a word Wyatt climbs onto the wagon and shakes the reins, driving off. He pulls up in front of the Cowboys. They make a show of pretending to hide their guns. Wyatt looks straight ahead:
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>

Allie's eyes flare, Louisa stifles a sob. The Cowboys snicker. Wyatt clenches his teeth, still staring straight ahead, and drives on. A few beats then Curly Bill turns to Ike:

A train pours steam onto the platform in puffs and clouds while 2 porters load Morgan's coffin into a boxcar. Up ahead, Mattie and Louisa fumble with luggage while Allie boosts Virgil into a passenger car. As we HEAR the conductor's voice shouting, 'Board!, Ike and Stillwell emerge from the shadows near the scales, crouched behind shotguns. They exchange nods and start forward, cocking their weapons, squinting through the steam:

Lucinda's ever-silent son sits at a nearby wagon, staring at Wyatt while Lucinda rolls dough, lovely as ever. Just finished telling his story, Wyatt sits by the fire with the wagonmaster and several others. They shaker their head:

	</DIALOGUE>
</WAGONMASTER>
<DIRECTION>
They shake hands then Wyatt motions to his men. They take off at a graceful lope, riding through camp toward the deadfall and the desert beyond. Unable to contain himself any longer, Lucinda's son bounds up onto a wagon, waving and shouting, spurring them on with a spontaneous frontier toast:
</DIRECTION>
<LUCINDA_S_SON>

	Wyatt Earp, the two-gun man, Whistling death and bloody Murder! Wyatt the widow-maker, Avenging and bright, purple Poison on horseback with Lightning in his eye and thunder In his heart!

They break into a dead run, streaking across the frame. As they crest a rise the ground seems to drop from under them and for a single perfect moment it appears as if they're airborne, flying across the skyline like the winged horsemen of myth. Johnson turns to Vermillion, laughing at the sheer joy of being alive:

EXT. - RUSTLERS PARK - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun just starts to dip behind the near end of the ridge overlooking the camp where on one side Florentino and several Cowboys sit in a circle, playing poker while others recline on bedrolls, laughing and drinking. On the other side, at the foot of the ridge, Spence, Pony Deal, and 2 others crouch over a fire, cooking. Suddenly the cattle nestled under the far end of the ridge start bleating. Spence turns to Pony Deal who shrugs:
</DIRECTION>
<PONY_DEAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe they smell a wolf.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PONY_DEAL>
<DIRECTION>
SPENCE (turns to other Cowboy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go up there and take a look.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Cowboy mount a pinto pony and lopes up and over the far side of the ridge. Spence and the others continue cooking. Moments later a CRASHING SOUND comes echoing over the ridge like thunder. The Cowboys look up, startled. Pony Deal points:
</DIRECTION>
<PONY_DEAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PONY_DEAL>
<DIRECTION>
The pinto gallops riderless back over the ridge. The Cowboys exchange confused glances, all attention focused on the far end of the ridge. Then the five black horsemen ride out of the sun, gliding like apparitions up and over the near end of the ridge and bearing down on the unsuspecting camp with the speed of a flame. They are within a few yards of the fire when Johnny Barnes suddenly spots them and:
</DIRECTION>
<BARNES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
Spence and the others turn and just have time to gasp before Wyatt and his horsemen SLAM into them with terrifying impact, the bodies disappearing under their horses' hooves. The Cowboys recoil in total shock, jumping up from bedrolls, stumbling in confusion, scrambling to get out of the way as the possemen plow through the fire and roar into camp, pistols BLAZING in air, horses rearing and snorting.
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	United States Marshals! Reach!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>

Everyone freezes. A worried-looking Florentino shrinks back behind the others, trying not to be spotted. Meanwhile Doc leans down and pokes his pistol into a nearby Cowboy's forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say something witty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
They herd the Cowboys over to one side of camp, shouting, Get over there!, Move it!, etc. But Barnes brazens up to Wyatt:
</DIRECTION>
<BARNES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you can't come-
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNES>
<DIRECTION>
A loud crack as Wyatt's quirt lays his face open to the bone.

Doc and Wyatt cover the Cowboys while the others scatter their herd with pistol shots. Indignant, Swilling sneers at Wyatt:
</DIRECTION>
<SWILLING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bastard! Stinkin' bastard! Like To eat you blood raw!

A queer look in his eye, Wyatt dismounts and faces Swilling.
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, breed. Dig in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
And then Wyatt DRILLS him in the jaw with a straight right hand. Swilling drops like a stone. Wyatt hauls him up by the hair and hammers him left-right-left, steps around, digs down, and pile-drives a left hook to his gut. Swilling topples back into a seated position then rolls over with a moan and passes out. Meanwhile, seeing his chance, Florentino ducks down and makes for the remuda as Doc looks down at Swilling.
</DIRECTION>

At the remuda Florentino leaps on a horse and gallops off bareback. McMasters point, pulling his rifle from its scabbard:
</DIRECTION>
<MCMASTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Florentino! He's getting away!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCMASTERS>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drop his horse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
McMasters draws a bead on the retreating form with his '76 Winchester and FIRES. 100 yards away, the bullet hits Florentino's horse in the shoulder with a thunk. It drops, tumbling end over end and plunging Florentino face-first into the ground. He jumps up, spitting out a mouthful, and starts running. Wyatt leaps on this black and it streaks forward, closing the distance in seconds. Florentino gasps and runs faster, pulling a bellygun from his sash, Wyatt almost on top of him. He turns and FIRES on the run. A branch next to Wyatt's head EXPLODES. Wyatt keeps coming, drawing his Buntline, impervious, unstoppable. Florentino turns for another shot just as the black PILES into him, sending him flying and tumbling him down an embankment. He scrambles to his feet as Wyatt dismounts, starting toward him with deliberate step, eyes blazing, long-barreled pistol held in front of him. Florentino backs up in terror, gun at his side, shaking his head:
</DIRECTION>
<FLORENTINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't kill your brother! I Don't even know him. I was only Lookout. It was money, they give Me twelve dollars! It was money!

</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>

Wyatt FIRES, blasting Florentino to the ground. He advances, FIRING over and over, emptying his gun into him....

The Cowboys watch as Wyatt gallops up, dragging Florentino's bullet-riddled body behind him. He reins up, un-dallying the rope. The corpse flops at their feet. They jump back, horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at him. That's how you'll All end up if you don't get it Through your head: it's over, The Cowboys're finished. Forever. So tell the others and get out of The Territory 'cause next time I Leave no one alive. Understand? No one. You been warned.

Now we see what so interested Wyatt-it's the same mountain cut where he and Josephine met. Pony Deal and a party of 10 Cowboys ride through the desert 300 yards from the cut, pushing a herd.
</DIRECTION>
<PONY_DEAL>

They look. Wyatt and his horsemen stand waiting at the mouth of the cut. They tense, the 1st Cowboy squinting against the sun. At the cut, Wyatt and his men poise themselves, Doc nodding:
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They saw us. Here they come.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
The Cowboys charge forward, outnumbering them better than 2 to 1 and only 100 yards away. The possemen choke up on their reins, alerting their horses for action as:
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait... wait... steady...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
75 yards and the first shots RING out, richochetting off the walls of the cut. The others blanch but Wyatt stays cool, waiting, 50 yards... 40 yards... till we can see their eyes and:
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
They whirl around and disappear into the cut. The Cowboys keep coming. Wyatt's group reaches the little trail leading up the wall of the cut he used to avoid Josephine. They clamber up the side of the cut at a bounding gallop, unseen, as moments later the Cowboys gallop by and continue through into the desert on the other side. Wyatt's group careens up and around the high mountain wall as if on a roller-coaster, following the tiny, narrow path at a breathtaking clip, the trail finally plunging them back into the draw behind the Cowboys. They speed up to the opposite mouth of the cut, drawing their pistols as the Cowboys gallop into the desert before them, unaware.
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lay on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
They CHARGE forward. Seeing the empty desert ahead, the Cowboys pull up, looking around in confusion. Suddenly a VOLLEY of GUNFIRE hits them from behind, knocking several from the saddle. They spin around just as Wyatt's group SLAMS into them HEAD-ON, guns BLAZING, Cowboys tumbling from the saddle left and right, horses rearing and toppling over backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<PONY_DEAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run!

The remaining Cowboys turn and dash into the desert. Wyatt shouts:
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
Wyatt's group CHARGES, the thoroughbreds closing the distance in seconds. Vermillion stands in his stirrups, roaring like an animal as he PLUNGES into them, swinging his quirt like a saber and LASHING a Cowboy across the face, making him tumble to the earth and bounce over the rocks like a rag doll. McMasters closes with another, throwing an arm around him and JERKING him from the saddle, SNAPPING his neck. Doc overtakes a 3rd, jams his pistol into his face and FIRES point-blank, blackening his face with soot and BLOWING out the back of his head as he falls. Reins in his teeth, shotgun at his shoulder, Johnson comes up behind a 4th and FIRES. The Cowboy's head DISAPPEARS in a cloud of pink vapor, the body dropping like a stone....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wyatt bears down on Pony Deal at a dead run. Pony Deal turns in the saddle and FIRES at him. We feel a surge of breathless exhilaration as Wyatt swings out of the saddle like a Commanche and ducks his body down against the side of his horse, hiding in its lee. Pony Deal turns for another shot only to see an apparently riderless horse overtake him. But in the next instant Wyatt darts around under his horse's neck and FIRES, blowing Pony Deal head-over-heels off the back of his horse. Wyatt bounds back into the saddle as McMasters rides by, drawing a bead with his rifle on the lone survivor, the 1st Cowboy. Only a few yards in front of them, he whips his horse frantically, trying to get away. McMasters is about to fire when Wyatt rides up, deflecting the shot. The Cowboy makes it over a rise and disappears.

<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll go around that way, come up on foot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
They pull shotguns from their saddles and start down over the rocks on foot, creeping up on the camp, seemingly undetected. But suddenly the Cowboys by the fire dive behind a log and:
</DIRECTION>
<MCMASTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ambush! Get down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCMASTERS>
<DIRECTION>
And suddenly the deadfall on the opposite side EXPLODES IN GUNFIRE. Vermillion takes a graze and drops with the others, hugging the rocks. A bullet RICHOCHETS into a rock at Johnson's head, biting his face with fragments, making him wince:
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNSON>
<DIRECTION>
Hunched behind the logs on the opposite side with 15 more Cowboys, Curly Bill raises his head, grinning and shouting:
</DIRECTION>
<CURLY_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Wyatt! How the hell are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURLY_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
Wyatt and his men react to his voice. The fire continues. Suddenly there's MOVEMENT in the rocks above them. Doc points:
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<CURLY_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got some boys workin' around Those rocks behind you. Another Minute or two, gonna have you in A crossfire! How do you like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURLY_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing the spot they're in, McMasters turns to the silent Wyatt:
</DIRECTION>
<MCMASTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's right. They get set up in Them rocks it's the end for us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCMASTERS>
<DIRECTION>
And now for the first time we see fear in these men, actual naked fear. But Curly Bill laughs, having the time of his life.
</DIRECTION>
<CURLY_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Course you could give yourselves up and we could have a party! Then what larks!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURLY_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
Crouched by Curly Bill, Barnes chuckles. A confident ripple of laughter goes through the Cowboy line-they know they've got them. On the other side, Vermillion shakes his head grimly.
</DIRECTION>
<VERMILLION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ain't takin' me alive, damn it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERMILLION>
<DIRECTION>
McMasters looks at the still silent Wyatt, shrugging helplessly:
</DIRECTION>
<MCMASTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think of somethin' fast or we're cooked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCMASTERS>
<DIRECTION>
They really are at the end of their rope, all looking to Wyatt for a solution. He remains silent. Then suddenly, in this supreme moment, a strange, almost supernatural calm seems to come over him and he says simply:
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<JOHNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNSON>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
And now we can almost hear the ether RINGING in our ears as Wyatt takes his shotgun and, while the others look on in horror, rises to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wyatt!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
Bullets WHIZ around him. Doc jumps up to grab him but a RICOCHET drives him back down. Wyatt advances quickly across the clearing, walking right into the teeth of their guns, repeating:
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
Wyatt's clothes jerk and ripple as bullets pass through, but he just keeps coming. Seeing this, Curly Bill also stands, a weird, manic elation coming over him. He hoots and howls:
</DIRECTION>
<CURLY_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at that! Yeah! Come and get Some, boy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURLY_BILL>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
Curly Bill waves away his men's fire and walks toward Wyatt, 12 gauge shotgun in one hand, .45 in the other, BLASTING away.
</DIRECTION>
<CURLY_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me, let me, yeah! Die, you Bastard...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURLY_BILL>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
Curly Bill FIRES again. Wyatt's hat flies off. He FIRES again, digging a gash in Wyatt's boot-heel. Now Curly Bill takes dead aim with his .45 and-CLICK-it's empty. He tosses it aside. Suddenly a sharp wind gusts up, making the tails of Wyatt's duster swirl around him like a halo as he advances. Eyes wild with battle rage, Curly Bill quickly raises his shotgun.
</DIRECTION>
<CURLY_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Die! Son of a bitch! Die!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURLY_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
He FIRES. Wyatt's coattails EVAPORATE into swirling shreds as he takes deliberate aim with his mighty 10 gauge, hissing through clenched teeth:
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
And with that, Wyatt lets go with BOTH BARRELS. Curly Bill's mid-section VAPORIZES, the huge double-charge of buckshot RIPPING HIM COMPLETELY IN HALF. The other Cowboys flinch as they're sprayed with flecks of blood and gore. Barnes screams:
</DIRECTION>
<BARNES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARNES>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
Eyes burning like two twin hells, Wyatt pulls his Buntline and FIRES. Barnes doubles over. Wyatt FIRES again. Barnes drops. The others recoil, their faces looking as if they are living in a waking nightmare as Wyatt advances on them, STILL FIRING. Another goes down. Doc leaps from the rocks, gun in hand, and:
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
Now they all rise and OPEN FIRE, advancing 4 abreast, a WALL OF GUNFIRE driving the remaining Cowboys off, running for their horses. Wyatt keeps snapping his empty gun as the others run up.
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
Beside himself, Doc helps Wyatt to a nearby rock, sitting him down and examining him, running his hands all over his body. The others FIRE at the Cowboys retreating on horseback.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wyatt, my God! You're shot to pieces!

EXT. - CAMP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're camped by a running stream. Wyatt stares into the fire. Doc crouches opposite him, shaking his head:
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a man without fear, Wyatt. I Literally don't care if I live or Die. But even I can't fight human Instinct. Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about?

</DOC>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
At the other end of camp, Vermillion and Johnson sit together. After a beat:
</DIRECTION>
<VERMILLION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Creek, you ever see anything Like that before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERMILLION>
<JOHNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>

Vermillion nods. Both look shaken to the very core of their beings. Finally:
</DIRECTION>

EXT. - CAMP - MORNING

Wyatt sits by the fire, sipping coffee. Vermillion and Johnson approach. Johnson drops a wad of money on Wyatt's bedroll. Wyatt looks up in surprise:
</DIRECTION>
<VERMILLION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talked it over. We decided we Don't need the money. Took out 13 Dollars each, though. Federal Posseman's fee. That all right?

Wyatt nods, picks up the money and quietly moves off toward the stream by himself. Moments later, McMasters approaches:

Ringo crouches by the fire with the other Cowboys, his face a deeply shadowed mask. 2 Iron Springs survivors stand before him:

	You see my face, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINGO>
<DIRECTION>
Out of nowhere, Ringo draws and FIRES 2 shots so quickly they sound like one. The 2 survivors drop with bullets through their brains. The others jump, transfixed by the insane brutality of what he's just done. Ringo draws himself up, in full possession of the situation, the new leader, fearsome, matchless:
</DIRECTION>
<RINGO>

	Everybody get this through their Heads. Wyatt Earp dies. I'm Running the show now and I'm Telling you, Earp dies. His men Too. They all die. Understand? We're gonna kill 'em.

Wyatt and his men watch from a plateau as far out on the horizon, the Cowboy Posse rides out of the sun, drawing closer:

The Cowboy posse is camped in a draw up in the Whetstones. They look up as the stage rolls up and stops. Shouting and commotion as Behan and Breakenridge approach and confer with the driver, then Behan turns to Ringo:

	Robbery. 2 men stuck 'em up and Killed a passenger. One of 'em Rode a Mexican saddle, the other Had a Mother Hubbard. Billy Grounds and Zwing Hunt.

Behan opens the door. Mr. Fabian lies inside cradled in Josephine's arms, surrounded by the other actors in the troupe. Reclined at full length, head back, he looks like the dying Hamlet, even more beautiful than in life. Breakenridge gasps:

Wyatt opens the coach door for her. She gets in. It pulls out with a crack of the driver's whip. She and Wyatt hold each other's gaze as the stage recedes into the distance. Then:

Creek Johnson steps up next to him. Wyatt looks at him:

Grounds raises his pistol. Breakenridge recoils in fright, stumbling backward in the dark, and his rifle accidentally FIRES. Grounds drops like a stone, a look of utter disbelief on his dying face. Hunt looks at him in shock then turns on Breakenridge, raising his gun and snarling. Breakenridge FIRES again. Hunt grabs his midsection, dropping his gun and falling to his knees. He looks up at Breakenridge who shrugs timidly:

A gorgeous sunset, yellow and red and magenta. Making his way down the trail, Wyatt looks up at the sky. A flock of wild geese fly overhead in V-formation, oblivious to the human drama below. Wyatt stops, drinking it all in, as if trying to grab all he can in the time left. Suddenly he closes his eyes, falling to his knees, trembling, afraid for the first time. He clasps his hands:
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>

	Dear God, this is the last Battle. I worked it out in my Head every which way and I know There's no way I'm comin' through This alive. You've preserved me This far so I only ask one more Favor: just let me live long Enough to kill that man. Thy will Be done and there's an amen to it.

Blood coursing from the hole in his head, frenzied messages flickering all through his shattered brain, going only on pure hate, Ringo stumbles and jerks, struggling to raise his pistol. Doc dances in front of him, urging him on:

But finally Ringo falls over into the crook of the oak tree, his pistol firing into the air harmlessly. Doc looks down at him, shaking his head:

	Oh Johnny. You're no daisy, no Daisy at all.

Doc looks at him like he's a fool then points to Ringo:

Vermillion and Johnson are mounted, watching while Doc tries to climb up into the saddle with excruciating slowness. Though on his feet, it's clear Doc is as sick as ever, sweating and panting, running on sheer animal courage. Wyatt stands behind him, his hands poised to help, trying to will him into the saddle, jerking his hands behind him every time Doc looks back. Finally, with a last grunt, Doc throws a leg over his horse and drops into the saddle. Wyatt mounts, turns to his men, pointing:

Now Wyatt's men break into a dead run, hurtling toward them at top speed, their thoroughbreds eating up the distance, now only 100 yards away. The Cowboys tense up more and more, biting lips, grinding teeth. The 4th Cowboy turns to the nearby 3rd Cowboy:

The others keep going, leaving him behind. But seeing Wyatt bearing down on him, Ike finally bolts himself, pounding off hell-for-leather into the hills. Wyatt and his men keep coming at a full gallop and as they crest the rise, suddenly, as before, the ground seems to fall out from under them and for another burning moment they once again appear airborne, grim-faced avenging angels on winged horses, now even more majestic in the twilight, like a myth made flesh, awesome, superb, and unutterably beautiful. As they approach, only Breakenridge remains, giving them a tentative wave. Wyatt points a finger at him as they ride by in a flash, cresting another rise and passing into legend....

Wyatt stares into his eyes, letting this sink in. Just then, Doc looks up, as if something were pressing on him. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wyatt, please, if you were ever My friend, if you ever had even The smallest feeling for me, Leave. Leave now. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other and something passes between them, something so personal and powerful it transcends emotion. Wyatt starts to speak, but:
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never mind, Wyatt. I know. Just go.
	</DIALOGUE>

Doc turns away. Wyatt exits. Doc looks over at Father Feeney:

Father Feeney nods, picking up his Missal. As he starts to intone the Last Rites, Doc looks down at the end of the bed and sees his feet poking through the sheets. They are bare. Doc smiles:

Josephine and her fellow chorines, including the 1st Actress from before, all in various stages of undress, sit at the long mirror, removing their make-up and chatting:

<1ST_ACTRESS>

Suddenly the door bursts open. Screams and stunned reaction. Wyatt rushes in and goes to Josephine who sits in stunned silence. He falls to his knees and grabs the hem of her robe.

<JOSEPHINE>

	Wyatt! My God...

INT./EXT. - TRAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brilliant sunlight, clean, crisp air as a train hurtles through a pass high up in the Rocky Mountains, blowing its whistle and sending a giant plume of steam billowing up over the sheer, towering, snow-topped mountain walls into the crystal-clear sky above. Wyatt leads Josephine by the hand through the parlor car, both hardly able to contain themselves, brimming over with excitement and anticipation, like children waiting for Christmas morning and trying to ignore the group of REPORTERS dogging their footsteps, swarming around them, calling out to Wyatt:
</DIRECTION>
<1ST_REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr Earp! One minute, please! You And your four men have just Accomplished in one week what it Took the Texas Rangers four years To do. Please, do you have any comment?
	</DIALOGUE>
</1ST_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
Wyatt and Josephine hunch down and duck through a knot of porters into the next car. Only the 1st Reporter gives chase. Moving into the passenger car furthest forward, Wyatt leads her through the door to the platform over the coupling between cars. Chugging up a steep grade toward a high crest, the train is immersed in shadows. Wyatt points ahead to the approaching crest:
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There. It'll come up over that ridge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
Inside meanwhile, the 1st Reporter comes through the car and spots them up. A business-type PASSENGER tugs on his sleeve:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PASSENGER What's the commotion? Who are they?
</DIRECTION>
<1ST_REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you know? That's Wyatt Earp, the Lion of Tombstone, and His lady fair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</1ST_REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
Outside, still bathed in shadows, Wyatt and Josephine hang onto the railing and lean out, watching in as the train nears the top.
</DIRECTION>
<WYATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get ready, here it comes! Here it comes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WYATT>
<DIRECTION>
Then, as if on cue, they crest the mountain and are suddenly bathed in golden sunlight, their heads leaning from the train, Wyatt's blonde hair and Josephine's black tresses flowing in the breeze, their faces luminous, looking straight ahead toward their future. Hold on this image as the sun gets brighter and brighter, finally making the frame white-out as we....

	Wyatt Earp died in Los Angeles in 1929. Among the pallbearers at his funeral were early western movie stars William S. Hart and Tom Mix.
	</DIALOGUE>
</V_O_NARRATION>
<DIRECTION>
Flickering images from early Hollywood silent films split the frame: on one side the grim but impassioned figure of William S. Hart, the original western good-badman crouched menacingly behind a pair of sixguns, his costume dusty and severe; and on the other side Tom Mix, the original western fantasy hero, so light-hearted and optimistic with his sunny grin and fancy white outfit....
