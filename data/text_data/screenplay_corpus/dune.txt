Suddenly a GUARD enters from a small door and quickly crosses to ANOTHER GUARD. A warning SOUND begins. The Emperor turns nervously. Guards quickly begin to clear the large room. Several women are rushed toward us to a door beyond. One of the woman, IRULAN, stops and turns back for a worried, caring look to her father, the Emperor.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the Emperor's chamber, the TANK-SUITED GUILDSMEN are arranging themselves in a "V" formation around the box. Suddenly the box opens, slowly and beautifully revealing a huge, thick glass tank. Inside the tank floats a THIRD STAGE NAVIGATOR twenty feet long, much like a cross between a pasty, pale human being and a fleshy grasshopper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tank is filled with swirling orange spice-gas, and Guildsmen continuously vacuum up the toxic chemical spills dripping from under the tank. Suddenly the Guild Navigator swims towards the Emperor. His head is enormous and fleshy, like a huge grasshopper head -- the eyes are totally deep blue. His voice is a high, fleshy whispering and an intricate electrical apparatus in the front of the tank translates into English and broadcasts it into the room.

House Atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain.

Paul smiles up at his father. The WIND blows the Duke's hair and behind him stands the castle and the green and black Atreides banner against the night sky beyond. The RAIN starts again -- lightly. Paul takes a closer look at the Atreides banner moving in the wind.

Jessica leaves the room. The Reverend Mother speaks to Paul using The Voice, a Bene Gesserit training which permits an adept to control others merely by selected tone shadings of the voice.

The surface of the planet is a vast sea of black oil. A small cable car traverses high above the sea toward a gigantic black city in the shape of a rectangular box over 100 stories high.

In front of a huge steam boiler, the cable car stops and Piter gets out, steps down steel stairs and enters a porcelain room where the Baron is being treated by a DOCTOR for sores on his face and body. The doctor uses a lasbeam on a big sore on the Baron's lips. The Baron is sickly and hugely fat and sweaty and looks like he has been sickly for some time. He turns to Piter as he enters the room.

Rabban breaks open a squood (living food). The squood makes a tiny SCREAM, then Rabban drinks the blood and bodily fluids. He throws the empty container of tiny animal meat into the dark water trough running through the center of the room. Across the room, TWO HARKONNEN SOLDIERS enter, holding big guns on a BOY who is wearing white pants. The Baron smiles when he sees the boy, who is deeply afraid. The guards force the boy to arrange violet flowers on a stand by the far wall opposite the Baron.

	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<DIRECTION>
The Baron gives a hand signal and seven gates in the wall open, emitting tremendous SOUNDS. Suddenly the Baron begins to float straight up, twenty-five feet in the air. It is a frightening sight. He floats down under the giant, humming electrical tube light and rubs his head and body with a black fluid which drips from tiny holes in either side of the pink glow. Feyd and Rabban watch nervously. The Attendants stand completely still with fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Baron swoops down to the Boy, who stands petrified. The Harkonnen guards smile nervously as they step slightly backwards. The boy begins SCREAMING as the Baron pulls the boy's heart plug, located in his chest. The violet flowers are bumped and disarrayed by the violence which ensues. Then the Baron turns smiling to Feyd as the SOUNDS continue to roar.

INT. CONTROL ROOM - HEIGHLINER - SPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We pass through electrical shields into a 2,000-foot high control room filled with orange spice gas. On the floor are large gratings covering an exhaust and filtering system. Tons of spice gas are being converted into the clouds of gas along a wall of machinery. From within a dark metal tunnel comes a Guild Navigator. He exits the tunnel and swims through the gas 1,000 feet to a six-dimensional layered miniature replica of the entire Universe. The Navigator emits a long piece of light from his mouth which travels to one edge of the Universe and changes into a likeness of the planet Caladan. The Navigator turns and emits another piece of light which travels to the opposite side of the Universe. It changes into a likeness of Arrakis. The Navigator begins to put his slender fingers in amongst the stars and he emits SOUNDS and bursts of light into the mass of stars and galaxies. The Universe begins to vibrate and elongate, then to curve. Electrical lightening traverses from Caladan to Arrakis as the Universe bends into a U-shape. Arrakis submerges deep into the light. The navigator swims to the point where Arrakis disappeared. He begins to pull and tear a hole in the Universe. Stars like sparks and SOUNDS and rings of light appear, along with a roaring WIND. The Navigator swims deep into this hole through the rings of light. The Navigator becomes more and more transparent, until he's lost in darkness. The sounds fade.

Gurney and a squad of TROOPERS climb through bodies and thick smoke. Gurney has the Duke's dog safely inside his coat. The little dog's head sticks out -- looking about. Gurney strokes the dog's neck when the reach safety behind some rock. Small glimpses, as the smoke moves this way or that, let them see thousands of Sardaukar fighting.

Rabban stops up the ramp. He wears a large smile. His thick head sweats and sweat runs down his thick neck. He goes inside and the doors swing closed.

INT. HARKONNEN SHIP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He enters the ship and moves down within to the Baron's headquarters, passing two dwarves cooking a dead legless cow which hangs from chains. Rabban tears out the cow's tongue and eats it. Then he exits through a door which closes behind him.

INT. BARON'S QUARTERS - HARKONNEN SHIP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Baron is flying wildly, circling the outside of a large steel shower, while Nefud and a DWARF play a strange instrument producing maniacal, perverse, screaming MUSIC. The Baron SEES Rabban enter, but continues to fly around the shower.

The Baron floats to Rabban and begins lovingly massaging Rabban's massive neck as he speaks to him.

<BARON>

	Rabban, Rabban... I place you in charge of Arrakis. It's yours to squeeze, as I promised. I want you to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze.

Another burst of LIGHTNING. The distant rock seems to have grown no larger. Their muscles begin to ache. Suddenly they HEAR the thumper start behind them.

EXT. DEEP DESERT AND ROCKS - NIGHT (LATER)

Their breathing becomes very labored. The sand moves like slow water, forever rolling down and up. Then they hear the worm, the low thundering HISS shaking the tonnage of sand. The thumper stops. Paul turns.

A flash of LIGHTNING. The worm is now coming toward them. The mound of sand over the worm is enormous and is approaching at a terrifyingly fast speed. The power of this worm is awesome.

All at once their feet tromp down on firmer sand. The SOUND is very loud.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drum sand!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
The DRUMMING sound ECHOES deep within the ground. Jessica falls. Paul stops and drags her up. They run again. The worm SOUND becomes unbearably loud. Static electricity SPARKS giant bolts of pure white LIGHTNING and the air turns to ozone. Finally they find rock. Behind them the SOUND of the worm changes. They turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WORM - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

The gigantic head of the worm is just breaking through the sand. The mouth begins to open in an eighty-foot circle of teeth and darkness. The mouth arches forward searching for them.

Still the worm stretches up to them. Suddenly the worm begins BANGING on the rock. Huge SHUDDERS drive through the black stone. Over and over again the worm mindlessly hits at the rock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Paul and Jessica crouch further back in the tiny passageway of safety, but a solid back wall of rock prevents them from moving back any more.

The worm now can get even closer to Paul and Jessica. It looms up again and crushes its mouth up against the rock.

Another fissure opens, and suddenly half the rock wall protecting them splits off entirely and falls... taking Paul with it.

Paul is knocked off the cliff and falls straight down two hundred feet. His feet skid along the face of rock. He bounces and brakes. He hits and jumps. He careens from one boulder, flies upside down, rights himself then tumbles and skids into the sand. Unhurt, he jumps up and scrambles up another part of the rock to safety.

They climb upwards until the ledge ends at the mouth of a dark crevice. Paul and Jessica try to see into the inky black hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CREVICE - DEEP DESERT - NIGHT

Slowly Paul and Jessica enter, inching forward. A low moan of WIND comes up. Paul can see nothing, then suddenly he SEES stars above and SEES the hint of stairs cut into the rock.

A LOW NOTE on a dip stick is blown by one of the Fremen tribe. Jessica shifts, Paul sees it, and just as Stilgar begins a reach for his weapon, Jessica turns, slashes out, utters a SOUND, whirls again and with rock behind her holds Stilgar helpless in front of her -- her hand at his throat. Paul moves on her first move. He races up a rocky incline.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fremen carry the Fremen REVEREND MOTHER RAMALLO in on a litter. The old Reverend Mother is old a frail yet extremely beautiful and mysterious. She turns to Paul and Jessica with a strange look.
</DIRECTION>
<REVEREND_MOTHER_RAMALLO>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jessica, in an ancient voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you are the ones.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REVEREND_MOTHER_RAMALLO>
<DIRECTION>
She turns away towards the monks who are very busy blowing horns and waving pots of burning spice, purifying the area of the rite. Several Fremen blow on dip sticks and a FEMALE CHOIR begins a haunting chorale as the giant pipe organ blows beautiful low notes below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul looks to his mother.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He then sees Chani.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU Chani.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU Paul -- he cannot stop looking at her.

<DIRECTION>
Stilgar motions to Paul.
</DIRECTION>
<STILGAR>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know the Water of Life?... Come... ...Watch... the mystery of mysteries... the end and the beginning.

</STILGAR>
<DIRECTION>
He shows Paul through a narrow passageway -- almost a slot through the stone to a small room. Through an opening in the stone wall, Paul is shown a very strange and somewhat horrifying scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BABY WORM - MAKER ROOM - SIETCH TABR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A thirty-foot baby worm is being lowered into a stone chamber. The chamber is then covered with a wire top. Valves are turned and water rushes into the chamber. The worm begins to writhe violently and leap and bang against the bars above. The worm begins to turn inside out from the mouth back and it begins to gag. Some monks and watermasters quickly drain the stone chamber and wrench the worm out using large steel hooks. They hold the worm above a large tub. A watermaster-reed man runs a long reed in to the worm, causing it to spasm and gag up a beautiful deep blue bile as it dies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Then we HEAR from Paul's memory his conversation with the Reverend Mother:
</DIRECTION>
<REVEREND_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Many men have tried.
	</DIALOGUE>

<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>

Stilgar and Paul return to the ledge above the Hall of Rites. A MONK PRIEST steps forward, addresses the crowd, silencing them. The other monks move back carrying their smoking cleansing bags.
</DIRECTION>
<MONK_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One among us has consented to enter the rite. She will attempt to pass within that we not lose the strength of our Reverend Mother.

She swallows. Her body contorts and spasms violently. She screams. The Reverend Mother screams with her.
</DIRECTION>

We see Jessica sitting, shoulders tight and spasming -- straining, her eyelids half-closed and flickering.

The old Reverend Mother slowly extends a hand toward Jessica's shoulder.

<DIRECTION>
JESSICA - MENTAL IMAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside Jessica, we see the Reverend Mother Ramallo's hand descend through the dark void. Shimmering water starts to ripple, lightly stirring an image of Jessica.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the hand penetrates, something deep within her starts to GLOW. It is a fetus, a female. The Reverend Mother Ramallo's hand flinches as it touches the fetus. The fetus sparks to life - screaming and rapidly spasming upwards on its umbilical cord.

INT. THE TUNNEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jessica and the fetus rush mentally through a dark strangely worm-like tunnel until suddenly, a gaping black hole appears. A horrible WIND, SPARKS and circles of expanding light issues from it.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSICA>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O) (inner voice)(fearful)

<DIRECTION>
The fetus twists down the tunnel to join Jessica, her umbilical cord trailing behind. She SCREAMS as she looks into the hole.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She and Jessica see a shape moving deep within the windy hole. It is a Third Stage Navigator, ROARING.

The old Reverend Mother Ramallo slumps forward onto the stone, dead. The crowd waits. The corpse is tenderly removed. Jessica very slowly opens her eyes and looks about her. The monk holds the jug to her lips.
</DIRECTION>
<MONK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Change it that we may all drink of it.

Jessica spews water into the spout. The monk swirls the jug, sniffs at the spout and then drinks.

	Oh Thufir, I see they've installed your heart plug already.... Don't be angry. Everyone gets one here. But this is not why we're here. We've brought you a little cat, Thufir. You must care for it if you wish to live. A poison has been introduced into you, Thufir Hawat.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Two thumpers are planted. The worm may not surface for the first - he will rise for the second. Remember, when the worm approaches, you must be utterly still... and close enough to plant the hook firmly under a ring segment.... The worm will turn to lift this exposed area as far from the abrasive sand as possible and it will take you with it -- to the top. Do not get too close as he approaches... the sand will engulf you.... Wait till the head of the worm passes -- then go... quickly.

EXT. WORM - DEEP DESERT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...a mountain of sands rise up, towering, thundering -- lightning SPARKS fissuring throughout the air above the worm.

The mountain approaches at a terrifying speed. Then, the worm appears -- rushing. The mouth, at first a small opening, begins to widen -- exposing a thousand glistening teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul freezes. He lets the worm get closer and closer. The HEAT WAVES distort the gigantic form, making it more hideous -- more foreign. He moves forward. The others watch anxiously. This worm is big. It is so much larger than imaged. Its top towers 125 feet in the air. The segments are each ten feet wide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VERTICAL SECTION OF WORM - DESERT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul gets close and running alongside, he plants the hook under a segment and pulls back. The SOUND is excruciatingly loud. The sand is so deep and more is being thrown out beneath the body of the worm. Paul gets caught in it and falls. He narrowly escapes being sucked under the beast. He gets up -- runs again and plants the hook once more. He runs faster, bending the segment open to expose the tender flesh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FULL-SIZE SECTION OF WORM - DESERT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the worm begins to turn. Paul pulls himself up the body as it turns -- holding onto the hook. Soon he is fifty -- sixty -- seventy feet off the ground -- going higher. The giant worm gets the second thumper and Paul at that moment climbs to the top. He plants the second hook.

	You know what I'm about to say is true.... I have the power to destroy the spice forever.

The Guild Navigator's mouth stretches back in a horrible MOAN. The moan becomes more pained and grows louder and louder.

INT. GREAT HALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Guildsmen in the room are MOANING and SCREAMING and swarming out towards the doorway -- the Fremen stop them. The Emperor and all are amazed and frightened. There is a long hush. The old Reverend Mother then turns and glares at Paul.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't try your powers on me. Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there staring back at you!! You Bene Gesserit have waited ninety generations to produce the one person your schemes required. Here I stand. But... I will never be yours.

<REVEREND_MOTHER>

	Stop him, Jessica!

<JESSICA>

	Stop him yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JESSICA>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You saw a part of what the race needs in the beginning. In time you perverted the truth. You sought to control human breeding and intermix a select few according to a selfish master plan. How little you understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<REVEREND_MOTHER>

	You mustn't speak of...

The old woman is shot backwards by the power of his shout. Her breath is knocked out of her.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember your gom jabbar, now you remember mine. I can kill with a word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
A Fedaykin stand forward and recites from the prophecy.
</DIRECTION>
<FEDAYKIN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and his word shall carry death eternal to those who stand against the righteous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEDAYKIN_1>
<DIRECTION>
Feyd hears this and is angered.
</DIRECTION>
<FEYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The righteous!

(to Emperor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is a Harkonnen among you. Give the Harkonnen a blade and let him stand forth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<EMPEROR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If Feyd wishes, he can meet you with my blade in his hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMPEROR>
<FEYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish it.

	This is a Harkonnen animal. Let me, please, my Lord.

<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Emperor's blade.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Feyd takes up the Emperor's blade with a smile. Paul takes out his crysknife. They begin to circle each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul smiles, circling still. Suddenly, Feyd leaps, his blade jabbing savagely outward, but Paul easily evades it, moving away. They begin to circle again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He makes another pass at Paul that comes dangerously close, but again, Paul is away, a frozen smile on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<FEYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why prolong the inevitable? I will kill you! I will kill him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEYD>
<DIRECTION>
Feyd smiles. He lashes out biting Paul's hand. Feyd LAUGHS in triumph.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Feyd leaps forward jabbing, his right hip also forward. Yet Paul, although a little slowly, again reels away. Again, Feyd thrusts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This time Paul jabs with his crysknife, but Feyd moves away effortlessly. Feyd counters and kicks Paul to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<CHANI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul!

</CHANI>
<DIRECTION>
Paul is up instantly and he circles with Feyd.
</DIRECTION>
<FEYD>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is the little one? A pet, perhaps? Will she deserve my special attentions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEYD>
<DIRECTION>
Paul jabs out, his crysknife slashing. Feyd grabs his arm, and Paul his, the two men locked in a straining clinch. Feyd presses his right hip closer and closer to Paul's body. Paul strains to keep it away. Suddenly, the gom jabbar flips out of Feyd's girdle, but on the left side, and he lunges powerfully with it at Paul, who just barely misses taking it in his skin. He throws Feyd back, but not before Feyd's feet strike out, sending Paul to the floor. Feyd leaps onto him.
</DIRECTION>
<FEYD>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see... your death... my blade will finish you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEYD>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Paul, with lightning swiftness, pushes Feyd up and over. He is on top of him in a flash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul's crysknife flashes up, thrusting upward through Feyd's jaw. Feyd's mouth opens as the knife continues up through his tongue and through to his brain. Feyd's eyes go wild, then glaze over as he jerks dead on the floor. Paul slowly gets to his feet, breathing heavily. Anger still seething in him, Paul issues a SOUND -- a loud, horrible, powerful sound, and Feyd's internal organs rupture and the stone floor under him cracks open. The Fedaykin smile.
</DIRECTION>

Everyone stares in disbelief. Paul looks to the Emperor.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, I will tell you how it will be. Irulan shall be my wife, opening the way for an Atreides to take the throne.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<EMPEROR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sit on the throne!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMPEROR>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will sit on a throne on Selusa Secundus, your prison planet. Either that or you will die.

The Emperor is still. Paul moves to Chani.

<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (to Chani)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Princess shall have no more of me than my name... no child of mine or touch the softness of glance... nor instant of desire.... This is my promise to you...

	<DIALOGUE>
	...my love.

Paul turns back to the others.

<DIRECTION>
Jessica turns to Chani and whispers to her.
</DIRECTION>
<JESSICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think on it Chani... We who carry the name of concubine... history will call us wives.

Alia enters with two monks. She signals and one of them places a cloak over Paul's shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Fremen have the word of Muad'dib. They will have their Holy War to cleanse the Universe... they will have Arrakis... Dune... their planet. There will be flowing water here open to the sky and rich green oases. For the spice there will always be some desert. There will be fierce winds and trials to toughen men. We Fremen have a saying...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he stares at the Reverend Mother)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"God created Arrakis to train the faithful." One cannot go against the word of God.

Everyone in the room stares at him soundlessly.
</DIRECTION>
<ALIA>
	<DIALOGUE>

EXT. ARRAKEEN PALACE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul opens his mouth and issues an ever increasing wind. Lightning and thunder begin. Clouds begin to form over the Palace. In the half-light of dusk, thousands of Fremen watch the sky. Giant golden lights are illuminated and their rays shoot far into the sky illuminating the growing clouds. Five tremendous bolts of lightning suddenly unleash a downpour of RAIN ON ARRAKIS. The Fremen stand awestruck as they are drenched with water falling from the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GREAT HALL - ARRAKEEN PALACE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE MOVE through Paul's glowing blue eyes into beautiful blue luminescent light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gigantic WIND arises, and suddenly appearing in the blue light is an ocean of light rolling like gold glass off into infinite. The blue becomes darker and a golden lotus flower blooms in the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
