<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OPENING CREDIT SEQUENCE. Images and sounds are surreal, dreamlike, disturbing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HAND is trying to dial three simple numbers. Trembling fingers miss, try again...we hear boop-boop-boop.
</DIRECTION>
<911_OPERATOR>
<DIRECTION>
(filtered)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	911 operator, what is your emergency?
	</DIALOGUE>
</911_OPERATOR>
<DIRECTION>
The phone rises, gripped tightly. Knuckles white. We're TIGHT, it's dark, we see no face -- just slack, trembling lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whoever it is, he can't talk. All we hear is breathing, all we sense is grief and panic and deep shock.
</DIRECTION>
<OPERATOR>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (filtered)

	<DIALOGUE>

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lights appear like phantoms over blacktop, flashing. Police cars coming our way.
</DIRECTION>
<OPERATOR>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, what is the nature of your emergency?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
The man can't speak.

INT. HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON PHONE AND MOUTH:
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...her eyes...she can't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POLICE VEHICLES converge in SLOW-MOTION, dreamlike. Doors fly open, COPS jump out, weapons drawn as WE MOVE with them to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Front door. RAMP TO NORMAL CAMERA SPEED as it opens, revealing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BENSON CLYDE, phone still gripped. He barely registers the weapons aimed at his face. CAMERA CLOSES IN ON HIM, as:
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She can't...close her eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
He's pulled from frame. CAMERA KEEPS MOVING, following COPS into the house...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark as hell inside. And tense. Arms training weapons. Moving up a tight hallway, emerging into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...where the flashlight beams find blood-spatter patterns. Furniture shattered and overturned. A kid's sneaker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flashlights play across TWO BODIES in the wreckage -- a woman's pale hand, a child's motionless leg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA DRIFTS AROUND to the cops' faces, as:
</DIRECTION>
<COP_1>
<DIRECTION>
(unsnaps shoulder radio)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dispatch, we have multiple 10-55s,
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_1>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE (SLO-MO) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chaotic now, vehicles and lights. The eye of the storm is Clyde on the lawn, hugging his knees, fetal with horror and grief. He's screaming at the sky, but no sound is coming out. EMS TECHS enter shot, steal the frame, race toward the door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE (SLO-MO) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING SHOT at floor level, photos being taken. FLASHES bathe the foreground wreckage. FORENSIC TECHS step gingerly. Uniformed cops hang grimly back, hugging the walls...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA BRINGS US TO CLOSEUP: A PROFILE IN DEEP SHADOW in the foreground, face tilted obliquely in the wreckage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CAMERA FLASH reveals the face with shocking glare and the IMAGE FREEZES. A TEN YEAR-OLD GIRL, eyes open, staring at us.
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (prelap)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her eyes. That's how they were. Open like that. You see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CITY HALL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde is seated, speaking slowly and precisely. ANGLE WIDENS, revealing the room, light filtering through blinds, as:
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I found my wife and child dead, my little girl's eyes were open.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The last thing she saw of this earth were the faces of the men who took her life. Can you understand that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Yes, I can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you? Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks to somebody else)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<CANTRELL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Clyde. I don't see this helping.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No? You married? Children?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE HAS NOW WIDENED/DRIFTED to include D.A. JONAS CANTRELL, Senior Attorney for the State. He wears thick glasses and is suffering the early stages of macular degeneration.
</DIRECTION>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Divorced. I have a son and daughter. Both in college.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My daughter was ten. I married late in life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde spreads the crime scene photos further on the table. ANGLE COMES AROUND to reveal the third man in the room:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK PRICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The D.A. under Cantrell -- focused, exceptional at what he does, the man you'd want on your side.
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You, Mr. Price? Married? Kids?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick doesn't answer, stays focused on the task:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've seen the crime scene photos, Mr. Clyde. Many times. They're horrifying. But they don't alter the facts of the case.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Facts? Those men are guilty. Both of them. You know they are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't about what we know. It's about what we can prove in court.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Things have gone against us. Tainted crime scene, evidence thrown out...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you just haven't tried hard enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. We've had only one real break in this case. The fact that one asshole has decided to testify against the other asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In return for immunity. So he gets away with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The other man doesn't. He'll go down for the crime. That has to count for something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. It counts for half.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause, quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't reward one of the men who murdered my family. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Clyde. I can't claim to know what it's like to be in your position. Losing your wife and child. But please try to grasp how limited our options are. This is how the justice system works.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde sits for a long moment, numb, absorbing this.
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah. I see my mistake. I came for justice. Instead I got a system.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CITY HALL - HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARAH LOWELL, fresh out of law school, is waiting anxiously for the meeting to end, arms full of file folders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With her is BILL REYNOLDS, the defense attorney in this case, glancing impatiently at his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde exits the room fast, not watching where he's going, accidentally plowing into Sarah as he passes.
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. My fault.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
On he goes. Nick and Cantrell exit the room.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're due upstairs in three minutes! You're gonna be late!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, voice of doom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
They move toward the elevators with Reynolds. Sarah's at their heels, sensing the tension and keeping her mouth shut.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(to Cantrell)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We doing the right thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<REYNOLDS>
<DIRECTION>
(jumps in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You even doubt it? C'mon, you didn't just tumble off the fucking truck. Do the math...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<DIRECTION>
Cantrell has trouble seeing the elevator button, misses. Nick presses it for him. (This is thrown away without comment; both men are used to Cantrell's bad eyes by now.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They elevator opens, they get on...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and ride up:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's your office.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's your decision.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<DIRECTION>
Nick shoots him a withering look, glances back at Sarah.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you asking her for? She's just an intern.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
(deer in the headlights)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am just an intern.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were top of your class at Yale, don't give me that shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Young lady. Someday you might have our jobs. You know the issues of the case before the court. Speak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Um. You can take both men to trial, spend a year and millions of taxpayer dollars, and probably lose. Or you can cut a deal and at least put one of the men who did the crime on death row. It's a no-brainer. You make the deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<REYNOLDS>
<DIRECTION>
(smug, to the men)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Duh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<DIRECTION>
They trade a look. Cantrell glances to Sarah.
</DIRECTION>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When the day comes that you argue a real case in court, you might refrain from summing up with "duh."
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll avoid that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JUDGE'S CHAMBERS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUDGE LAURA BURCH presides. Nick, Cantrell, Sarah are present. CLARENCE DARBY is the focus, Bill Reynolds at his side.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE_BURCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The agreement has been vetted by both sides? Satisfactory to all?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE_BURCH>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, your Honor. Defense approves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	State also approves, your Honor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<DIRECTION>
Nick places a document before DARBY, along with a pen.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clarence Darby. This document guarantees that you will provide testimony against Rupert Ames in the matter of which you were both accused. In return, you will be shielded from further prosecution for those capital crimes. But you will plead guilty to the lesser charge of breaking and entering.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll do a maximum of five years. With good behavior, you could be out in three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<JUDGE_BURCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That also depends on your testimony and the level of your cooperation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE_BURCH>
<DARBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Honor need not worry on my account. I assure the court that I am aware of the opportunity I've been given. And I am deeply grateful to all concerned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARBY>
<DIRECTION>
Nick gives Cantrell a glance, both stoically enduring this proceeding. Darby pulls the document closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DARBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I may. It has come to my attention that Rupert Ames has been spreading lies about me to the tabloid press. About certain alleged activities of which I have no knowledge. Sexual and otherwise. Libel and slander...yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARBY>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(dryly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can always sue him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DARBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, no matter. My tongue will wag in court, under oath. His tongue will wag in hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARBY>
<DIRECTION>
He puts pen to paper, looks to Nick.
</DIRECTION>
<DARBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll get the chair?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARBY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't do chair. We do needle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CITY HALL - GRAND INTERIOR STAIRCASE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cathedral-like, pigeons fluttering. The door from the hallway opens and BETSY, a months-old GERMAN SHEPHERD PUPPY, bounds toward us on a leash pulling Cantrell toward the top of the vast marble staircase. Nick trails them, nervous as hell:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa, Jonas, take my elbow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not blind. Yet. I'll do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're shitty on stairs. At least let me take the leash so the dog doesn't pull you down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. She needs to imprint on me. Not you, not somebody else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<DIRECTION>
Cantrell starts down. Nick's at his side, hovering and ready to grab him, jumping at every little lurch Cantrell makes.
</DIRECTION>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the whole point of this phase. She needs to get the idea that she and I are partners. Then the real training can begin. Unless you wanna lead me around the rest of my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll pass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COURTHOUSE STEPS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick and Cantrell emerge into daylight and find Darby in the protective custody of a FEDERAL MARSHAL on the courthouse steps, surrounded by a crush of REPORTERS:
</DIRECTION>
<DARBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...it was a burglary gone wrong. We thought the house was empty. Rupert found the woman and child at home and went crazy. I was stoned and in fear of my own life, so I fled...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARBY>
<DIRECTION>
They catch sight of Bill Reynolds, the defense attorney.
</DIRECTION>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bill! You let all your clients give testimony on the courthouse steps?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hellooo, kettle to pot. Since when do you shy away from publicity?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since everything in this case has gone sideways so far. Tell your boy to save it for the courtroom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's your boy too now. You tell him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<DIRECTION>
Reynolds proceeds down the steps...
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dickwad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuckface.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<DIRECTION>
...and vanishes in the crowd. Nick glances sourly toward Darby.
</DIRECTION>
<DARBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and may I say for the record how very sorry I am that I failed to prevent Rupert Ames from committing those terrible crimes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARBY>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You good here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Long as nobody bumps into me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA FOLLOWS Nick through the crowd toward Darby...
</DIRECTION>
<DARBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...been given a chance to put the drugs and foul living behind me. To atone for my past failings and weakness of character. It is a gift given me by God's grace...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARBY>
<DIRECTION>
Darby sees Nick, grabs his hand, shaking it for the cameras.
</DIRECTION>
<DARBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and the grace and wisdom of this court. I cannot thank you enough, sir. I cannot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARBY>
<DIRECTION>
A BARRAGE OF CAMERA FLASHES. Nick caught off guard before the press, Darby not letting go. Then Nick sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde, a tiny defeated figure far below, waits at the bus stop. He's gazing up, seeing this photo op happen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
breaks the handshake with a flush of discomfort, signals the federal marshal:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marshal, escort your man, please!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the reporters)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Darby is done here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Darby is hustled down the steps. The reporters surge to Nick, surrounding him, shouting questions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick looks over their heads and glimpses Clyde getting on a bus. The door closes, the bus pulls away...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NICK'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick enters. Dark. He drops his briefcase by the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REFLECTED IN THE MIRROR: KELL, Nick's wife, is just out of the bath, wearing a robe and toweling her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick enters behind her. She cranes back for a kiss, keeps toweling her hair in the mirror. He hugs her from behind, buries his face in her neck. Drained.
</DIRECTION>
<KELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit day?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELL>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit day. Better now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's she doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. She drove me a little crazy today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELL>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was busy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In overdrive. Here. Feel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELL>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches around, slowly unties her robe, pulls it open...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...revealing her pregnant belly. (Our angles have avoided this till now.) He places his hand, feeling for movement.
</DIRECTION>
<KELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course she stops kicking the moment you get home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOW TRACKING SHOT finds them in bed, Nick with his head on Kell's chest. Pensive.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had to say some things to a man today I didn't want to say. And I did something I didn't want to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't lie to him. Or bullshit him. Or shine him on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELL>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None of those things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you had your reasons. You did what you had to. It's not your fault the world sucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELL>
<DIRECTION>
Nick smiles, eases his face to her belly.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You in there. Listen up. Your mother just said the world sucks. You may wanna rethink this whole thing. My advice? If you're asking? Just stay in there. I promise you, nothing will ever make as much sense as it does right now...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is wrong with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELL>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...plus there's shit you don't need to know about. Rap. Internet porn. Madonna's entire back catalog.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did someone drop you on your head? Seriously. I have swollen ankles and all I do is pee. That baby's coming out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELL>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(weighs that)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. I'm sure you heard that. Then again there are the Beatles. 70's funk. Louie. Ella. Be a shame to miss those.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat, getting serious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, kid. Bring it on. But when you're old enough for the world to disappoint you, I hope you won't blame your old man for bringing you into this mess. Give me that at least.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick and Kell asleep. She's no longer pregnant -- it's now ten years later. A long beat of quiet...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small face peers in from the hallway. EMMA, their 10 year- old daughter. She darts in, puts her face to Nick's.
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh? Wha--?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what it is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
(hollering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	IT'S MY BIRTHDAAAAAY!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
She jumps up on the bed, bouncing up and down and dancing around, hollering at the top of her lungs:
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	IT'S MY BIRTHDAY, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
Nick and Kell are too groggy to do anything but ride it out. Emma sails off the bed and vanishes out the door, hollering all the way up the hallway:
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'M SO COOL IT'S MY BIRTHDAAAY!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
Nick and Kell are left groping with blankets, heart rates, and consciousness:
</DIRECTION>
<KELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Glad it's once a year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN/BREAKFAST AREA - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick and Emma finishing breakfast, getting ready to leave, Kell packing Emma's lunch at the counter:
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why can't you be here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a work thing. Grownup stuff. You know that happens sometimes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>

He claps his hand over her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe we've established that. I let go, you'll stop reminding me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she nods, he lets go)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll celebrate this weekend. Tonight is all about your friends. Knock yourselves out, don't give mom any grief. I'll try to be home in time to tuck you in, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. But what are you doing tonight that is more important than...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
She's doing that "sneakily drawing close" thing again. Nick holds up his finger, cautioning her to say it quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
(leans in, whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...my birthdaaaaay.

</EMMA>
<KELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something he'd get out of if he could. Here. Take lunch. Grab backpack. We go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELL>
<DIRECTION>
Emma grabs her stuff, kisses dad, races from the room. Kell grabs her keys to follow, kisses Nick goodbye.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice evasion. Thanks.

EXT. RURAL ROAD - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cars are traveling an old service road...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOWN CAR - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick's in back with Cantrell. The years have left Cantrell 90% blind; his glasses are beyond Coke bottle-thick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Between them sits Betsy the German shepherd, now ten years old, wearing a guide-dog harness. She looks miserable wearing a big cone-shaped POST-SURGERY COLLAR.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long she have to wear this stupid thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Till the stitches heal. Week or two.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<DIRECTION>
Nick dotes on the dog, they're old pals:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor honey. Sucks, doesn't it? But you're very pretty. Yes, you are. Even with a radar dish on your head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There they are. Like clockwork.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE SHIFTS TO Sarah -- much more confident and power-suited than last time we saw her -- riding up front with the driver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AERIAL ESTABLISHING - GEORGE HILL PRISON - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car pulls up to the gate as CAMERA RISES to reveal the new facility positioned right next to the old one...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The condemned, RUPERT AMES, is placed against the upright execution table and buckled in. The table is tilted back to vertical. All Rupert can do is lay there and watch, as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDICAL TECHS swab his arms with alcohol, prepare the needles, find his veins. The needles are inserted, taped off. The I.V. lines are attached. Very methodical.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The techs leave the room. The curtain is drawn aside, revealing the big window that separates the chamber from:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VIEWING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick and his colleagues are among SEVERAL DOZEN WITNESSES seated in chairs. They watch as WARDEN IGER faces Rupert.
</DIRECTION>
<WARDEN_IGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rupert Ames. Do you have anything to say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARDEN_IGER>
<DIRECTION>
Rupert doesn't have much of an IQ and he's scared shitless, but he does his best:
</DIRECTION>
<RUPERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm here. Clarence Darby ain't. And that ain't right. 'Cause that man is evil, ain't no other way to say it. All them things he done, and him turn witness against me for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUPERT>
<DIRECTION>
He pauses, trying to untangle his thoughts.
</DIRECTION>
<RUPERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did wrong too. I guess I'll pay up. But it was always him sayin' jump and how high, and I just went along. Now he's killin' me and he got you people to do it. And that's a shame. A goddamn shame. And...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and I guess that's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUPERT>
<DIRECTION>
Nick trades a look with Sarah. Cantrell is stoic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Warden Iger nods to TWO GUARDS manning the LETHAL INJECTION MACHINE, on which EIGHT OVERSIZED GLASS CYLINDERS in a vertical row are the main feature, filled with various clear liquids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are two switches -- one a dummy, the other live (no way to know which is which). The guards power up the machine. Lights activate on the board. Each man grabs a switch, waits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick watches the wall clock. It hits 7 o'clock. The warden nods and the guards flick their switches, quickly leaving the room. The warden follows them out, closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the pumps quietly activate. Rupert is taking shallow breaths, terrified...then lays back to wait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLUNGER ONE slowly descends, emptying its contents into the I.V. lines...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rupert sags as the fast-acting barbiturate spreads through his veins...his breathing slows...his head drops back... he loses consciousness...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLUNGER TWO depresses, sending the second vial of liquid into the I.V. lines with a quiet whir of pumps...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLUNGER THREE activates...then PLUNGER FOUR...the row of cylinders emptying in sequence...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rupert lies unconscious, just drifting away...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He suddenly comes to. He draws in a long, shaky breath. It catches in his throat. His eyes go wide. His entire body starts to clench against some increasing pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick is surprised, uncertain. Betsy starts GROWLING SOFTLY at Cantrell's side. Her head comes up, hackles rising.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick glances to the dog...then to Iger, sees the stunned look on the warden's face. Something is definitely wrong.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pumps keep whirring, the plungers keep descending...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rupert he throws his head back, mouth wide...
</DIRECTION>
<RUPERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah...ah...AH!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUPERT>
<DIRECTION>
The witnesses go tense, confused -- what the hell?
</DIRECTION>
<RUPERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah--ah--Jesus, don't that HURT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUPERT>
<DIRECTION>
Rupert looks down at his arms, his expression turning to sheer horror, because: The veins are turning angry red, then blackening, as the liquids course through them...
</DIRECTION>
<RUPERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OH FUCK, OH FUCK, THAT HUUUURTS!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUPERT>
<DIRECTION>
Those are last coherent words he speaks. From then on, he's just shrieking and bouncing against his straps, because:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His veins are starting to smoke. Noxious and foul. The flesh starts giving away, blood eating though skin like acid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shock sweeps the onlookers:
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Jesus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going on? Nick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<DIRECTION>
People are on their feet. Horror and incomprehension.
</DIRECTION>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick, goddamn it, what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Rupert is fast becoming a horror:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's going down his arms and legs, up his neck, infusing his ears -- a nauseating discoloration courses through his body, using his veins as a road map, going from red to yellow to black like bruises birthing spontaneously before our eyes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People in the room scream, turning away. Nick pushes his way to the viewing glass, shouting at the techs:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHAT THE FUCK'S GOING ON? DO SOMETHING!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
The techs dash into the chamber -- but are instantly gagging and choking on the toxic fumes billowing from Rupert. They retreat coughing, pulling the door shut again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rupert's screams spew forth toxic fumes...breath blows smoke from his nostrils...eyes liquefy...he's arching against his restraints so hard that bones begin snapping, blood spewing and smoking through his skin...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All Nick can do is stand at the glass in horror as whatever is happening runs its course and the victim collapses in a cloudy, toxic haze...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRISON YARD - PARKING AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drained and waiting: Nick sitting against the town car. Cantrell across from him with Betsy at his side (the guide dog will always be at his side in this movie, specified or not). EMERGENCY LIGHTS are swirling all around them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PARADE OF PEOPLE descends: DETECTIVE DUNNIGAN, Sarah, Warden Iger, COPS, PRISON STAFF. Intense:
</DIRECTION>
<IGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're still trying to sort through this thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IGER>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen, we face a terrible shitstorm of scrutiny in the days to come. We need answers. Start with what we know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<IGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lethal injection is a series of drugs given in a specific order. Somebody had to have replaced one or more of those ingredients with something else.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off their looks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Industrial solvent? Acid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IGER>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's not guess, let forensics do its job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could the chemicals be switched? We're in a goddamn prison!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll ask because somebody has to. Is there any chance, no matter how remote, that this was an accident? A mix-up? Weird shit happens?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
A beat of awkward silence. The warden hesitating.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show them. The bad part.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PHONE JUNCTION ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dunnigan brings our group in. ELECTRICIANS huddle at an array of circuits and trunk lines. In the dancing flashlight beams:
</DIRECTION>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some kind of bypass on the phone lines.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Nick sees a CIRCUIT-BOARD spliced into the wiring.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty minutes before the execution, the prison stopped receiving incoming calls and emails. Cell service went dark too. Signal was probably jammed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The bad part. I was just on with the Governor's office. He commuted Rupert Ames' sentence. They were trying to call us to stop the execution. They couldn't get through.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
Nick and Cantrell are stunned as this sinks in.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Governor's incoming number triggered this device and shut out any further calls.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Cantrell removes his glasses, rubs his eyes. Softly:
</DIRECTION>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, fuck me. Fuck me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One more thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Dunnigan aims his maglight and swings the junction box cover all the way open. Scrawled on the inside of the door in red are the words: "HIS TONGUE WILL WAG IN HELL."
</DIRECTION>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This mean anything to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PUSHES IN on Nick...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRISON YARD - PARKING AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick's LAPTOP sits on an unmarked car, streaming the D.A.'S DATABASE by wireless. Nick taps the keys, as:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clarence Darby. That's what he said when he agreed to testify against the man we executed tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"His tongue will wag in hell." Those very words? It was ten years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember it too. Some things stick in your head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Check the court transcripts, they're public record.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
DARBY'S MUGSHOT (ten years ago) scans up, along with pertinent info of that time. GARZA, Dunnigan's partner, peers at it.
</DIRECTION>
<GARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know this prick. I'm pretty sure he's one of our C.I.s.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARZA>
<DIRECTION>
Surprised looks are traded.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think, or you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<GARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not the name he uses now. But I'm pretty sure he's one of Bernstein's informants.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARZA>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, raise Bernstein, I want everything he's got, including an address. We roll with tactical.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about I ride-along? Give you a fast, accurate ID on this guy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that necessary?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said yourself we should move fast. This thing'll be all over the morning news cycle. We'd all look a lot better if we have the right man in custody by then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Off Cantrell's look...

EXT. BRIDGE/CITYSCAPE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
AERIAL SHOT: ANGLING DOWN to find a CONVOY OF POLICE VEHICLES speeding across a bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNMARKED CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Garza driving. Dunnigan riding shotgun. Nick in back, putting on a tactical vest. A transmission comes over the car's dashboard computer: a MURKY NIGHTTIME SHOT OF A MAN in sunglasses and Hawaiian shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<GARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's him. "Wayne Dunlap."
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARZA>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that Clarence Darby?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think so. Hard to tell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Dunnigan scrolls the classified police data pertaining to the informant: dates, number of convictions attributed...
</DIRECTION>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, look at this. No wonder Bernstein loves him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<GARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We scored a lot of good intel off this fuckhead through the years. Almost a shame to bag the guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARZA>
<DIRECTION>
A snort from Nick. The cops glance back.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A shame?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<GARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's helped us put a lot of bad people behind bars. Look. Arrests, convictions...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARZA>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can read a C.I. profile. What I see is an asshole dirty up to his ears in the drug trade. So you cops look the other way? He gets a free pass as long as he keeps feeding you convictions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't that what you did ten years ago? Give this guy a free pass in return for a conviction?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Nick's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we played this asshole to our advantage on the street, but you're the one who put him there. So, no offense, but you might wanna go fuck yourself a little.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Nick stares at the man on the dashboard computer screen...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLARENCE DARBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...who is indeed Clarence Darby, naked and drenched with sweat, taking a hit off a crack pipe. A woman's HAND flails up into frame, trying to grab for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DARBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait...wait...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARBY>
<DIRECTION>
He sucks in a full breath, hands the pipe off to: LISA, the thin tattooed skank he's got bent over his bed and is fucking from behind. She flares the bowl with a lighter, barely registering any reaction as he keeps pumping her.
</DIRECTION>
<DARBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Almost. Almost.

</DARBY>
<LISA>

<DIRECTION>
(thrusting, grimacing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you...for stating the obvious...you...bitch...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARBY>
<DIRECTION>
He grits his teeth. Screams. Finishes. He sags, catching his breath, and glances at the PLASMA TV SCREEN, which has been playing silently. He grabs the remote, unmutes the set:
</DIRECTION>
<NEWSCASTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...rumors the execution did not go well due to technical flaws, but that has yet to be confirmed...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEWSCASTER>
<DARBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Did not go well." Way to go, Rupert. You even fucked up dying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARBY>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know that guy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DARBY>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Argue later. Do it now.

Darby goes to the window. Headlights in the distance. Lots of them. He grabs binoculars off the sill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BINOCULAR POV: VEHICLES

All cop. Racing this way. No lights, no sirens.

DARBY

</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a world of shit coming your way. I'd get out the back. Now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Click -- line dead. Darby frozen for a moment, looking around at all the drugs and paraphernalia. He scrambles, tossing on his pants, grabbing his shirt. Lisa jumps off the bed --
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to the window, sees cars sweeping from the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are those fucking cops?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
Darby lunges to a bookcase, grabs a REVOLVER from behind the books, sails out the bedroom door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and races down the steps with Lisa at his heels.
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ain't leaving me here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
She catches him halfway across the room, holding him back. He smashes the gun into her face repeatedly...
</DIRECTION>
<DARBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OFF'A ME!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARBY>
<DIRECTION>
...and knocks her bleeding and crying to the floor. He sails on through the kitchen, leaving her there...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DARBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and bursts through the screen door, fleeing barefoot across the back yard as VEHICLES AND COPS swarm the front of the house. A cruiser nails him with a spotlight:

<COP_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(over car speakers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You! Freeze right there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Darby, never slowing, swings his arm around, FIRING his revolver blindly at all the lights...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT YARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...whoa, fuck, gunshots! Cops scramble and dive. Nick has just gotten out of Dunnigan's car -- a cruiser's window takes a blind hit nearby, exploding glass. Nick ducks, total shock, out of his element. Drawing, Dunnigan throws him to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	STAY DOWN!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BAD NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darby runs like an amped-up rat in a maze, hearing cop cars in the night: Engines ROARING, tires SQUEALING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the SOUND OF A HELICOPTER above. Darby dashes for cover against a garage, lost in shadow. A massively bright searchlight sweeps from above, probing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darby crouches, heart hammering, watching the searchlight scan over rooftops. His phone RINGS, he answers:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ditch the gun. Wipe the prints.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DARBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kiss my ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARBY>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard six shots. Revolver? Bring extra ammo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Darby glances at the gun, realizing. He bangs his head back against the garage wall in frustration -- fuck!
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shot at cops. That's attempted murder if they find the gun on you. You're in deep enough without that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Darby frantically wipes the gun with his shirttail, as:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll need my help getting out.

<DARBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'll it cost me?

</VOICE>
<DARBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARBY>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A cop. Take his ride, he won't give you any trouble.

</VOICE>
<DARBY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</DARBY>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Cause I tasered his ass. You gonna keep asking questions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Click -- line dead. Darby breaks cover, heaves the gun into somebody's yard, keeps moving...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DARBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chaotic with cops and lights. Lisa is dragged out, shrieking and bleeding, her face a broken mess. ANGLE TO Nick watching it all unfold. He sees Dunnigan approach:
</DIRECTION>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way he's getting out of this neighborhood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darby finds a POLICE CRUISER parked in the moonlight, window down. Dark inside. A LOCAL COP is sprawled across the front seat...groaning, coming to.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darby jumps in, passenger side, wrestles the cop upright. He yanks the cop's service revolver, slapping him awake.
</DIRECTION>
<DARBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARBY>
<DIRECTION>
Darby reaches over and keys the engine to life.

The cop hits the gas. Tense moments go by as they accelerate up a dark road. Darby ducks as COP CARS stream past.
</DIRECTION>

Dunnigan and Nick tense, hearing a VOICE over the radio:

</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gotta be kidding me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Dunnigan -- angry, at a loss -- doesn't reply. Cops are scrambling in all directions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick turns, steps TOWARD CAMERA INTO A TIGHT SHOT, gazing off into the darkness. Something very weird just happened here, but he has no idea what. Softly:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could we lose him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INDUSTRIAL ZONE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tracks and factories, remote and deserted. Far away, the POLICE COPTER is still buzzing, searching...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The police cruiser appears, stops. Darby emerges with gun and flashlight leveled, motions for the cop to get out. The cop complies with hands raised, shaking.
</DIRECTION>
<DARBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the ditch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARBY>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...please...don't kill me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<DARBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Knees. Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARBY>
<DIRECTION>
Darby shoves him stumbling into the ditch. The cop sinks to his knees and starts to weep.
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll never see my wife and little girl again. I'll never see them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<DARBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's fucked up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARBY>
<DIRECTION>
Darby steps closer, draws the hammer back, takes aim for a head shot...but his PHONE RINGS. He pulls it fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DARBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This my guardian angel?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARBY>
<DIRECTION>
On his knees in the muck, the cop's quiet weeping becomes soft laughter. He brings up a cell phone, speaks into it:
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see you got out okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<DIRECTION>
Darby draws back, confused, gun still aimed. The cop snaps his cell phone shut, rises to face him.
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know why I'll never see my wife and daughter again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<DIRECTION>
He takes his hat off, peels his moustache away. Darby pins him with the flashlight, finally and fully revealing:
</DIRECTION>
<BENSON_CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You took them from me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENSON_CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
Recognition floods Darby. He pulls the trigger, and:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing. Just a click, Darby freezing, a hiss of pain. Not comprehending.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde reaches for the gun, pries open Darby's fingers, pulls it from his grasp... revealing the TINY NEEDLES that sprang from the pistol's grip into Darby's palm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darby stares at his perforated palm. His knees give out and Clyde catches him, eases him to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FARM SHED - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE: A head encased in a hood. The hood is pulled off, revealing Darby -- eyes wide, lying on a rough table. Benson Clyde leans over him, checks his pupils.
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't speak?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
He displays the prop gun rigged with the needles.
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tetrototoxin. Fascinating stuff. It paralyzes you, but leaves all other neurological functions intact.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
He sets the gun down, starts rooting through some instruments that Darby can't see (though he's straining to).
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That means you can't move. Or talk. But you can see. Hear. Feel.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(busying himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That last one's important. Feel. You can feel everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(glances at bottled drugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got some other items here. Drugs to revive you in case you pass out. Stuff like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
Darby almost manages to speak, thrashing weakly. Clyde leans over, checks his pupils again.
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wearing off a little. No worries.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
He tucks a padded block under Darby's head like a pillow, raising his head so he can see better. Clyde moves down the table, tightens straps holding Darby down. But the worst part:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOURNIQUETS are tied on Darby's arms and legs at various points. Darby sees them and starts hyperventilating.
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. These. Don't want you bleeding out. This will take a while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde puts on a thick coat, like a meat-packer's. He returns, sorting implements, Darby trying to see. Clyde obliges him, holding things up:
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
(pliers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Teeth.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hacksaw)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Balls.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(bolt cutter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fingers. Maybe toes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(scalpel)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eyelids. In case you insist on shutting your eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
Darby's screaming -- but with the tetrototoxin in his system, all that's coming out is air, like a slow leak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde picks up an object, unfolds it -- a full-body plastic coat. He puts it on over his other coat, as:
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Earlier on the phone? I said I'd get you out? You asked me what it would cost? Well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
He finishes buttoning up, crosses back to the table, raises a new object into view: a CIRCULAR POWER SAW.
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll start with an arm and a leg. Go from there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. The reality of what he's about to do washing over him:
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been waiting to say that line for years. But it wasn't very funny, was it? No. Played much better in my head. Maybe it's my delivery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
He puts a construction-site face protector atop his head, the kind with a full plastic face shield that can be flipped down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and undoes the slipknot of a laundry cord stretching up to the ceiling. He feeds the cord and a full-length mirror tilts down horizontally above the table. Darby finds himself staring straight up into it -- he'll see everything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE FROM BEHIND VIDEO CAMERA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA'S LCD SCREEN looms large in our shot. The LCD is dark, the camera inactive. It's mounted high on a tripod, aimed down at the table. Clyde approaches b.g., pauses.
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gosh. My heart's beating. You?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
He flips his visor down -- dark, no face visible. He reaches up, turns the camera on. The LCD screen activates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE CLOSES IN until all we see is:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LCD IMAGE. Grainy in low light. Clyde, now faceless behind the visor, crosses to the squirming figure on the table. We hear the CIRCULAR SAW BUILD TO A HIGH SHRIEK...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and the SHRIEKING SAW FADES...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLD IN BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BLACKNESS OPENS UP -- we're in a cop car's trunk looking up as the lid is opened. A FIGURE in a meat-packing coat looms over us, faceless and scary behind a dark face protector.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INTO TRUNK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reveals OFFICER HILTS hand-cuffed and duct-taped. He's spent the night in here. He recoils, terrified and blinded by glare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLUE - 9-19-08 29A.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure opens a wicked-sharp butterfly knife, CLICK-CLACKS it open. He leans down, slits the tape binding Hilts' arms, drops the keys in the cop's hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRY DIRT ROAD - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The police cruiser sits on a dirt road, a FEMALE DISPATCHER'S VOICE issuing softly and incessantly from the radio:
</DIRECTION>
<FEMALE_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...unit twenty one, come in...unit twenty one, please respond...report your location...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEMALE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The mysterious figure strides from the police cruiser to a MIDNIGHT BLUE 1965 LINCOLN CONTINENTAL in superb condition, shrugging off his thick coat. He gets in, hits the gas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hilts struggles to uncuff himself in the cruiser's trunk, arms and legs cramping, as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lincoln becomes a CLOUD OF DUST receding in the distance...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NICK'S KITCHEN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cleaning up the aftermath of the party: Nick up on a step- stool taking down the birthday banner; Kell in her robe feeding the dishwasher; Emma zooming in and out shuttling paper plates and plastic cups into a big trash bag...
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and while we were singing karaoke, Ashley was all dancing around and jumping up and down and suddenly she gets this look on her face...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<KELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw it coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELL>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and suddenly she just went barf. Total puke moment. And we were all like, ewwww gross! It was so funny...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
She's out of the kitchen to grab more stuff. Kell starts preparing a bowl of cereal for Emma.
</DIRECTION>
<KELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Funny for her. I cleaned it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELL>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had my "ewwww gross" moment last night too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. I had a house full of shrieking ten year-old girls.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELL>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. I saw a guy's veins dissolve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey. It's not a competition.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off his look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, you win.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELL>
<DIRECTION>
Emma re-enters, dumping more trash:
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...so Tara says that's what you get for eating too much cake and that almost made Ashley puke again...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
The DOORBELL RINGS. Kell glances out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<KELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Delivery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELL>
<EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
(grabs her cereal)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
She runs out. Nick comes off the step-stool, gratefully accepts a cup of coffee from Kell. He suddenly freezes, notices:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kitchen TV is playing CNN: a top-of-the-hour story on the Rupert Ames execution and foul-up.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, shit. We've gone national.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the front door, a MESSENGER hands Emma a GIFT BASKET trailing mylar balloons with "Happy Birthday Emma" on them.
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
She closes the door, turns toward us, finds a CARDBOARD ENVELOPE on the basket -- a card? She opens it, finds:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not a card. An unlabeled DVD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRY DIRT ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOCAL SHERIFFS (not city cops) are spreading out across the fields, beating the grass, looking for clues...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE TO Officer Hilts, blanket-draped and still rattled by his night-long ordeal, being interviewed by a SERGEANT:
</DIRECTION>
<SERGEANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...the suspect who tasered you last night...was it the same person who let you out of the trunk this morning?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGEANT>
<HILTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never saw a face...either time...he wore a thing, a face shield...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILTS>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, we hear a DISTANT VOICE shouting in panic:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sergeant! Sergeant!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Everybody's gaze snaps up, tense. Across the fields, a YOUNG COP is stumbling away from a distant farm shed, pointing:
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come quick! You gotta see this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_COP>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NICK'S KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick at the table with Kell, riveted to CNN: STATE OFFICIALS, including Iger, are being grilled in a media frenzy. Cantrell was right, it's a shitstorm of scrutiny...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emma, munching her bowl of breakfast cereal, slots the DVD in the player. She backs up, hits play with the remote.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An IMAGE appears on screen, grainy. Emma looks perplexed. It's not a normal DVD -- more like a bad home movie:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A figure in a plastic coat and face shield turns from the camera to a table, where another man is strapped down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first man raises a circular saw. The man on the table is thrashing weakly, trying to move. Emma still has no idea what she's looking at. Suddenly:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man with the saw makes a quick sweep across the table, across the other man's leg at the shin. The move was so fast and casual that it's taking a moment to sink in:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emma stands frozen, clutching her cereal bowl.
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
B.G., we see Nick lean back in his chair, reacting to her tone of voice...and by what sounds like a shrieking saw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On screen, the man with the saw picks up the severed limb and shows it to the victim. It's been lopped off below the knee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emma drops her bowl -- it shatters at her feet. Nick and Kell enter behind her, confused, not sure what they're seeing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On screen, the man with the saw lops off the victim's forearm.
</DIRECTION>
<KELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELL>
<DIRECTION>
Emma turns, throws herself into her parents' arms. They drop to their knees, shielding their sobbing daughter. PUSH IN ON them staring at the shrieking saw...
</DIRECTION>
<KELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell is this? Jesus Christ, Nick! Turn it off! Turn it off!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(comforting Emma)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay, baby, I'm here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELL>
<DIRECTION>
Nick lunges to turn off the TV as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM THIS POINT ONWARD, WE PLAY THE SEQUENCE AS MONTAGE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FARM SHED - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door is swung open in a blaze of sunlight. The local cops enter with pistols drawn and shotguns leveled. Faces go stark with horror as their eyes adjust.
</DIRECTION>
<SERGEANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my Lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGEANT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. A RENOVATED FARMHOUSE SOMEWHERE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RECORD is pulled from a sleeve. An old-school vinyl LP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FARM SHED - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cops easing in. ANGLE SWINGS QUEASILY AROUND as they enter, WIDENING to reveal a scene of nightmare intensity: Blood everywhere. Streaks. Spatters. And body parts. Strewn and discarded. Intestines nailed to the rafters overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RECORD PLAYER NEEDLE DROPS, hits the groove with a HISS of vinyl. MUSIC STARTS TO PLAY LOUDLY, BOOMING through the space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOCUS REMAINS WITH the spinning record. An OUT-OF-FOCUS FIGURE in a rolling chair pushes away from the record player and sails across the room toward a brightly-lit work table...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FARM SHED - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cops are covering their mouths with handkerchiefs, gagging. The stench is incredible. Flies are buzzing and swarming. One cop turns away and doubles over, trying not to puke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sergeant moves cautiously forward, finds: A HEAD. On the wooden dissection table. Clarence Darby, not that you'd recognize him. His eyes are gone. His lips are missing. His teeth...well, most of them are scattered about.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MINIATURE CIVIL WAR SOLDIER is held in extreme magnification before us under a tabletop magnifier, the tip of a paintbrush delicately evoking stunning detail...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NICK'S HOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emma is still sobbing into her mother's arms as Nick takes the frame f.g., shouting into the phone:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My daughter is traumatized! She's only ten! It's a goddamn snuff film! In my home!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DETECTIVE'S BULLPEN - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)

(motioning O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Price got a video of it happening delivered to his house...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARZA>
<DIRECTION>
Dunnigan enters frame f.g., snatches up his extension. He listens for a few beats, trying to get a word in:
</DIRECTION>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, we know. Nick, we know. The body's been found. The pieces, anyway. Call just came in.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In some old shed on a farm outside the city. About a hundred and fifty acre piece of property.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NICK'S HOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Belonging to who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GIANT EYEBALL stares at us, unnaturally magnified by a tabletop magnifier. The lens is swept aside, revealing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Benson Clyde. In addition to the tabletop magnifier, he's wearing MAGNIFYING LENSES on his head. He examines the figurine with his naked eye, then flips the glasses down to continue...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VEHICLES race along two-lane blacktop: CRUISERS, UNMARKED CARS, TACTICAL VANS. A POLICE HELICOPTER skims along just above them at scary-low altitude...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cars veer off pavement and up a dirt road, kicking up an awesome trail of dust as the copter sweeps wide, pacing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CARS - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tense faces: Dunnigan, Garza, Nick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde pauses, hearing a RUMBLE under the music. Glances up as the rumble passes overhead -- a helicopter? He clicks on a tiny fan, holds the figurine under it, giving it a final dry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shitstorm descends: vehicles swerving in, COPS jumping out, machine gun-toting SWAT TACTICAL TROOPS pouring from vans...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde, still holding the figurine under the whirring fan, leans to one side in his chair, glancing out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He glimpses scurrying figures behind cars, cops darting and surrounding the house, motioning with hand signals...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He holds up the figurine for a final look. Satisfied with it, he places it onto:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CHESSBOARD -- the last piece. All the others are also hand- painted, gorgeous. Real craftsmanship here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands. Calmly moves to the middle of the room. Kicks off his shoes. Peels off his shirt and undershirt. Even takes off his pants. There will be no confusion about hidden weapons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He positions himself, very precise and purposeful. Lifts his hands high above his head. Presenting himself. Waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, bam: doors EXPLODE in and windows SHATTER as the SWAT tactical troops storm the room, bad-asses in black, machine guns aimed, encircling him, everybody shouting:
</DIRECTION>
<SWAT_TROOPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DO NOT MOVE--FREEZE MOTHERFUCKER-- DON'T EVEN TWITCH--WE WILL FIRE UPON YOU--LET'S SEE THOSE HANDS--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWAT_TROOPS>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde is the calm eye of a pissed-off storm of highly professional cops with itchy trigger fingers. He remains serene, looking around at them, hands raised high...
</DIRECTION>
<SWAT_CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ON THE FLOOR! FACE DOWN! DO IT NOW!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWAT_CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
He compliantly goes to his knees, then prone, offers his hands behind his back. They move in, cuff him, as troops spread throughout the house yelling "Clear!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick, wearing his kevlar, follows Dunnigan and Garza. Nick glances over and sees a perfect 1965 midnight-blue Lincoln Continental in the carport...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde is pulled to his feet just as Nick enters. UNIFORMS spread out, securing the house. Dunnigan faces Clyde...
</DIRECTION>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Benson Clyde. You have the right to remain silent...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
...as the full Miranda is read, Nick and Clyde have their eyes locked throughout -- this moment is all about them...
</DIRECTION>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...understand your rights as I have explained them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde is hustled outside, leaving Nick with Dunnigan and Garza in the farmhouse -- it's renovated, clean, very loft-like.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick drifts to the table, sees the chess board, can't help admiring the pieces. Then his eyes go to a floor-to-ceiling bookcase. He's stunned to realize: they're all law books.
</DIRECTION>
<GARZA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Check this shit out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARZA>
<DIRECTION>
Nick turns, moves to Garza's side. Dunnigan joins them. All three staring at a wall. ANGLE SHIFTS around to reveal:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The long-ago PHOTO (clipped from a newspaper) of Nick and Clarence Darby shaking hands on the courthouse steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE WIDENS to reveal:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Photo after photo. The crime scene photos...photos of Clyde and his family in happier times...photos clipped from magazines and newspapers about the murder and trial...all very neatly and precisely arrayed. The entire wall covered with them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MUSIC KEEPS BOOMING from the record player. Dunnigan turns TIGHT TO CAMERA and yells:
</DIRECTION>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	CAN SOMEBODY TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF, PLEASE?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde sits alone and isolated in a small room. WIDEN to reveal Sarah at the observation glass. She turns as Nick steps up.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says he'll only talk to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
Nick and Dunnigan prepare to go in. Dunnigan takes off his gun and holster, lays them on a table, as Garza activates the VIDEO. Cantrell finds a chair by feel, sits down, as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INNER ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick and Dunnigan enter. Dunnigan melts into a corner to observe as Nick sits across the table from Clyde.
</DIRECTION>

	Why so formal? We go way back. Call me Benson. Or Ben.

</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick sits across the table from Clyde, settles in.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. I'm here. So?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. Maybe you can explain what this is all about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick almost laughs -- not what he expected to hear.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>

<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darby? I knew about Ames, of course. I've been following the news about his horribly botched execution. But Darby too? Quite a coincidence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut the shit. We know you did it. Save everybody a lot of time and trouble and just confess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you going to continue to insist on being part of this conversation?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. Far be it from me to be rude.

<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clarence Darby was found on your property. Old abandoned shed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't know I had one. It's 150 acres, uncultivated. The other day I found a creek I never knew I had. Hunters trespass all the time. You going to try to pin the dead deer on me too?

INNER ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It occurs to me that an even moderately clever person could try to frame me for the murder simply by killing him on my property. One of Darby's drug rivals? That's an unsavory world.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Nick's stare)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A jury would have to weigh that possibility. What else you got?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(temper flaring)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about video of you dismembering Darby while he was still alive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's odd. See, if I were to do such a thing, I'd probably wear something so I couldn't be identified. Some kind of mask maybe. But you say it's actually me on the video? Did the camera capture my good side?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick snaps, lunges across the table, grabs Clyde.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sick fuck, you sent it to my house! My daughter saw that video! It fucking traumatized her! She couldn't stop sobbing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Dunnigan moves in fast, trying to pull Nick off (but failing):
</DIRECTION>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa-whoa, Nick, ease off!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No trouble here, Detective, we're fine. Thank you, though.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
Dunnigan backs off. Clyde turns back to Nick, who's still got him in his grasp, their faces close.
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your daughter is, what, ten now? That's a wonderful age. My daughter was always so busy at that age, so interested, so into everything. Jumping around. I called her "Bean," she jumped around so much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick is easing off by inches, subtly and ineffably weirded- out, unable to break Clyde's gaze. Softly:
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am sorry, Nick, that your daughter experienced that. You're right. That video should not have arrived that way. The person who sent it should have thought twice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
Dunnigan moves in again, gently but firmly pulls Nick away.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unless there's hard evidence tying me to these crimes -- forensic or otherwise -- why am I here? Why are we having this conversation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We know you did it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not about what you know. It's about what you can prove in court.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Nick's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your words. Like when you called it a justice system. You know the thing about a system, Nick? Any system can be played.

</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think you can play us? You gonna take me on?

</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clarence Darby did. And I'm much smarter than he was. Or you.

Nick advances, furious, held back by Dunnigan:

</NICK>
<CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
(lunges to his feet)

<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or. Set me free.

</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I stutter? Make your case. Or. Shake my hand on the courthouse steps and send me on my way.
	</DIALOGUE>

(off Nick's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll even make it easy on you. I will confess, how's that?

</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're gonna confess.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Ten years he's been planning this? Patient people make me nervous. This? This freaks me out.

</SARAH>
<DUNNIGAN>

	Is he serious about confessing? What's his deal, is he crazy?

	Confession or not, we're gonna nail him on two counts of first-degree.

	Agreed, but softly. Nothing hard- ass, no grand-standing. Kid gloves.

	Kid gloves? He's a psycho with a power saw.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CANTRELL>

	Depending on who's writing the headline, he's a grieving husband and father who got revenge on the men who murdered his wife and child.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Nick's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Public sympathy is to be respected and feared. This could blow up in our faces if we're not careful. We can't look like we're pissed off or have an ax to grind.

STEADICAM TWO SILHOUETTES: We're following Nick and Sarah through one of the pedestrian tunnels to the street:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...background check's gotta be thorough, I want to know everything there is to know about this son of a bitch. Get all the ADAs on it, tell 'em I better not see them sitting around on their asses or texting their pals...

	How about outside help? That P.I. who helped us on the Jacovitz case?

</SARAH>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, he was good. And Hanson's always reliable. But try to limit their hours, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
We find a MERCEDES at the curb -- Kell at the wheel, Emma in back. Nick gets in. Sarah leans down, happy to see them. Emma's face lights up -- the little girl obviously adores her.

	Well, hello there beauty!

	Soon, huh? Seriously, we miss you.

Sarah blows Emma a big extravagant kiss. Emma returns it, waves as they pull away. Nick and Kell glance back, happy to see their daughter acting a bit more like her old self...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NICK'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Late. Nick, in t-shirt and pajama bottoms, comes up a dark hallway with a file in his hand, rubbing his eyes. He comes to his daughter's bedroom door, quietly turns the knob...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EMMA'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and finds the bed empty. Sheets thrown back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick stands for a moment, every irrational fear he's ever had washing over him. CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM fast down the hallway...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...into the master bedroom, where he finds Emma sleeping with Kell. He stands for a moment, heart hammering. Softly:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Kell stirs, sees him, puts a finger to her lips. In whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw her bed empty. Scared the shit out of me. Don't know why.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KELL>

Nick lays there, listening...

<DIRECTION>
INT. "THE DOME" - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge domed chamber. In the center of the floor stands a smaller free-standing domed cage, like a bizarre birdcage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the birdcage: Nick and Garza wait. Garza mans a camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside the birdcage: Observers. Some (Cantrell and Sarah) occupy floor-level, where the video monitors are. Others (Iger and Dunnigan) are on a catwalk above that encircles the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A door opens and Clyde is brought into the birdcage. He gazes around, checking his surroundings.
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I admit I expected something more modern. That jail downtown?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Filled to capacity. It has been for years. They had to re-open this for the overflow. Part of it anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<GARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome to the county jail annex. All new inmates come here. It was in the papers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARZA>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Prison crowding. It's a problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
He sits. Nick joins him, pulls out a legal pad.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the record: You've waived legal counsel. You've offered to confess to the murders of Clarence Darby and Rupert Ames. Yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll get to that. First, what I'd really like to talk about is the cot in my cell. It's lumpy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Nick's stare)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hardly any padding? Steel springs? Very uncomfortable?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what lumpy means. Sorry to hear it. But we're not here to talk about prison conditions, we're here to talk about things you've done.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Start with things I haven't done. Like get any sleep last night.

</NICK>
<CLYDE>

</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A bed. In your cell.

</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, please. One of those Sleep- Matic adjustables. Those are best.

</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want the variable temperature control too?

Beat. Nick tosses his legal pad on the table, swivels around in his chair to the observers up on the catwalk, spreads his arms in a "help me" gesture.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You looking to deal? All right, how's this? How about I don't kick your fucking teeth down your throat?

	Sorry, Jonas. Okay, kid gloves.

(to Clyde)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My daughter slept in our bed last night. She hasn't done that since she was six. You gave her nightmares. So excuse me if I don't feel like cutting any little deals today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My daughter can't have nightmares, because she died with Clarence Darby's breath in her face. You gave him a reduced sentence and his freedom. All I want is a good night's sleep.

</NICK>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can justify the expense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<IGER>

INT. CELLBLOCK - CLYDE'S CELL - DAY

Clyde watches as MAINTENANCE MEN remove the unbolted cot from the cell and his Sleep-Matic is rolled in.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back in the birdcage:
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hacked the Fedex database, diverted the package to me, made the switch, sent the package on. It's automated tracking numbers moving millions of packages daily. Nobody's questioning who receives what, or why.
	</DIALOGUE>

<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the prison phones?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get a phone company uniform, hack the prison database, schedule an official visit. They'll wave you through the gate, like they did me. It's simple if you know how things work.

	Very much. Why?

</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could tell. I love music. All of it. It's like air in my lungs. So the thing about Clarence Darby is, I want my record collection and player brought to me. The vinyl discs as well as CDs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
Reactions all around the room. Iger leans forward:
</DIRECTION>
<IGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vinyl records and CDs can be broken into shards. They make excellent weapons. My answer to that one, Mr. Clyde, is not no, but hell no.
	</DIALOGUE>

Clyde absorbs that, looks to Nick, as:

INT. CELLBLOCK - CLYDE'S CELL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN IPOD AND SPEAKER DOCK now occupy a small plywood shelf attached to the railing outside Clyde's cell. A GUARD plugs it in via a long orange extension cord.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE WIDENS to Iger, who turns to the bars and hands a remote control through to Clyde. Dixon's watching balefully, as is every inmate on the cellblock.
</DIRECTION>
<IGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The player stays out here. You hand the remote to the on-duty guard every night at lights out. Those terms aren't negotiable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IGER>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I appreciate your compromise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
Iger draws close to the bars. Quietly:
</DIRECTION>
<IGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You looking to get your ass kicked?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Clyde's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By every inmate on this cellblock. You keep this up, they'll take it out on you. Harshly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IGER>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde glances back to Dwight. Dwight's watching, glowering, agreement in his silence. Clyde turns back to Iger.
</DIRECTION>
<IGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just trying to keep you alive in here. That's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IGER>
<DIRECTION>
Iger walks away. Clyde aims the remote. MUSIC STARTS PLAYING. He leans his head on the bars, listening, blissed. Cons all over the cellblock are staring daggers at him.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Check the video I made. All that will match up. I kept him alive for an hour, give or take. Time it.

Nick trades looks with the others in the room -- everybody have what they need? People nod. Nicks closes his pad.

</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My office types it up, you sign.

Nick rises, putting things in his briefcase. People get ready to leave -- but Clyde motions Garza to keep it rolling.

<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DUNNIGAN>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a place in town on Halston. La Traviata. Ever been?

</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I have no interest in making it happen. And you have nothing left to bargain with.

	C'mon, Nick. We've just started bargaining. You haven't even heard what I'm offering yet.

<DIRECTION>
A HELICOPTER THROTTLES UP, everything moving fast: an FBI FIELD TEAM, led by AGENT SAM DAVIES, emerges from a staircase door onto the roof, where they are met by Nick and Dunnigan. Davies dons his kevlar vest on the move toward the waiting copter, everybody SHOUTING over the rotors:

Nick gazing out the window, Cantrell seated with his dog, Sarah reading the report thus far:

A CONVICT comes to his bars, peering out...

<CONVICT>

	Motherfucker...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONVICT>
<DIRECTION>
...because here comes the rolling La Traviata cart -- gleaming domes keeping food warm, silver utensils, crisp linens, a ROSE in a bud vase. A red-jacketed LA TRAVIATA WAITER is pushing the cart, accompanied by GUARDS and Warden Iger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More cons appear at their bars, faces peering, an angry grumble growing in the cellblock as the cart goes by. The waiter's looking around, nervous...
</DIRECTION>

EXT. NEW JERSEY HILLTOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HELICOPTER ROARS IN, lands. Davies and his men jump out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN FBI GROUND TEAM is waiting for them. A CAMDEN FIELD AGENT runs up and points at the ground, shouting:
</DIRECTION>
<FIELD_AGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WE THINK WE'VE GOT A CAIRN HERE! SOMEBODY LAID A BED OF STONES AND PLANTED SOD OVER IT!

Davies signals his team. SHOVELS AND PICKS hit the ground...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CELL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...while GORGEOUS FOOD hits paper plates. It's being slopped unceremoniously from the fine china by the guards. TILT UP to Iger overseeing this process, passing china and utensils to the waiter, who's flustered:
</DIRECTION>
<WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're bruising the crepes.

	Thanks. Keep digging.

Digging. Sod coming off, being set aside on plastic. FLASH PHOTOS being taken. Stones being pried up...

INT. CELLBLOCK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Waiter and guards exit with the cart. The entire cellblock is SHOUTING. Iger pauses, gives a final glance back. Softly:
</DIRECTION>
<IGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Idiot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IGER>
<DIRECTION>
Then he too departs, as:

<DIRECTION>
CLYDE

<DIRECTION>
aims his remote. MUSIC for dining. Clyde glances back at Dwight, who's poised and tense.
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>

</DWIGHT>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde motions "join me, won't you?" They each take a seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde passes Dwight a crisply-folded linen napkin. Dwight tucks it like a bib. Clyde lays his on his lap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hurled object CLANGS off their bars. The cons are now throwing things, hollering to raise the dead. Clyde cranks the music a bit louder, motions for Dwight to dig in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwight goes for it, cramming food in his mouth and grabbing for more, fingers digging in...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HILLTOP - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...fingers digging in, pulling loose soil, prying stones. A layer of soil is brushed aside to reveal:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A face. Embedded in the dirt. He's been there a long time. FLASH PHOTOS highlight desiccated lips and teeth...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CELL - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...lips and teeth -- Dwight chewing, laughing. Oddly enough, he and Clyde seem to have started enjoying each other's company. THE MUSIC PLAYS in bizarre counterpoint to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CACOPHONY of an angry cellblock -- if the cons weren't in their cells, this would be a riot. All imaginable items are being hurled through bars: toilet paper rolls, books, shoes, clothes, all raining down, showering the cellblock floor...
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wonder what the little people are eating tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
Dwight throws his head back and laughs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OFFICE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...while, in deep silence, Nick unwraps a sorry-looking deli sandwich, swaps his pickles for Cantrell's potato salad (their long-standing ritual). They both keep glancing at the phone...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CELL - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...as Clyde and Dwight indulge their food orgy. Dialogue is not important, so we won't hear any -- we'll let the MUSIC take over and carry -- because it's all about tone:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're laughing and talking, winding each other up. And the more Clyde wisecracks, the more Dwight laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde finishes gnawing a lamb rack and says something to Dwight about the ruckus. Dwight turns, glances out, as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde casually, but with purpose, lowers the bone onto his lap -- adding it to one already there. He picks up a fresh one, starts chewing the meat off...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HILLTOP - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark enough now for flashlights. In the beams, we see the body mostly excavated. Forensic team members gather, in gloves and breather masks, getting ready to try lifting.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, let's see if we can get him out in one piece...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CELL - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde laughing, chewing, gnawing that third bone. ANGLE CLOSES DOWN as he brings it to his lap...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT REVEAL: His napkin wrapped tightly around his hand provides padding for his palm. The two earlier bones are already held between his fingers -- he places the third, makes a fist -- and the bones now protrude from his clenched knuckles like a trio of spikes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TILT UP to Clyde...he reaches across, turns a paper plate over to cover the crepes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OFFICE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PHONE RINGS. Nick snatches it up. He listens, looks to Cantrell...nods. They found the body.

Behind Davies, B.G., the body's being extracted from the hole:

WHAM -- the GRAVE ERUPTS as HALF A DOZEN BURIED CLAYMORE MINES pop like firecrackers, knocking Davies forward...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CELL - DUSK

...and Clyde lunges, face no longer laughing, the rolling cart slamming into the wall as the lamb bones protruding from his fist go slamming into Dwight's throat...

TIGHT ON NICK holding the phone. He knows something awful just happened on the other end:

EXT. HILLTOP - DUSK

An open CELL PHONE lies on the grass. Feet stumble haltingly into the shot. TILT UP TO:

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CELL - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde rises into the shot, calm now, covered with blood. He unwraps the napkin from his hand, snaps it open, uses it to wipe the blood from his face.

He takes his seat, positions the cart, uncovers the crepes and resumes eating...

A steel gate slides open, revealing Nick. Flanking him are Cantrell, Dunnigan, Davies (banged up and bandaged), Iger, others. They move toward us with purpose, grim and resolute, Sarah bringing up the rear with a young ADA named ROYCE.

	Here's what I think. You suckered us in. You ordered that meal for the purpose of killing him.

</NICK>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which makes it premeditated. Again.

Clyde sinks with a sigh of resignation and defeat, rests his head wearily on the bars. Nick moves in, speaking quietly:

	You're doing everything wrong. Making all the wrong moves.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Blowback?

INT. SOLITARY WING - DAY

"The Dungeon" -- a small underground block of FIVE CELLS dating back a century or more. A GUARD is spraying WD-40 into the lock of a cell, trying to turn the key. It finally does, as:

Clyde is brought in. GUARDS have him on poles connected to a leather collar around his neck, and they're none too gentle. Clyde tosses a final glance back at Nick and Iger.

Nick and the others exit the Dome, thoughts racing:

<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can he do? We've got him boxed in. He's isolated, for God's sake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's keep him that way. Strict rules apply. Law says he gets one hour outside his cell a day, that's what he gets. Just one, under heavy guard. The other twenty-three hours, he's in that cell, he's a ghost, he doesn't exist. No contact whatsoever.

	Yeah. I guess he is.

She raises her menu -- yes, we're in La Traviata. And the waiter is the same guy who brought Benson Clyde his meal:

<WAITER>

</WAITER>

Nick's CELL PHONE RINGS. He pulls it, checks the number, gives them a look -- sorry, gotta take this.

	<DIALOGUE>
	He's coming here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DAVIES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I'm told. It's called inter-agency cooperation, but don't ask me what agency because I wouldn't know. This isn't even back-channels, this is Theseus in the fucking Labyrinth.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just blew thirty years' worth of favors today calling in this one chit. I hope it's worth it.

The desk phone RINGS. Nick answers, listens a beat:

	Yes. Yes, we're all here. Downstairs? Okay. Understood.

INT. CITY HALL - SPIRAL STAIRCASE - NIGHT

Huge, descending seven floors, circles within circles dropping into darkness. Nick and Davies lead the way down. Cantrell brings up the rear with his dog and cane...

<SPOOK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOOK>

They freeze. Nick and Davies peer down. They start to make out a FIGURE in the murky darkness one level below.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which one of you is Davies?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOOK>
<DIRECTION>
Davies takes a step forward. THE SPOOK eases partially into the light -- flinty gaze, military-style haircut.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must be well thought of, Agent Davies. I don't do this. But I was asked nicely by the right people. They briefed me on your problems with Benson Clyde.

</SPOOK>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are we dealing with?

</NICK>
<SPOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Things I can neither confirm nor deny. Things of which, if I'm asked, I will disavow any knowledge.

The guys trade a look. Cantrell can't help chuckling.

	What was Clyde? Some kind of spy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SPOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spooks like me are a dime a dozen. Clyde was a brain. He ran a think- tank, inventing things for use in the field. Ways to kill people.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off their looks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need to get rid of somebody. It's not a situation where you can get close. What do you do?

</SPOOK>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ask Clyde?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SPOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. Ask Clyde. And he'd figure something out. Gizmos, strategy. He was good at it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOOK>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How good?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SPOOK>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>

	You play chess?

</SPOOK>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Tournament level in college, matter of fact.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SPOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In my line, we use an aptitude profile based on chess. A tournament- level player like you can think five to eight steps ahead of an average player, did you know that? Me, I think about ten steps ahead, so I'd take you in a game.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOOK>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Clyde?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SPOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Off the charts. If you're eight steps ahead, he's twenty. Or fifty. He's already got the game won on the first move, you don't even know you're playing yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(further into the light)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This cellmate he killed? You think that was random? Bullshit. That was a pawn taken off the board. If I were you, I'd be trying to figure out what the move was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOOK>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have been. Any thoughts?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SPOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Top of my head? Was the cellmate ever connected with this case? Or with Clyde? Was anybody else in that facility? Guards? Cons? The janitor? Any connection at all, no matter how remote. Because if Clyde says he has things in play, he does.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOOK>
<DAVIES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what? He's locked up. What can he do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVIES>
<SPOOK>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're an average chess player, aren't you?

<DAVIES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, I kind of suck.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. Father's Day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVIES>
<SPOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's this tie -- we call it the Albert, after Albert DeSalvo. They tiptoe in one night, thread a piano wire with a ratchet gizmo into one of your ties. Sounds crazy, but trust me it works. You put your tie on and all day long it slowly tightens. You don't even notice it's cutting off the blood-flow to your brain. Then you drop dead. Brain-dead or plain dead, doesn't much matter at that point.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clyde invented that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOOK>
<DIRECTION>
The Spook melts back into the shadows. The guys crane forward, trying to see. There's a brief spill of light below as a doorway opens and closes...he's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three of them stand there absorbing everything they've heard. Nick sits on a step. Quiet looks are traded...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and they all start taking off their ties...

INT. NICK'S HOUSE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Nick enters tie-less, subdued, distracted. Kell and Emma are in the living room playing Scrabble.
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>

Emma jumps up and runs over for a hug.

Emma returns to the couch. Kell comes to Nick, noticing his weird vibe: he's looking around at the room.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick?

	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would we wanna do that?

</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes in, opens the closet, reaches up for some overnight bags -- but pauses, drawn to his tie-rack inside the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at the ties hanging in neat rows...starts touching them, running his hands up and down the fabric...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kell stands in the doorway watching. Wondering what the fuck is going on. And getting a little creeped out.
</DIRECTION>
<KELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELL>
<DIRECTION>
He freezes, feeling something in the seam of a tie. Runs his fingers up and down, thinking something's in there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emma appears in the doorway too, at her mother's side. Both staring now. They watch as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick grabs a pair of scissors from Kell's sewing kit, carves the tie lengthwise, rips it open, feverish and faster, finds nothing inside but mangled fabric and thread and -- stops. Looks back. Realizes they're staring at him.
</DIRECTION>
<KELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELL>
<DIRECTION>
Nick pauses -- what the hell is he doing? He starts to regain his sense, laughs at himself in amazement.
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay, baby -- I'm fine, I promise. Go back to your game.

</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Dubious, Emma departs. As soon as she's out of earshot:
</DIRECTION>
<KELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seriously, Nick. What the fuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELL>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. I got paranoid for no reason, that's all. I'm fine now. I can't believe I let that son of a bitch Clyde get to me like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you in danger? Are we?
	</DIALOGUE>

The question hangs there -- the real question.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>

He pulls his phone, speed-dials.

ADAs are parking their cars along the wall, directed by a waving GUARD. ANGLE FINDS a lot of people: cop, prison, FBI. Sarah jumps out of her car and hurries over to Nick and the others with a flock of EIGHT ADAs at her heels.

</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See if there's anybody locked up here -- or working here -- ex-cop, witness for the prosecution -- anybody who might have had anything to do with the original Darby-Ames case, or has any previous history with Benson Clyde. Start with the cellmate. Flag anything, no matter how insignificant it seems...

<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRISON GROUNDS - NIGHT

INT. CLYDE'S CELLBLOCK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUARDS, FEDS, BOMB-SNIFFING DOGS -- they're cruising the cellblocks, flashlights swiveling, beams catching the faces of sleepy cons in their cells or at their bars...

<DIRECTION>
We find Nick and Iger at Clyde's now-empty cell. TWO FBI emerge, shake their heads.

INT. SOLITARY WING - CLYDE'S CELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two doors: solid steel outer door, inner barred door. The outer slides aside, reveals Nick outside the bars. Inside stands a shadow, waiting: Clyde.
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're up early. Trouble sleeping?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a good bluff. But you're done. Fucking with my head. Scaring my family half to death. Done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde moves closer to the bars, into the light.
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>

	Amazing, isn't it? How primal that is. That pull? What a man is capable of when it comes to his family?
	</DIALOGUE>

<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You strip away all the polite shit, that's what we're really about.

That could play as a threat, of course -- but it's not. It's genuine. And pained. And sincere. And Nick knows it.

<DIRECTION>
(off Nick's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

The outer door GRINDS SHUT...

Night has passed, day is coming. All the earlier energy has dissipated into anticlimax and weariness. People straggle across the yard in groups toward their vehicles...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let them all sleep a few hours, then bring 'em back for round two.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Due diligence. My middle name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
She trudges toward her car, following the ADAs toward their vehicles. Nick trades relieved looks with the men -- everybody coming down from a tense night. Davies shakes their hands:
</DIRECTION>
<DAVIES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fellas. For once, glad not to be of assistance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVIES>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love it when they cry wolf.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
The men separate in different directions. Dunnigan catches a glimpse of Sarah almost at her car -- she loses a page from under her arm, which flutters away on the breeze.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNNIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
(calls to her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Lowell! Lost something!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
She looks back, sees the page skittering slowly across the ground. Weary, she blows a strand of hair from her eyes, sets down her briefcase, walks back to get it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dunnigan smiles, keeps walking. The other men too. Nick stands a moment, watching, then starts toward his car...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ADAs are getting to their cars, pulling key fobs, aiming them to unlock their cars...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah is getting to the page, leaning down...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ADAs are pressing the remotes, a CHORUS OF CHIRPS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And WHAM -- the cars EXPLODE in a stunning SERIES OF DETONATIONS, killing the ADAs, throwing bodies through the air, kicking cars off the ground and flipping a few skyward...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick is knocked flat by heat and shrapnel ripping the air...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah goes flying. An arcing car slams upside-down nearby on a rocket-booster of flame and shattering axle...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And from this point on the visuals and sound are surreal:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pries himself off the ground, stunned, looking around, trying to figure out what the fuck just happened. He's disoriented, all sound muffled. Smoke drifting. Flames billowing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dunnigan runs up to Nick, shouting something. We can't tell what, because Nick can't hear. Dunnigan sees Nick is alive, turns and keeps going, running to help the others...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick looks over, sees bodies being pulled clear by responders, men running in, beating at flames...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick, dazed, looks through the drifting smoke and sees Sarah trying to sit up. There's something wrong with her leg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick pulls himself to his knees, staggers to his feet as sound filters back in: screams, shouts, the roar of flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stumbles through the smoke to Sarah. She's on the ground in shock, sobbing and flailing, crying out. Nick sees the jagged piece of metal that slammed deep into her calf, nearly severing it. He drops to his knees, tries to calm her:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're gonna be all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls the metal from her leg -- mistake. Blood sprays. He clamps down hard with both hands, blood going everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MEDIC! I NEED A MEDIC!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
He keeps clamping down, Sarah screaming and sobbing, as we
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GO TO BLACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN A SERIES OF FADE-TO-BLACKS, THE FOLLOWING IMAGES:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIREMEN spraying the flaming rubble of the cars...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TANGLES OF WRECKAGE billowing smoke...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BODY BAG dragged across the ground, added to a ROW OF BODY BAGS awaiting transport...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EMERGENCY VEHICLES parked haphazardly, lights spinning...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COPS AND RESPONDERS dealing with the scene...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARAH being wheeled on a gurney to a PARAMEDIC VAN by an EMS TEAM, oxygen mask on her face, gravely injured but stabilized, everything swirling around her, Dunnigan clearing a path...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK appears, takes her hand. She clasps it weakly. They load her on and the vehicle pulls out with siren and lights...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRISON GROUNDS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back to "real time" -- Cantrell is just getting out of his town car with his dog. WE FIND Nick on his cell:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(on cell)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baby. Listen. Don't be worried or scared. But I want you to pack those overnight bags... I don't have time to explain now. Just do it, okay? I'll call you back as soon as I can -- please, honey, I gotta go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
He clicks off as ANGLE COMES AROUND, revealing Davies and his TEAMS coming his way:
</DIRECTION>
<DAVIES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Each car had an explosive charge on the gas tank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVIES>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's got someone working with him. On the outside. He's got to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DAVIES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not necessarily. Everything looks pre-rigged.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVIES>
<BOMB_EXPERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We found a short-range transmitter beacon buried outside the prison wall. When your people showed up here and drove in through the gate, the signal armed the bombs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOMB_EXPERT>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He could have planted those bombs a month ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<CANTRELL>
<DIRECTION>
(grappling for sense)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...no, we've got two dozen ADAs on payroll. Those eight were picked last night on the spur of the moment. How could he know which eight would show up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<DAVIES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He didn't. Our people just found bombs on every car in your ADA pool. All two dozen. We're disarming those now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVIES>
<DIRECTION>
INT. "THE DOME" - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON CLYDE shoved into the birdcage. The neck-poles are disengaged. He moves forward, gazing through the bars...
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want a phone in my cell. If I'm conducting my own defense, it would be useful. Also in case you and I need to be in touch, Nick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
(glances at clock)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your twenty four hours are about up. In return for the phone, I'll extend you another twelve hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many more people die while you stand around dithering? How many do you get killed before my point starts sinking in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
Cantrell closes in, tracking Clyde by voice:
</DIRECTION>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Motherfucker! Whatever point you had was lost long ago! Eight kids dead in that yard, most of them just out of college! Eight! I have to talk to their families. I have to try to explain why their loved ones are dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde leans down, right in Cantrell's face, intense:
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been waiting for my explanation for ten years. So far...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shouts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...NOBODY'S FUCKING BOTHERED!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Cantrell spits in his face, turns away trembling with rage. Clyde calmly wipes it off, rises to address them all:
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it hasn't dawned on you, this is a war. As in any war, there will be collateral damage. The question, as always, is how much damage you're willing to take before you withdraw.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I got a better idea. Maybe we end this war right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks around)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fourteen people dead! I have to say this out loud?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(moving toward Clyde)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prisoners die in custody all the time. Attacking a guard. Trying to escape. Shit like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde, eyes locked, pulls his shirt open -- here's your target. Dunnigan, temper flaring, yanks his revolver and aims.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tempt me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<GARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ, man, dial it back...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARZA>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do it. It would be decisive. Stupid, but decisive.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Dunnigan's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you handle the blowback, Detective? The "shit like that?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick's stunned, seeing the whole situation spiraling out of control. He steps in, seizing the moment back:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put the gun away! Are you crazy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DUNNIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
(calmly reholsters)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's an option. All I'm saying. Risk the blowback. Ride it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not risking anything. Or letting him tear us down.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Clyde)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not getting us to throw out the rules, like you. No way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like rules. I've wanted you to follow them from the start. Like the one that says you prosecute a man who murders my family.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(re-buttons)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. Rules. A phone buys you another twelve hours. But if you haven't cut my deal and let me go by the deadline...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? What then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll kill someone in this room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
That sucks the air out of the conversation -- everybody stares as that sinks in. Glances are traded.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at the room full of people, scans their faces as if trying to pick. He points his finger, starts going from one end of the group to the other...
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eenie...meenie...miney...moe...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
...from person to person, to the end, moving back again...
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...my mother...told me...to pick...a person...and that...person...is...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
He lands on Cantrell. Silence. Cantrell obviously can't see.

<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's he pointing at?

</CANTRELL>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everybody on the move, emotions high:
</DIRECTION>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck him. Let him try.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not helpful! We have fourteen dead! You could ask them what he's capable of, but they're in no position to answer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CANTRELL>
<DIRECTION>
(beat, tight)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Point taken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<DAVIES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll give him his phone. We'll tap in and monitor every call.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVIES>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buys us another twelve hours, we could use that right now. That puts the deadline at...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(checks his watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...about 7:30 tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit. I'll be in front of a room full of lawyers. The A.B.A. dinner. I'm the keynote speaker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way. Find a replacement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Until his deadline passes, you're in protective custody. Not negotiable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Cantrell isn't happy about it -- but nods.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And have them switch the location of that dinner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's last minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. He could have gotten your schedule in advance -- been planning to take you out at the dinner along with everybody else. That eenie- meenie act could have been horseshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off their looks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have to get a few moves ahead. Plan for every contingency.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This way, Mr. Cantrell. Garza, you're with Mr. Price.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
They split up. Dunnigan leads Cantrell to an unmarked car while Nick and Garza head toward Nick's. Nick's phone RINGS. He checks the number, answers:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey baby -- no, I'm fine. Really. Honey, calm down...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
He listens a beat, calls to the men getting in the other cars:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our shit just hit the fan in a big way -- we're all over the news...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(on phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, all eight died. Sarah's in surgery right now...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...they think so, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...okay, I'll meet you there. Love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up, aims his key fob -- and hesitates. He and Garza trade a look, thinking the same thought. ANGLE SHIFTS to:
</DIRECTION>
<BOMB_EXPERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're good. Car's been swept.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOMB_EXPERT>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course it has. Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Nick, feeling foolish, presses the fob. Nothing but a tiny CHIRP. He and Garza get in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNMARKED CAR (MOVING) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dunnigan drives. Cantrell and his dog ride in back. Both men tense and silent. TWO POLICE CRUISERS provide escort...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NICK'S CAR (MOVING)/EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick is pulling up toward the hospital, sees a TV NEWS VAN at the entrance, a MINICAM CREW arguing with hospital security.
</DIRECTION>
<GARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go around. I'll get us in back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARZA>
<DIRECTION>
Nick hits the gas, drives past the news van...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and they come past the nurse's duty desk. UNIFORMS are stationed in the hallway. Garza pushes a path through:
</DIRECTION>
<GARZA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep the press off this floor, understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARZA>
<DIRECTION>
Nick squeezes past. The floor is busy. He finds Kell in the waiting area. She looks up, spots him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kell rises. She and Nick pull into a tight embrace. No words for a long moment. Kell's shaken, fighting tears.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any word?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's in surgery now. They're saying she'll be okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELL>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God. That's good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good? You'll have to explain the good part, Nick. I'm missing it. This is crazy. What if something happened to you? What would I say to Emma? What would we do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELL>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't lose me. You won't. Does the school know we're pulling Emma out of class?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<KELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I called, yeah, but -- I'd rather be here for Sarah when she wakes up. Nick -- and for you. I want to do something...

	You are. Getting our daughter out of harm's way. And yourself.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Detective. Will you escort my wife, please?

(to Kell)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's not much time. I'll be there to see you off. Okay? Please?

Kell reluctantly walks away with Garza, while:

EXT. CITY HALL - DAY

A media frenzy is brewing: TRUCKS pulling in, NEWS CREWS gathering. ANGLE TO A REPORTER on-camera:
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. D.A.'S OFFICE - DAY

Nick enters, finds the STAFF around the bullpen watching the same live report. Everybody's in shock, a few are crying...
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>

	...details are sketchy at this point, and names are being withheld...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>

	We've been getting calls from upstairs. The mayor's people.

A FIGURE enters shot, pushes a door open into glaring daylight. CAMERA FOLLOWS him outside to a podium set up before a swarming MOB OF PRESS shouting questions. ANGLE COMES AROUND to reveal:

Royce, nervous, leaning to the microphones.

EXT. TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Kell and Emma on the platform, Garza hovering nearby, CROWDS swarming around them as boarding calls come over the P.A. system. Kell is looking around, anxious.

Nick appears on the platform, hurrying. They see him. Emma runs, throws herself into Nick's arms as he crouches.
</DIRECTION>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanna see Sarah...

</NICK>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do we have to go?

</EMMA>
<NICK>

	'Cause your mom wants to see a few Broadway shows. You gonna begrudge her that?

</NICK>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're kinda full of shit, Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
Nick's taken aback -- not sure whether to laugh. He trades a look with Kell, who's too tense with worry to care.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, you're right. Maybe I am a little. But only a little. The part you can believe is that this is all going to be fine. Sarah, us.

(directed at Kell)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean it. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<EMMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.

</EMMA>
<DIRECTION>
She detaches from her father. Nick rises to Kell, pulls an envelope, hands it to her...
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No credit cards. Too easy to track. Meals, hotel, whatever -- pay cash.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
...then takes her cell, swaps it for Royce's...

She embraces him, fears and emotions swirling.

</KELL>

She breaks the embrace. Nick stands, watching them get on the train. The doors close. The train starts out...

Nick turns. Garza's been watching -- a look of sympathy for what Nick's going through...

Cantrell sits isolated, near tears of frustration, as the place is trashed around him. He glances up, hearing:

</DAVIES>
<TECH_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like this salt.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pours a small amount)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not sodium chloride. Potassium chloride. It's a neuro-blocker, stops the heart -- they use it in lethal injections. You'd be dead before you got up from the table.

Nick tosses the others a grim look.

</NICK>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who? Who could he have?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somebody from his past. Could be that spook we met on the stairs, for all we know -- he'd know how to plant this shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Him? No--why would Clyde let him come talk to us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To fuck with our heads? To get us to bring in our ADAs so he could blow them up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would be a Clyde move. But it's not proof.
	</DIALOGUE>

	I--I don't know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<NICK>

	Jonas, think -- last few days, have you used any ice? Any salt?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CANTRELL>
<DIRECTION>
(confused, grappling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't use salt--my cholesterol. Ice? Yeah--not long ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before or after he was arrested?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't remember! You track your use of ice, Nick? You keep a daily log?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<DIRECTION>
TECH #2 calls from the kitchen:
</DIRECTION>
<TECH_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heads-up! Looks like polonium here. In his tea pot. Same way the Russians killed Litvenenko. Took him two weeks to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off their looks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's an exotic isotope. All you need is a trace amount. Rips through your organs and bone marrow.

Nick's been listening, thunderstruck, paler by the moment. He looks to Cantrell sitting there, quiet and shaking.

DRIFTING IN on a reflective glass skyscraper -- spectacular.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens, revealing Nick, Cantrell, et al. They come into the room...actually, "room" undersells it. It's the most spectacular suite known to man -- huge open floor plan, with a stunning view of all the downtown buildings surrounding us.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice?

<DAVIES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm actually a little jealous Clyde didn't pick me.

<DIRECTION>
Cantrell laughs -- and it lightens everybody's mood. Nick drifts to the windows, gazing out, as:
</DIRECTION>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the presidential suite. Last person who stayed here was actually a president. Of a country. Security here is amazing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not bad, Jonas. I think you can muddle through.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DAVIES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're muddling with him. I don't want you back at your house until my people sweep it. You need pajamas, buy some in the shop downstairs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVIES>
<DIRECTION>
Nick nods, pulls Sarah's reports from his briefcase.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The background check my office was compiling -- these properties we think Clyde owns? If he is working with somebody, they could be operating out of any of these. We should check them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll try to wrangle additional manpower. Big job.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No shit. This is quite a list. Over forty locations?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVIES>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not even complete. Sarah was in the middle of it -- untangling property ownership from under assumed names, shell companies. She's the expert on all that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fellas... I'm grateful for all your efforts. I just wanted to say it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Save it for tonight. Hope you're in the mood for Chinese takeout.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CANTRELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANTRELL>
<NICK>

EXT. COUNTY JAIL ANNEX - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A STEEL DOOR opens. Clyde steps out, shackled, blinking at daylight. He comes down a short flight of steps...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA COMES AROUND to reveal his surroundings: not within prison walls, but rather behind the prison -- a loading area we haven't seen, comprised of fences and razor wire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick walks in the rear gate, passed through by Warden Iger himself -- this is clearly an off-the-books meeting. Nick and Clyde walk to each other, meet halfway.
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Interesting location you've chosen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought we'd have some privacy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what? A talk? Or...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gazes around)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you've decided to take Detective Dunnigan's advice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
He's noticing GUARDS atop the prison wall and surrounding roofs -- all with sniper rifles.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be the perfect place for it. Outside the wall. Look like you were shot trying to escape.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE ANGLE FROM ABOVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick and Clyde below. A SCOPE suddenly rises into frame, turning our shot into a SNIPER SCOPE POV, jumping Clyde's face into magnification. He smiles in the crosshairs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RESUME NICK AND CLYDE
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have some kind of signal worked out? You scratch your nose and blam, I'm a goner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Might solve all your problems. What's stopping you? Afraid of the blowback?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It's to prove a point.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Clyde's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just because I have the power, doesn't mean I have to use it.

<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. So why don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
We see Clyde's brain bend a little -- trying to wrap his head around it. It's almost painful for him.
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we've come a little too far for that, haven't we, Nick? I mean, what do I say? Sorry, my bad? Which way to the execution chamber?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't give me that. Death doesn't scare you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles "right")
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but...we're in the flow of this now. You cry havoc, you let slip the dogs of war, you go with it. You don't just stop because someone says hey wait. By then the dogs are dragging you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>

	Until one side admits defeat. What if I did that? What if I said...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...you were right. I was wrong. What if I say I should have prosecuted both men ten years ago?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd say you're making progress. You should have, you know. Prosecuted both.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd have lost.

	<DIALOGUE>
	She is? Great news. I'll stop on my way back. And Royce? Put some get- well flowers in her room, they sell 'em in the lobby. Thanks.

<DIRECTION>
(hangs up, baleful)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Six hours in surgery.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You asking that question makes me want to scratch my nose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde glances around at the snipers with a laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a guess. It's what I would do. Get 'em out, make sure they're safe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reproachful)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon. Like I'd ever have hurt them anyway.

</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are limits. Even in war. I may be many things, Nick. But I'm not Clarence Darby. I'm not Rupert Ames. I'm not that kind of monster.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not the kind who'd hurt your wife and child. Christ, look at me. Mine were my salvation -- then they were killed -- and all I had left was this. Life without them in this fucking charnel-house world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. Drawing close:
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It hurt to lose them, didn't it? Your family. Even knowing they'd come back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Imagine knowing they wouldn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't. I can't imagine that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. I envy you. For me, knowing mine won't come back is the only thing that's crowded my thoughts for ten years. If I could take a rusty knife and cut out that part of my brain, I would.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't make any more deals with murderers. If hearing that makes a difference...if that was the point of all this...you've won.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
We see Clyde's brain hurting again -- he's trying to believe that, would like to believe that...
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Counselor. I have no doubt, as we stand here, that you really believe that. I wish I could.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are we done? You gonna scratch your nose, or can I go?

Nick peers in. Sarah's in bed, leg braced, in traction. She's awake but groggy -- which isn't stopping her from giving instructions to Royce, who's scribbling notes at her bedside:
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	...tell Hansen we need hard info on those addresses...don't let the shell game on ownership title slow him down...at this point we'll take educated guesses...

He looks around, trying to pinpoint it. His head finally swivels down to Betsy lying at his side. She's WHINING, getting a little freaked, licking her stitches...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cantrell's hand travels down her fur to her belly...fingertips tracing the stitching...and what he can't see is the strange glow building under her skin...

But he can sense it. His eyes widen slightly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and WHAM! The room is swallowed in a DETONATION --

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FIGURE steps into frame, pockets the cell phone. CAMERA PIVOTS BEHIND him, losing Cantrell's building and bringing the other hotel into view -- the one with the lawyers...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NICK'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick jumps out, stunned. He runs up the street toward the hotel as glass and debris rains onto the sidewalk...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People crowd to the glass, staring out at the skyscraper across the way -- at the smoking ruin that was once a floor...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and the FIGURE bends down, picks something up. He hefts it onto his shoulder: a LAWS ROCKET-LAUNCHER. He flips up the sight, takes aim at the other hotel, fires...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOOSH -- the rocket streaks, leaving a contrail...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FAST CUT: Judge Burch and those around her reacting as the glare of the rocket approaches in a heartbeat --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM! OUR SECOND EXPLOSION of the night takes out the ballroom, killing dozens, blowing flame and debris across the room...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick sees it: the contrail, the second blast, all of it. It stops him dead in his tracks. Just overwhelmed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CANTRELL'S SUITE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Garza and his guys come stumbling and bleeding from the room they were in. They get to the top of the stairs, find the front of the suite open to the windy sky outside...

INT. CITY HALL - GRAND CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A 30-foot-high hand-painted domed ceiling above, an equally huge ROUND TABLE below -- an imposing room that says power.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick is ushered in. A DOZEN OR MORE PEOPLE are seated -- top- echelon city brass -- political, fire, police.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Also present are Davies and Dunnigan. (Dunnigan is not seated -- he's getting his ass reamed today.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The top dog: THE MAYOR. He's seething but not a screamer -- a man who keeps it tightly reined:
</DIRECTION>
<MAYOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're worldwide news this morning. Almost twenty dead, among them some of this country's top attorneys. I had friends in that room. Hell, I almost attended myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYOR>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The second explosion. I saw a rocket fired.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Davies and Dunnigan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clyde does have somebody on the outside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<MAYOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you saw or think you saw is beside the point. What matters is that the FBI wanted to rendition this man out of my city. The reason he's still here causing havoc is you. You wanted to prosecute this case. Your ambition kept him here and provoked this tragedy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYOR>
<DUNNIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
(mutters)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...not entirely fair...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<MAYOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Detective. Your job is hanging by a thread. I'd think a man of your experience would know when to keep his mouth shut and his ass covered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYOR>
<DIRECTION>
Dunnigan -- formidable though he is -- looks away, keeps his mouth shut. The Mayor approaches Nick, looks him in the eye.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I go in front of the cameras today -- unlike some people who seem unwilling to do so when asked -- I'm going to make goddamn sure the media doesn't hang this abject disaster around my neck. Why? Because I'm hanging it on yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're done. Gone. Fired. Non- existent. Get the fuck out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYOR>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY HALL COURTYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People going about their business.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick exits, dazed, comes down the steps. He sits on a step, vacant -- a man completely at a loss and out of options.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His CELL RINGS. He rouses himself, flips it open.
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. Some legal team from the mayor showed up here this morning. I hear you're off the case. Told you they'd scapegoat you, didn't I?

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick? You there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd you kill Jonas? I know about the second explosion, I saw the contrail, so I know you got somebody working for you. But the first explosion -- how?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say you find a guy with a bad cocaine problem. Hungry ex-wives. Greedy mistress. Heavy gambling debts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
...a bizarre sound occurs on the line -- an unidentifiable SHRIEKING SOUND that grows and rapidly dissipates...
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say that guy's a veterinarian. You hand him a million in cash, he'll do what you ask. Especially if he's looking to blow town for good...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(can't believe it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was...inside the dog?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You own the vet, you own the dog. Explosive wasn't even that big. Stuff I use, it didn't have to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hidden in plain sight. That's my specialty. Haven't you figured that out yet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
Nick sighs, rubs his eyes, can barely even speak.
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's next for you? Mulling career options? I suppose law is out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm trying to get over my friend being dead. Aside from that, fuck you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fair enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll miss you Nick. It was a good dance.

<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't bring your family back, though, did it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Clyde's silence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Has it made you feel better? All this? You done making your point?

<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just warming up. This is Clausewitz shit, my friend. Total war.

</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PUSHING IN on Nick, listening, as:
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna pull the whole thing down. I will topple the gleaming pillars and drag the whole fucking diseased, corrupt temple down on my head.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick enters, finds Sarah crying. A WALL-MOUNTED TV IS PLAYING A NEWS REPORT of the explosions -- file footage of Jonas Cantrell pops up. Nick drifts over, sits at her bedside, as:
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...going live now to City Hall where Mayor Tilden is about to make a statement...announcing, we're told, among other things, the dismissal of District Attorney Nick Price...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
The IMAGE cuts to the Mayor stepping to the mic.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you all for gathering on this solemn and anxious occasion...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYOR>
<DIRECTION>
Nick MUTES it. He and Sarah don't speak for long moments -- he's waiting for her to pull herself together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She finally does, going into professional mode, pulling her laptop and files and reports around her.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got the latest batch of background in. Hansen and the other guy did some good work here--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sarah. Give it a rest. It's over. We're done.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off her look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm done. The mayor is nailing my coffin shut. The best thing you can do right now is distance yourself from me as much as you can -- see what you can salvage of your career.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah is staring at him with "fuck you" in her eyes. She picks up a multi-page list of addresses, hands it to him.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This lists over fifty shit-value properties in industrial zones that nobody in their right mind would want to own -- stuff around chemical plants, factories. All are owned by Benson Clyde. Look at twenty-two.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
Nick, not caring, scans down to:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Joe's Lube-and-Drive Garage." Went out of business in '94.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks up, irritated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now why would Joe's extinct Lube- and-Shit Garage be of the slightest possible fucking interest to you, me, or anyone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
(tight, pissed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The garage, not so much. But the address. Look at the location.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
Nick looks down at the list again...staring...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOE'S LUBE-AND-DRIVE GARAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shitty garage in a shitty industrial park. Bordering it, on the other side of some fencing, are municipal train tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick's car pulls up. He gets out. It's a ghost town here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to the garage window -- glass thick with dirt. He wipes with his sleeve, but it doesn't help him see in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON ROLL-UP DOOR -- a CAR JACK jams in under the lip. We hear CRANKING and the door rises...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick drops down, peering in. He squeezes under the door, stands up. Gloomy in here. He hits the door switch -- it RATTLES up on its tracks, flooding the place with light...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around. Cobwebs. Dust. A CAR under a tarp on the hydraulic floor-lift. Old shelves and pallets of tools. Rust. Grime. The crap of ages.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sighs, turns and walks out...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. GARAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and pauses. Something tickling his brain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a SHRIEKING COMMUTER TRAIN blasts by -- gone, dwindling. It was a bizarre, distinctive sound...like the one Nick heard during his last phone call with Clyde.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick stands frozen, pieces in his head tumbling and threatening to fall into place. Something about the shape of that car under that tarp...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns, staring at it. Goes back in, drawn to it -- it's long, distinctly old-school, with sharp boxy corners...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He draws the tarp off -- finds a 1965 Lincoln Continental, midnight-blue, in excellent condition. The last time he saw it, it was parked in a carport at Benson Clyde's farmhouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What's it doing here? More pieces falling into place. Nick leaves the garage again, walking out...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA TRACKS HIM across the tarmac, and as we come around the corner of the building, we reveal:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The County Correctional Annex is right there, a backwater corner of the prison not sixty feet away...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick stares up at it -- a very curious location indeed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FAST CUTS: Nick searching...behind shelves...the toilet...in closets...the grimy little office...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops. Looks at the car. There's a mechanic's pit below that hydraulic lift. He goes to the control, hits "up"...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE FROM MECHANIC'S PIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick's face comes slowly into view as the hoist rises...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN BLACKNESS, WE HEAR: Boop-boop-boop...a cell being dialed. The line RINGING. A voice answering:

Poor Dunnigan looks tortured. He catches Garza's eye...

EXT. JOE'S LUBE-AND-DRIVE GARAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TRAIN SHRIEKS through shot, revealing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The garage quiet in moonlight. The area deserted. Beat. The garage door rolls up on its tracks. Darkness within.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PAIR OF HEADLIGHTS kick on, blinding us. The Lincoln emerges, moves off into the night as the door rolls down again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear SOFT STATIC from a police radio, and a voice:
</DIRECTION>
<DUNNIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All units. Subject vehicle is on the move.
	</DIALOGUE>

ANGLE WIDENS to reveal we're in an UNMARKED CAR -- Dunnigan at the wheel, Nick beside him. Dunnigan's on the radio:
</DIRECTION>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody maintain distance.

Dunnigan puts the car in gear, pulls out...

</DIRECTION>

CAMERA PUSHES IN as the car door opens, feet step out...

<DIRECTION>
TILT UP to Clyde dressed in a custodial services uniform. He slams the car door, gets in the van, fires up the engine...

The NOMOS VAN STEALS THE FRAME as it drives past and turns to go around the back of the building...

A LIMO STEALS THE FRAME BACK as it pulls to the curb. The Mayor steps out, waving and smiling for FLASHING CAMERAS...

INT. EMPTY COURTROOM - NIGHT

Clyde comes down the hallway B.G., rolling his cart...
</DIRECTION>

F.G., ANGLE FINDS tactical cops with machine guns pouring quietly up the stairs, taking up positions just around the corners, poised and tense. TIGHTEN IN as the TAC LEADER uses a small mirror to peek around the corner and spot Clyde:

Dozens of beams converge. Davies places the drill, goes to work on the case...grind, grind...
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_4>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have visual...suspect leaving the building...different service exit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_4>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde exits a loading dock, gets in his van...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COURTROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...grind, grind...the drill taps through. Davies yanks it, feeds a fiber-optic tube into the hole, puts his eye to the eyepiece. He swivels the tube carefully, peering inside...
</DIRECTION>
<DAVIES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Crap.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(glances up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Explosives. Nasty ones.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVIES>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? C-4?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Davies takes his eye from the eyepiece, looks at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVIES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C-4 is for girl scouts. This is malglinite. Take out the whole floor above us...maybe this entire corner of the building...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVIES>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you open it? Disarm it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DAVIES>
<DIRECTION>
(back to eyepiece)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, we got tripwires. We open this lid, instant karma's gonna get us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(keeps scanning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't see a motion sensor. Trigger looks simple...dial a cell phone, incoming call arms the trigger -- trigger's set to count down from forty seconds, then boom.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off their looks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That call comes in, we have forty seconds to get as far away from this thing as possible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVIES>
<DUNNIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to his men)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alert the mayor's security team. Evacuate those people upstairs -- clear that ballroom, go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Dunnigan turns on him, instant shouting match:
</DIRECTION>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No? What the fuck are you talking about, this could go off any second!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He won't set it off until that room is full! People are still arriving, red carpet shit, that's at least another half hour!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will not take that risk!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Nick, no longer shouting, but intense and fast:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I'm him, I've rigged cameras in that ballroom -- live video feed -- first sign of an evacuation, I trigger the bomb.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off their looks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have to think ahead of this fuck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. Looks traded.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVIES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm open.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVIES>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Nick. What's the move?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LINCOLN/NOMOS CUSTODIAL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde slams the van door, gets in the Lincoln. He pulls a handheld CLAMSHELL VIDEO MONITOR -- it shows a LIVE FEED of people entering the ballroom, mingling as they arrive...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde smiles, starts the engine...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CITY HALL BALLROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mayor enters, waving to everybody, shaking hands...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JOE'S LUBE-AND-DRIVE GARAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The garage door rises. The Lincoln backs in, stops on the hydraulic lift. Clyde gets out, throws the tarp over it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Briefly checks his clamshell. Still plenty of time...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He raises the lift a few feet, drops down and crawls under the car into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MECHANIC'S PIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duplicate controls. He hits the button and the car sinks down atop us, settling to the floor, sealing us into darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. A BRIGHT LIGHT turns on -- one of those gazillion candlepower flashlights. Clyde aims it and we see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TUNNEL hewn into the wall of the mechanic's pit. Just large enough for Clyde to crawl into. He does...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hand-dug, rough dirt held up by two-by-four bracing. A wheeled platform is the transport -- Clyde's on his back, pulling himself along by an overhead rope, hand over hand...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDER THE PRISON - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde emerges in the suffocating darkness of a sub-basement laid into a foundation that dates back to the Civil War. He crawls free, shining his light as rats scurry in shadows...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's on his hands and knees at first because the ceiling's so low. He's finally able to rise, moving along at a crouch...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and emerging into a proper sub-tunnel. Now able to walk normally, he navigates the tunnels and comes to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLYDE'S STAGING AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're just below the solitary wing. Clyde has it rigged with all his needs: computer, spare cell phones, various kinds of clothing, even a shelf lined with snacks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He quickly shrugs off his custodian's outfit, revealing his prison jumpsuit beneath. He gazes up a welded steel ladder (identical to four others in a row -- one for each cell).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He checks his clamshell one last time, tweaking the bad reception with a relay -- ballroom looks full. He clicks off his lamp and clamshell, sets them on a shelf...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes up the ladder to a hatch in the ceiling...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLYDE'S CELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and enters through a swiveling portal concealed behind the toilet. In deep darkness now, he pulls his cell phone, starts inputting a number -- boop...boop...boop...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And he freezes. Realizing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's somebody in there with him...a silhouette sitting on the floor by the door. The figure reaches out, pushes open the outer door a bit. Faint light spills in, revealing:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came to talk. Guess who wasn't in his cell? Imagine my surprise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Imagine mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beautiful how you played us. Getting yourself tossed into solitary -- pre-rigged with exits from all five cells. Whichever one we put you in, you had your bases covered.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(faint smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought I was such a bad-ass putting you down here. Turns out I was doing what you wanted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's how you play. Make the other guy think it's his idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You came to talk, so talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Been thinking. If I'd done things differently -- made different decisions from the start -- we wouldn't have gotten to this point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it happened. And here we are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here we are.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your decisions put us here too. This mess is on both of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to hold hands? What's your point?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't change decisions we've made. We can only account for decisions we make from here. I know what mine will be.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about you? You gonna finish dialing that number, or what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde hesitating, thumb hovering over the number pad.
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I don't? What are you offering?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You looking to deal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm willing to listen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, here's the deal. The deal is...there is no deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Clyde's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you. No more deals with murderers. I'm sticking to that. That's my decision. It's what you taught me. Strange as it sounds, I'm grateful for the lesson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Nick rises, steps out -- pauses, turns back.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your turn. You make the right decision, I'll see what I can do for you. But the wrong decision is one you'll have to live with the rest of your life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
The moment stretches. Clyde poised -- all down to this. In the end, he can't help himself: Boop-boop-boop -- hits send.
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Nick pushes the barred door shut...
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...because like I said, it's a decision you'll have to live with the rest of your life. Which at this point I figure is...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(glances at watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...another 35 seconds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
...and turns the key in the lock -- klatch.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Check mate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde hears a SOUND...like a phone ringing -- sort of close but not -- muffled -- like the sound Cantrell heard...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde, realization dawning, thrusts his hand out and jerks the cot blanket up, revealing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The steel briefcase under his cot. He glances up to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde scrambles to his portal, yanks on the handle...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLYDE'S STAGING AREA (UNDER THE CELLS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON: The hatch handle rattles -- now padlocked shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JOE'S GARAGE/MECHANIC'S PIT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FAST CUT: Dunnigan thrusts himself out of the tunnel, cops grabbing his arms, pulling him free...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SOLITARY WING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick comes through the sally-port at a fast stride, through another door, goes up the steps...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLYDE'S CELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde wheels around, frantic as a caged tiger -- he lunges to the door, rattling the bars...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK ANGLES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...while Nick pounds faster and faster up staircase after staircase...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLYDE'S CELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde -- enraged, bellowing -- picking up the steel briefcase, swinging it hard against the bars, trying to batter through...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then stopping. A self-awareness returning. Perhaps it's the Clyde that's been missing for years -- the sane one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. He sets the briefcase down. Stands a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits down on the briefcase. Calm now. Pulls a SMALL PHOTO from his breast pocket. Gazes at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's his wife and daughter. He stares at them a while.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tucks the photo back in his pocket. Nods.
</DIRECTION>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well played.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
BOOOOM! The DETONATION is staggering, instantly vaporizing Clyde and the cell he's in...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOLITARY WING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...BLOWING the bars right out of the stone on a WALL OF FLAME that overwhelms the lens...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FAST CUTS: CORRIDORS AND STAIRCASES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...FLAME HURTLING with express-train force...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRISON COURTYARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and BLASTING TONS OF BRICK AND MORTAR skyward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick enters the shot as WE DOLLY BACK WITH HIM, walking away from the building going to dust and rubble B.G.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS HIM AROUND, now following him, as he approaches Davies standing with Iger. Iger is staring, agog:
</DIRECTION>
<IGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God that wing was empty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IGER>
<DIRECTION>
A car arriving behind them: Dunnigan getting out, approaching.
</DIRECTION>
<IGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do I explain this to the city?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IGER>
<DUNNIGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think the Mayor will have your back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNNIGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Nick approaches, comes abreast of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looks are traded with Dunnigan and Davies. Relief. Fellowship. A touch of sadness. Words aren't needed here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick keeps walking, pulls his cell phone, starts dialing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dunnigan smiles. He knows exactly where Nick's going...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN STATION PLATFORM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG LENS: Nick sitting...waiting...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ARRIVING TRAIN moves massively into the shot, pulling into the station...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick rises. A SQUEAL OF BRAKES, steel on steel...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick engulfed in a crowd of arriving passengers, people getting off, swirling and jostling all around him, wiping frame...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...only two faces he wants to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and there they are...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sweeps his family into his arms. The final moments of this movie are all about faces and joy...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and CREDITS BEGIN as we
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
