Moonlight reflects on a vehicle's shiny surface. FISTS THUD into flesh. O.S. -- a man slams of the hood, rebounds away.

BLACK -- MORE TITLES -- then

LOVERS -- caught in FREEZE-FRAMES of green neon -- off, on, off, on -- like a strobe's instant-images -- of gasping, tough sex.

EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A place of money and privilege. White coral buildings surround an open yard. Tile roofs rise among banyan trees and banana palms, shimmering before a blue blaze of sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beyond the yard is the school's playing field and beyond that the waters of Biscayne Bay, dappled in sunlight where the sloops of the school's sailing class bob at their moorings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment all is quiet. Then, faintly, the HUM of many VOICES, rising and falling, LAUGHTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PANS to the open windows of a building somewhat larger than the others. The SOUNDS grow louder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BLUE BAY AUDITORIUM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hundred high school kids sit before a raised, hardwood stage. The students are not unlike the campus, radiant, well-tended -- a veritable sea of adolescent sexuality -- bronze boys who seem to have just come from the boats or tennis courts -- girls in tight shorts riding high up shapely thighs, as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM LOMBARDO strolls out onto the stage. The man is thirtyish, drop-dead handsome. Dressed not that differently from the kids, in an Izod polo shirt, khakis and boat shoes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His entrance has an effect upon the audience, particularly upon the girls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAREN and JANELLE, 16, pretty blondes, whisper then giggle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICOLE, a dark-eyed beauty, 17 but going on 25, watches Sam's walk, then turns to the girl at her side...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KELLY VAN RYAN, 17, a fully-developed knockout.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When we graduate the only thing I'm going to miss is...

<DIRECTION>
(with a nod to the stage)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Kelly's eyes are locked on Sam. Nicole has to nudge her.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is at the podium. He looks out across the audience. There are a couple of flirtatious whistles, laughter. Sam smiles, silencing them with a wave of his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've come to the halfway point in my senior seminars...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Cheers, applause. Sam waits for the kids to settle.

	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Boos as we FIND...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIMMY LEACH, 18, grumge look, long hair. He sits with a clique of white trashy types, or at least what passes for such at Blue Bay School. Jimmy appears a bit more genuine, as does...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUZlE TOLLER, a boyish brunette, seated nearby, but with just enough space between her and everyone else to mark her as a loner. She studies Sam Lombardo with a dark, sullen stare.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Jimmy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>

This remark is greeted by a chorus of laughter as we FIND...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KIRK, one of the golden boys, seated with Kelly and Nicole.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something Kirk with which I'm sure you have hands-on experience.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Loud laughter. Sam quiets them again, then turns to the blackboard, where he begins to write, in big letters -- S-E-X. The kids start to cheer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam writes another word -- C-R-I-M-E-S.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cheering fades into silence.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>

	Our speakers today head up the Blue Bay Police Sex Crimes Unit -- Detectives Ray Duquette and Gloria Perez.

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're here to give you what we hope will be a fresh perspective on these subjects, and to answer any questions you night have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Sam turns to the wings, his hand out to welcome the visitors...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAY DUQUETTE, mid-thirties, with the lanky build of a light heavyweight, walks out onto the stage. He's dressed in a dark suit, dark hair combed straight back above steel-rimmed glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GLORIA PEREZ walks at his side. She's a good six inches shorter than Ray, with a sweet face. Attractive but no stunner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
About five kids applaud. Ray takes the podium.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you for having us. We'll each talk for ten or fifteen minutes, then open it up to your questions...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE AUDIENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suzie Toller suddenly gets to her feet. As she passes behind Jimmy, we HEAR her VOICE, beneath her breath.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going to listen to this jack-off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZIE>
<DIRECTION>
She marches down the aisle and bangs out the rear door..
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray pauses, a dark look on his face, then goes on...
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's begin with a question. What is a sex crime?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
A moment.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not getting any.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
This draws a few laughs from the kids, a couple of thin smiles from Sam and Gloria. And none at all from Ray Duquette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kids change classes. Sam, Ray and Gloria CROSS the grass. The kids swarm past. A pair of girls flash by.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLE>
	<DIALOGUE>

The three adults ENTER an old wooden building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is one of the original buildings. We have the offices here now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
The walls are paneled in wood, decorated with framed photographs. Gloria stops before one of the photos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON PHOTOGRAPH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An old black-and-white, with that sepia caste harkening back to another age.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A handsome young man of perhaps 14 stands at the helm of a boat under sail. His hair is swept back, his eyes fixed upon an unseen horizon. There is something in this boy's pose, in the line of his jaw, in the clarity of his gaze, as if what he has fixed upon is the future itself.
</DIRECTION>
<GLORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anybody in particular?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLORIA>
<DIRECTION>
When no one answers, she turns to find Sam at her side. He stares at the picture, then looks at Gloria.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam Lombardo. The first. Class of 'Forty-Two
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(0.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't seem to get rid of the Lombardos around here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Sam and the detectives turn as a professorial-looking guy in a baggy brown suit (ART MADDOX) arrives on the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Art. Say hello to Detectives Perez and Duquette.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the cops)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Art Maddox. A fellow guidance counselor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Art and the detectives shake hands.
</DIRECTION>
<ART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, did you set 'em all straight on the ugly facts of life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ART>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have the feeling, they got it down already. They're a step ahead of us, Artie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Gloria seems to find this amusing. Ray stands at her side, looks at Sam. Sam feels it, makes eye contact with Ray -- a beat -- at which point, Ray puts a hand on Gloria's back.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got that two o'clock in town.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<GLORIA>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back to the land of grownups.

</GLORIA>
<DIRECTION>
The detectives shake hands once more with San and Art.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(to Gloria)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If old pictures interest you, come back some time, there's quite a collection down in the pagoda. I'll see you get a proper tour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<GLORIA>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLORIA>
<DIRECTION>
Ray opens a door for her. The detectives pass through it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Art claps Sam on the shoulder, then walks off down the hallway. Sam remains near the doors, watching as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE DRIVE LEADING TO THE SCHOOL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray and Gloria walk past half a dozen expensive cars -- Range Rovers, Beamers and Mercedes, to a plain, white Ford Taurus, which they get into and drive away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cheerleaders perform a sensual dance on the porch of a wooden pagoda. A rugby team runs drills on the grass, as out on the bay, six tiny racing sloops tack toward the docks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON DOCKS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the sloops enter the narrow channel between the slips one student from each boat jumps onto the dock where he or she sets about tying off the boat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is on one of the boats. Jimmy Leach is at the rudder.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(loud enough to be heard by his class)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, you guys. Good work. Now coil those dock lines and I'll see you all on Monday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
He watches his class clamber up the docks. His eye falls upon the pagoda, the dancing cheerleaders -- Kelly Van Ryan in work-out tights -- bare arms reaching for the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SCHOOL DOCKS - SAM & JIMMY - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hosing down boats, stowing sails. They look up as... A HUGE POWER BOAT glides past. The docks rock in its wake.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. I could party on that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Sam just laughs at him.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's about all it's good for.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the one to have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
He points to a beautiful triple-masted schooner headed out of the bay, under sail.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Windward Passage. I crewed on that one summer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Long time ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls his eyes from the boat, sets about coiling a line.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I want to thank you for getting me into this class... No way was my old man going to spring for the fees...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you're working for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beneath a laugh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Least you're supposed to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
He tosses Jimmy the coiled line. Jimmy's caught off-guard, but catches it at the last second, then shares the laugh with Sam.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I play too? Or is it just for boys?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Sam and Jimmy turn to find Kelly Van Ryan at the far end of the dock. She's fresh from cheerleader practice, in a white blouse knotted at the bottom to REVEAL a flat, tanned stomach; open at the top to REVEAL the swelling of her breasts. She favors Sam with a coy smile.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So who's washing your car this weekend, Mr. Lombardo?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Sam's blank look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The senior car wash, remember?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tamara's making a schedule. She said you bought a coupon but you're not on anybody's list.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Sam smiles, remembering.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you know. Figured I'd buy a Washing ticket, support the effort. That old Jeep of mine's kind of a waste of time, don't you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Sam places the coiled hose on top of a locker then starts up the dock, Jimmy at his side. Kelly falls in with then.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at all. How about if Nicole and I do it? We're working as a team.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Sam just looks at her. She looks back -- big, pleading eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, try me on Sunday. I'm going out to the Everglades on Saturday. You guys can wash the mud off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I just looked out front. My ride wasn't there. You suppose you could give me one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Sam doesn't answer right away. He looks toward the school.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wouldn't want me to walk, would you? I mean like, something bad might happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Sam hesitates, momentarily at a loss, then turns to Jimmy, who seems to regard Kelly with something akin to physical pain.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about you, Jimbo, you need a ride?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(still looking at Kelly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A ride. You want one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. But I got my bike.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam's Jeep rolls out of the drive, Jimmy's bike in back, meaning that Jimmy and Kelly are squeezed into the passenger seat, which is fine with Jimmy. Kelly's thigh is pressed against his. His arm pushes against her breast. Kelly is not so happy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they near the school's entrance, they come upon a beat-to-shit VW bug -- stalled at a stop sign.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A John Deere tractor mower sits nearby. A groundsman -- a tall black guy with a shaved head, waits at the wheel of the bug as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suzie Toller -- in black platform shoes, a T-shirt and cutoff jeans, leans over the engine, fiddling with the car's linkage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam pulls up next to the bug and stops.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got room for one more, Suzie. You need a ride?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly rolls her eyes as Suzie turns to look at them.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus. Where'd she get those shoes? Whores-4-Less?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Suzie's eyes go cold. She signals the groundsman, who turns the key. The CAR SPLUTTERS to life. Suzie flashes a smile, then sticks out her tongue -- which has been pierced by a silver stud.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's cute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Suzie gives her the finger. Sam makes eye contact with Suzie, offers a sad smile, while putting the Jeep in gear.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (to Suzie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you swallow it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy turns, waving to Suzie as the Jeep pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Magnificent old mansions occupy five-acre bay-front parcels amid lush, tropical settings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam's Jeep stops before a pair of gates with the words "VAN RYAN" woven into their wrought-iron design. Beyond the gates a long drive leads toward a huge stone house. Kelly jumps out, punches in a code. The gates swing open.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't forget the car wash.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
SANDRA VAN RYAN, Kelly's mom, big, sexy, aggressive, a young 42 in a string bikini, comes out from the side of the house. When she sees the Jeep, she starts down the drive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly waves to Sam, then walks up the drive. When she sees her mother coming toward her, her face hardens.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that Sam Lombardo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>
<KELLY>

Sam has already hung a U.

Jimmy is checking her out. All eyes.

<DIRECTION>
Sandra looks down her nose at Jimmy.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He can wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
Sam glances past her, to Kelly, who stands languidly at the front of the house, watching.

<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't, Sandy. I've got to run.

(cutting her off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, Sandy. I've got plans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Running over alligators with that silly swamp jalopy when you could be sailing a real boat...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Swamp's where it's at, Sandy. Gives you a look into the muck we all crawled out of. You ought to try it some time.

Sandra gives him a hard stare, then marches off toward the house.

Neat little stucco houses -- some not so neat -- simmer in tropical heat.

A BMW Z-3 Roadster stops at the head of the cul-de-sac. Nicole is driving. Kelly sits beside her.

Nicole does, before one of the not-so-neat houses. Sam's muddy Jeep Wrangler is parked in the drive. Behind that is a red Mercedes convertible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAM'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam and BARBARA, 28, a lean, beautiful country-clubber roll on the bed. Barbara is dressed for tennis. Sam wears a baggy pair of khaki shorts. Barbara struggles to escape. Sam grabs a leg, kisses the back of her knee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes up the little white skirt, kissing her between her thighs.

Barbara starts to giggle. He's just about got her when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DOORBELL RINGS. Sam lets go. Barbara sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam goes to the front door, opens it, to find...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly and Nicole, holding plastic pails full of rags. The girls are dressed in Blue Bay High T-shirts, cropped to REVEAL flat tummies, shorts and running shoes.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRLS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Mr. Lombardo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRLS>

Sam looks over the girls -- a small, exasperated smile.

<KELLY>

	Look, he forgot. I knew it.

</KELLY>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In back of the garage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
As they walk away, he is joined by Barbara. She watches the girls with an appraising eye.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that Sandra Van Ryan's kid?

</BARBARA>
<SAM>

Barbara laughs at him.

</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
Sam nods. Another kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAM'S DRIVEWAY - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Barbara goes to her car she sees the girls coming from behind the garage. She looks at Sam, standing in his doorway, watching the girls. When he sees Barbara looking at him, he shrugs, then waves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT DOOR - SAM'S HOUSE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly and Nicole, looking very much like the finalists in a wet T-shirt derby, ring the bell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam answers. He looks them over. A couple of houses down he can see the guy with the mower, dumping grass into a can, watching the girls, then turning to walk back to his house.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, where you off to now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Lombardo.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're running kind of late. How about if Nicole goes on to the Mansons? You could give me a ride when you find the ticket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Sam looks at her, as does Nicole.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
He hurries from the room. Kelly turns to Nicole, giving her the eye, pointing toward the drive.
</DIRECTION>
<NICOLE>
<DIRECTION>
(mouthing the words)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICOLE>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly nods, a mischievous smile on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAM'S BEDROOM - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is rummaging through drawers. He stops when he hears the SOUND of a CAR. He goes to the window in time to see Nicole's BMW headed down his street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAM'S LIVING ROOM - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam ENTERS the room to find Kelly just inside the doorway, where the water from her wet clothing has formed little pools on the linoleum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam looks at the water. He looks at Kelly. She moves a step closer, allowing the door to SWING shut behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAM'S NEIGHBORHOOD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long, slow, Antonioni PAN -- time passes -- the cul-de-sac -- the sparkling lawns -- the kids with the basketball -- a jogger passing by...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAM'S PORCH - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front door. The door opens. Kelly comes out, fast, slamming the door behind her. She walks down the drive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are tears on her face. As she hits the street, she begins to run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man with the mower is now seated on his parch, drinking beer. He watches as the girl runs by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The teenagers are still playing hoops. They stop as Kelly jogs past, sobbing. They watch as she hits the end of the cul-de-sac and DISAPPEARS around a corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE EVERGLADES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam, perched in the pilot's seat of a beat-to-shit old air boat, rips through the Florida swamp land.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He glides across channels of water, then turns into the tall grass which whips at the hull of his boat. Bits and pieces of debris fly through the air. Sam smiles, swinging the boat through a series of wide, sliding turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he spots something. He throttles down gliding into a shallow pool where... A HUGE ALLIGATOR, aware it has been found out, whips about, stirring up mud, then scuttling OUT OF SIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sly old fucker. How you got so big, wasn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Sam sits for a moment in the silence. He pulls a pair of binoculars from beneath his seat and looks through them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON HORIZON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All we SEE is a shabby collection of whitewashed buildings shimmering in the last long light of afternoon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam watches for some time. At last he lowers the binoculars, revs up his engine and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON SAM'S BOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it moves away, as SEEN from water level where...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The old gator has risen once more -- just the eyes -- a cold primordial intelligence, gazing out, unblinking across the murky waters of the swamp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam's Wrangler pulls in next to Barbara's Mercedes. The Jeep is muddy once more. So is Sam. He gets out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAM'S HOUSE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam ENTERS. The house is dark.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Barbara?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing. Me CROSSES the living room and starts down the hallway, where a faint light issues from beneath the bedroom door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam opens the door. He hears the SOUND of RUNNING WATER. He walks across the room and into the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clouded mirrors, a shower stall full of. steam. Behind the glass door we SEE an indistinct shape, moving about in the hot water. Sam opens the shower door. The steam clears to REVEAL Barbara's gorgeous athletic body.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's hot in here, just the way you like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBARA>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs his shirt, pulling him into the shower's flow. They kiss. She pulls his shirt open, loosens his pants. His clothes fall away. Sam pushes her up against the tile wall, hard. She holds to his shoulders, nails sinking into his flesh, wrapping her legs around his hips as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water, dark with swamp mud, spirals down the drain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly Van Ryan sits on the dock, looking back toward the huge stone house, where...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A YELLOW LIGHT burns in one of the upstairs windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly has a shotgun laid across her knees. Slowly, she raises the gun, pointing at the yellow window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She holds it there for some time, then, softly, to herself...
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bang...

<DIRECTION>
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - VAN RYAN ESTATE - NEXT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sunlight streams through open windows, mingling with loud sighs of pleasure... Sandra Van Ryan on top of FRANKIE CONDO, a big, buffed-out Cuban. They're making love on the bed. She throws her head back -- an explosion of hair -- gasps -- an orgasm is near, as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cordless PHONE RINGS on the night table. They try to ignore it. No dice. Sandra groans, finally pulling away.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamnit!

Sandra waves him off. She pulls on a T-shirt, then grabs up the phone once more, punching in a number.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAM'S OFFICE - BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Desk, files, a terrarium full of swamp lizards, above which a photo of the Windward Passage decorates the wall. There's a Waterford bowl on the desk -- etched with "Sam Lombardo -- Blue Bay Educator of the Year."
</DIRECTION>

Sam is working on the computer. The PHONE RINGS. He answers.

Frankie's eyes go cold when he hears the word "Sam."

In his office, Sam pushes himself away from the computer, stiffening noticeably.

	To tell you the truth, I haven't seen her since Friday.

BOOM -- A SHOTGUN BLASTS outside Sandra's window. She jumps. BOOM, BOOM -- more BLASTS. She jumps up to look outside.

She glances at Frankie -- who has heard enough. He gives her a long hard look, then rolls from the bed to walk from the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam remains silent, watching the lizards with their blank, unblinking eyes.

</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Sam puts down the phone, looks at it -- a long moment as -- the barest hint of a smile plays upon his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sandra slams down her phone. She looks to the bay, to the sleek racing sloop floating beyond the private dock.

The SHOTGUN BLASTS away. Kelly pauses to reload. She catches sight of...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sandra, approaching from the main house.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You seem to find guns therapeutic. Maybe I oughta try it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly lets the gun's barrel drift over Sandra, then turns to walk away. She moves toward the guest house. A used-brick cottage tucked among the gnarled branches and roots of a huge banyan tree. Sandra follows.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>

Kelly turns away, starts for the guest house once more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GUEST HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAN to REVEAL room -- the gun case, the animal trophies, the photos -- One of a stately old gentleman in an elaborate wicker chair, a cane at his side, a bowler on his knee. Others of Kelly and a handsome middle-aged man in safari gear, posing with their rifles above slain wildebeests and bison.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sandra and Kelly ENTER. Kelly puts down the shotgun, turns, tears in her eyes.

</SANDRA>
<KELLY>

Her voice trails away, as meanwhile Kelly has drawn herself up into a fetal position on the bed. The sobbing has stopped but her shoulders continue to shake. Sandra sits on the edge of the bed, reaches over to rub Kelly's back.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I get you anything?

Kelly shakes her head, no.

Her mother looks at her, clearly at a loss. At last she stands. She is headed out of the room when Kelly says something, but the words are indistinct, as her fists are pressed against her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, honey? I can't hear you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>

There is a long beat as Kelly collects herself. She stares at the wall, her eyes filled with tears, but when she speaks she enunciates each word.

Seated across from these three are Ray, Gloria and BRYCE HUNTER, the local D.A.

Silence follows Sandra's outburst. Baxter reaches to squeeze Sandra's shoulder. Kelly puts her face in her hands.

Sam sits at his desk, toying with a pencil. He watches students pass -- no smiles, no waves, an occasional dark look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the press of students Sam sees Art at the door of his office. The two men look at one another. At which point...
</DIRECTION>

Gloria, followed by Ray, steps INTO SCENE. The detectives shake hands with Art. As Art turns to close the door, Sam falls within his line of vision. Art looks away. The door swings shut.

INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

Sam sits in a cramped waiting room, leafing through a magazine.

Trendy nouveau. A valet parks Sam's Jeep.

INT. RESTAURLNT - SAME

Sam walks across a tiled entry. He looks tired, but smiles at the maitre d'.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>

	Georgie, hey. I'm meeting Barbara. She here yet?
	</DIALOGUE>

GEORGE looks stiff, maybe a little nervous. Sam picks up on it. He scans the room...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dimly-lit, crowded, but we PICK OUT Barbara, stunning in a delicate white sun dress, tanned arms resting upon a table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam starts toward her. George reaches out to touch his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Lombardo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Sam ignores him, threading his way among the people at a lavish bar, then stopping short as he sees who Barbara is with -- her father, Tom Baxter.
</DIRECTION>

Tom Baxter sees Sam, gets to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<BAXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is not appropriate Lombardo.

Sam steps to one side, makes eye contact with Barbara.

Barbara has tears in her eyes. She looks at Sam, then shakes her head, looking away.

	Barbara...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ever see you around my daughter, you're going to be finished, period.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAZTER>
<DIRECTION>
The two men square off, but already we can SEE Georgie, trailed by a pair of beefy characters in blue blazers making their way across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam sees them too. He takes a final look at Barbara. When she refuses to meet his eye, he pushes past Baxter, through the crowd and out of the restaurant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AN EVERGLADES ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Red neon identifies it as Jim's Recovery Room. A handful of trucks sit in a dirt parking lot, Sam's Jeep among them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROADHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The air is thick with smoke. Locals shoot pool. The walls are decorated with dusty fishing nets and inflated blowfish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An aging BARMAID -- good-looking -- once, runs a rag around a pitcher, looks down the bar, smiles, finding...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam, alone, awaiting service.
</DIRECTION>
<BARMAID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam, honey... Haven't seen you in a while. How's life treatin' you?

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That bad, huh? Well, you came to the right place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARMAID>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROADHOUSE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam walks outside. He stands in the red glow of neon light, looking toward the road... On the opposite side of which...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... sits a sorry little collection of whitewashed stucco bungalows, identified by a green neon sign as the Glades Motel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beyond the motel are the Everglades, a great expanse of darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam stares at the motel. At last he gets in his Jeep. As he EXITS the lot, a second pair of headlights flashes on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EVERGLADES - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A deserted two-lane road cuts through the swamp. Trees bearded with moss appear as ghostly shapes in the lights of Sam's Jeep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. SAM'S JEEP - MOVING - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
San drives -- a tired face. Soft MUSIC on the RADIO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something APPEARS in the road, caught for a moment in the headlights. Sam swerves, whirls his head around, sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GATOR sliding of the shoulder and into the murky water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam lets out some air, relaxing a bit, then catches sight of something else -- Headlights finding reflection in his rearview mirror, coming fast. Sam watches as the lights get closer. He looks back to the road -- an approaching curve...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is into the curve when the lights catch him. A black Range Rover moves out to pass, then turns suddenly into Sam's lane, cutting him off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It happens quickly. Sam swerves to avoid hitting the larger car, but the road affords little margin for error.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The JEEP slides across a narrow shoulder, then plummets down a steep embankment, CRASHING through cattails, rolling over to SLAM BACK DOWN on its tires in a swampy gulch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam slumps back from the steering wheel. Somewhere over his head he can see headlights shining into the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hears a CAR DOOR SLAM, the SOUNDS of someone scrambling down the embankment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam tries to get out of his seat harness. Someone is approaching, splashing through the muck. Suddenly a hand reaches through the broken driver's window, helping him.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The hands get him loose. Sam stumbles from the car.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'm okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up to find -- Frankie Condo, looming over him.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's too bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKIE>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs Sam, pulling him OUT OF FRAME. What we are left with is the SOUND of FISTS THUDDING INTO FLESH -- then Sam, hitting the hood of his Jeep, slumping down into the muck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frankie is breathing hard. We HEAR him SLOGGING back up the embankment. We HEAR a DOOR SLAM, the RANGE ROVER driving away, leaving only darkness, and the EERIE SOUNDS of the swamp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE STRIP MALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dazzling light. Sam's smashed-up Jeep is parked before Ken Bowden's office, next door to the Mongolian Beef Bowl.
</DIRECTION>

INT. BEEF BOWL - SAME

Sam and Ken eye one another over a green plastic table -- Ken with his neck brace, Sam with a bruised face.

The squalor of the buildings is seat in contrast to the beauty of the Glades where the waters have gone to the color of polished brass beneath an immense, darkening sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray parks before a ramshackle building covered in vines and peeling paint. A sign reads: "NIGHT CRAWLERS $1 A BUCKET." The jawbones of numerous gators hang beneath the eaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they get out of the car, something catches Gloria's eye -- along the bank of the canal...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON BANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where a tall man (WALTER) with long white hair and tattooed arms kneels inside a pen, slapping a huge gator on its snout. The reptile lifts its upper body, hissing, opening its jaws.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter takes a stick from his hip pocket, passing it through the gator's mouth. The jaws snap shut, incredibly fast, with a hollow snapping sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gloria jumps instinctively, then watches, aghast, as Walter slaps the creature once more. This time moving round to the front of the gator, sticking halt his arm inside its mouth.

Ken in his neck brace, ENTERS with Sam and a bailiff. Sam wears a suit. Re's clean-shaven, recovered from the car wreck and beating. Still, there is a weariness about him we have not seen before. He makes eye contact with Sandra -- a cold stare.

Kelly sees them. She makes a run at Suzie. For a moment the girls shove and kick but Ray and Gloria are between them in a hurry, pulling then apart as Baxter arrives to take charge of Kelly, pulling her toward the door.

Ruby and Walter arrive now too. Suzie runs to them and they lead her through the crowd, Walter pushing people aside with his long, tattooed arms.

Gloria heaves a sigh. Ray pushes a hand through his hair, then turns to find Sam looking at him. Most of the press have run off to follow the girls -- looking for more action. It is a quiet moment. The two men lock eyes.

Sam leans back, enjoying the silence. He reaches into a cooler, takes out a beer, opens it, takes a drink, then pulls something else from the cooler --

</SAM>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I'm crazy. Ask my mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him again, more passionately now. He gets into it, tears her blouse open, putting his tongue to her breasts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHADOW moves on the wall, looming above them. Sam sees it, his eyes widen. He tries to sit up, as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG! -- an EXPLOSION. Sam jumps, knocks Kelly to his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A champagne cork hits the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suzie Toller stands over the bed with a foaming champagne bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much is about six and a half million divided by three?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, come on... We've got to have at least one victory party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly grabs the champagne, takes a long gulp, pours some on her breasts as she straddles Sam once more, inviting him to lick them clean.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kelly, for christ's sake...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
She has begun to move like a lap dancer, inviting him to take her breasts in his mouth, putting a hand to his crotch...

Sam gives up, lays back as Kelly undoes his pants, then moves to get him inside her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suzie watches. She takes another drink, then tosses the bottle, pulling off her top, REVEALING her small, white breasts, a couple of tattoos, a pierced nipple. She slips behind Kelly, fondling Kelly's breasts as Sam arches beneath them both -- all of them totally into it now, losing themselves in the sex...

INT. DETECTIVZS' ROOM, BLUE BAY POLICE STATION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is dark and empty, with the exception of a single desk lamp, by which halo we find...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray Duquette, in an aloha shirt, waiting as his computer's printer finishes a job, as suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... a new light rushes into the room. Ray turns to find Gloria standing in the doorway. He stops as his printer finishes the job. He pulls out the paper, looks at it, smiles. Gloria walks to his desk.

	Hey, don't back away from it, you were right. We did look stupid.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you were wrong about, is who made us look that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>

Gloria just looks at him, puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial. Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Gloria nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So why not tell us about the affair? I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<GLORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLORIA>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought of that. Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo. Your reputation is getting trashed. You want to stop the bleeding. You don't want to sit in jail for three months. Unless...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<GLORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>

<RAY>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The job looks okay to us. But look at it from his point of view. The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege. But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his.

Gloria gives this a moment's thought.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Your old man graduates from Blue Bay School, you're not supposed to wind up there. Board of Directors maybe, but not in the lousy guidance office. Now. Point number two.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he taps at the printout on his desk)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've run a financial on Lombardo. Guy was eyeball-deep in debt before this all happened -- trying to keep up with pricey trim like Barbara Baxter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
He passes the printout to Gloria. She looks at it, thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<GLORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what about the girls? Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother? Surely her father...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLORIA>
<RAY>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her father didn't leave her squat. The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.

Gloria looks over Lombardo's financial once more, tosses it on the desk, then studies Ray -- long beat.

	</DIALOGUE>
</GLORIA>
<RAY>

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was after the war. Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him. The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.

EXT. YACHT BROKERAGE - DAY

INT. SWIMMING POOL, BLUE BAY SCHOOL - DAY

Girls in tank suits finish laps, towel off. As the girls begin to walk toward the lockers, they encounter...
</DIRECTION>

Ray Duquette, threading his way among the girls, his eye on...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly, alone on the deck, still dripping -- a Botticelli vision.

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice stroke.

Kelly, startled, turns to find Ray walking toward her across the deck. She snatches a towel from one of the racing platforms and begins to dry herself, wrapping the towel around her.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>

Ray gives her a cold smile.

<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, I was curious about how you see things working out, for you, Sam and Suzie.

Kelly starts to walk away. Ray cuts her off.

EXT. SMILIN' JACK'S FISH CAMP - NIGHT

Suzie wanders along the canal, smoking a joint. At her back a few faint lights flicker here and there in the windows of trailers. She walks down to the little dock, sits on a rail, takes another hit.

A shadow stirs in one of the skiffs tied to the dock. A man stands, walks up the couple of wooden stairs. The light from a trailer across the road glances off steel-rimmed glasses as Ray Duquette steps onto the dock.

Suzie gags on the smoke in her lungs, coughs. She squeezes the lit roach into her palm, then tosses it into the canal.

Suzie's VW idles. She leans out the window, talks to the intercom, the gate opens. The VW ENTERS. The gate closes.

<DIRECTION>
Ray's pickup drives past. He drives to a big lot where one of the mansions has been torn down. He drives up onto the dirt, keeps going, right down to the water's edge where he pulls his little skiff out of the back once more.
</DIRECTION>

He walks back to the truck, pulls off his sport coat, hangs a Hi-8 video camera over his shoulder and wades out into the calm waters of the bay, pushing the skiff, then climbing in.

EXT. VAN RYAN ESTATE, REAR OF MAIN HOUSE - NIGHT

Suzie follows Kelly past the pool, which is all lit~up, and on toward the jacuzzi. The whole deck is tiled in black-and-white.

Kelly's in a bikini -- the killer body. Suzie, the contrast -- pale, skinny, boyish, in a T-shirt and cutoff jeans. They argue -- we CANNOT HEAR.

EXT. THE BAY - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray has arrived near the docks. He has killed his engine, maneuvering here with a single oar. He ties the skiff off behind the Jonathan, then climbs to the dock, moving around the guest house and coming close to the pool. He takes a position behind the cabanas, readies his camera.

</SUZIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly tries to put an arm around her. Suzie slaps her -- a mistake -- Kelly's bigger, faster. She slaps the side of Suzie's head, then grabs her legs, dumping her on the tile deck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON RAY

Suzie tries to kick Kelly.

<DIRECTION>
Something changes in Kelly, a scary, calm rage.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stupid bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
She very methodically grabs Suzie's hair, dragging her into the jacuzzi, holding her under the hot water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suzie thrashes, breaks free, gags, arches out of the water, the wet T-shirt clinging to her small breasts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly is on her again, slaps her, puts her hands to Suzie's throat -- violently sexual in her wet bikini.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly slams Suzie back onto the black-and-white tile, gets on top of her, knees between Suzie's legs, her hands on her throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suzie's skinny shape writhes underneath Kelly on the gleaming tile. She gasps for air. Kelly finally lets go, but remains on her knees between Suzie's legs, breathing hard. A moment. Kelly touches Suzie's face.

Suzie nods, tearing her T-shirt, getting both of Kelly's hands onto her breasts, then pushing at Kelly's wrists, getting her to pull at her nipples, hard... Kelly obliges...

Suzie cries out in pain. Kelly's hands move down to pull off Suzie's bottoms...

Sam lunges at Ray. The officer and Hunter restrain him. Gloria looks on, taken aback by Ray's accusations, Sam's response.

EXT. MALL ENTRANCE - LATE AFTERNOON

<DIRECTION>
Sam EXXTS a building, a large package of wrapped goods beneath his arm. He looks toward the parking lot where --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barbara Baxter stands beside the red Mercedes. She tips a valet then starts toward the mall. She sees San. Their eyes meet. A moment of hesitation, as neither is quite sure what to say.

<DIRECTION>
A moment, she touches his face. Sam raises a hand to cover hers, as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... in b.g., a BLACK RANGE ROVER -- just the roof VISIBLE above the tops of the other cars, cruises the lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RANGE ROVER - KELLY VAN RYAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
seated at the wheel, parks, stares toward the mall entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON ENTRANCE - KELLY'S POV

<DIRECTION>
Sam and Barbara stand in the orange light, hand-in-hand. Barbara leans forward, kisses Sam on the lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON KELLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lost in thought, when she is startled by a sudden CACOPHONY of ENGINE NOISE. She turns to find...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suzie's BUG, SPLUTTERING and BELCHING smoke, parks next to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suzie opens the door of the Rover, jumps in. She's wearing a black ball cap, armed with a huge straw bag. As she settles in the seat, she lets out a long breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly makes a face, fans the air.

<KELLY>

The Range Rover comes down onto the sand, parks.

<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. RANGE ROVER - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly turns off the engine. Suzie tokes on a joint, swills the MD 20/20. She gazes upon the sea, eyes at half-mast.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought we were goin' to a movie.

<KELLY>

Suzie shrugs, gets out. Kelly gets out with her. Suzie staggers. Kelly circles her with an arm, looks nervously around, begins leading her down the beach.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZIE>

	I wanna live at the beach someday.

</SUZIE>

Suzie plops down on the sand, drinks from the bottle. She watches Kelly fading into the darkness, mumbles something beneath her breath, then lies on her back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUZIE'S POV - THE NIGHT SKY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SOUND of CRASHING WAVES. She rolls to one side, looking down the beach
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Murky blackness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to focus, sits up.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kelly?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZIE>
<DIRECTION>
She stands -- wobbly -- peers down the beach.

A shape EMERGES in the blackness, moving toward her.

The shape gets closer and closer, until...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam Lombardo steps up to loom over Suzie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a step back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam puts a hand on her shoulder. He carries something in his other hand -- hard to see on the dark beach.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suzie, it's okay. It's me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Suzie steadies herself. A face APPEARS behind Sam -- Kelly.

<SAM>

<DIRECTION>
Sam leads Suzie toward a huge rock formation.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me tell you about this boat I picked out for us...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
They move OUT OF SIGHT. Kelly continues to walk, back along the sand toward the cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT - A SCREAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sickening hollow THWACK -- an arc of blood and two teeth fall silently on dark stone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly begins to run, stumbling through the sand to Sam's Jeep, where she pulls a big roll of clear plastic from behind the seats. She stuffs it under her arm, then runs back along the beach. As she runs, she can hear them -- more THWACKS, MOANS -- it seems like forever
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam APP£ARS before her on the sand. The champagne bottle swings loosely at the end of one arm. it looks shiny now, dripping with Suzie's blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly goes to him. She looks at the bottle, then throws herself against him -- a hard kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Kelly. I'm sorry it had to happen like this. She was losing it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<KELLY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was no way. That cop would've gotten her to tell him... everything. She was weak and dumb...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him again, her hands moving over his body. Sam takes a step back, looks into Kelly's face -- the parted lips, sultry eyes -- as if seeing her for the first time -- a long beat -- at which point he turns, heaving the champagne bottle as far as he can into the black waves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RANGE ROVER ON THE SAUD - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rear hatch open -- overhead light on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam and Kelly drag Suzie's body -- wrapped in the plastic -- to the rear hatch. As they heft her inside, the light catches --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUZIE'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mask of blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly turns away in disgust. She goes to the passenger side door, gets in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam gets in behind the wheel. For a moment the two of them just sit there, in the darkness, with the SOUND of the SEA, and their own BREATHING. Sam looks at Kelly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is focused on the dark Atlantic.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly turns to him -- an anxious face.

Kelly waits by the Rover, swatting mosquitoes.

SLOSHING SOUNDS -- a shape approaches in the dark -- Sam in waders, muddy, tired, carrying a shovel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GALLERIA PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Almost empty of cars. The Range Rover cruises past Suzie's VW, circles, comes back. Sam jumps out, pulls on latex gloves, gets into the VW and backs it out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUS TERMINAL (MIAMI) - DAY

Almost dawn. A long parking lot fronts the terminal. Suzie's VW arrives, parks, Sam gets out. He goes to the waiting Range Rover, gets in and drives away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT GATE - VAN RYAN ESTATE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A THIN STREAM OF MUDDY WATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

A HAND touches the water.

PULL BACK to REVEAL the hand as that of Ray Duquette.

<DIRECTION>
Ray kneels, fingers wriggling in the water, then straightens, looking toward the house where...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the other side of the gate, Kelly, in a tube-top and tight shorts, washes mud from the Range Rover. She looks up, sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray, drying his hand on a handkerchief, walking up the drive, arriving at the wrought-iron gates.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>

As Gloria watches, Sandra looks off to the side, where something catches her eye. Gloria sees her start, then follows her gaze.

On a rise some fifty yards from the Van Ryan plot, two people stand near an old oak -- Ruby and Walter.

When Gloria looks back at Sandra, it seems to her as if the woman has slumped against Tom Baxter, who now stares at the two people on the rise as if, by doing so with sufficient intensity, he might make them disappear.

Gloria turns to the grave site, her eye lingers on the open grave, then moves to the huge marker which dominates the Van Ryan family plot and, in fact, the entire scene.

Ray kneels. He begins to tighten the winch.

Sam watches him for a moment, then reaches around behind his back to unhook the short line which holds the boom.

<DIRECTION>
The mainsail catches wind, swinging the boom in a wide arc, directly at Ray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray looks up, sees it coming just in time to catch it on his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blow is enough to send him sprawling through the lifelines, where he just manages to grab one of the nylon cords.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam ducks as the boon continues to swing erratically above the deck, watching as Ray hauls himself on board.
</DIRECTION>

The boat no longer driven by the wind, bobs up and down on a small ground swell.

Sam looks around. He jerks open a storage compartment. A diver's weight belt tumbles out. Sam grabs it, swings it over his head in circles, letting the weight pick up momentum, preparing to throw.
</DIRECTION>

Ray crouches, still brandishing the winch handle. The boom sweeps the deck.

Sam throws the belt.

Ray grabs a shroud, dances out of the way, then steadies himself, a mean grin spreading across his face.

There's no tine for Sam to look for anything else.

Ray moves quickly across the deck -- a menacing sight -- tall, well-muscled, the handle gleaming in his hand.

Sam pulls himself out of the cockpit. Ray jumps in. But that's as far as he gets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOSH -- A spear pierces Ray's thigh. He screams, goes down, the handle skittering across the deck.

Ray follows it with his eyes, reaching out, then freezing as he sees something else. He draws in his hand as if bitten.

Gloria stands, a little weary. Ruby walks her from the room.
</DIRECTION>
<GLORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you for talking to me, Ruby. I am sorry about Suzie, she...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLORIA>

They have gotten to the main room and Gloria stops short, noticing for the first time that the beat-up old black-and-white TV has been replaced by a high-tech, giant-screen television.
</DIRECTION>
<RUBY>

The dusty road, the little dock, the gator pen.

<RUBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's an old saying from the Everglades -- virtue may be missed but sin can't hide.

Gloria nods. She is distracted by a movement in the gator pen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON PEN

For a moment there is nothing more than a few ripples across the surface of the pond which lies inside the pen, then, slowly, the GATOR'S EYES -- cold, reptilian, unblinking, rising up to gaze across the oily waters.

INT. GUEST HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly is frantically trying to unlock the gun case as Ray comes through the French doors. She can't get it done. He's there in an instant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She screams, backs away, then watches as Ray stops, wraps a hanky around his hand and breaks the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes out a small caliber handgun, checks the clip, aims the gun at his own shoulder and fires.

Sam takes a breath, prepares to try again. Suzie pops a couple of pills with gulps of wine. Sam goes to it once more.

Kelly and Sam on the floor, naked. He's on her from the rear. It's getting wild. He suddenly stops, rolls to the floor.

She takes an envelope from her notebook, tosses it in front of Sam. Pictures slide onto his desk -- Sam and Kelly -- in various poses of coked-out debauchery at the Glades Motel.

Sam lounges in a booth. He looks hot, bored. He stirs a drink. Kelly walks in out of the light. She is looking a little strung out, a big straw bag slung over one shoulder, but oh, so sexy in skimpy cutoffs and cowboy boots -- long legs flashing as she nears Sam's booth. Sam looks up, as...
