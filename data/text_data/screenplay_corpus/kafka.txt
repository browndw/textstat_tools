PRAGUE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Old Town is quiet. It's very early in the twisted streets of this ancient ghetto. Dark corners casting a medieval spell over a modern century oblivious to their romance and mystery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The River is the dividing line. Elegant gardens on the opposite bank embracing the monotonous solemnity of the New Town, tower steeples silhouetted against the sombre sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An empty motor bus rattles along a deserted street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Gothic bridge links the two halves of the strange city. Its half-moon arches becoming circles as they meet their reflections in the water. Thin mist swirls over the cobblestones above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few boats in the water. Fishermen casting their lines in silence. One or two lights now burning in buildings beyond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the Old Town Square the great clock on the cathedral strikes six.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes filled with terror, beads of sweat crawling on his brow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands in the middle of a murky courtyard, perfectly still. Waiting. Watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The balconies overlooking on successive floors, looming all around him, are empty. All is quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man's name is EDUARD. He dares not move for fear of missing a single sound. And then he hears it. A small noise of movement nearby. He runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TINY ALLEYWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He runs alone in the dim light of the deserted morning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CROOKED PASSAGEWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Running for his life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NARROW LANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Running on sheer pumping fear, long after the verge of collapse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coming out into the light, but by no means out of danger, he allows himself a brief pause, gasping for air, just for a moment looking back into the gloom, starting to retreat again even as he does, then turning running ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WINDING STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He runs on, past boarded-up houses and shuttered inns, strange relics of the Middle Ages casting frightening shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AROUND A CORNER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eduard appears suddenly, quickly flattens himself back against the large notice board that covers the wall here, layers of expressionistic theatre and film posters pasted on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He breathes painfully in short bursts, as silently as he can. He watches the corner he's just come from, the ornate archway through which any pursuer must emerge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing there. But then a shadow moves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eduard's shoulders tense. His eyes widen. He holds his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shadow ... spreading ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eduard edges away ever so slowly, keeping his unblinking gaze on the archway, backing off, one arm brushing the notice board as he feels his way along it, macabre images on the posters, some torn and incomplete, revealing other fragments behind, Eduard's eyes staring constant, no noise here at all and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HAND! clamps over his face from behind. All of a sudden and out of absolutely nowhere and not a thing he can do about it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he tries, his hands coming up to grip the arm that grasps him, an arm of iron.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hand is huge. It covers Eduard's face almost entirely, only one eye gaping bloodshot through the fingers, ghastly fingers that, just for a second, seem almost inhuman, perhaps even fingers that seem incompatible on the same hand, a hand covered in scar tissue, starting to squeeze as it pulls Eduard swiftly away.

:SC: A ROW OF TYPEWRITERS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clacketing incessantly under slightly more agile and refined fingers. Beyond these, another row of desks. And beyond that another, the office workers in their neat suits tapping away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And beyond that another, at which one worker scribbles furiously at his figures, the next rolls a new sheet into his typewriter, the next answers his clanging telephone, the next rifles through the pages of a massive record book, the next sits erect in his chair playing his machine like a piano, and the last, by the window, dusty light streaming across him, contemplatively taps the end of a pencil onto his desk. This is KAFKA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A rather tall young man with a kind, sensitive face. sensitive perhaps because his eyes, ears, and nose seem slightly bigger and more inquiring than most, and his gaze one of almost unrelenting intensity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's looking off at something now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A desk, not very far from his own. But empty. The chair pushed squarely under it. The typewriter covered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka is wondering why -- when his concentration is interrupted.

Kafka turns to see BURGEL, a creep.

<KAFKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never seen him. I don't believe there is a keeper of the files.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFKA>
<BURGEL>

	He's usually in the storage room sorting things out. He can't close the file on a case until he has the concluding report.

	He has it, he just hasn't noticed it yet, all right?

</KAFKA>
<BURGEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's to say he ever will? He's a timid old man and quite careful not to tread on anyone's toes -- In fact, I'm the only one he trusts and he wouldn't even look at a document if it didn't first come through me.

Burgel just won't go away. Kafka tries to get on with his work.

</KAFKA>
<BURGEL>
<DIRECTION>
(flushed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I deliver a message the very act of delivering it, you might say, gives it an official stamp, and only in this way are both the sender and the receiver satisfied that it was delivered at all.

Kafka comes through the door that divides the stairs from the hall, goes to knock on the door of the first apartment down here.

Kafka comes in tentatively, seeing the CONCIERGE in a far corner of the cluttered room, in bed, covers tucked right up to her chin.

The door unlocks and the two of them come in. Kafka goes to open the window curtain. He turns around to see the Concierge already poking about in drawers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He ignores her and looks around the room on his own. Eduard isn't here. Nothing else seems out of place. He wonders instead how he can dissuade the Concierge from her unbelievable snooping.
</DIRECTION>
<KAFKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, he's not here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFKA>

The Concierge takes a tie from one of the drawers and models it over her own ample chest.

Kafka pauses at Eduard's desk, still untouched, then continues on to his own.

When Kafka reaches the ground floor he passes a pair of SENIOR PARTNERS conferring together -- and does a double-take when he hears his name mentioned -- then sees the two men shake hands conclusively and turn away. Kafka continues walking away himself, worried about his future.

A bizarre street. Tiny little houses that look fashioned by a toymaker, all bunched tightly next to each other, forming a continuous rooftop of odd configurations and angles and pointed chimneys. The street named after practitioners of the black arts and dark sciences who inhabited it in the Sixteenth Century.

Kafka's house is toward the back, a light shining from the single upper window. Through it, Kafka is seen sitting at the only desk that really matters to him -- his writing one.

Kafka tugs his collar up a bit, his breath visible in the air. He has a feeling what's going to be under the sheet on the lonely trolley in the middle of the room before the first man summons him over to it.
</DIRECTION>

Kafka goes. The first man yanks the sheet off the face in one quick movement. The face of Eduard. White and bloated, the tongue jutting, the eyes bulging.

Kafka recoils, stepping back instinctively.

And now he hears a stirring in a dark corner. He looks up again.

A third man steps out of the shadows where he's been quietly standing and walks over to Kafka. He is a severe man, stolid, dedicated, and never smiles. He reminds Kafka of his father.

Two other MEN are here waiting, sitting on a bench, sharing a private joke. Kafka glances down at himself, wondering if his appearance could in any way inspire ridicule.

	You've been with the firm for nearly nine years. You've done your work diligently, there are no complaints on that score. But there's more to the job than the work -- there are other people to consider -- and frankly, Kafka, we eel your social situation could bear improving.

Suddenly, in a terrific release of pent-up emotion, she slaps him hard across the cheek, the first of what would be a flurry of blows if not for the fact that the unexpected force of it throws Burgel reeling backwards before she can deliver any more. Instead she rushes away, very upset.

HIGH TERRACE

A flight of stone steps takes them up here to this vantage spot overlooking the River and the city beyond. Kafka stands by a railing -- and the huge, distorted shadow of SOMEONE looms suddenly on the high wall under him.

Sit laughing, jowls gyrating, around a table filled with an abnormal amount of food. One of them stops laughing then, and the others follow suit, one after the other in turn, until they're all silent, looking at the same thing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're in a fancy restaurant, and the other customers have also turned away from their dinners for the moment to stare at the Man in Black who stands before the Fat Men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man wears a black mask as well. He presents the Fat Men with a covered tray. They look at it, then back at him -- but he's walked away. They look at the tray again -- and one of them lifts the cover. Underneath lies the classic black bowling ball -- with a fuse burning at the top. The Fat Men all try to stand up at once but --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM! Their booth explodes with them in it.

At the doorway, holding a revolver loosely in one hand to discourage heroes, the Man in Black turns calmly to face the stunned restaurant.

In the dark distance behind him there seems to be a person following him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOISY BEER SHOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neighborhood denizens have come out, hearing all the excitement not far away. Kafka walks past. He looks behind him, but the following figure has gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWISTED LITTLE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka comes around a curve -- and sees ahead a dark figure a black cape standing waiting under a lone lamppost. When Kafka gets a bit nearer, the figure starts to walk slowly away, as if expecting Kafka to follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DIRTY YARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dark figure walks alongside a row of black window panes, turning around the corner where they end. Kafka follows around the corner -- and through a dingy doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LOPSIDED STAIRWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leads him up to a large attic. Warning shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ATTIC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gloomy except for the light around a table at a far end. Kafka advances, seeing Gabriela sitting there with her same companions from the coffee house. Kafka stops in front of the table.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_FROM_BEHIND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please sit down.

</VOICE_FROM_BEHIND>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka turns to see the last of the group come in, having obviously tailed him all along. A burly man with a BEARD. The leader of this anarchist cell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka sits down, in between a SOLEMN man with a moustache and a woman with a POCKMARKED face. The seedy YOUTH who led him in completes the circle.

Gabriela darts a fierce look at her overly-flippant colleague. And Kafka is sad about his dead friend for a different reason.

:SC: MANIACAL LAUGHTER - BEFORE DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeming to emanate from pitch blackness -- but then suddenly, fast, out of a tunnel under a bridge come running three terrified VAGRANTS, roused from slumber and scared out their wits by the ghastly, crazed CACKLING chasing after them, ECHOING under the arches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're at the river's edge, all running wildly, slipping and stumbling, every man for himself, as they desperately try to escape from whatever madness is closing in behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now from out of the tunnel appears their pursuer, seen only from the back, literally shaking with insane, involuntary, howling LAUGHTER. A horrific human hyena, far further gone than the sad wretches he's cornered here on this foul, moss-covered ledge in the cold wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing him, the vagrants freeze in their various positions -- then turn in panic to flee again as he starts after them, moving like an animal, a killer predator, laughing horribly as he goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The First Vagrant, propelled by fright, manages to make a stunning leap up a wall to grab onto some overhanging chains and pull himself up. The Second Vagrant finds himself trapped at the edge of the ledge -- with the Laughing Man choosing him as the one to go after first. He turns and jumps into the river. The Laughing Man, face still unseen, turns toward the climbing vagrant instead -- who clambers over the top just in time as the Laughing Man's fingernails claw the moldy wall beneath him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Third Vagrant has made it to some steps, and down them -- glancing back to see the Laughing Man coming after him -- to the small patch of muddy beach at the bottom, grey river water lapping at his ragged shoes. He doesn't know what to do -- he doesn't know how to swim! The Laughing Man is running down the steps now. The Vagrant starts wading out into the water, crying out in fear as the HOWLS behind him come closer and closer -- he throws himself forward, splashing vainly -- and feels the Laughing Man grabbing his ankles, pulling him back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Vagrant's screams join the Laughing Man's insane giggles as they thrash around violently in the water. The Laughing Man drags the Vagrant back to the beach, then back up the Steps, the Vagrant struggling helplessly, his head banging from step to step, his hands flailing around but finding nothing to clutch onto, his screaming going unheeded in this lonely part of the sleeping city.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Laughing Man drags him on, back to the slippery ledge and along it, dragging the Vagrant on his back through a filthy sewer alongside the wall, the Vagrant's cries choked by the stagnant water, but continuing as the Laughing Man drags him back into the dark tunnel, under the bridge, the two of them disappearing into the blackness again, their combined SHRIEKING louder than ever as it ECHOES horribly around the damp stone, then dimming as they go deeper and further away, unseen, until the screaming and the laughter can no longer be distinguished.

EDUARD'S ROOM

<DIRECTION>
Kafka comes in. Gabriela is here, gathering up Eduard's belongings from drawers.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIELA>
<DIRECTION>
(hardly glancing at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.

	They're not obliged to tell.

</GABRIELA>
<KAFKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It couldn't be for that incident with Burgel the other day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFKA>
<GABRIELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember. He could've killed Eduard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELA>
<KAFKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't believe that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFKA>
<GABRIELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't put it past him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELA>
<DIRECTION>
She's stuffed the last of the clothes into a small bag, goes to take the few other possessions from shelves and elsewhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka notices that he's standing by a dumbwaiter. For lack of anything better to do he pulls the rope to bring it up. It's filled with more clothes. Gabriela comes over with her bag, holding it out for him as Kafka puts the clothes in -- but not as many clothes as they thought. Behind the bundle, hidden at the back, is a briefcase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriela recognizes it. Kafka sees her surprised reaction. He removes the case and carefully flips the latches. Inside, a complex mechanism, wires connected to a clock -- and a clump of dynamite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka just looks at it sadly. He closes the case.

	It seems I knew Eduard a little bit, after all.

GROUND FLOOR OF BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ratty old concierge peeks up the stairs inquisitively. In the doorway of his room, a LODGER clips his fingernails at a little folding table, neatly lining them up. The concierge turns and notices.
</DIRECTION>
<CONCIERGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lodgers! Not one of them thinks to spare me such spectacles!

She slams the door on him then returns to her own apartment, slamming that door too. The hallway is empty now.

EDUARD'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriela turns to Kafka.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELA>
<KAFKA>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs at her relentlessness)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you've fallen into his trap. When he goes to bed at night Burgel dreams of inspiring as much fear in others as they inspire in him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFKA>
<GABRIELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's still easier for you to understand suicide, isn't it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELA>
<DIRECTION>
She's got his number. He's so in awe of her he has to turn away -- looking out the room's small window.
</DIRECTION>
<KAFKA>

	That street down there -- I always used to call it the approach road for suicides. It leads straight down to the bridge and the River.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFKA>
<GABRIELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Burgel hated Eduard. And me. I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELA>
<KAFKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Burgel doesn't like anybody!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFKA>
<GABRIELA>

	He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELA>
<KAFKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's jealous, yes, but that jealous? He's too cautious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFKA>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriela clears some more items off a mantelpiece with a sweeping gesture.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark. People disappear up there regularly. If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
	</DIALOGUE>

	I've heard of it happening.

	Usually.

Putting the bag down, Gabriela goes closer to Kafka, so close he almost cowers.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or what if there really was an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it? One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELA>
<KAFKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First these nameless authorities were the root of all evil, now it's insignificant Burgel. If indeed there was a mistake -- and a minor one at that -- you're suggesting someone went to a lot of trouble over something so trivial as to not matter at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFKA>
<GABRIELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELA>
<KAFKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now Burgel's one of the authorities?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFKA>
<DIRECTION>
She turns away from him, reddening.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For all his big talk he is. Does he really have access to the Directors of the firm as he always claims? -- or only the Deputy Managers -- people of no importance whatsoever. Someone ought to follow him for a change.

Kafka sees an opportunity to go to her, to try to calm her, to make a timid approach to this woman.

	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFKA>
<DIRECTION>
-- But she breaks away.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Burgel is only there for one purpose -- to spy on the employees and report any and all indiscretions, real or imagined. If he didn't send Eduard to the Castle, you can be damn sure he's in league with whoever greeted him there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(very upset now)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All those bastards are in league with each other -- why can't you see that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELA>
<DIRECTION>
She takes hold of him as if to shake some sense into him -- but really because she needs someone to hold.
</DIRECTION>
<KAFKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I don't see anything. I see a message on its way to me -- with all the right answers. Only it never arrives -- it's always just on its way.

Gabriela doesn't seem to be listening. She's looking around. the little room, as if it's someone else she's holding ...

</GABRIELA>
<DIRECTION>
Her head against his, Kafka tentatively touches her hair and she pulls away, the spell broken.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your ignorance of the way things are here is so appalling that it makes my head spin to listen to you and compare what you say and have in mind with the real situation!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELA>
<DIRECTION>
She storms out, vehemently picking up her bag on the way out, and slamming the door quakingly behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka is too astonished at her behavior to make a move for a moment, then he glances at the bomb-case she's left behind, then he goes out to the landing.

Rushing down the stairs in anger, tearing open the door at the middle landing and slamming that one too once past it.

Kafka comes through the door from the stairs, out of breath, and stops. He's too late. The hallway is empty. The front door at the end of it is shut. He makes a face and a moment later starts to go back up. Then stops again. Turns. Looks back at the front door. ... The one he didn't hear slam.

<DIRECTION>
They've come to the door to the stairs now.

<DIRECTION>
Looks up from his desk and sticks his chin out, which is his way of asking Kafka what the hell he wants. Kafka dares to come in.

The Chief Clerk has little time for such sentimentality. He gives Kafka a little exasperated look before reaching down to -- a right hand desk drawer -- which Kafka notices -- and taking out a folder.

	No -- just as I thought -- no entry for family.

<KEEPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least the account is current even if the employee isn't.

</KEEPER>

He pulls it out -- with great difficulty. The Orlac file is very, very thick. Kafka prepares himself to catch it, but the Keeper of the Files manages to hand it down to him without serious injury. Still, it's quite cumbersome and heavier than Kafka expects.

:SC: THE OFFICE - EVENING

<DIRECTION>
Kafka works at his desk, finger tapping at an adding machine. He checks the office clock -- nearly the end of the day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ASSISTANTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One is sweeping the floor. The other is scribbling at their desk. His pen blotches his paper. He has a fit and crumples it up and throws it down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAFKA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looks over at the Chief Clerk's office -- sees him writing intently at his desk, pausing to turn on a lamp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ASSISTANTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sweeping one bangs his knee against a desk and starts hopping about. The pen of the other one leaks again. He crumples up his new sheet and flings it away even more angrily than before. Then he examines his pen, determines that the cap at the back is loose, and starts banging it on his desk in an attempt to tighten it -- while the other assistant keeps jumping around holding his hurt kneecap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAFKA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Glances over his shoulder at them, starts to say something -- but then notices Burgel, not far away, sometimes blocked by other employees, walking in the direction of the Chief Clerk's office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ASSISTANTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The one assistant has just fixed his pen when the other one, still hopping around, bumps into him, causing him to knock over a bottle of ink. The two of them start shoving each other about.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka whirls around, can't ignore them any longer.
</DIRECTION>
<KAFKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you mind!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFKA>

The Assistants look at him, surprised at this outburst.

Oskar tries to lunge at Ludwig, but Kafka holds him back.

<KAFKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My assistants! You might as well have fallen from the sky for all the thought that was spent in choosing you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFKA>
<DIRECTION>
The Assistants look at each other sheepishly. Then smile at Kafka, submissively or mockingly, it's hard to tell.
</DIRECTION>
<OSKAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not our fault. We're naturally nervous.

KAFKA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wouldn't. It's the nightmare of his life. But now he's distracted again -- noticing Burgel walking away from the Chief Clerk's office (without ever having seem him actually enter it). And Burgel is carrying a parcel under his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<KAFKA>
<DIRECTION>
(to Assistants again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, you might as well go home -- go on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFKA>
<DIRECTION>
The Assistants do as they're told, Oskar returning to his desk to clear up, turning his back on Ludwig -- at which Ludwig immediately rushes up very close behind him and shakes his fist strenuously at him, turning away quickly when Oskar turns around again to try and catch Ludwig at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka isn't paying them any attention anymore. He efficiently cleans up his own space, keeping an eye on the Chief Clerk's office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the office bell RINGS the Chief Clerk immediately turns off his desk lamp, puts on his overcoat, and shuts his office light on his way out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka doesn't think twice. He forces himself to start walking to the Chief Clerk's office. Other departing office employees crisscross past him, but he walks in a straight line, businesslike, toward the Chief Clerk's office. He has a piece of paper in his hand. He enters the Chief Clerk's office, holds the paper out to drop on the Chief Clerk's desk -- but lets it slip off onto the floor. When he bends to retrieve it he quickly opens that bottom drawer where Eduard's file was -- but it's now empty.

Pauses in some shadows. He glances up at the distance, the way Burgel is going, up at --

Almost glowing as it's outlined against the blue of the darkening night.

WHORES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Giving Kafka the eye as he goes past doorway after doorway filled with their frightening/tempting forms. But he tries never to lose focus on the small form of Burgel further up the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Men milling about, up and down the street, prostitutes roaming amongst them, Kafka negotiating his way through. An urgent moment when he almost loses Burgel -- then sees him turning down an alley. Kafka hurries after him, avoiding a pair of drunken louts in the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

The Castle visible, but still a little in the distance. Kafka comes into view. He sees Burgel entering a building.

Very dingy. Burgel leaves the top of the stairs and walks down to a room at the end.

Kafka waits momentarily at the bottom, then goes up.

Peeking around the corner, he sees a YOUNG GIRL embracing Burgel in her doorway before letting him in.

OUTSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka comes out of the building. He hears a noise, turns around, sees Burgel and the girl on the tiny baroque balcony outside her room. Kafka retreats into the shadows. He watches the girl unwrap the parcel Burgel's given her. She smiles as a box of chocolates is revealed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAFKA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watches -- with an expression of guilt, sadness? Until a door suddenly opens at his back. A MAN shuffles out past him. A rather ugly WOMAN in a dressing gown holds the door open, giving Kafka a cursory look. Beyond her inside, a quick glimpse of MASOCHIST yelping as he's whipped.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what're you waiting for?

She's nodding him inside. Kafka backs away from her and her invitation.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leads him up to the attic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEARDED ANARCHIST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watches Kafka's approach. But sees nothing. His eyes are wide open, but lifeless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka stops at the anarchists' table. They're all lying around it on the floor except for the Pockmarked Anarchist who's slumped over it, her face sunk in a pool of her own blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Youthful Anarchist lies on his back, mouth open, still dribbling red. The Solemn Anarchist seems less than solemn due to the almost comic, convoluted, broken-backed position he's in. And the neck of the Bearded Anarchist is all twisted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka just stares in disbelief -- then SCRATCH! -- a noise from a spiral staircase close by, leading to the roof. Kafka looks around in panic -- the attic entrance is too far to run to and there's nowhere else to hide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man appears from above (MR. PICK). Legs draped in expensive trousers, the skirt of his high-buttoned coat flowing around them due to the breeze from the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_PICK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Come on -- there's no one up there. We're going now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_PICK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
He raises his arm up to help down whoever it is he's talking to. We hear a strange GROAN. Followed by the appearance -- unclear, from the back, face hidden, or otherwise blocked by Mr. Pick -- of A STRANGE hunched figure. He moves in a halting, cowering way. Mr. Pick helps him down the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_PICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it -- it's all right -- you've done very well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_PICK>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Pick's voice is reassuring, though he has a dark, diabolic face. They're at the bottom of the staircase now, Mr. Pick leading his odd companion toward the exit. The odd companion lurches towards the dead anarchists, but Mr. Pick restrains him.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_PICK>

	Never mind them -- they'll be attended to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_PICK>
<DIRECTION>
KAFKA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pretending to be one of the dead anarchists. Hiding under the large body of the Bearded Anarchist. Trying hard to emulate his lack of movement. Blood from the Bearded Anarchist's ear drips onto Kafka's face. He tries to blink it away while his other eye remains fixed on the two figures walking away to the doorway until they're through it and gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, he unloads the Bearded Anarchist and softly hurries over to the attic doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STAIRS

<DIRECTION>
The Strange Man utters another low moan as Mr. Pick leads him like a dog down the creaking old steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAFKA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Comes cautiously out onto the landing. He leans over the bannister, watching the two figures slowly going down the long stairs, vanishing from sight at a certain turn of the staircase on every floor and coming into view after a moment or so.

:SC: THE QUARRIES - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the outskirts of the city, beyond the Castle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Pick and the Strange Man approach. Some distance behind them, Kafka takes cover behind a tree, watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Pick leads the Strange Man down the central quarry to where a third man, a LABORER by the look of him, is waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka finds a vantage point somewhere above the central quarry. He flattens himself on the ground and peers over the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the quarry, Mr. Pick steps back a pace from the Strange Man as they meet up with the Laborer and suddenly grabs the Strange Man, pinning his arms behind him, baring his chest or the Laborer to stab a dagger into!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka is shocked by the abruptness of this. He sees the Strange Man slump to the ground. He crawls a little closer. He sees the Laborer replace the knife in its sheath on his belt, then help Mr. Pick drag the Strange Man off to some side shadows where they dump him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka strains forward a little, trying to make out their faces -- and the ground gives way!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. PICK AND THE LABORER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spin around at the noise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAFKA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lands at the bottom of the incline, dazed. He's still quite far away from the other end of the quarry where they are.

<DIRECTION>
MR. PICK AND THE LABORER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Look at each other once -- then go after the intruder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAFKA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sees them coming. Scrambles to his feet. It takes him a split second to establish his options. Namely, the best route is back up the way he came. If only he can get up it again as fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Pick and the Laborer start to run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka starts to climb. The incline is steep. The gravel is loose. He slips back down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Pick and the Laborer are gaining speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka digs his fingers into the dirt, pulling himself up with all his might, even though his shoes don't sustain holds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Pick is a better runner than the burly Laborer. He's almost there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka slips back down again. Mr. Pick could almost grab him -- but Kafka literally throws himself up the slope again, gasping -- and Mr. Pick stretches but can't reach that far and Kafka's nearly at the top again -- Mr. Pick climbing after him now -- and Kafka's arm comes over the edge, he struggles over, kicking gravel back down in Mr. Pick's face. Mr. Pick slides back down to the bottom -- and Kafka's gone.

The Laborer fell over Mr. Pick as he came crashing back down, now Mr. Pick pushes him off in one direction while he goes another.

A number of streets branching off. Kafka sees Mr. Pick coming down one of them -- and the Laborer coming down another. Kafka runs off along a third.

CIRCUITOUS PASSAGE

Kafka runs. Looks behind him. Mr. Pick is coming. He runs faster, under a weird archway. Looks behind him. Mr. Pick and the Laborer are coming. Kafka darts down a side street.

Another twisting little road. He winds around one corner only to be met by another, the end of this street impossible to determine.

Mr. Pick and the Laborer are catching up.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Of a monster. Horribly disfigured, scarred and stitched. And it isn't the kind of patchwork mess caused by acid or accident. There seems to be design behind it. Human design. And beneath all this warped, mutilated flesh, almost unrecognizable ... the features of the vagrant snatched from the River.

Revulsion. He goes.

The BARKING of a DOG outside distracts him. He stands up to stretch by his open window -- and we SEE that he's wearing a suit that's far too big for him, sleeves overhanging his skinny arms and ands, trouser bottoms drowning his shoes. He looks out at the sky which is turning blue.

Dead silence after the daily racket of typewriters and telephones and adding machines. Kafka works alone in the utterly deserted office building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks out the window and sees a POLICEMAN walking by on the street below. He thinks again about going to the law -- but goes back to work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hears a SOUND. He looks around. A sort of a SCRATCHING sound. It's coming from the other end of the office somewhere. Maybe the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka walks slowly back there. At the bathroom door he pauses momentarily, then turns the handle to go inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCRATCH, SCRATCH. Kafka looks for the source of the sound -- and in sudden startled shock instantly finds it -- where a huge arm has just been thrust through a small, high window -- and the ugly hand at the end of the arm is feeling around for the window-latch.

Kafka starts backing away -- as the hand flips open the latch -- and now the window, swinging open with a bang, and the rest of the intruder starts coming into view -- out before all of him appears Kafka has run out and slammed the door behind him.

ELEVATOR

Kafka descending. The elevator cranking slowly downwards. Then, nearing the ground floor, it slows down even further. Then it suddenly stops dead. Kafka reaches for the walls to steady himself. He looks through the gate, assessing the distance to the ground floor below. He tries the gate but it won't open.

He looks around the tiny space of the elevator. The roof hatch. He reaches up, pushes it open, starts to climb up -- and YAAHH! -- the Maniac's face appears in the opening! It's another monster face -- this one even worse than the one Kafka uncovered at the quarries. A groaning, drooling, misshapen lump of wrinkled tissue. And its owner's arms now come through to stretch after Kafka.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka beats them back with the umbrella while still trying to pull the unyielding gate open. The Maniac yelps as Kafka bashes the umbrella up at him, dodging his head out of the way each time the umbrella sweeps back at him, swinging his thick arms wildly to ward off blows and try and snatch the umbrella for himself. He finally retreats under the barrage of blows and Kafka quickly takes the opportunity to lever open the gate with the umbrella.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Maniac's face reappears overhead. Kafka stabs the umbrella up at him some more -- and the Maniac manages to grab it. Kafka sits down on the elevator edge to jump down to the ground floor and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MANIAC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lunges forward from above, scooping both arms down in a vain attempt to catch Kafka just as he drops out of sight -- landing on the ground floor with a roll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Maniac HOWLS at his failure, his features even more horribly contorted, Practically filling the small opening of the roof hatch as he SHRIEKS. And as his atrocious face comes CLOSER and CLOSER and CLOSER -- one of his eyeballs falls out! -- POP! -- out of the socket suddenly -- dangling into the elevator, hanging by a single sinewy bloody thread. The Maniac cries out and reaches for the eyeball, bringing it back up to try and stuff back in place ...

Mr. Pick leans against a door, trying to keep back the howling horde of prisoners pushing from the other side. Another JAILER joins him, helping him to try and push the door closed.

THE LABORATORY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A real mad scientist's workshop. Chemicals of bizarre colors rush and FIZZ through mazes of glass pipes and beakers, in some places boiling and steaming, in others frosting or freezing. Circuits and test tubes flash and glow as sparks and filamentary arcs CRACKLE with electric incandescence. insane instruments and devices, interconnected with complex wires, perform strange and villainous functions. It's the most modern setting we've yet seen -- but at the same time all this futuristic technology seems somehow archaic, as if put together from old, familiar materials and elements, both eccentric and eclectic.

The chain that runs through the floors of the Castle carrying documents runs up and down through the laboratory too.

Kafka seems deadened himself by all that he's seeing -- until he sees someone he recognizes. The Bearded Anarchist. Kafka goes closer.

Holding himself together, and with new determination etched on his face, Kafka walks to the center of the lab -- and an operating table. Ignoring the implications of the table, he sets down the bomb-briefcase -- flicking the latches to open it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sight of the explosive mechanism inside causes him a moment's hesitation, but a look round at various animal parts hanging from hooks above the table or bobbing in jars alongside sinister implements laid out in preparation for an operation renews his anger -- and he decisively turns the dial on the bomb's timer-clock, setting it to the maximum allowance of one hour.

Just as he reaches the light something lunges at him from one side! It's the Laughing Man, hysterical as ever, face now SEEN for the first time, SCREECHING, salivating, eyes watering.

Caught up in the chain, he's carried aloft with it, up to the ceiling. The chain is the lifeline of the Castle and does not, could not, ever stop. Instead it forces Mr. Pick to go along with it, his head CRACKING through the glass or wood "manhole" cover through which the chain passes.

He passes through a small park, approaching a gate on the other side of it. Leaves RUSTLING. Mist swirling around him. He opens the gate and -- BOO!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GABRIELA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing there, half in shadow, in profile. Her glorious profile.
</DIRECTION>
<KAFKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gabriela! -- you did get away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFKA>
<GABRIELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew you walked this way to work. I wanted to find you before they did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELA>
<KAFKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I've just come from the Castle. It's over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFKA>
<GABRIELA>
<DIRECTION>
(her eye glancing far away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Over? It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELA>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka is beginning to sense something quite wrong with her.
</DIRECTION>
<KAFKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gabriela ...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFKA>
<GABRIELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELA>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka just watches her ... The breeze sings in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever watched a person deteriorate? Day by day. I don't mean in a spiritual sense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELA>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka doesn't answer. She turns fully to him. The other side of her beautiful face is ... fungus. Alive. Seething. Frothing. Bubbling. Kafka backs away a couple of steps.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only two steps back? Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELA>
<KAFKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I -- I found your jailer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFKA>
<GABRIELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the result of their elixir of youth. They were to come and check on it during the night. I contrived to miss the appointment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELA>
<KAFKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're dead now. We can get help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFKA>
<GABRIELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELA>
<KAFKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a new potion -- he said it was perfected.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFKA>
<GABRIELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know there is. And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELA>
<KAFKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you, they're dead. It's finished.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFKA>
<GABRIELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why should I believe a man who never believed me? They're absolutely right, you know -- guilt should never be doubted. It's easier that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELA>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka starts to back away some more. Gabriela starts to follow him.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you've just escaped for the moment. Just as I did. As Eduard did. As they let us do. But only for the moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELA>
<KAFKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- not this time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFKA>
<GABRIELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know better than you what people will say when they have to. When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELA>
<KAFKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Listen to me --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFKA>
<GABRIELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do. Always. You understand the world better than any of us, Kafka. And what it's becoming.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've always held you in the highest regard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIELA>
<DIRECTION>
And suddenly she's slashed a knife across Kafka's chest. He shouts in pain, staggering backwards. She comes after him.
</DIRECTION>
<KAFKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Gabriela!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFKA>
<DIRECTION>
She comes after him, blade glistening. Kafka does his best to run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka giddily staggers forward, one arm wrapped around his bleeding chest, Gabriela close behind him. Too close for him to get away. He turns to face her as he reaches the bridge and as she comes upon him again with the knife, raising his arm to block the thrust and hold her wrist back. She's strong, though, made more so by her madness. She forces him down to the ground, straddling him, the knife pushing closer. Kafka gasps in pain, finally succumbs, no longer able to hold his hand up in defense, simply shutting his eyes with a terrible sigh to await the fatal stab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It doesn't come. Almost. But not quite. Gabriela's arm pauses, shaking in the cool, cloudy air, her sleeve trembling in the breeze off the River, the sharp blade, inches from Kafka's throat, flashing in the new day's light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriela stares away over the River, the destroyed half of her face in shadow again, the other more strikingly beautiful than ever. As Kafka watches, passive, she gets off him and slowly walks to the wall of the bridge, letting the knife drop from her hand along the way. Kafka manages to lift himself to his knees, clutching his wound. He looks up. Gabriela in one graceful movement climbs over the wall and throws herself into the River.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka lowers his head.
</DIRECTION>

:SC: CONTINENTAL COFFEE SHOP - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quiet in here. Breakfast business not as crowded as evening. Kafka sits alone at his usual table. Looking dazed, almost in shock. Mostly just tired. Waiting. He sips from his coffee cup. He COUGHS a little into his napkin -- and notices blood on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has a pen in his hand. Tapping it slowly on a newspaper on the table ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bizzlebek comes into the coffee house. He sees Kafka sitting in the far corner and gives a grand smile and wave. But then he notices Kafka's other friends entering and he'd rather not have to deal with them -- so he gives Kafka a "catch you later" gesture and turns onto his own usual stool at the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kafka stares at his friends over there. They're taking off their coats and greeting other people. The girl, Anna, is the first to start walking to join him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to write, a first line that has occurred to him, the pen moving as if he can't help himself ...
</DIRECTION>
<KAFKA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dearest Father ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFKA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's approaching. Kafka just watches her coming. He knows he'll end up going out with her, sleeping with her, getting engaged to her ... We see the future on Kafka's face
</DIRECTION>
<KAFKA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You asked me recently why I maintain that I am afraid of you ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAFKA_S_VOICE>

CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: KAFKA'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alone again in his little room, Kafka writes on into the night. The famous "Letter To His Father" is pages and pages long. We notice too that his chest has been bandaged. He COUGHS a little as he forces himself to keep writing.
</DIRECTION>
<KAFKA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naturally things cannot in reality fit together the way the evidence does in my letter -- life is more than a Chinese puzzle. But in my opinion something has been achieved which so closely approximates the truth that it might reassure us both a little and make our living and our dying easier.
	</DIALOGUE>

FADE OUT

<DIRECTION>
FADE IN

:SC: WATERFRONT WHARVES - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Assistants sit on a big packing crate, brushing soot from their suits, shaking dust out of their hair, fiddling with the rips in their jackets and trousers.
</DIRECTION>
<LUDWIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We could go back to the office. Explain ourselves to the Chief Clerk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUDWIG>
<OSKAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'd drive us away. That Kafka's made things very hot for us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSKAR>
<LUDWIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand he was wounded in the lung.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't matter. It's too late for all of us.

</OSKAR>
<LUDWIG>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's to become of us now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUDWIG>
<DIRECTION>
Oskar has a long think.
</DIRECTION>
<OSKAR>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at L.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amerika. That's the place to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSKAR>
<DIRECTION>
Ludwig jumps off the box and gapes at Oskar, tremendously impressed by this brainstorm.
</DIRECTION>
<LUDWIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone in Amerika has a toaster in their building!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUDWIG>
<DIRECTION>
Oskar jumps down from the box.
</DIRECTION>
<OSKAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then that's the place for us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSKAR>
<LUDWIG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amerika for us!

</LUDWIG>
<OSKAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amerika!

And, linking arms, they do a strange dance along the quay ...
