EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - SUNSET A serene landscape, mist collecting as the red ball of a sun dips behind the mountains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the middle of a field stands a bare-chested man facing the sunset. He is HARRIS, forty-ish, greying but handsome, and very fit. His hands are outstretched as if embracing an invisible entity. He seems filled with some sort of transcendental power. Now, an air of fulfillment and resolve settles over him. He turns and walks away from us. CAMERA ADJUSTS and reveals--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UNITY HOUSE - LONG SHOT - SUNSET Once the home of Victorian Gentry, a few seasons of amateur repair work have not compensated for decades of neglect. But now as Harris walks towards it, the fading daylight and long shadows turn it into a fantasy castle. MUSIC ECHOES faintly from within; it's "In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida" by Iron Butterfly. If the music didn't place the era for us, the battered VW MINIBUS parked outside the house does; it's covered with flower paintings, slogans, and the ubiquitous peace sign.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Harris approaches the house, a dozen or so YOUNG PEOPLE rush to greet him and embrace him. Extending his arms out to enclose them all, he goes inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COMMON ROOM - SUNSET This was probably a stately parlor in its day. There is a funky assembly of odd handmade furniture. There are muslin curtains on the windows, crude paintings, and quilts covering ripped chairs and couches. Despite the squalor, there is a neatness to the place. Now, the CAMERA begins to ROAM through the room and down the hallways lined with fading wallpaper.

All these comments are made in relaxed and good natured tones. Finally the CAMERA PANS OVER to a little storage alcove beneath the servant's stairway. A HAND reaches in and opens the door, and inside we SEE cartons, antique toys... and then CYNTHIA, a pretty 13 year old girl who wears funky clothing and a haunted, nervous expression.

The VOICES stop as everyone awaits an answer. CAMERA PANS across the common room, to the end we haven't seen yet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the center of the room is a big cistern or font. As we watch, Harris has just DUNKED someone in it. The person steps out, laughing, sloshing in amber liquid. Standing around are other people, some already dripping wet, others awaiting their turns. Some are clothed and wet, others in varying degrees of undress. It all seems slightly off, slightly eerie, despite their smiles and cheer. Harris splashes himself with the amber liquid from the tub, pushes his hair back.

I don't know how much my colleague Dr. Berrisford has told you about my methods. I have my detractors... but I have my successes, too! We're going to get you out of your depression... We're going to got you out of your neurosises... We're going to got you out of that hideous hospital robe and into a flimsy revealing negligee--one with the little holes here?

INT. VICTOR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT They come in, turning on lights. It's a dingy couple of rooms, but lush with its variety of objects. Everything looks like it came from the Age of Aquarius: beanbag furniture, paper "Tiffany" shades on hanging lights, blacklight posters, hanging macrame planters.

Cynthia loves the room and everything in it. But she is particularly drawn to a canvas on an easel in the far corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAINTING - HER POV It's of her, sitting serenely in a meadow, the Unity House perched prominently on a hill in the distance. (In the doorway, the bare-chested FIGURE of a man may--or may not--be barely visible.) Cynthia's clothes in the painting are the ones she wore in the opening scene.

<DIRECTION>
Cynthia and Victor are making love. Not violent, but slow, passionate, dreamlike. They are completely enjoying each other. The satisfaction seems spiritual. They stare into each other's eyes the entire time. They are lost.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gradually Victor's rhythm builds. As his momentum increases, as the ecstasy nears, Cynthia accelerates too. Heaving, gasping, they are approaching a beautiful climax.

But just when it seems Victor is on the verge, the very threshold, he stops and JUMPS violently out of bed.

A bright white light melts across Cynthia's face. She looks up. Something draws her forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CYNTHIA - SIDE ANGLE She begins walking, passing behind CLOTHES RACKS and LOCKERS. Then, somehow, the SHADOWS of these things become the SHADOWS of TREES, and then Cynthia is
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON A BROAD FIELD which leads down to a POND. Twenty or so PEOPLE are gathered at the edge of the water. We see the Unity House in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cynthia moves behind a tree to watch. Harris stands waist- deep in the pond. The Unity House Members all sit or stand on the shore. Harris holds his hands out in a gesture. A girl comes forward through the group out into the water. It is Cynthia, the younger Cynthia, with long hair in a braid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles at Harris as she nears him. He clutches her hands. Behind the tree, Cynthia watches "herself," absorbed.

Harris looks into Cynthia's eyes. He touches her face.

We're in the clinic's swimming pool! On the edge of the pool, Cynthia SCREAMS, drops to her knees in horror.

</DIRECTION>
<BERRISFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(thinking aloud)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fascinating. She's a textbook specimen from a collective environment, an immersion philosophy, run by an extremely manipulative figurehead with Messianic delusions. Unity House at its apex must have been a classic matrix of belief impression overlaid on collectivity--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(exciting himself)

	That would indicate she's symptomatic of a hypothetical Borderline Personality syndrome among cult followers, all externalizing their anxiety!

At the opposite and of the hallway, a window is broken. Cynthia runs to it. There is a WOMAN'S SCREAM from the street below. PEOPLE YELLING. Cynthia looks out and down.

A TRICKLE OF BLOOD streams out at the edge, but Edgar doesn't see it.

Edgar yanks and pulls with all his might, groaning and heaving. Finally he stops in frustration. He sits an a duct, resting.

PARKING LOT The box of his possessions is still on the roof of the car. Alan sees this, staggers against the car, fights a wave of nausea. Struggling to remain composed, he takes his pulse. Feels his head. Suspicion crosses his face. Then his hand moves to his shirt pocket.

FLASH CUT of himself taking the pill by the clinic sign.

<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cynthia! Cynthia!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
The two security guards start running over. One of them has his gun drawn. Alan wants to run, but he sees there is no way out. He sticks his hands in the air. The guards are upon him. They start leading him away.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes doctors got personally involved. I think it's a mistake. You've got to keep professional.

He looks back at Hettie. He sees a fire alarm.

Suddenly, he grabs one of the Guard's guns. He dives against the wall and pulls the fire alarm.

Alan runs from the guards, shooting but missing. He runs up the hall in the opposite direction of Cynthia's room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hides in a doorway. They pass. He heads back up to Cynthia's room. He grabs the cop's chair and runs into
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CYNTHIA'S ROOM - NIGHT He slams the door and rams the metal chair log into the bolt latch to secure the door. SIRENS and BELLS continue. Alan looks over. The room is dark, except for the red light flashing on and off. Cynthia is crouched in the far corner by the open window.

We can see that the room is otherwise empty of anybody.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Cynthia, please. I'm not going to be able to come back, but you have to listen! Berrisford's been tampering with the medication for everybody in the group--that's why they've been committing suicide--he's been making them crazy--

</ALAN>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Harris comes to me... He speaks to me--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNTHIA>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A drug induced psychotic state is very suggestible. All we've hearing for days is "Harris, Harris,"... so that's what we all saw... That's what I saw when I took Ralph's pill! It's all part of Berrisford's plan--he has this fucked-up theory about how you still think you're part of the Unity House, and the only way he can prove it is if you want to kill yourself!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>

Behind Alan, the dark shape of Berrisford emerges from outside the window. It is climbing inside from the ledge.

Alan turns around.

Berrisford bashes him in the head, neatly slicing off some skin. Alan flies against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gun is knocked away.

<DIRECTION>
Alan writhes a little, then dips into unconsciousness,

Cynthia is a basket case. She looks at Alan.

Berrisford comes to her and starts giving her an injection.

</ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT The corridors are run amuck with isolation patients (the worst kind) all escaped from their rooms. Alan runs out of Cynthia's room. He is surrounded by bizarre-looking people screaming, singing, dancing, praying.

Hettie is by the stairway helping Isolation patients exit.

The guards see Alan. They come after him. He runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alan scans every room. He slams into patients. The guards aren't far behind. Alan turns a corner, passing a door marked "NOT AN EXIT: ROOF ACCESS." It is ajar. He goes in without the guards seeing him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT It is dark, but the red lights FLASH. He runs up several flights. The landings face onto the outside with a railing, open, no glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns a corner. Cynthia is there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She in perched on the outside of the railing, a serene expression on her face, the wind blowing her frail white gown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alan freezes. He moves towards her slowly, hands outstretched.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Cynthia, take my hand... Just relax... Think about what you're doing... Stay calm... I want you to take my hand...

<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's so beautiful.

Alan turns. There on the stair above is Berrisford, his face dancing in the flashing red light.

FALLING It is a dizzying spiral. We hear the WIND RUSHING up as we go FASTER AND FASTER down. We SLAM into the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CYNTHIA'S HEAD hits rock.

<DIRECTION>
ON HER FACE She is still. Blood drips out her nose and mouth. She is dead. We HOLD ON HER until gradually bright light pours in over her. The CAMERA LIFTS UP revealing

EXT. UNITY HOUSE - DAY Cynthia rises and walks towards the house through a field in the foreground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks up the porch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNITY HOUSE ENTRANCE - DAY She opens the door. Everything is clean and fresh. Flowers. Light. Birds CHIRPING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harris is at the far and of the hall. There is an intense white light behind him. He is smiling beatifically. Cynthia goes towards him. As she nears him, she reaches out her hands. He does too. They clasp.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cynthia!

Suddenly she FALLS.

EXT. HOSPITAL BUILDING - NIGHT She is unconscious. She swings twelve stories above the pavement.

Cynthia looks at Berrisford deliriously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He CHANGES from Berrisford to Harris with each FLASH. He comes to the railing where Alan is holding on.

<DIRECTION>
Almost politely, he tries to undo Alan's grip.

Alan's grip on Cynthia slips down to her fingers.

<BERRISFORD>

	Let her go. Let her go and I'll forget your disobedience. You can stay one with me in the psychosis and cult behavior study. We'll publish our findings together--

</BERRISFORD>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Publish this, asshole!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
Alan SWINGS one leg up, KICKS Berrisford in the groin. Berrisford HOWLS and suddenly his calm demeanor cracks. Snarling like an animal, he stomps, claws and even bites at Alan's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (to Cynthia)

	Don't you hear him? He's trying to bribe me--but I'm not letting go! I'll go with you, but I'm not letting go!

</ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
Berrisford sees the discarded gun... picks it up. He aims unsteadily... SHOOTS. Alan yanks himself out of the way. Berrisford misses. Berrisford moves closer. Raises the g= barrel at point black range towards Alan's hand.

Berrisford SHOOTS. One of Alan's finger joints is BLOWN AWAY. He SCREAMS, his grip loosens, and he SLIDES down the railing. Berrisford moves several yards to stay close... begins to POUND on Alan's mutilated hand.

Alan's grip on her slips down to two fingers. They CRACK. She yells from the pain. She swings in the breeze.

Alan is weakening. He is losing consciousness. He knows he is about to die.

<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Berrisford?

Suddenly Berrisford freezes.

The other guard appears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They start helping Alan up by Pulling his arm. As they help him up, Berrisford, in a state of shock, backs further up the wall. He leans against the wall and puts the gun to his head. He trembles. He pulls the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK, CLICK, CLICK. Out of bullets. The others are too busy to be noticing what he in doing. Just as they pull Cynthia to the edge, she looks up to see:

There is joy through her delirium. She is just able to clasp hands with him briefly before she disappears behind a set of double doors.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY A new station wagon whisks along the pretty road.

INT. STATION WAGON - DAY Alan drives, Cynthia looks at a map. They both look relaxed. They both have bandaged hands.

EXT. UNITY HOUSE - DAY Through the greenery are the charred and overgrown remains of Unity House. A chiseled sign embedded into a tree verifies it. Alan and Cynthia pull up, park. Cynthia gets out and looks around. She goes to the front entrance. Alan follows her in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRONT ROOM - DAY A mere skeleton of what it was. Daylight pours in through the faded, burnt slats of wood. Patches of woods have sprouted up. Cynthia wanders in and marvels at it all. Only piles of charcoal signify where furniture was.

Alan meanders in from the other and of the house.

Alan smiles. He pulls her close to him. They look into each other's eyes. Neither of them is completely at ease with the other, but there is honest affection. They hug, then kiss.

	Real funny, Doctor. Try this for laughs: As soon as you're ambulatory, you're going in front of a Grand Jury, and you're going to be charged with six counts of obstruction of justice and two counts of assault. Then it gets choice: five counts of murder in the first degree, one count of murder in the second degree. Add the civil liability to all that, and you're going to have plenty of time to write that book.

	What's the matter?

</ALAN>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was just thinking about Gilda. Somehow, she knew. She kept talking about "him," but I didn't know what she meant. She said the answer was inside me. Why would she say that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNTHIA>
<DIRECTION>
Alan doesn't have an answer. She sighs.

</DIRECTION>

She stands at the top of what remains of the stairs.

We FOLLOW HER DOWN. Just as she nears the bottom, the TICKING of a clock is audible. It gets LOUDER. Cynthia reaches the last stop and turns into

Cynthia turns and we PAN BACK TO THE STAIRCASE. It is new, unburnt. Two KIDS come scrambling down the stairs laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entranceway, the archway to the front room, the staircase are all intact, just as we saw them in the opening scene.
</DIRECTION>

CYNTHIA peers into the kitchen. Two WOMEN in work aprons are kneading bread dough, chopping vegetables. They smile at Cynthia.

Ralph is crouched with victor in a corner. They are laughing warmly.

Cynthia nears Harris. He smiles at her and kisses her. Everyone in the room turns to her. Harris holds up a shiny and sharp knife with ornamentation on the handle. Cynthia doesn't see it yet.

He puts the pointed tip against her chest.

Cynthia clasps her hand around the knife at her chest, Harris lets go. She holds it there by herself, completely hypnotized by his words, by his eyes.

She is weak now. She is about to do it.
</DIRECTION>

Her grasp tightens around the knife handle. She's trembling. She takes a deep breath.
</DIRECTION>
<CYNTHIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!

</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cynthia?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
She drops the knife. The knife is all rusty and corroded. The floor is a charred mass.

Cynthia turns around.

Alan comes in the front door. The room is again its empty, skeletal self, blackened and silent.
