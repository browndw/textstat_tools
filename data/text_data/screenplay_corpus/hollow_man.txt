:SC: The Hollow Man
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN: On complete darkness. A SMALL DOOR swings open. A circle of light reveals that we I re looking down the length of a tube. At the far end of the tube, we see a gloved hand dangling a rat. The hand shoves the frightened rat into the tube and closes the door behind it. The rat s stark white fur bristles and it begins to pad down the tube s length. After several feet, the tube opens up into a dimly lit cubicle. The rat hesitates and stops. The SOUNDS of gentle BREATHING whispers in the rat s ears. The rat turns round to head back down the tube, but a door swings shut, trapping it in the cubicle. The rat cowers as the BREATHING turns to SNORTING. The rat s head jerks around, looking for signs of danger, but the cubicle is empty. The rat sees a water dish on the far side of the cubicle - a place to hide - and dashes toward it. But an invisible force descends. The rat squeals in agony as something smashes down on its body, crushing it. A LOUD BELLOW rings out, and the rat flies into the air, halting a few feet off the ground. Its body writhes, struggling against the unholy force. Then a sick crunch of tiny bones snapping. All life quickly drains from the levitating body. Dead eyes... The creature s corpse floats in mid-air. Then the white fur of the rat explodes in a shower of blood. HUGE BLOOD SMEARED INCISORS appear, as do the red-slicked ape- like lips. The gaping bloody mouth bites again into the rat.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the background we hear Jay Leno s monologue from the Tonight Show. A small lamp and the glow from a computer screen illuminates SEBASTIAN CAINE, late twenties with the shabby good looks of a perpetual grad-student. Wiry framed and wearing only boxer shorts, Sebastian sips coffee from an Einstein coffee mug. He peers at a complex computer rendered molecule displayed on his screen. He pecks a few keys and the molecule shifts slightly, then falls apart. Sebastian pulls a twinkie from a hostess box, unwraps the cellophane and sucks it down. He attacks the keyboard with renewed vigor. Another molecule appears on the screen. Sebastian s fingers fly across the keyboard. The molecule blinks on and off, it trembles and twists apart.

Sebastian pears out his window. Across the courtyard, a light comes on in a neighboring window. He sees a BRUNETTE, mid-twenties, absolutely stunning, enter her living room. The Brunette thumbs through the mail, tosses it and then begins to undress. Sebastian loans over to the window, getting interested. But when the brunette reaches her bra and panties, she crosses to the window and lowers her shades.

Sebastian leans back in his chair and closes his eyes. He s obviously tired. He opens his eyes and stares up at the ceiling. Painted across the white matte finish in big red letters is a brief reminder - You Should Be Working. Sebastian sighs, leans forward and begins pecking away again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER: The television is now only static. We pan by his alarm clock. 4 am. We find Sebastian pacing in front of his computer. He gets an idea... slides back in his chair. Types away again. The molecule reforms on the computer screen. He types a few more keys, waits, watches the molecule. Nothing happens. He hits a few more keys and watches intently for a reaction.

Digital phone rings. In the bed, LINDA FOSTER, late twenties, stirs from a deep sleep. As she straggles out of bed and over to her desk, we notice a young man sleeping next to her.

INT. HABITAT S CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We slowly push down a hallway panelled by Plexiglas chambers. Each chamber looks as if it s tailored for a specific animal, although no animals are visible. As we pass one habitat, something slams into the Plexiglas and begins barking. Another HOWL joins in. Then SCREECHING. Suddenly the hallway fills with a dozen animal cries. THUMP. THUMP. The Plexiglas on several chambers vibrates as if angry animals were slamming against it. But still, no animals are seen. Above each chamber, VIDEO SCREENS display THERMAL IMAGES revealing heat signatures of the various animals, but they remain invisible to the naked eye. MATT taps on a sheet of Plexiglas which seals off another seemingly empty cage.

Linda opens a lock-box at the end of the hallway and pulls out a two tranquilizer guns. She hands one to Matt. AROUND THE CORNER A slight distortion shimmers as something runs past us. We hear HOOTS and FOOTSTEPS. Looking down the shadowy corridor, we hear grunting and a haunting heavy breathing. The control door is closed though and something large and angry is throwing itself against it. We can t see anything. A few moments later, Linda and Matt round the corner, wearing goggles and leveling their pistols.

The buzz of conversation is punctuated by an amplified HEARTBEAT, thumping its familiar rhythm. Bah-bump. Bah-bump. In the center of the room, Sebastian, dressed only in a pair of jogging shorts is strapped to a table inclined at a 45 degree angle. Electrodes are strapped to his body. An I.V. tube snakes from the needle in his vein up to a bag of saline solution. Dripping slowly. Linda makes last minute checks of some of the equipment. She pats Sebastian on the shoulder.

INT. LABORATORY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sebastian screams in dire pain. He struggles against his restraints as his skin liquefies into a muscular mass. It's like something's eating away at him. Gruesome. The yells become louder and more painful to hear.
</DIRECTION>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Oh god! NO! STOP IT! STOP IT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<DIRECTION>
The muscular system begins to dissolve, leaving a struggling skeleton wrapped with tentacular blood vessels and stuffed with the major organs. The beating heart, the heaving lungs.

<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pulse is 180 .... holding stable.

Screaming.... Then the organs go. Then the blood vessels. Leaving only a skeleton howling in pain. The jawbones spread wide ... Screaming... screaming...

Then as if someone had poured acid all over the bones, the skeleton evaporates into nothingness.

INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER

The chamber is half constructed out of Plexiglas at the end of the Hallway of Habitats.

<DIRECTION>
On the recovery bed, a sheet drapes over Sebastian's invisible body. The gentle bleatings of medical machinery pound out a dulling rhythm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda sleeps in a corner chair as Matt slips into the room. He checks the readouts on Sebastian then takes a seat by Linda. She wakes with a start.

Linda and Matt watch intently. Then suddenly... the sheets thrash violently. A yell of pain.

	<DIALOGUE>
	The lights! Turn off the goddamn lights! Ah Christ!

The sheet rises and slips away. The wires, seemingly connected to thin air, spread out like a spider's web and then fall away one-by-one. The monitors all go dead.

<DIRECTION>
Matt motions to a dark corner of the room, toward a mirror and sink. We push in on the mirror. No reflection. Suddenly it fogs up ... Sebastian's breath. A finger tracing appears in the fog ... but of course we see no finger. The sink faucet twists on and water runs. It cups into the shape of hands and lifts into the air, splashing against the surface of Sebastian's face. Beads of water cling to his f ace, outlining it I shape f or a moment before dripping away.

Linda's hair drops back to her shoulders.

Deserted and dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Late. Sarah rubs her temples. Her eyelids are heavy. She's having real trouble staying awake. The buzzing fluorescent light isn't helping either.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RECOVERY ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sheets ruffle and the indentation disappears from the bed. We can hear breathing and soft sound of bare feet shuffling against linoleum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA SLOWLY PANS toward the door, as if we, are following someone walking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door handle turns and the door pushes open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY OF HABITATS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE SLOWLY TRACK DOWN the Hallway of the Habitats. We hear the sounds of sleeping creatures. A couple of them growl at something unseen. The growling follows the invisible something as it passes by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The laboratory door opens and shuts again. Ghostly. We see papers shuffling at one of the work stations. A glass moves slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah reclines in her chair. Fast asleep, Behind her is the glass wall, revealing the empty hallway behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But a small portion of the glass fogs, as if someone had just breathed on it. As the fogged part quickly clears, we see the door to the observation room quietly open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SARAH, still sleeping. We hear a whisper.
</DIRECTION>
<SEBASTIAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sarah. Are you awake?

Her heavy breathing mixes with Sebastian's.

(cont'd) (barely audible)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah's hair moves slightly, as if a hand were running through it. And then we see her shirt move, like fingers were tracing over it. Down from the shoulder to her breast. Around her nipple. Sarah moans slightly, as if she were dreaming, but she doesn't stir. And then her breasts cup slightly, as if they were being touched... softly... gently. Her breathing becomes harder, more labored, erotic... and then she... BOLTS AWAKE. Bar eyes wide with fear. She jumps and cups her own breasts and looks around the room. It's empty, of course. She jumps over to the monitor and checks on Sebastian's room. The heat signature isn't there.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Caine! Goddamnit, Dr. Caine! Are you in here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>

INT. RESEARCH LAB - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Sebastian, wearing surgical scrubs sits in an examination chair. Wire leads sprout from the electrodes covering his head and arms. The electrodes seem to outline his body.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, how was your first night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<SEBASTIAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	I guess I didn't hear. I had the radio on.

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah rolls up Sebastian's sleeve, revealing empty air. She wraps a bungee cord around the nothing, pulls it tight and sprays the inside of his elbow with dye. She acts very self conscious.
</DIRECTION>
<SEBASTIAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN_S_VOICE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>

<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I...I'm fine. Hold still. This might hurt a bit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
The surface of his skin sheens in the light as Linda searches for a vein. She slaps his arm several times, then plunges a hypodermic needle into his skin. His skin bends and gives. The needle remains in sight after it slips through the visible surface. Sarah presses down on the hypo plunger, releasing a dye into his bloodstream.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Caine... this might sounds stupid, but are you... are you looking at me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
The red dye twists into a long snaking red tube up and down his arm. His vein.
</DIRECTION>
<SEBASTIAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I was looking at the clock. Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah draws the plunger back, sucking Sebastian's blood into the hypodermic and then yanks the needle out.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just felt like someone was staring at me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>

Sarah pulls the vial off the needle and labels it with a grease pencil. After a few beats the red dye in Sebastian's blood stream dissolves and disappears, as does the liquid in the vial.

INT. SPECTRAL LAB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dim lights. Janice and Frank both don eye guards. Frank switches on a low intensity laser on and it's beam shoots across the room. The beam distorts slightly in the center of the room. As Frank widens the spectral pattern, suddenly the beam splits into a million different spectral rainbows, momentary illuminating Sebastian's entire frame in a glowing tingle of light.
</DIRECTION>

INT. MAIN LABORATORY

LINDA pulls vials from the cyclotrons and props blood sample slides. She slips them under the microscope. She takes a sip of her Diet Coke and puts it on the table. She pears into the microscope and analyses the blood sample, squeezing more stain onto it. She looks up to make notations, but when she reaches for her Diet Coke IT ISN'T THERE. She looks around. It's on the other side of her microscope. She shrugs it off, she takes a sip and sets it down where it was before. She peers into the microscope again and when she looks up... the Diet Coke is gone. She looks around the room and sees it on another table completely.

INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a dusty shaft of light...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cotton swab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is dipped by a gloved hand into a jar of flesh-colored cream make-up. We follow the hand as it raises the cotton swab into the darkness. The swab strokes over the black and the rich fleshy cream spreads, revealing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EYE LIDS of a closed eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The eyelids part, unveiling...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PITCH BLACK. Blink. Blink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not even a trace of a eye socket. Just darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A COLORED CONTACT LENS floats through mid-air... hovering before the eyelids. It turns and fastens itself to the darkness between the lids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We PULL BACK slowly as Sebastian lifts a latex FACE MASK and pulls it over his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He checks his reflection in the mirror. He looks almost human. Almost. A face, eyes, hands ... the rest of him covered by surgical scrubs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We pull back and see the rest of the team looking on.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not too bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The latex'll limit the amount of light delivered to my optic nerves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could almost pass for human.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
Sebastian rises. He looks eerily removed from reality with his cold blank expression.
</DIRECTION>
<SEBASTIAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it gives you a face to talk to at least, and we can all work in normal light again.

INT. LABORATORY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter draws blood from Sebastian.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Samples are placed into the cyclotron.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Matt peers through the eyepiece of a microscope. He makes notes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank and Janice finish a computer simulation on a protein strand. Matt looks over. They shake their heads, no.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sebastian slides into the MRI.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda examines a petri dish. She throws her pencil down in frustration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sebastian is hit by the spectral radiation beams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Matt pulls a vial of orange liquid from the cyclotron.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sebastian, still in his latex and scrubs, but looking like he's been dragged through the nine levels of purgatory, is escorted back to the recovery chamber by Linda and Matt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses to his bed and collapses on it. Closes his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<SEBASTIAN>

	The testing's making me sick.

<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want me to stay?

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter kicks back in his chair listening to his walkman stereo and playing gameboy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RECOVERY CHAMBER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sebastian, in scrubs and make-up, paces back and forth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slams the wall in frustration. He crosses to a mirror and examines himself. He doesn't look half bad. He pokes his cheeks. There's something about him that's a little off, but only if you look close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shadow falls across Carter's face. He looks up. It's Sebastian wearing street clothes - jeans and a hooded sweatshirt over his latex mask.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter pulls of his earphones.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>

Sebastian hits the elevator button. The doors open.
</DIRECTION>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carter, I was suppose to be like this for three days. Three fucking days and I'll be damned if I'm going to spend the rest of my life as a prisoner in this godforsaken dump. Now I'm going out. I'll be back in a couple of hours. Okay?

The elevator doors close with Sebastian inside. Shit.

	Hey, Doc. Haven't seen you for awhile?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARINE_GUARD>

Sebastian keeps his face turned away as he crosses to his Porsche.

	Yeah, well. You know how it in sometimes.

Sebastian starts his car. It chugs a few times before turning over and speeding out of the warehouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - NIGHT

The door opens and Sebastian switches on the lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around his apartment and sighs. It's good to be home.

INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

Sebastian enters the bedroom, clicking on the light. He looks at the ceiling, "You Should Be Working", and smiles.

Linda and Matt each rush to their respective cars.

They get in their cars.

<DIRECTION>
INT. SEBASTIAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sebastian packs up a few personal belongings in an overnight duffle. He crosses to his bookcase and pulls out some books and throws them into the bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But as he does, he notices a light come on in the window across the courtyard. Sebastian turns off his bedroom light and moves toward the window. He peers across the courtyard into the Brunette's apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He watches the Brunette as she comes into the living room from her front hallway. She drops her keys on the table and begins unbuttoning her blouse as she crosses to the window. Just as the blouse slips off her shoulder, she pulls her blinds shut.
</DIRECTION>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Frustrated, Sebastian steps away from the window and then stops. Something has occurred to him.
</DIRECTION>
<SEBASTIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't even think it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down and notices his hand is trembling. His breathing is a little heavy. A little nervous. He catches a glimpse at himself in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<SEBASTIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (almost whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Once...just once.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Brunette's living room light switches off and the bathroom light switches on. We see him fighting an internal battle and we see him lose it. He grabs a hold of his hand and peels the latex skin off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda drives Sebastian's apartment. She spots his black Porsche in the parking lot. She pulls over to the curb, jumps out of her car and heads into the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRUNETTE'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wearing just a robe, the brunette turns on her shower. The doorbell rings. With a frustrated sigh, the brunette rises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE FRONT DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She peers through the peep hole. No one's there. But as she turns she hears the doorbell again. She opens the door, steps out into the hallway and looks around. Empty. Puzzled she heads back inside her apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow her as she crosses to her bedroom, but a moment later, the bedroom door closes on its own.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a SCREAM come from the other side. Then another. Then a muffled struggled. And we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY, SEBASTIAN BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda exits the elevator and heads down to Sebastian's door. She knocks. Waits. No answer. She knocks again. Waits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then she tries the door. It's unlocked. She pushes the door open.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sebastian?

	Sebastian?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
She notices that the bathroom light is on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the floor she finds Sebastian's clothing and on the vanity she sees his latex face and hands.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
She scramble for the bedroom phone and quickly dials.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, Matt, it's me. He was here. No. He's taken his make-up off. I don't know...He must be outside somewhere. I don't know where he went. I'm coming back to the lab. How? How'm I supposed to do that? I CAN'T FUCKING SEE HIM! We're going on alpha call. I want everyone at the lab now. We're gonna need thermal visors and we may need tranqs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
As she hangs up the phone, and heads out. The CAMERA doesn't follow, but instead pushes through the blinds and out the window. As we cross the courtyard, we begin to hear muffled cries of terror. We hold on the Brunette's window as we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRUNETTE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bedroom door opens and we see the Brunette, nude and curled up on the bed, sobbing. We follow the sounds of heavy breathing to the front door of her apartment. The door opens and we push out into the hallway. We can see indentations of feet appear on the hallway carpet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR BY SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator doors open and Linda steps inside. The doors close shut behind her. A beat later we see the indentations of footsteps come around the corner. We follow the breathing and stumbling footfalls back into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We push over to the bathroom sink. The faucet turns on and the water starts running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the water cup under the faucet and splash against Sebastian's face. His face appears briefly in the water. Then the water slips away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For second it sounds like he's crying, but then we hear something far worse. He's laughing. Nervous laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Matt hands out thermal goggles, while Frank loads and passes out tranquilizer guns.

	Look, this isn't a monkey we're talking about. It's Dr. Caine. Don't you think you're over reacting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This program is classified. If he's out there it means someone might find out about him. He could destroy the whole program.

<SEBASTIAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax, Linda. No one's gonna find out.

Sebastian realizes that they don't know.

	Don't make a mountain out of molehill. I didn't let anyone see me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not good enough. When you're outside the lab there are a thousand variables none of us can control. It's just not safe for you to be out there.

	Come on, Linda. You don't expect me to be some kind of prisoner.

	Hold still.

She wraps a bungee cord around the nothing and pulls it tight. She then sprays the inside of his elbow with dye.

	How much blood do you think you've taken so far?

The surface of his skin sheens in the light as Linda searches for a vein. She slaps his arm several times, then plunges a hypodermic needle into his skin.

	Not enough to worry about.

	And for the record, you've got no idea what it's like. I get up every morning and you people stick needles in me. You bombard me with radiation until I vomit. And then at six it's over for you. You get to go home. But Sebastian is still here. Sebastian can't leave, or else. That's the worst part, you know. Here I have this ... this GIFT and I can't even use it.

<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now it's a gift?

Sebastian looks around at the other scientists staring at him. He tosses the hypo with the needle onto the instrument tray and heads toward the door.

INT. LABORATORY - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Linda, Matt and Sebastian, in latex and scrubs, stare at an electron microscope's video display. On the screen in a sparse colony of blood calls but every second more and more cells appear, filling the gap.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	60% reversion. 70% ... 75% ... 80% ... 85 ...

But the blood cells nearest the blank patch twinkle out existence, and then those around them also blink away until after a beat, the screen is empty.

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sebastian lies in his bed, staring at the security camera. The camera stares back at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As if from a dream, we hear the Brunette's muffled scream and cries for help. As we push in on Sebastian's cold eyes, we can barely make out her face thrashing back in forth in panic and confusion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sebastian suddenly rises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses to the video camera and examines a small panel on the underneath of the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches into a box of twinkies and pulls out one of the sponge cakes and begins munching. He hits the intercom button on the phone.

<DIRECTION>
Sebastian crosses underneath the camera... just out of its range... reaches up and using a screwdriver, unscrews the access panel. He scans the electronics and attaches two alligator clips to wires on the circuit board.
</DIRECTION>

Again, Sebastian's POV as he pushes through the open door of the observation room. We see Frank sorting through various computer readouts, highlighting certain coding sequences.

EXT. LINDA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

Linda passes through the revolving doors of her apartment building. A few beats later, as if caught by a gust of wind, the revolving door slowly turns on its own.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT'S HALLWAY - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Linda slips into her apartment and the door closes behind her. A moment later we see the doorknob turn back and forth. It's locked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a fire escape, we see the ladder shake and descend to the ground. The metal rattles back and forth as if something were climbing it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We slowly crane up the fire escape and hold on a window. Through the wispy curtains and dirty glass we can see Linda enter the room. The panel of glass fogs from Sebastian's breath. The fog wipes away, seemingly by itself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But then through the window we see Matt walk into the living room and put his arms around Linda's waist. We hear a shocked intake of air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her neck and then slowly unzips her dress. Her dress falls to the floor. Matt takes off his sport coat and drapes it over a chair, while Linda unfastens the buttons of his shirt. They're laughing now, exchanging kisses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Matt reaches behind Linda and unhooks her bra. He kisses his way down her neck to her breasts. Linda pulls him to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the window shatters. Startled, both Matt and Linda jump back covering themselves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear Sebastian's footsteps as he retreats down the fire escape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later Matt reaches the window and peers out. He sees the fire escape ladder slowly rise back up down below.

BARKING can be heard in the background. That horrible repetitive barking that grates the soul like Chinese water torture.
</DIRECTION>
<SEBASTIAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be quiet!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
A photograph of Linda drifts through the air and settles atop a flaming candle. It ignites into fire, twisting and turning in mid-air, then falling on the floor as ash. A beat later water runs from the sink faucet. It forms in the shape of hands and splashes against his face, dripping away.
</DIRECTION>
<SEBASTIAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	And the cyclops screamed out, "Who is it who blinds me?" and Odysseus replied "Nobody is my name". And the Cyclops raged to his friends "Nobody is killing me. Nobody".

The barking continues. A moment later the chamber door slides open. We push down the...

	Shhhh. It's Nobody-It's nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN_S_VOICE>

The Plexiglas door to the doggie's cage swings open and some invisible force grabs little doggie around the neck. The force squeezes its little fur ball throat until the barking stops.

<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody's gonna hurt you.

<DIRECTION>
The force keeps squeezing until the little doggie goes limp. Then the dog smashes against the Plexiglas over and over until blood spills out its mouth. The Plexiglas door swings closed again and moments later the door to Sebastian's cubicle closes as well. The water runs in Sebastian's sink washing the blood away from his now half visible hands.

We hear breathing and footsteps as we push through some bushes and head toward a bay window which looks into the Kramer living room.

Through the glass we see LINDA and MATT seated across from DR. KRAMER. We can't hear what they're saying but it certainly looks serious. Kramer puffs on a pipe and strokes his beard, shaking his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kramer rises and shakes hands with Linda and Matt, and the three of them head toward the front door.

We move away from the window and track toward the front door. As the door opens we begin to hear the tail end of the conversation.

<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Kramer retreats back to her bedroom as Dr. Kramer crosses over to the telephone. He picks up the receiver and starts dialing. In the middle of dialing, the phone goes dead. He clicks the hookswitch up and down trying to get a dial tone. Nothing. He checks the connections on the phone and then follows the wiring to the wall. The line's plugged in. Weird. He hears a door creak open in the kitchen.

Kramer crosses to the darkened kitchen. The kitchen door leading to the backyard is open. Puzzled, he crosses to it. A wind stirs across the pool and backyard, swirling dead leaves in small twists of wind. The windchime rings lightly. Kramer steps out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. POOL/PATIO, BACKYARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the dim spillover light from house, Kramer crosses to the telephone- box against the back of the house. It Is open and several of the wires have been pulled. He looks around, spooked and puffs out a cloud of smoke from his pipe. For the briefest of instants, Sebastian's face is visible in the smoke. Kramer jumps back in surprise and the pipe drops from his mouth. He gives a small sharp cry, but deep indentations appear across his mouth and his cries are stifled. In the darkness, we can make out his form writhing as if possessed. The struggle continues a beat until Kramer manages to break free.
</DIRECTION>
<KRAMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help! HELP! MARTHA! HELP!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRAMER>
<DIRECTION>
As Kramer runs, he looks behind him. But no one's there. WHAM! Something slams into Kramer and he tumbles, rolling into the pool. But as he hits water there's not just one splash, but TWO. In the water next to him is human shaped AIR-POCKET. It's Sebastian displacing the water. And because of the water displacement, we can clearly see two arms pushing Kramer beneath the water's surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTHA KRAMER opens the bedroom window and looks down at the pool. All she can see is her husband drowning... his flailing limbs kicking up a massive air bubble around him. She races from the window. Kramer kicks and flails for a few moments and then his limbs stop moving. A moment later he floats to surface, face down. The AIR POCKET bobs over to the pool ladder, and rising from the pool, we see Sebastian's body outlined in sheets of water. The shape melts away in a cascading waterfall until all we can see of Sebastian are the hundreds of tiny droplets still clinging to his body, caught in the light like twinkling bulbs on a Christmas tree. The shape disappears into the darkness. A moment later Martha emerges from the house and sees her husband floating face down in the pool. She screams.

Matt sweeps his front leg back and forth, like a blind man using a cane. But his foot isn't hitting anything. He sees a FIRE EXTINGUISHER mounted on the wall. He rushes it, turns it on the hallway and sprays. And SOMETHING LUNGES through the foam. GRABS HIM, sending him tumbling down the tunnel. Matt is thrown against the wall. Blood coming from his brow. He scrambles away, spraying more foam. Sees a shape in the mist, raises his pistol and FIRES. The shape leaps away. The DART FLIES. Doesn't hit. Matt scrambles back into a corner. His pistol is empty.

Matt and Linda push along the corridor; Matt spraying with the fire extinguisher in short controlled bursts, Linda clutching her tranquilizer like a commando.

A noise behind them. Footsteps.

Matt turns to blast with the extinguisher. The white chemical dust sprays out, outlining a shape in the tunnel. But it isn't a human shape.

Matt's uniform shreds. Something with fierce sharp claws fells him. Tearing into his flesh. We see a angry, hungry face... jabbing for a moment through the lingering fog.

	Ahh! Shit!

Linda tries to get a clear shot off through the smoke. Matt trips and goes sprawling. Something yelps. A howl. Linda shoots. Her dart jabs into something which collapses to the ground. A moment of calm. As the dusty chemical foam settles, the outline of a great ape appears, still twitching.

She starts to back away, but she's already in the corner. She clutches her tranquilizer gun, but there's nothing to aim at. The vials of blood on the shelf gives her an idea. She reaches over, grabs a vial and throws it on the floor. GLASS SHATTERS and BLOOD SMEARS across the linoleum. Sarah tosses another vial and another. Becoming more and more hysterical. Splattering more and more blood. But she runs out of vials. Shaking with fear, she searches the blood looking for a footprint, or movement. But there's nothing there. Sarah waits a beat, clutching the tranquilizer gun. Takes a step. Waits a beat longer.

The three of them approach the supply room door slowly. Blood trickles from under the door and bloody footprints extend down the hallway.

They swing open the door.

The floor is covered in blood and broken glass. But no body.

Sarah, broken, is dragged toward the chair, eerily jerking down the hallway... seemingly on its own.

The three scientists follow the bloody footprints down the hallway past the empty cages in the tunnel of habitats.

Linda still holds his tranq gun toward the door. Nothing moves. Nothing. Linda walks over to the Plexiglas ... stares in. Can't see anything, anyone. Just the dead Sarah.

She clamors over to him. But Matt rises in the air and is tossed against the lab table. Linda levels her dart pistol and fires haphazardly at the air. She hits nothing but objects jerk and move in a line as Sebastian heads for cover. Linda manages to grab Matt and pull him to her.

Linda reacts to the voice as it grows nearer. She navigates the maze of equipment, heading toward the crack of light at the front door.

Linda closes the door, sliding the deadbolt into place.

She rises, and looks outside the porthole into the room. Suddenly it fogs up and she almost sees a face. She stumbles backward, and the door starts rattling. Linda scrambles over to hold the metal crowbar in place. Sebastian pulls and rattles on the freezer door. To no avail. It's not gonna budge. Finally he gives up. The door stops shaking. Linda is relieved, briefly. Still. Then she hears the click of the door locking.

She grabs a hypodermic needle package, and her cold fingers fumbles with the package as she tries to pull out the plastic tube.

She finally gets it out and she starts wrapping the stripped electric wire around the tube in a tight coil.

Sebastian heads down the corridor. Lingering steam twists in and around the hallway, long wispy tendrils. Sebastian pauses for a moment, hearing A GROWL. Suddenly the hallway seems a lot scarier. From beneath his scrubs he pulls his own tranq gun. He listens ... hearing scraping and footsteps. Watching the water on the floor twitch. With machine like precision, he turns and fires. The tranq dart halts in mid-air and some invisible thing tumbles over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sebastian continues down the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STORAGE FREEZER

<DIRECTION>
Linda holds the plug end of the extension cord. The other end is wrapped into a tight long coil. Linda looks for an outlet, but can't find one. She looks at the overhead lights.

A moment later she's climbing up the shelving. She wrap* a piece of fabric around her hand, and with a sharp punch she smashes one of the overhead light bulbs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Sebastian enters, fully dressed. At a distance it'd be hard to tell his secret. He pulls several chemicals off the shelves. Then he pulls a tray of test tubes over and begins mixing.

<DIRECTION>
Sebastian loads the filled test tubes into the centrifuge. Dozens of other vials are already slotted. He takes one of the left over vials, considers it a moment and then flings it over to the other side of the lab. The vial shatters and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXPLODES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A powerful explosion that rocks the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Linda feels the rumbling as she places the coil up against the door. The magnet attaches itself. Linda shakes the coil, trying to get the doorlock to move.
</DIRECTION>

OUTSIDE THE DOOR -

<DIRECTION>
We see the lock twitching. Shaking...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE DOOR -
</DIRECTION>

Linda shivers as she plays with the coil. Her eyes glaze and she stumbles backward. Her surgical scrubs, once soaked with sweat, are now frozen stiff. She composes herself and pushes back toward the door. Her heavy breath hangs as a low cloud of Mist.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door lock twitches again and twists back. The door swings opens and Linda stumbles out, mashing into a supply shelf of oxygen canisters. The canisters tumble every which way as Linda tumbles to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She scrambles to her feet and goes in after Matt, pulling his cold body out of the storage locker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls stacks of paper down from, the shelves into a trashcan, grabs an industrial lighter and ignites the paper. She pushes Matt close to the small bonfire. As she does, the oxygen tanks catch her eye.
</DIRECTION>

Sebastian exits the lab, locking the door behind him. He heads down the darkened tunnel. Something scampers in front of him. Small, not visible. Sebastian sends it reeling with a swift violent kick.

<DIRECTION>
She hits the top of a LIGHTER duct-taped to the hose. A line of PRESSURIZED FIRE BLOWS into the elevator. WWHHHOOOOSSHHHH! Sebastian goes up in flame. Linda runs toward the elevator. Just as the door's about to close, she slides. Her foot jamming into it. She lets loose with the flame again. Sebastian, backed into the corner, has no where to go. He's yelling in pain. His latex FACE BUBBLES and burns. The surgical scrubs SINGE BLACK. With no other escape route, he dives toward the door. Linda looks up to see his flaming body fly over her, back into the corridor. Linda kills the tank as Sebastian continues to burn. The elevator lights flickers and the security panel goes up in a shower of sparks. The elevator dies. Linda pulls herself to her feet and turns to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Half of Sebastian's head MELTED AWAY, his latex facade a gruesome smoke-damaged mass. His clothes are half burned revealing large blistering bubbly welts underneath, like deformed blackened bubble wrap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sebastian crawls to his feet, but Linda hits him with another shot of flame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sebastian pulls at his clothes as he crawls around the corner.

	You wanna see God? I'll show you God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
Linda turns the corner to see a heap of smoldering latex and clothing strewn about the corridor floor. Sebastian, looking like some ugly creature, pushes down the corridor. He throbs with his blackened skin blistering and cracking up and down his body. Linda lets loose another jet of flame. It's smaller than the first and doesn't quite hit Sebastian. Linda checks the tanks pressure gauge. It slowly drops. Linda follows the blackened horror into the maze of tunnels. But as he pushes along the corridor, his burns slowly re- absorb themselves. Sebastian is no longer visible. A quiet moment in the hallway as Linda realizes how vulnerable she is. She looks around for him desperately. Nothing. But something on the ceiling catches her attention. She blasts it with the last jet of her dying torch. THE SPRINKLER SYSTEM, hit by fire, comes to life. Water sprays down on the tunnel. Sebastian is caught in the downpour, his invisible frame outlined by water. It comes toward her, the hot skin steaming in the water. He grabs Linda and slams her against the wall. His watery hand smashes her across her face. Linda reels. On the floor, she looks to see Sebastian stalking toward her. She crawls away, but he grabs her by her hair, pulls her to her feet and slams her against the wall.

	I'm gonna find everyone in your family and kill them-. Your sister... she never liked me. I think I'll go after her and her little boy first.

Sebastian smashes her head against a metal post. Her head cuts open, blood dripping down.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I just wanted you to know that before you die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Linda collapses to the floor. Sebastian's foot presses against her neck, squeezing it. Linda gags for breath. But through the shoot of water that is Sebastian, we see something also... a watery smudge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MATT - smashes Sebastian with the metal bar. Sebastian slams against the corridor wall and sinks down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Matt staggers. It's taken all his strength to got there. He drops the crowbar and seeks the wall for support, he sinks to his knees by Linda.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thought I'd... thought I'd save you for a change.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
He gives her his hand and pulls her up into his arms.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's got out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
Just as the two turn, Sebastian rises with the crowbar. He swings it with a yell. Matt pushes Linda out of the way, his arm glancing the blow into a conduit. The conduit splits open and severs ELECTRICAL wiring. The VOLTAGE shoots up the crowbar and into Sebastian. As the current pulses through his body, Sebastian vibrates. His blood vessels yank back to visibility, followed by his skeletal structure and major organs. Sebastian is slowly electrified. Smoke pours off him and he becomes more and more visible. Finally he collapses. His body throbbing in and out of visibility. Matt and Linda stumble away.

INT. CORRIDOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just outside the lab... Linda tries to pry open the sealed doors with the crowbar. But she can't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the doors porthole she sees a collection of chemicals and the fire raging from the earlier explosion.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>

<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda and Matt move as fast as they can. They reach the burned out elevator. What the hell are they gonna do? We know the damn thing doesn't work. She swings her crowbar at the ceiling. The maintenance hatch comes down.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grab on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
Linda hooks the crowbar onto the hatch lip and pulls herself up. She reaches back down for Matt.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget about me. You go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>

Linda grabs Matt's hands and pulls for all she's worth. She struggles, but they both manage to got him through the hatch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LABORATORY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three... two... one. The centrifuge springs to life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The centrifuge spins the two dozen vials slowly at first.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda and Matt are on top of the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda's hands search the wall. Bar fingers run across the smooth metal surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the little light below she can see a maintenance ladder that spans the entire height of the vertical tube. They look up and see it disappear into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Climb!

<DIRECTION>
The centrifuge spins faster and faster. The vials are starting to rattle.

<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda and Matt pull themselves up the ladder as quick as they can.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep moving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
He does, through sheer force of will. Blood from his wound drips down on Linda's face. No telling how much further they have to go in this darkness. Light leaks in from the maintenance hatch below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LABORATORY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The centrifuge's whine has reached a fevered pitch. The vials shake violently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then... one of the vials shatters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FLASH OF LIGHT. A HUGE EXPLOSION rips through the laboratory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The EXPLOSION rips through the lab doors. A MASSIVE FIREBALL rolls down the tunnel swallowing everything in its path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the phase shifted animals gets caught in the flames. We see its shape briefly before it disappears In a wall of fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ladder begins to shake. The entire shaft begins to rumble. Linda pushes Matt up as they scramble toward safety.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EXHAUST VENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FIREBALL blows into the vent. Starts rolling down it also.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNELS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More explosions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHAIN REACTIONS. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE EXPLOSIONS rolls toward the OPEN ELEVATOR. Slamming into it... The elevator flies upward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rumbling worsens. The two desperately cling to the ladder. They looks down to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SURROUNDED BY FLAMES flying up toward them, lifted by the explosion's SHOCK WAVES.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
The carriage accelerates toward them, faster and faster. Its loose cables whip around the shaft, slapping the walls around the pair. Its gonna hit them! Linda pulls herself close to the ladder and closes her eyes. She's pressed against Matt. The elevator... 50 feet... 40 ... 30 ... W0000000SH! It flames RIGHT BY THEM. When Linda opens her eyes, the elevator is HUNDREDS OF FEET ABOVE THEM and a wall of fire is below them, closing in.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Move!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
Panicked, Linda pushes Matt up the ladder as she stares down at the rising fire wall. But the fire dissipates before it hits them, though a stray tongue of flames reaches up to lick the soles of her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They hear a terrifying moan and looks up to see the elevator peaking far above her. It slows to a stop and BEGINS TO FALL.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's coming down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
FASTER AND FASTER. Coming back toward them in complete free- fall. It's emergency brakes clamp down, slowing it. Metal against metal. Sparks flying. One of the brakes shears. Then another. The elevator unseats from it's tracks, SLAMMING against the walls as it TUMBLES. Linda sees that the elevator is out of control, and watches as it ping-pongs toward them... smashing into the access ladder, smashing into the wall. The elevator slows, but continues slamming side-to-side. Linda cringes as the elevator crashes into the wall above them. But it jams there, stopping. They pull their heads away from wall and look up. The elevator just hangs there, suspended. There's a small crawlspace between the elevator and the ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon. Before it slips.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
They begins to climb up again. Matt shimmies through the tight hollow, and squeezes out the other side, followed by Linda. She breathes a sigh of relief and just hangs there a moment when ... Ah! Something grabs her. A singed throbbing hand emerges from the darkness, gripping at her leg.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>

She kicks at it and sees a dark dirty face - a swirl of dirt, grime and smoke with hollow eyes - rise up the ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sebastian, you fuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get off me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
Sebastian pulls himself up Linda's body. Translucent dirty hands paving at the fabric of her clothes. Linda tries to climb with this thing on her. But Sebastian grabs her around the neck. She begins choking for breath. Linda fights to keep her grip on the ladder... She looks down at the ten foot drop to the elevator and then... She lets go!
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
She and Sebastian plummet through the smoky haze and slam against the top of the elevator. Linda seems to hover a few above the elevator, Sebastian's shadowy outline below her. Matt painfully lowers himself down the ladder. But metal groans and the elevator drops another five feet. Linda struggles to her feet. Sebastian rises. A menacing dark figure stalking toward her. Linda pushes back from him. Sebastian grabs her by the hair and pulls bar over to the ladder. The elevator strains and groans.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let go of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
Sebastian presses her up against the ladder. Presses into her from behind. He has her trapped. His dirty hand reaches out and strokes her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember the day we met? You were wearing a red dress and you were so pretty. Now... Now look at you.

</DIRECTION>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fucked it all up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Linda looks at her feet. The last elevator emergency brake grips its cable. She grits her tooth and grabs hold of the ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go to hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
Linda stamps on the brake release. The ELEVATOR TUMBLES ... along with Sebastian. It slams into the fiery abyss a hundred yards below. Linda hangs, one hand holding onto the ladder, the other holding onto Matt. Matt pulls her back onto the ladder, using all his remaining strength.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda and Matt stumble out into the blazing sunshine. Emergency crews close from all directions, sirens roaring. A trail of smoke drifts higher and higher into the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ambulance pulls up next to them and the paramedics hop out, immediately putting a blanket around her and treating Matt's wounds.
</DIRECTION>
