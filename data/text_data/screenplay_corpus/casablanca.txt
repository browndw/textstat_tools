INSERT - A revolving globe. When it stops revolving it turns briefly into a contour map of Europe, then into a flat map.

Superimposed over this map are scenes of refugees fleeing from all sections of Europe by foot, wagon, auto, and boat, and all converging upon one point on the tip of Africa -- Casablanca.

Arrows on the map illustrate the routes taken as the voice of a NARRATOR describes the migration.

	<DIALOGUE>
	With the coming of the Second World War, many eyes in imprisoned Europe turned hopefully, or desperately, toward the freedom of the Americas. Lisbon became the great embarkation point. But not everybody could get to Lisbon directly, and so, a tortuous, roundabout refugee trail sprang up. Paris to Marseilles, across the Mediterranean to Oran, then by train, or auto, or foot, across the rim of Africa to Casablanca in French Morocco. Here, the fortunate ones, through money, or influence, or luck, might obtain exit visas and scurry to Lisbon, and from Lisbon to the New World. But the others wait in Casablanca -- and wait -- and wait -- and wait.

There is pandemonium as native guards begin to round up people.

<DIRECTION>
A police car, full of officers, with SIREN BLARING, screams through the street and stops in the market.

<DIRECTION>
Some try to escape but are caught by the police and loaded into a police wagon.

At a street corner TWO POLICEMEN stop a white CIVILIAN and question him.

Suddenly the civilian breaks away and starts to run wildly down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The policeman SHOUTS "Halt", but the civilian keeps going.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAN and ANNINA BRANDEL, a very young and attractive refugee couple from Bulgaria, watch as the civilian passes. They've been thrust by circumstances from a simple country life into an unfamiliar and hectic world.

A shot RINGS out, and the man falls to the ground. Above him, painted on the wall, is a large poster of Marshal Petain, which reads: "Je tiens mes promesses, meme celles des autres."

EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the plane lands a swastika on its tail is clearly visible. It taxis to a stop as a group of officers march into formation in front of it. Behind them stand a detail of native soldiers keeping guard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the group is CAPTAIN LOUIS RENAULT, a French officer appointed by Vichy as Prefect of Police in Casablanca. He is a handsome, middle-aged Frenchman, debonair and gay, but withal a shrewd and alert official.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With him are HERR HEINZE, the German consul, CAPTAIN TONELLI, an Italian officer, and LIEUTENANT CASSELLE, Renault's aide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the plane door opens, the first passenger to step out is a tall, middle-aged, pale German with a smile that seems more the result of a frozen face muscle than a cheerful disposition. On any occasion when MAJOR STRASSER is crossed, his expression hardens into iron.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Herr Heinze steps up to him with upraised arm.
</DIRECTION>
<HEINZE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heil Hitler.

As they acknowledge each other, Captain Tonelli barges in front of Casselle and salutes Strasser.

</TONELLI>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is kind of you.

But Tonelli gets no further than that as Strasser turns again to Renault. They walk away from the plane, Heinze following, with Casselle and Tonelli bringing up the rear, engaged in a heated exchange of words.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.

Rick's is an expensive and chic nightclub which definitely possesses an air of sophistication and intrigue.

SAM, a middle-aged Negro, sits on a stool before a small, salmon-colored piano on wheels, playing and singing while accompanied by a small orchestra.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All about him there is the HUM of voices, CHATTER and LAUGHTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The occupants of the room are varied. There are Europeans in their dinner jackets, their women beautifully begowned and bejeweled. There are Moroccans in silk robes. Turks wearing fezzes. Levantines. Naval officers. Members of the Foreign Legion, distinguished by their kepis.
</DIRECTION>

Two men sit at a table.

	Waiting, waiting, waiting. I'll never get out of here. I'll die in Casablanca.

On the way to the bar we pass several tables and hear a Babel of foreign tongues. Here and there we catch a scattered phrase or sentence in English.

The overseer walks up to a table with a paper in his hand.

Then we see a drink and a man's hand, but nothing more. The overseer places a check on the table. The hand picks up the check and writes on it, in pencil, "Okay-Rick."
</DIRECTION>

The overseer takes the check.

We now see RICK, sitting at a table alone playing solitary chess. Rick is an American of indeterminate age. There is no expression on his face -- complete deadpan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a commotion at the door as people attempt to come into the gambling room. He nods approval to Abdul.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then a GERMAN appears in the doorway. Abdul looks to Rick who glances back toward the open door and nods "no".

	Look, Rick, do you know what this is? Something that even you have never seen. Letters of transit signed by General de Gaulle. Cannot be rescinded, not even questioned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UGARTE>
<DIRECTION>
Rick appears ready to take them from Ugarte.
</DIRECTION>
<UGARTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UGARTE>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For how long?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<UGARTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UGARTE>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want them here overnight.

</RICK>
<UGARTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be afraid of that. Please keep them for me. Thank you. I knew I could trust you.

</UGARTE>
<DIRECTION>
Rick takes them. Ugarte leaves the table just as the waiter comes up.
</DIRECTION>
<UGARTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, waiter. I'll be expecting some people. If anybody asks for me, I'll be right here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UGARTE>
<WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Monsieur.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITER>
<DIRECTION>
The waiter leaves. Ugarte turns to Rick.
</DIRECTION>
<UGARTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rick, I hope you are more impressed with me now, huh? If you'll forgive me, I'll share my good luck with your roulette wheel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UGARTE>
<DIRECTION>
He starts across the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Ugarte stops as Rick comes up to him.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I heard a rumor that those German couriers were carrying letters of transit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Ugarte hesitates for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<UGARTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh? I heard that rumor, too. Poor devils.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UGARTE>
<DIRECTION>
Rick looks at Ugarte steadily.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(slowly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, you're right, Ugarte. I am a little more impressed with you.

Rick leaves the gambling room and goes into the main room.

INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rick makes his way over to Sam, who plays and sings the "Knock Wood" number, accompanied by the orchestra. The cafe is in semi-darkness. The spotlight is on Sam, and every time the orchestra comes in on the "Knock Wood" business, the spotlight swings over to the orchestra.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
During one of the periods when the spotlight is on the orchestra, Rick slips the letters of transit into the piano.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FERRARI, owner of the Blue Parrot, a competing night spot, comes into the cafe, sits down, and watches Sam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he sees Rick and they smile at each other. At the end of the number Ferrari goes to the bar to speak to Rick.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRARI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Rick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRARI>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<FERRARI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRARI>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not for sale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<FERRARI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You haven't heard my offer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRARI>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not for sale at any price.

</RICK>
<FERRARI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want for Sam?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRARI>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't buy or sell human beings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<FERRARI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRARI>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<FERRARI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRARI>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suppose we do.

Rick and Ferrari walk over to the piano.

<RICK>

</SAM>
<RICK>

	He'll double what I pay you.

<SAM>

Apparently satisfied, Ferrari walks away.

Back at the bar, YVONNE, an attractive young French woman, sits on a stool drinking brandy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sacha, who looks at her with lovesick eyes, fills her tumbler.

	All right, all right. For you, Yvonne, I shot opp, because, Yvonne, I loff you. Uh oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SACHA>
<DIRECTION>
Rick saunters over and leans on the bar, next to Yvonne.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pays no attention to her. She looks at him bitterly, without saying a word.
</DIRECTION>
<SACHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Monsieur Rick, Monsieur Rick. Some Germans, boom, boom, boom, boom, gave this check. Is it all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SACHA>

Rick looks the check over and tears it up. Yvonne has never taken her eyes off Rick.

<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where were you last night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's so long ago, I don't remember.

</RICK>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will I see you tonight?

</YVONNE>
<RICK>

(matter-of-factly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never make plans that far ahead.

Yvonne turns, looks at Sacha, and extends her glass to him.
</DIRECTION>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me another.

</YVONNE>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sacha, she's had enough.

	Don't listen to him, Sacha. Fill it up.

Yvonne wheels on Rick with drunken fury.

</RICK>
<SACHA>

	Yes, boss.

</SACHA>

Rick takes Yvonne by the arm.

<RICK>

	Come on, we're going to get your coat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take your hands off me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls her along toward the door.

<RICK>

	No. You're going home. You've had a little too much to drink.

Sacha stands at the curb on the street in front of Rick's and signals for a cab.

<SACHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Taxi!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SACHA>
<DIRECTION>
Soon one pulls up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rick and Yvonne come out of the cafe. He puts a coat over her shoulders and she objects violently.
</DIRECTION>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who do you think you are, pushing me around? What a fool I was to fall for a man like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>

Rick and Yvonne approach the waiting cab.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>

(to Sacha)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd better go with her, Sacha, to be sure she gets home.

</RICK>
<SACHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, boss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SACHA>

Rick stands and looks up at the revolving beacon light from the airport. It intermittently sheds its light on Rick's face.

Renault sits at a table on the cafe terrace, watching this evening's performance.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Rick.

Rick walks over to him.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Louis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.

Rick sits down at the table.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
As they talk, Captain Tonelli and Lieutenant Casselle walk by toward the entrance of the cafe. Casselle talks non-stop and Tonelli tries. They both stop, salute Renault, and walk into the cafe.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If he gets a word in it'll be a major Italian victory.
	</DIALOGUE>

Rick laughs.

<DIRECTION>
Rick and Renault look up when they hear the BUZZ of a plane taking off from the adjacent airfield. The plane flies directly over their heads.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The plane to Lisbon.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You would like to be on it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(curtly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? What's in Lisbon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The clipper to America.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<DIRECTION>
Rick doesn't answer. His look isn't a happy one.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have often speculated on why you don't return to America. Did you abscond with the church funds? Did you run off with a senator's wife? I like to think you killed a man. It's the romantic in me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<DIRECTION>
Rick still looks in the direction of the airport.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a combination of all three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>

EMIL, the croupier, comes out of the cafe and walks over to Rick.
</DIRECTION>
<EMIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMIL>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'll get it from the safe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<EMIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --

They pass Sam at the piano. He's playing "Baby Face". Rick pats Sam on the shoulder.

<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(somewhat annoyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.

</RENAULT>
<DIRECTION>
Rick's eyes react. Involuntarily, they glance toward the gambling room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Renault catches the look.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.

</RENAULT>
<RICK>

	I stick my neck out for nobody.

	A wise foreign policy.

<DIRECTION>
They start upstairs to Rick's office, passing Casselle who is still haranguing Tonelli.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Our entertainment is enough.

They go inside the office.

Rick opens up the safe in a small, dark room just off the office. Only Rick's shadow can be seen getting the money out.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rick, we are to have an important guest tonight, Major Strasser of the Third Reich, no less. We want him to be here when we make the arrest. A little demonstration of the efficiency of my administration.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<DIRECTION>
Rick moves out of the shadows and into view.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>

He gives the money to Emil.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here you are.

	It shall not happen again, Monsieur.

Emil departs.

Rick closes the door to the office, then goes over to close the safe.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? Have a brandy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? What's his name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>

	Victor Laszlo.

Renault watches Rick's reaction.

	Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.

</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Manages what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>

	His escape.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, but I just told you. --

	This is the end of the chase.

They sit down to discuss the matter in earnest.

<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that a serious offer?

<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.

</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why two?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is traveling with a lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll take one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<DIRECTION>
Rick makes a face.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And got well paid for it on both occasions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The winning side would have paid you much better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have my orders.

Renault stands up.

	May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.

</STRASSER>
<WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very well, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITER>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A very interesting club.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I expected no less, Captain.

INT. RICK'S CAFE - GAMBLING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ugarte stands at the roulette table. Two gendarmes approach him from behind.
</DIRECTION>
<GENDARME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Monsieur Ugarte?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENDARME>
<DIRECTION>
Ugarte looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<UGARTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</UGARTE>
<GENDARME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you please come with us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENDARME>
<UGARTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certainly. May I first please cash my chips?
	</DIALOGUE>
</UGARTE>
<DIRECTION>
The officer nods. They follow Ugarte to the cashier's window. Ugarte puts his chips through the window to the CASHIER.
</DIRECTION>
<UGARTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty lucky, huh? Two thousand, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UGARTE>
<DIRECTION>
Two more guards station themselves at the door in case there is trouble.
</DIRECTION>
<CASHIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two thousand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASHIER>
<UGARTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UGARTE>
<DIRECTION>
Ugarte starts to walk out, followed by the gendarmes. When he reaches the doorway he suddenly rushes through and slams the door behind himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By the time the gendarmes manage to get the door open again, Ugarte has pulled a gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He FIRES at the doorway. The SHOTS bring on pandemonium in the cafe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Ugarte runs through the hallway he sees Rick, appearing from the opposite direction, and grabs him.
</DIRECTION>
<UGARTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rick! Rick, help me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UGARTE>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<UGARTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help me, Rick. Do something!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UGARTE>
<DIRECTION>
Guards and gendarmes rush in and grab Ugarte. Rick stands impassively as they drag Ugarte off.
</DIRECTION>
<UGARTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rick! Rick!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UGARTE>
<DIRECTION>
We move to Strasser's table, who has witnessed the event.
</DIRECTION>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excellent, Captain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<DIRECTION>
Back to Rick, still standing where he was, as a CUSTOMER walks by.
</DIRECTION>
<CUSTOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When they come to get me, Rick, I hope you'll be more of a help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUSTOMER>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I stick my neck out for nobody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Rick comes out to the middle of the floor. An air of tense expectancy pervades the room. A few customers are on the point of leaving. Rick speaks in a very calm voice.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry there was a disturbance, folks, but it's all over now. Everything's all right. Just sit down and have a good time. Enjoy yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Rick glances toward Sam.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, Sam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Sam nods and begins to play.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Renault, Strasser, and Heinze sit calmly at their table after witnessing the arrest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rick walks by.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>
<DIRECTION>
(calling to Rick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Rick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<DIRECTION>
Rick stops and comes over to their table.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you do, Mr. Rick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, how do you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<DIRECTION>
Rick nods to Strasser and Heinze.
</DIRECTION>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please join us, Mr. Rick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<DIRECTION>
Rick sits down with them.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are very honored tonight, Rick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<DIRECTION>
Major Strasser is one of the reasons the Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has today.
</DIRECTION>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You repeat "Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<STRASSER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Rick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially, of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make it official, if you like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is your nationality?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(pokerfaced)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a drunkard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There seems to be no secret about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<HEINZE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you imagine us in London?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEINZE>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you get there, ask me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ho, diplomatist!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about New York?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't the slightest idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<DIRECTION>
Strasser takes a little black book from his pocket and turns to a certain page.
</DIRECTION>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Richard Blaine, American. Age, thirty- seven. Cannot return to his country."
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<DIRECTION>
Strasser looks up from the book
</DIRECTION>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The reason is a little vague. We also know what you did in Paris, Mr. Blaine, and also we know why you left Paris.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<DIRECTION>
Rick reaches over and takes the book from Strasser's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. We are not going to broadcast it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<DIRECTION>
Rick looks up from the book.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are my eyes really brown?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(glances toward Renault)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<DIRECTION>
Rick gets up.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<DIRECTION>
Rick walks away toward the gambling room.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<DIRECTION>
A couple comes in the front door. They are VICTOR LASZLO, the Czech resistance leader, and a very pretty young woman wearing a simple white gown, MISS ILSA LUND. She is so beautiful, in fact, that people turn to stare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The HEADWAITER comes up to them.
</DIRECTION>
<HEADWAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Monsieur?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEADWAITER>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I reserved a table. Victor Laszlo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<HEADWAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Monsieur Laszlo. Right this way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEADWAITER>
<DIRECTION>
As the headwaiter takes them to a table they pass by the piano, and the woman looks at Sam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam, with a conscious effort, keeps his eyes on the keyboard as they go past. He appears to know this woman. After she has gone by Sam steals a look in her direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BERGER, a slight, middle-aged man, observes the couple from a distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The headwaiter seats Ilsa. Laszlo takes the chair opposite and surveys the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Strasser and Renault look up at them from their table.
</DIRECTION>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two cointreaux, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Monsieur.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITER>
<LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
(to Ilsa)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw no one of Ugarte's description.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
Berger walks up to their table.
</DIRECTION>
<BERGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, but you look like a couple who are on their way to America.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERGER>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
Berger takes a ring from his finger.
</DIRECTION>
<BERGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will find a market there for this ring. I am forced to sell it at a great sacrifice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERGER>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, but I hardly think --
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<BERGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Then perhaps for the lady. The ring is quite unique.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERGER>
<DIRECTION>
He holds it down for their view. Carefully lifting up the stone, he reveals...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT - a gold plate in the setting underneath, an impression of the Lorraine Cross of General de Gaulle.
</DIRECTION>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes, I'm very interested.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
Berger sits down with them.
</DIRECTION>
<BERGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERGER>
<LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
(lower voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is your name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<BERGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Berger, Norwegian, and at your service, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERGER>
<DIRECTION>
Renault approaches the table from behind Laszlo. Ilsa tries to warn him.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victor...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<DIRECTION>
Laszlo understands.
</DIRECTION>
<LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
(in a low voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll meet you in a few minutes at the bar.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(in a louder voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not think we want to buy the ring. But thank you for showing it to us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
Berger, taking the cue, sighs and puts the ring away.
</DIRECTION>
<BERGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Such a bargain. But that is your decision?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERGER>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. It is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
Berger gets up and leaves as Renault moves to the table.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. What is it you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<RENAULT>
<DIRECTION>
(amiably)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca. That was a gross understatement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<DIRECTION>
Ilsa's manner is friendly and reserved, her voice low and soft.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are very kind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Won't you join us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
He sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you will permit me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(calls to the waiter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Emil. Please, a bottle of your best champagne, and put it on my bill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<EMIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very well, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMIL>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Captain, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<DIRECTION>
Ilsa glances off in Sam's direction.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He came from Paris with Rick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rick? Who's he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RENAULT>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Is what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if I were a woman and I...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(taps his chest)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	were not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<DIRECTION>
Renault jumps to his feet as Strasser enters.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me. Ah, Major. Mademoiselle Lund, Monsieur Laszlo, may I present Major Heinrich Strasser.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<DIRECTION>
Strasser bows and smiles pleasantly.
</DIRECTION>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you do. This is a pleasure I have long looked forward to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<DIRECTION>
There is not the slightest recognition from either Ilsa or Laszlo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Strasser waits to be asked to seat himself.
</DIRECTION>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<DIRECTION>
Laszlo stands.
</DIRECTION>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is hardly the time or the place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<STRASSER>
<DIRECTION>
(hardening)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain Renault, I am under your authority. Is it your order that we come to your office?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<RENAULT>
<DIRECTION>
(amiably)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
Renault and Strasser bow shortly.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mademoiselle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mademoiselle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<DIRECTION>
Renault and Strasser walk away.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A very clever tactical retreat, Major.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<DIRECTION>
Strasser looks at Renault sharply, but sees only a noncommittal smile on Renault's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laszlo remains standing at the table as Strasser and Renault leave.
</DIRECTION>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This time they really mean to stop me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victor, I'm afraid for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
Ilsa smiles back at him, but her eyes are still troubled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the floor, CORINA strums a guitar and begins her number.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, Laszlo looks about with apparent casualness. He sees Strasser and Renault whispering together, then notices Berger at the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must find out what Berger knows.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be careful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will, don't worry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
He rises and goes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Ilsa's troubled profile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While Corina sings, Sam gives a worried glance in Ilsa's direction. Ilsa watches him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the bar, Berger sips a drink. Laszlo walks up and casually takes a place at the bar next to Berger.
</DIRECTION>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<BERGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Monsieur.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERGER>
<LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
(to Sacha)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A champagne cocktail, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
Laszlo takes the ring and looks at it.
</DIRECTION>
<BERGER>
<DIRECTION>
(in a low voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I recognize you from the news photographs, Monsieur Laszlo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERGER>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.

	As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.

Berger shakes his head.

<BERGER>

	Ugarte cannot even help himself, Monsieur. He is under arrest for murder. He was arrested here tonight.

Laszlo absorbs the shock quietly.

Sam wheels in the piano to Ilsa's table. On his face is that funny fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ilsa herself is not as self-possessed as she tries to appear. There is something behind this, some mystery.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Sam.

Sam looks very uncomfortable.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You used to be a much better liar, Sam.

</ILSA>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.

	Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.

	Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."

</ILSA>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Of course he can. He doesn't want to play it. He seems even more scared now.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll hum it for you.

</ILSA>
<DIRECTION>
Ilsa starts to hum.

<DIRECTION>
Sam begins to play it very softly.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sing it, Sam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<DIRECTION>
And Sam sings.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must remember this, A kiss is just a kiss, A sigh is just a sigh, The fundamental things apply, As time goes by.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
The door to the gambling room opens. Rick comes swinging out. He's heard the music and he's livid.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And when two lovers woo, They both say I love you, On that you can rely, No matter what the future brings, As time goes by.

Rick walks briskly up to the piano.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam, I thought I told you never to play...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
As he sees Ilsa he stops short. Sam stops playing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two close-ups reveal Ilsa and Rick seeing each other.
</DIRECTION>

Rick appears shocked. For a long moment he just looks at her.

</RICK>

<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- It was "La Belle Aurore."

</RICK>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.

	Not an easy day to forget.

</RICK>
<ILSA>

</LASZLO>
<RENAULT>
<DIRECTION>
(glancing at his wristwatch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it is. And we have a curfew here in Casablanca. It would never do for the Chief of Police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself.

Rick and Ilsa look at each other.

He fills his glass and drinks it quickly.

Rick just sits. His face is entirely expressionless. The beacon light from the airport sweeps around the room creating a mood of unreality.

INT. LA BELLE AURORE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small cafe in the Montmartre. A shadow on the floor reflects the cafe sign "La Belle Aurore."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rick, at the bar, gets glasses and a bottle of champagne.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks over to Ilsa and Sam at the piano.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam plays "As Time Goes By."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ilsa seems unnerved. There is evidently something on her mind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rick pours the champagne. His manner is wry, but not the bitter wryness we have seen in Casablanca.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Henri wants us to finish this bottle and then three more. He says he'll water his garden with champagne before he'll let the Germans drink any of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Sam looks at his glass.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said it!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Ilsa)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's looking at you, kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a loudspeaker BLARES out something in German. Rick and Ilsa look at each other, then hurry to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My German's a little rusty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<DIRECTION>
They are telling us how to act when they come marching in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles faintly.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten years ago? Let's see...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause as she thinks a bit)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looking for a job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Ilsa looks at him tenderly. Rick takes her in his arms, and kisses her hungrily. While they are locked in an embrace they hear the dull BOOM of cannons.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
<DIRECTION>
(frightened)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(grimly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Another BOOM from the cannons.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink up. We'll never finish the other three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Germans'll be here pretty soon now, and they'll come looking for you. And don't forget there's a price on your head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Ilsa reacts to this worriedly.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I left a note in my apartment. They'll know where to find me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Ilsa looks at Rick.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strange. I know so very little about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
He chuckles.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, no, no. We must leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ILSA>
<DIRECTION>
(seriously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, of course, we --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ILSA>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. At a quarter to five.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a thought strikes him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Rick chuckles again.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
<DIRECTION>
(evasively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's too far ahead to plan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, darling!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Ilsa turns away and starts to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<DIRECTION>
She can't go on. She lifts her face to his. He kisses her gently.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kiss me. Kiss me as if it were the last time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<DIRECTION>
He looks into her eyes, then he does kiss her as though it were going to be the last time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her hand falls to the table and knocks over a glass.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
INT. GARE DE LYON - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's raining very hard at the train station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a hectic, fevered excitement, evident in the faces of the people that pass by. This is the last train from Paris.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rick appears in the crowd. He stops and puts his suitcase down and glances at his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A conductor calls out "All aboard, last train leaving in three minutes."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rain pours over his head and shoulders, but he doesn't seem to notice. He nervously checks his watch again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Sam appears.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is she? Have you seen her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
She checked out of the hotel. But this note came just after you left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam pulls an envelope from his pocket. Rick grabs it, opens it, and stares down at the letter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT LETTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard, I cannot go with you or ever see you again. You must not ask why. Just believe that I love you. Go, my darling, and God bless you. Ilsa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raindrops pour down the letter, smudging the writing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A whistle BLOWS.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(frantically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the last call, Mr. Richard, do you hear me? Come on, Mr. Richard. Let's get out of here. Come on, Mr. Richard, come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Sam pulls a stunned, reluctant Rick to the train. The train starts to move just as he boards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the steps he looks off into the distance, then crumbles the letter and tosses it away as the steam from the engine clouds over him.
</DIRECTION>
<DISSOLVE_TO>

INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close-up of a glass on the table in the cafe. Rick's hand reaches for it and knocks it over. We now see Rick's face and he's very drunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam walks over to the table to pick up the glass and a fallen chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then the door opens and it's Ilsa. Rick stares at the doorway. Ilsa lingers a moment, then comes over to the table.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rick, I have to talk to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<DIRECTION>
Her manner is a little uncertain, a little tentative, but with a quiet determination beneath it.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Especially tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
She sits down in the chair before the empty glass. Her eyes are searching his face, but there is no expression on it except a cold and impassive one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rick reaches for the bottle, and pours himself another drink.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't count the days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a drink.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I tell you a story, Rick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Has it got a wow finish?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know the finish yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Ilsa gets up and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rick's head slumps over the table.

INT. RENAULT'S OFFICE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sign on the door reads: Captain Renault, Prefect de Police.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Strasser sits while Renault attends to some paperwork.
</DIRECTION>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they "blundered" into Berlin in 1918.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<DIRECTION>
Strasser looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<RENAULT>

	I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?

</RENAULT>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I slept very well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<LASZLO>

(coldly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May we proceed with the business?

</LASZLO>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
They take their seats.
</DIRECTION>
<STRASSER>
<DIRECTION>
(now as cold as Laszlo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at all. Captain Renault's signature is necessary on every exit visa.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns to Renault)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain, would you think it is possible that Herr Laszlo will receive a visa?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Mademoiselle?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You needn't be concerned about me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that all you wish to tell us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even in Berlin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will give us the names?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more "persuasive methods" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
The passionate conviction in his voice now reveals the crusader.
</DIRECTION>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France. Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe you have a message for him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You would find the conversation a trifle one-sided. Signor Ugarte is dead.

Close-ups of Ilsa, then Laszlo, reveal their disappointment.

The black market is a cluttered Arab street of bazaars, shops and stalls. All kinds and races of people mill about the merchandise which native dealers have on outdoor display.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both men and women are dressed in tropical clothes. The canopies over the stalls give them some protection from the scorching sun.

On the surface the atmosphere is merely languid, but underneath lies the sinister workings of illicit trade.

	You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
He eyes Rick closely.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRARI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRARI>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Practically no one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<FERRARI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.

</FERRARI>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<FERRARI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRARI>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the carrying charges?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<FERRARI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell him when he comes in.

	Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
	</DIALOGUE>

<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.

</RICK>

Rick looks out of the window and sees Ilsa at the linen bazaar, then Laszlo walking toward the cafe.

<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.

	Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.

Rick isn't listening to him. He looks through the open window in the direction of the linen bazaar.

At the linen stall, Ilsa examines a tablecloth which an Arab vendor is endeavoring to sell. He holds a sign which reads "700 francs."
</DIRECTION>
<ARAB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will not find a treasure like this in all Morocco, Mademoiselle. Only seven hundred francs.

</ARAB>
<DIRECTION>
Rick walks up behind Ilsa.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're being cheated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>

She looks briefly at Rick, then turns away. Her manner is politely formal.

<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't matter, thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<ARAB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, the lady is a friend of Rick's? For friends of Rick we have a small discount. Did I say seven hundred francs? You can have it for two hundred.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARAB>
<DIRECTION>
Reaching under the counter, he takes out a sign reading "200 francs", and replaces the other sign with it.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>

	I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.

He replaces the second sign with a third which reads "100 francs."

	Your story had me a little confused. Or maybe it was the bourbon.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

	I don't think I will, Rick.

<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can believe that if you want to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true, but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.

Ilsa turns her head away.

<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.

<ILSA>

	No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.

	Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.

Ferrari gets to his feet and walks away.

<LASZLO>

	No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?

<LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
(not very convincingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I would.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
Ilsa smiles faintly. She doesn't believe it for even a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<LASZLO>

	I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.

Ilsa and Laszlo walk up to him.

Ferrari looks shrewdly at Ilsa.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRARI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRARI>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<FERRARI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.

</FERRARI>

There's a moments pause as this sinks in.
</DIRECTION>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know where they are?

</LASZLO>
<FERRARI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.

Ilsa's face darkens. Laszlo quietly observes.

<LASZLO>

<ANNINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Monsieur Rick?

</ANNINA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ANNINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNINA>

Rick looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you get in here? You're under age.

</RICK>
<ANNINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came with Captain Renault.

</ANNINA>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(cynically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should have known.

</RICK>
<ANNINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My husband is with me, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNINA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Annina shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ANNINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNINA>
<DIRECTION>
Rick pours himself a drink.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNINA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ANNINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNINA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ANNINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He did. Captain Renault did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNINA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought so. Where's your husband?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ANNINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visa. Well of course, he's losing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNINA>
<DIRECTION>
Rick looks at her closely.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long have you been married?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ANNINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNINA>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(wearily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you decided to go to America.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ANNINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNINA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I'll bet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ANNINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNINA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does he know that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ANNINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNINA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he is still willing to give you a visa?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ANNINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Monsieur.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNINA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you want to know --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ANNINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Will he keep his word?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNINA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He always has.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
There is a silence. Annina is very disturbed.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Monsieur, you are a man. If someone loved you very much, so that your happiness was the only thing that she wanted in the whole world, but she did a bad thing to make certain of it, could you forgive her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNINA>
<DIRECTION>
Rick stares off into space.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody ever loved me that much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ANNINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNINA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go back to Bulgaria.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ANNINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNINA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Monsieur.

He quickly goes off, leaving Annina alone at the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She remains seated, too demoralized to move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While Rick checks the reservation list, Ilsa and Laszlo enter the cafe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the background we hear Sam playing, ironically enough, "It Had to Be You."

Rick greets Ilsa and Laszlo.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening.

	I take that as a great compliment to Sam.

<DIRECTION>
(to Ilsa)

	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days.

</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Laszlo looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He does. Could we have a table close to him?

</ILSA>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>

	Well, the geography may be a little difficult to arrange.

(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>

Rick walks over to Sam and whispers something to him. Sam stops what he is playing and begins "As Time Goes By."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes his head as Rick leaves.

Jan sits at the roulette table. He has only three chips left and seems bewildered.

Jan looks at Rick, then at the chips in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pauses, then puts the chips on twenty-two.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rick and the croupier exchange looks. The croupier understands what Rick wants him to do. He spins the wheel.

Carl follows the proceedings, fascinated.

The wheel stops spinning.

	Twenty-two, black, twenty-two.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROUPIER>
<DIRECTION>
A winner. Renault, at a nearby table, takes notice of what is happening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The croupier pushes a pile of chips onto twenty-two and Jan reaches for it.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(not even looking at Jan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave it there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Jan hesitates, then withdraws his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl continues to watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wheel spins. Nobody speaks while it spins. It stops.
</DIRECTION>
<CROUPIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty-two, black.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROUPIER>
<DIRECTION>
Another winner. The croupier shoves a pile of chips toward Jan.

<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cash it in and don't come back.

Jan rises to go to the cashier.

<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>

	I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.

<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What of it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<LASZLO>

	Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?

</LASZLO>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.

Rick gets up, as does Laszlo.

	I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.

	I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.

Laszlo and Corina sing as they start to play. Strasser conducts the German singing in an attempt to drown out the competition.

People in the cafe begin to sing the "Marseillaise."

After a while, Strasser and his officers give up and sit down. The "Marseillaise" continues, however.

Yvonne jumps up and sings with tears in her eyes.

Finally the whole cafe stands, singing, their faces aglow. The song finishes on a high, triumphant note.

<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.

</STRASSER>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the other alternative?

<STRASSER>

	My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca, human life is cheap. Good night, Mademoiselle.

She looks at him, understanding what he means.

He bows and exits as Laszlo arrives at the table.

Laszlo switches on the light as they enter. While Ilsa takes off some jewelry he walks to the window and peers out into the darkness. Below and across the street, a man stands under an arch. Laszlo watches him, then draws down the shade.

<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our faithful friend is still there.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
(soberly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must. Besides, it isn't often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses to a table, takes a cigarette from a box, and strikes a match.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
He lights the cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apparently he has the letters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
Ilsa is now noticeably uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he give any reason?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He suggested I ask you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ask me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
Laszlo turns off the light. Ilsa walks over to the couch and sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, our friend outside will think we've retired by now. I'll be going in a few minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>

He sits down on the couch next to her. A silence falls between them. It grows strained. Finally...
</DIRECTION>
<LASZLO>

<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?

Ilsa still cannot look at him.

<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Victor, I was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<LASZLO>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I know how it is to be lonely.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Victor, there isn't.

<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you very much, my dear.

</LASZLO>

Ilsa finally turns to look at Laszlo.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.

He bends down and kisses her cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodnight.

</ILSA>
<DIRECTION>
She watches him go.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victor!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<DIRECTION>
She gets up and follows him to the door. He opens it. In the slit of light from the hall we see Ilsa's face, now strained and worried. She hesitates for a moment, then...
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be careful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, I'll be careful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her on the cheek and goes out the door. She stands there for a few seconds, then crosses to look out of the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure in the archway is gone. She sees Victor walking down the street and closes the blind again. Ilsa gets a cloak from the bedroom, and leaves the hotel room.

</RICK>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richard, I had to see you.

<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.

</RICK>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
He walks over to the window and Ilsa follows.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting, harshly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.

</ILSA>
<RICK>

	-- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Rick walks over to a table and opens a cigarette box, but finds it empty.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to feel sorry for yourself, don't you? With so much at stake, all you can think of is your own feelings. One woman has hurt you, and you take revenge on the rest of the world. You're a, you're a coward, and a weakling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<DIRECTION>
There are tears in her eyes now.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.

</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.

He turns away to light a cigarette, then back to Ilsa.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>

	Now if you --

He stops short as he sees Ilsa holding a small revolver in her hand. It's pointed directly at him.

Her hand drops down, and there are tears in her eyes again.

She turns and walks away from him.

	Richard, I tried to stay away. I thought I would never see you again, that you were out of my life.

Rick follows her and takes her in his arms. He presses her tight to him.

	And then?

</RICK>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Rick sits down with Ilsa.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When did you first find out he was alive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ILSA>

	Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.

<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Laszlo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All except one. He won't have you.

Ilsa puts her head on Rick's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<ILSA>

	I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.

</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>

	I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.

Renault sits at his desk and smokes while Rick nervously fingers his hat. They're interrupted by an orderly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Renault hands some forms to the orderly, who then exits, and the conversation continues.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, they're all excellent reasons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What friend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ilsa Lund.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<DIRECTION>
Renault gets out of his chair and crosses to the front of his desk.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not. But I am interested in what happens to Ilsa and me. We have a legal right to go, that's true. But people have been held in Casablanca in spite of their legal rights.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Renault retrieves a fresh cigarette from a box on his desk.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What makes you think we want to hold you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<DIRECTION>
Renault chain-lights his new cigarette with the old one.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Renault sits back down in his chair.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
<DIRECTION>
(puzzled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.

</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, she isn't just any woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Rick stares at the floor, then looks back up at Renault.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?

</RENAULT>
<RICK>

	I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>

	Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.

The door to Renault's office opens. Rick rises to go.

Ferrari pours a cup for Rick, who takes a sip.

	Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.

</RICK>
<FERRARI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.

	And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.

Ilsa and Laszlo are both caught completely off guard. They turn towards Rick, bewildered. Horror is in Ilsa's eyes.

Renault takes the letters.

	Oh, you are surprised about my friend Ricky?

Obviously the situation delights Renault. He smiles as he turns toward Rick.

	The explanation is quite simple. Love, it seems, has triumphed over virtue. Thank --

Suddenly the smile fades. In Rick's hand is a gun, which he levels at Renault.

<CUT_TO>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. AIRPORT HANGAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laszlo returns. Rick walks into the hangar and Renault hands him the letters. He walks back out to Laszlo.
</DIRECTION>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything in order?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
(sensing what is coming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<ILSA>
<DIRECTION>
(facing Laszlo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
<DIRECTION>
(forcefully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Rick hands the letters to Laszlo.
</DIRECTION>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. I appreciate it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
Laszlo extends his hand to Rick, who grasps it firmly.
</DIRECTION>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And welcome back to the fight. This time I know our side will win.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<DIRECTION>
On the airfield the airplane engine TURNS OVER and the propellers start turning. They all turn to see the plane readying for take-off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ilsa looks at Rick and he returns her stare with a blank expression. He then glances at Laszlo, as does Ilsa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Laszlo breaks the silence.
</DIRECTION>
<LASZLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you ready Ilsa?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LASZLO>
<ILSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I'm ready.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Rick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ILSA>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You better hurry, or you'll miss that plane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Rick watches as Ilsa and Laszlo walk very deliberately towards the plane.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Rick puts a cigarette in his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
The door to the plane is closed by an attendant and it slowly taxies down the field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a speeding car comes to a stop outside the hangar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Strasser alights from the car and runs toward Renault.
</DIRECTION>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is the meaning of that phone call?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<DIRECTION>
Renault nods toward the field. Strasser turns to see the plane taxiing towards the runway.
</DIRECTION>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ask Monsieur Rick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<DIRECTION>
Strasser looks briefly at Rick, then makes a step towards the telephone just inside the hangar door.
</DIRECTION>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get away from that phone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Strasser stops in his tracks, looks at Rick, and sees that he is armed.
</DIRECTION>
<STRASSER>
<DIRECTION>
(steely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would advise you not to interfere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Strasser watches the plane in agony. His eyes dart towards the telephone. He runs toward it and desperately grabs the receiver.
</DIRECTION>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put that phone down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<STRASSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get me the Radio Tower!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRASSER>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put it down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
Strasser, one hand holding the receiver, pulls out a pistol with the other hand, and SHOOTS quickly at Rick. The bullet misses its mark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rick now SHOOTS at Strasser, who crumples to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the sound of an approaching car both men turn. A police car SPEEDS in and comes to a stop near Renault. Four gendarmes hurriedly jump out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance the plane turns onto the runway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gendarmes run to Renault. The first one hurriedly salutes him.
</DIRECTION>
<GENDARME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mon Capitaine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENDARME>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Major Strasser's been shot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<DIRECTION>
Renault pauses and looks at Rick. Rick returns Renault's gaze with expressionless eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Round up the usual suspects.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<GENDARME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oui, mon Capitaine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENDARME>
<DIRECTION>
The gendarmes take Strasser's body away and then drive off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Renault walks inside the hangar, picks up a bottle of Vichy water, and opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think perhaps you're right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<DIRECTION>
As he pours the water into a glass, Renault sees the Vichy label and quickly DROPS the bottle into a trash basket which he then KICKS over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks over and stands beside Rick. They both watch the plane take off, maintaining their gaze until it disappears into the clouds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rick and Louis slowly walk away from the hangar toward the runway.
</DIRECTION>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while. There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our expenses?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENAULT>
<RICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICK>
<DIRECTION>
The two walk off together into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<FADE_OUT>
