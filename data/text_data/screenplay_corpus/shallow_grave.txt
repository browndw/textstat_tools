INT. STAIRWELL. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the door of a flat on the third floor of the tenement. The door is dark, heavy wood and on it is a plastic card embossed with the names of three tenants. They are Alex Law, David Stevens, and Juliet Miller.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man climbs the stairs and reaches the door. He is Cameron Clarke, thin and in his late twenties with a blue anorak and lank, greasy hair. He is carrying an awkwardly bulky plastic bag. Cameron gives the doorbell an ineffectual ring and then stands back, shifting nervously from foot to foot until the door is answered.
</DIRECTION>

<ALEX>

INT. STAIRWELL. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Cameron plods slowly down the stairs, his shoes striking out against the stone steps, Alex's criticisms continue.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
(VOICE-OVER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, my first impression, and they're rarely wrong, is that you have none of the qualities that we would normally seek in a prospective flatmate. I'm talking here about things like presence, charisma, style and charm, and I don't think we're being unreasonable. Take David here, for instance: a chartered accountant he may be, but at least he tries hard. The point is, I don't think you're even trying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
Cameron has reached the bottom of the stairs. He opens the main door.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Alex is a vegetarian. Do you know why? Because he feels it provides an interesting counterpoint to his otherwise callous personality. It doesn't. He thinks he's the man for me. He isn't, though there was a time when, well, there was a time when...

In the living room each of the candidates is interviewed individually with the same seating arrangements as before (i.e. the trio on the sofa and the applicant on the chair). What we see are briskly intercut excerpts from each of these interviews. We do not get the responses to the questions, although we may see some facial reaction.

<JULIET>

	I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?

</JULIET>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?

</DAVID>
<ALEX>

	Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?

</ALEX>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIET>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?

</JULIET>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you ever kill a man?

</DAVID>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.

INT. ACCOUNTANT'S OFFICE. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David sits at his desk, looking across the office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crouched over a large array of other desks, young men and women in suits are pouring over folders and columned books. No one is speaking except in muted tones on the telephones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David watches them. He looks to his left and to his right: on either side young men like him are toiling over accounts. He turns and looks behind him, where another array of accountants sit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns back to his desk and opens the file he was previously given. He looks at the columns of records of profit, with a large total at the bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When David looks up he sees Juliet seated beside his desk. She smiles and directs his gaze, with her own, to the surrounding scene.

INT. DIY STORE. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside a large, brightly lit DIY store with Muzak playing in the background. We start with a tracking shot along an aisle stacked with potentially vicious tools.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
(VOICE-OVER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, now listen. We have to dispose of the body in such a way as to make it unidentifiable, so that even if it is found, then it's never anything more than an unknown corpse. Burning, dumping at sea, and straightforward burial are all flawed either by fingerprints, or, more commonly, by dental records. This I have learned. Now, what I suggest is that we bury him out in the forest, but first of all we remove his hands and his feet, which we incinerate. And his teeth, which we just remove. It's as simple as that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
As the tracking shot ends, we see David's head and shoulders as he looks at something off picture. Suddenly a spring-loaded screwdriver appears and is fired' so that the tip stops a few millimeters from his face. David winces as we see that Alex is holding it.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
(CONTINUED)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I always wondered what these were for.

<ALEX>

INT. STAIRWELL. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the stairwell of the flat, grunts of effort are heard as Alex, David and Juliet struggle with the heavy corpse, carrying it down the stairs wrapped in plastic sheeting. They come into view and go down the stairs. They are all very tense and freeze with panic after accidentally banging against another flat's door. They swear at one another and continue theri descent.

INT. VAN. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the back of the empty van. The door is opened and the body is half slid and half thrown inside.

He then closes and locks the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VAN. NIGHT

In front of the van, David is climbing into the passenger side. Juliet and Alex are already in, with the latter at the wheel. Alex turns to the other two.

</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
Alex starts the engine of the van.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the darkness we hear an engine, then the headlights of the van come into view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It pulls off the track onto a patch of grass. The engine is switched off but the light remains on. The trio descend from the van.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In fron of the van, Alex, illuminated by its lights, Alex, David and Juliet stand together. Alex is showing them two long stems of grass and one short one. He encloses them in his fist and holds them out.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, then, here we are and this is it. Do you want to play or not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
Alex holds his hand out towards Juliet, who takes the tip of one of the stems. It is one of the larger ones.
</DIRECTION>

</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deeper in the forest, with the headlamps still casting a little light throught the trees, we see David's head and shoulders. His right arm is moving briskly back and forth accompanied by a vicious sawing noise. The sawing stops as he evidently finished with one extremity. He shuffles back and starts sawing at another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alex leans against the spade in a shallow pit that he has dug. He observes David impassively. The sawing stops again.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Finished.

</DAVID>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But not quite.

</ALEX>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that going to be deep enough?

</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Alex bends down to pick up the hammer, which he holds out towards David.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you worry about that.

</ALEX>
<DAVID>

</DAVID>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Now come on, all or nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>

Most reluctantly, David takes the hammer and looks at Alex, who gestures as if to say, "On you go.' With revulsion on his face, he raises the hammer above his head.
</DIRECTION>

INT. DAVID'S ROOM. DAY

David's face is visible against the plain white backdrop of his pillow.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The loft above the flat in darkness, but the trapdoor is opened, letting in a pool of light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALL. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David is pulling himself through the trapdoor up into the loft. Beneath him is a stepladder. Juliet stands half-way up the ladder, while Alex stands on the floor beside it. As David enters the loft, Alex hands up the bag of money to Juliet, who passes it on up to David.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be careful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIET>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, we don't want another stiff on our hands. Don't fall through the ceiling. OK? Is he listening to me?

</ALEX>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop nagging.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIET>
<ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know why we couldn't stuff it in a mattress or put it under the floor like any normal human being. We could have hid it in the fridge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOFT. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David moves on into the dark cavernous loft, edging his way across beams and pipes. There are no skylights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops and leans against some structure (the water tank). He strains to see in the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly there is a loud sucking and flowing noise as water empties from the water tank. David is startled and steps forward, tripping. He reaches out as he falls, striking a light switch. Briefly the loft is illuminated: David blinking as he lies across some beams, the large cavernous area, the pipes, the water tank, the bag of money lying between two rafters, and then the old brass switches beginning to spark and the light goes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David scrambles towards the trapdoor.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HUGO'S ROOM. DAY

<DIRECTION>
Now clean and empty, with no trace of recent habitation.

INT. HOSPITAL. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a basement corridor in the hospital, pipes run along the ceiling. Above a fenced-off area is a sign saying For Incineration Only -- No Aerosols'. On the floor of this area are yellow plastic sacks. Juliet appears around a corner carrying one of these. Quite casually the clumps it on the pile and continues past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. QUARRY. EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alex pushes a blue car into a quary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBURBAN LOCK-UP GARAGE. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the garage there is a car, gardening equipment, several sacks of fertilizer and a trunk-style deep freeze, on the lid of which sit Andy and Tim. Tim takes out a cigarette and offers one to Andy, who declines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They slide off the deep freeze and open it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the freezer there is a man, naked and bound with cord. They lift him up. He is very cold and weak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Man begins to whisper inaudibly. Andy moves his head so that he can hear the whisper. He listens, then nods approvingly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They push him down again and close the lid. Andy holds the lid while Tim dumps the sacks of fertilizer on top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHARITY BALL. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alex, David and Juliet are attending a charity ball. Everyone is dressed very smartly, in ball gowns and black ties with the addition of a significant number of kilts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neither Alex nor David wears a kilt. The trio seem to know a number of people there but do not seem especially keen to speak to them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A middle-aged, podgy, mustachioed Master of Ceremonies is standing on a platform in front of the band, making a speech to the diners who are still sat at their tables.
</DIRECTION>
<MC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please. First of all, may I thank you all for coming along tonight and supporting our appeal to raise funds for the sick children's unit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MC>
<DIRECTION>
There is a quick drum roll and applause breaks out. We move to the table where Alex, David and Juliet are seated. Alex leans across to Juliet.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't tell me that this was for children. I hate children. I'd raise money to have the little fuckers put down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>

Some other guests around the table cast critical glances at Alex.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>

<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want my money back. Excuse me.

</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
Alex signals to the waiter by lifting his hand and snapping his fingers, then indicates another bottle of champagne that already ists in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<MC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For all too often there's a complacency: out of sight, out of mind, let someone else bother about these things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MC>
<DIRECTION>
Alex cheers once and starts to applaud on his own. Juliet nudges him viciously.
</DIRECTION>
<MC>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	But just before the dancing, I'd like to say a special thank-you to a few of the people who've worked so very hard to make this occassion happen.

The MC's drone continues in the background while conversation continues back at the table.

<DAVID>

</DAVID>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DANCE FLOOR. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dance floor a few minutes later. It is packed and rather chaotic. Sweaty, dishevelled dancers sling one another around, with the thud of flesh against flesh. Toes are stood on and jackets discarded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juliet dances with Alex, who plunges in with the maximum of violence, eventually tripping up and tumbling forcefully among the other dancers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to get up, then rests his head back against the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David has not been dancing. Instead he remains at their table and at the bar, drinking steadily and watching the other two.

</BRIAN>
<DAVID>

	Well, Brian McKinley, if you want to talk to my girlfriend, you talk to me first. If you want to dance with her, then you apply in writing three weeks in advance or you're gonna end up insode a fucking bin-bag. You didn't apply, so you don't dance.

Shocked and frightened, Brian backs away, then turns around to complete his departure. Juliet restrains David with a touch as they watch him go.

A hand on David's shoulder pushes him out of the way and two uniformed policemen walk past, followed by an ambulance man carrying a stretcher.

</ALEX>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't see the point in that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIET>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because that's no good. Remember, we did what we did, we took the money. It was a material calculation. But what's the use if it's underground, or in some funny bank in some funny place? If you can't spend it, if you can't have it, what use is it? None. It's nothing, all for nothing, if you do that. I didn't get into this for nothing, so that I could have nothing --

Alex approaches the door and is about to open it. At the last moment he checks himself and looks through the spyhole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THROUGH THE SPYHOLE. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tim and Andy stand outside the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALL. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alex, slightly puzzled, fixes the security chains before opening the door. As soon as he opens it, the door is kicked wide open as the security chains break off. Tim and Andy enter the flat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a whirlwind of force they drag and shove Alex and Juliet into the living room and bind them up with cord. There are no words apart from slightly muffled cries.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the end of this Andy stands in front of Alex holding a crowbar. Swiftly and without warning, he cracks it across Alex's shins. Then Andy slowly puts one one end of the crowbar into Alex's mouth. For a moment he does nothing, then just as slowly again, he takes the crowbar out.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's in the loft.

<DIRECTION>
The trapdoor is closed but the sound of it being unlocked can just be heard (although not by anyone in the flat.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HALL. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tim pulls the ladder across to the trapdoor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOFT. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is completely dark in the loft, but as the trapdoor opens a shaft of light strikes upwards and illuminates a small pool around the opening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOFT. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Away from the trapdoor there appears to be a wall of uniform darkness, but then we see a pair of eyes in the darkness. It is David. He stands perfectly still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a hammer in his right hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOFT. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tim's head appears through the trapdoor. Cautiously he lifts himself through and balances on the beams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALL. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hall is empty, but we can see the open trapdoor. Suddenly there is a single thud, as might be caused by a body landing heavily on and across some beams in the loft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOFT. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David stands motionless in the dark, exactly as before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy has heard the single thud. He strains to hear anything else but does not. Slowly he backs away to the door of the living room, keeping the crowbar trained on Alex as he does so. He looks back and up towards the trapdoor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOFT. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once again a small pool of light emanates from the open trapdoor. Andy emerges into the front of this, crowbar in hand, peering into the darkness. Carefully he stands up and moves out of the light and steps across the beams. His foot strikes something and he looks down. Tim's body lies spread-eagled beneath him. He looks up. To one side of him is the brass light switch. Andy lifts his arm, reaches towards it and switches it on. Sparks pour out for a moment and then the light comes on for a fraction of a second, long enough for Andy to see David's face is only centimetres from his own.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALL. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alex and Juliet are bound together as before. There is a loud thud from the ceiling, following by a few heavy steps. Then Andy's body falls headfirst through the trapdoor, straight down to the floor below, landing awkwardly and coming to rest with his head hanging back, looking towards Alex and Juliet. Andy takes one agonal breath and dies. Blood trickles from the side of his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tim's body lands on Andy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David drops himself from the hatch to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David takes a large knife from a wooden block.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back in the hall he kneels, holding the knife, beside Tim. Noticing something at the top of tim's neck, he uses the knife to lift away Tim's T-shirt. A tattoo covers Tim's neck. David looks at it, then stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks through to the living room, where Alex and Juliet, still bound, watch him approach. He looks at them for a moment, then extends the knife and cuts the cord in one place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a scene similar to the dismemberment of Hugo, we see David's shoulders as he saws back and forth at something unseen. He stops and reaches out for the hammer, picks it up and raises it above his head.

David is driving. Alex and Juliet are huddled silently away from him. David seems quite at ease.
</DIRECTION>

A thick bunch of keys dangles from the ignition. Juliet observes them.

<DIRECTION>
David sits still in the darkness.

INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alex sits at his desk fidgeting, about to write something but unable to start. On the screen of his word processor is a page mock-up with the headline CATS EAT PENSIONER'. As the telephone on his desk rings, he is startled, then reaches out, slowly lifts it fractionally and replaces it.

INT. LIVING ROOM. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alex sits watching The Wicker Man on televison. He can hear the footsteps above. He turns the sound up on the television so that he cannot hear them, but he keeps looking up at the ceiling, as though he expects to hear them or see somwthing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eventually he turns the sound back down and, after a moment's silence, the footsteps start again, back and forth, then stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alex looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without warning there is the sound of an electric drill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blade of the drill appears through the ceiling and is then withdrawn. Alex is shocked. Other drill holes appear.

	No, I'm not frightened. A little terrified maybe. Did you see what happened to the last two who tried that? They went up alive and they came down dead -- the difference, I mean, alive dead dead alive, that sort of thing. It wasn't difficult to spot. He killed them both: he cut them up.

	So I just heard her cries for help and all that, and when I went downstairs there were already those other people there, so I just stood around really, waiting -- you know how people do -- and then when your colleagues arrived I came back upstairs. And that's about all, I think. I didn't actually see anything useful, I don't think.

<MCCALL>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Yes, absolutely.

	No, they were asleep. They didn't even wake up.

Uncomfortably, David realizes that Mitchell has noted down even this last, trivial remark in a painful longhand and has underlined a short segment of it.

In the hallway of the flat Mitchell stands at the open main door, waiting to leave. McCall is kneeling at the door to Hugo's room, tracing his finger down the broken lintel and lock. David looks on.

</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
There is one light on. Juliet stands at the bottom of the ladder. Having opened the trapdoor, Alex stops and listens, but there is no sound above his own breathing. Juliet throws up a torch, which he catches. He switches it on. It shines, then goes out, and he knocks it against the ladder, making it work again. Slowly he pushes the trapdoor open.
</DIRECTION>

The trapdoor opens. Below it, Alex crouches on the ladder, expecting attack at any moment. He looks back down to Juliet, who returns his gaze, then he slowly raises himself into the loft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns around quickly, darting the torchlight around into corners and squinting in the darkness, but he sees nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The torch goes out. Cursing, he knocks it against a beam and it shines again.

Slowly he moves further from the trapdoor into the centre of the loft, still turning around and worried about what might be behind him.

David sits back suddenly, recoiling from the activity. He scrambles back across to his mat, where he sits back down and closes his eyes. Then he opens them and scrambles back to look down again.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David takes orange juice out of the fridge and pours himself a glass. He sits at the table and looks briefly into a corner that we cannot see. The expression oh his face does not change and his voice is impassive.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>

David sits while Juliet talks. She is now seated behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember how things used to be here, and I see how they are now, and I don't know why it is. I don't know how we let you become like this. We were your friends and we should have looked after you.

INT. EDITOR'S OFFICE. DAY

	I don't know anything about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<EDITOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course you don't know anything about it. If you knew anything about it, I wouldn't have to send you over there to cover it.

	Cover it?

<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several police and unmarked vehicles, including one mobile incident room', stand on a rough track. Another car arrives at the end and is parkeed to one side. Alex steps out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From where he stands, Alex can see towards the site of the burials. There are a few policemen, uniformed and plain-clothes, and a small knot of journalists, kept at bay by plastic tape draped from tree to tree. Mounds of earth mark the site of the exhumations.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alex walks past the other journalists into the woods. He looks back towards the sight, then turns to look in the opposite direction. He finds himself at the edge of a golf course. From the green to the graves is hardly any distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To one side, Alex sees McCall and Mitchell, hunched in earnest discussion. Mitchell looks up briefly and ctaches Alex's eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BINT. KITCHEN/HALL. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kitchen is empty. We track through the kitchen and out into the hall, stopping at the door to Juliet's room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JULIET'S ROOM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David and Juliet are seated on the bed. Among the junk on her bedside table is the Polaroid photograph of Alex, propped up against a tumbler. Juliet reaches out and turns it away before pulling David towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOBILE INCIDENT ROOM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several journalists sit close together on plastic chairs. Alex sits at the back, near the half-open door. At the other end, three police officers face them. They are a medium-ranking Uniformed Officer, and to one side of him Mitchell and then McCall, both of whom sit in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<UNIFORMED_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, ladies and gentlemen, the releasable and print-worthy facts of the day so far are as follows. Late yesterdat afternoon, forestry workers came across one set of human remains lying in a grave which appeared to have been recently dug. Further excavation on our part has revealed two similar, deeper graves, again containing human remains.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNIFORMED_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
Alex turns his head and looks out of the door towards the burial site, now enclosed in a plastic tent. He continues to stare at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While Alex is looking, the sound of laughter and Uniformed Officer's subsequent comments become muted and we hear the memory of a sound in Alex's head: it is the noise of the saw going back and forth across the victim's limbs.
</DIRECTION>
<UNIFORMED_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONTINUED)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As and when the corpses are removed, we will endeavour to ascertain the mode of death and duration of burial, as well as identification, which will of course be passed on to you after informing, where possible, the next of kin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNIFORMED_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
Alex discreetly stands up and slips out of the van.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alex walks away from the incident room towards his car. He breaks into a run for a few paces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The noise of the sawing continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he reaches his car, Alex fumbles in his pockets for his keys. He is sweating and trembling. He drops his keys. As he bends down to pick them up, his foot slips on the wet grass. He falls to his knees, his forehead banging against the car door. He kneels for a moment, gripping the keys, his head resting against the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The noise of the sawing stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From behind, the arm of a Police Constable reaches out and his hand rests on Alex's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
