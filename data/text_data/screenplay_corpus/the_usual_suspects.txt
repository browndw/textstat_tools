:SC: The Usual Suspects
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lonely sound of a buoy bell in the distance. Water slapping against a smooth, flat surface in rhythm. The creaking of wood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Off in the very far distance, one can make out the sound of sirens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY, a single match ignites and invades the darkness. It quivers for a moment. A dimly lit hand brings the rest of the pack to the match. A plume of yellow-white flame flares and illuminates the battered face of DEAN KEATON, age forty. His salty-gray hair is wet and matted. His face drips with water or sweat. A large cut runs the length of his face from the corner of his eye to his chin. It bleeds freely. An un-lit cigarette hangs in the corner of his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the half-light we can make out that he is on the deck of a large boat. A yacht, perhaps, or a small freighter. He sits with his back against the front bulkhead of the wheel house. His legs are twisted at odd, almost impossible angles. He looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A thin trail of liquid runs past his feet and off into the darkness. Keaton lights the cigarette on the burning pack of matches before throwing them into the liquid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The liquid IGNITES with a poof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flame runs up the stream, gaining in speed and intensity. It begins to ripple and rumble as it runs down the deck towards the stern.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOAT - NIGHT - STERN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A stack of oil drums rests on the stern. They are stacked on a palette with ropes at each corner that attach it to a huge crane on the dock. One of the barrels has been punctured at it's base. Gasoline trickles freely from the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flame is racing now towards the barrels. Keaton smiles weakly to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flame is within a few yards of the barrels when another stream of liquid splashes onto the gas. The flame fizzles out pitifully with a hiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two feet straddle the flame. A stream of urine flows onto the deck from between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of a fly zipping. Follow the feet as they move over to where Keaton rests at the wheel house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRANE UP to the waist of the unknown man. He pulls a pack of cigarettes out of one pocket and a strange antique lighter from the other. It is gold, with a clasp that folds down over the flint. The man flicks up the clasp with his thumb and strikes it with his index finger. It is a fluid motion,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
somewhat showy. Keaton looks up at the man. A look of realization crosses his face. It is followed by frustration, anger, and finally resignation.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you, Keaton?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<KEATON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd have to say my spine was broken, Keyser.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEATON>
<DIRECTION>
He spits the name out like it was poison.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man puts the lighter back in his pocket and reaches under his jacket. He produces a stainless .38 revolver.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<KEATON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What time is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEATON>
<DIRECTION>
The hand with the gun turns over, turning the gold watch on its wrist upward. The sound of sirens is closer now. Headed this way.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twelve thirty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Keaton grimaces bitterly and nods. He turns his head away and takes another drag. The hand with the gun waits long enough for Keaton to enjoy his last drag before pulling the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUNSHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of Keaton's body slumping onto the deck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE OUT ACROSS THE DECK. Below is the stream of gasoline still flowing freely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of the gasoline igniting. The flame runs in front of us towards the barrels, finally leaping up in a circle around the drums, burning the wood of the pallet and licking the spouting stream as it pours from the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE OUT ACROSS THE DOCK, away from the boat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pier to which the boat is moored is littered with DEAD BODIES. Twenty or more men have been shot to pieces and lie scattered everywhere in what can only be the aftermath of a fierce fire-fight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BARGE COMES INTO VIEW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the deck of the barge is a tangle of cables and girders. The mesh of steel and rubber leaves a dark and open cocoon beneath its base.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE INTO THE DARKNESS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sirens are close now. Almost here. The sound of fire raging out of control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIRENS BLARING. TIRES SQUEALING. CAR DOORS OPENING. FEET POUNDING THE PAVEMENT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE FURTHER, SLOWER, INTO THE DARKNESS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Voices yelling. New light flickering in the surrounding darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY, AN EXPLOSION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then silence. TOTAL BLACKNESS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the voice of ROGER "VERBAL" KINT, whom we will soon meet.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
BOOM INT. DARK APARTMENT - DAY - NEW YORK - SIX WEEKS PRIOR TO PRESENT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black explodes with the opening of a door into a dark room. Outside, the hall is filled with blinding white light. Shadows in the shapes of men flood into the room. We can make out men in hoods with flashlights. They are laden with weapons.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	POLICE. SEARCH WARRANT. DON'T MOVE.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
It is a blur of violent action and sound.'Beams of flashlights cut the darkness in all directions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FINALLY:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dozen flashlights land on one man. He lies naked in bed, Merging from a deep sleep. He squints at the flood of blinding white light, more annoyed than frightened. He nearly laughs at the sound of countless guns cocking. He is McMANUS. Age twenty-eight.

INT. AUTO BODY SHOP - DAY An old paint mixer vibrates furiously. TODD HOCKNEY, a dark, portly man in his thirties is working on an old Fire-bird. A YOUNG HISPANIC KID mixes paint a few feet away. SUDDENLY, the garage door opens TO REVEAL:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A row of five men silhouetted by the bright sun. Hockney squints.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NEW YORK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRED FENSTER, a tall, thin man in his thirties strolls casually down the street. He is dressed conspicuously in a loud suit and tie with shoes that have no hope of matching. He smokes a cigarette and chews gum at the same time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He happens to glance over his shoulder and notice a brown Ford sedan with four men in it cruising along the curb. He picks up his step a little. The Ford keeps up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks ahead at the corner. He tries to look as comfortable as he can, checking his watch as though remembering an appointment he is late for. The Ford stays right on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY, he bolts. He gets no more than a few yards before cars pour out of every conceivable nook and cranny. Brakes are squealing, radios squawking, guns cocking. Fenster is surrounded instantly. He stops short and flaps his hands on his thighs in defeat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MONDINO'S RESTAURANT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An attractive man and woman walk quickly through the front of a small New York cafe. They are charged with nervous, excited energy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man is DEAN KEATON, a well dressed, sturdy looking man in his forties with slightly graying hair. He looks much better than he did in the opening scene. The woman with him is EDIE FINNERAN, age thirty-three, poised and attractive - Easily the calmer of the two.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They come to a staircase at the back of the restaurant leading down to a dark room. Edie takes Keaton's arm and stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<EDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me look at you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Keaton is uncomfortable in his suit, or perhaps the situation. Still, he smiles with genuine warmth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edie straightens his tie and picks microscopic imperfections from his lapel.
</DIRECTION>
<EDIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now remember, this is another kind of business. They don't earn your respect. You owe it to them. Don't stare them down but don't look away either. Confidence. They are fools not to trust you. That's the attitude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDIE>
<KEATON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm having a stroke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEATON>
<EDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've come far. You're a good man. I love you.

Keaton blinks then stammers, looking for a response. PAUSE

	<DIALOGUE>
	Live with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him and runs down the steps with Keaton close behind. Keaton playfully grabs her ass and she nearly stumbles down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RESTAURANT - DOWNSTAIRS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They come to the bottom of the steps giggling and jabbing each other. Once off the stairs they instantly transform as though hit with cold air. They assume a cool, professional exterior and walk two feet apart. One would look at them and see only two business associates here to ply their trade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They walk across the dimly lit dining room to a table in the far corner where two men are already waiting. The first is MR. FORTIER, age thirty-five, the other is MR. RENAULT, age
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sixty. Both men are impeccably dressed with a distinguished air. They stand and smile.
</DIRECTION>
<FORTIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Edie, nice to see you.

</FORTIER>
<EDIE>

</DIRECTION>
<FORTIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Monsieur Fortier. So nice to finally meet you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FORTIER>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone sits at the table. All faces are smiling. LOW ANGLE: UNDER TABLE Edie's hand reaches out and finds Keaton's leg. Her hand runs high up his inner thigh and squeezes firmly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her face is absolutely calm, giving no hint of what her hand is doing. Keaton smiles and clears his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MONDINO'S RESTAURANT Follow a waiter past the flight of steps. PAN DOWN TO REVEAL:

Five sets of feet arriving at the bottom.

<FORTIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Edie brought us your proposal and I'll be
	</DIALOGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	honest. We're very impressed. A bit skeptical, I must admit, but impressed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<KEATON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Skeptical.
	</DIALOGUE>
<RENAULT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We find the concept brilliant, but New York is difficult for new restaurants. How can we be certain that our money will be returned in the long run?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Keaton looks at Edie and smiles confidently.
</DIRECTION>
<KEATON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's simple gentlemen, design

	versatility. A restaurant that can change with taste without losing the overall

<KEATON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. Sit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEATON>
<DIRECTION>
Keaton stands up and throws a wad of money on the table to cover the check. He looks at Edie. She moves to stand, but he sits her back down with a hand on her shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<KEATON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enjoy the meal.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(To Edie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'LL call you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEATON>
<DIRECTION>
Kujan takes him by the arm, but Keaton yanks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks out over the dozens of other faces in the restaurant. Everyone is looking at him with some level of surprise. If Keaton is humiliated by the whole affair, he hides it well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOCK-UP HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A police officer steps into the frame and opens the steel door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOLLOW A PAIR OF FEET as they shuffle across the cement floor. The shoes are shabby and worn, as are the wrinkled pants that hang too low and loose at the cuffs. The right foot is turned slightly inward and falls with a hard limp. It is clear that the knee does not extend fully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of a steel door opening. The bottom corner of a steel cage comes into view. Another set of feet falls into step with the first. Another steel door and another set of feet. Another door, another and another. Five pairs of feet walk single file down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lame feet are in the front of the line. They come to another steel door, this one solid and covered with dents and rivets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRANE UP TO REVEAL:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROGER KINT, VERBAL to his few friends. He has a deeply lined face, making his thirty-odd years a good guess at best. From his twisted left hand, we can see that he suffers from a slight but not debilitating palsy. Behind him are Dean Keaton, Fred Fenster, McManus and Todd Hockney.

Verbal steps through the door, followed by the rest.

INT. LINE-UP ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The five men are ushered into the room in front of a white wall painted with horizontal blue stripes. Each has a number at either end to denote the height of the man in front of it. Between these lines are thinner blue lines to tell the specific height in inches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bright lights shine on all of them. They squint, eyes adjusting.

Keaton leans forward a bit and looks at the men in line with him. He shares a look of familiarity with Fenster and then McManus. Hockney smiles at all of them.

Baer is suddenly distracted by something Kovash has said. In the middle of a long string of unintelligible dialect, he has spouted two words that have gotten Baer's attention.

EXT. FRIENDSHIP BELL - NIGHT All five guys stand in a group. It is utterly quiet. An old but well kept Cadillac creeps into the lot from the far end and idles up to them. The windows are tinted too much to see in. The car passes within a few feet of them and drives on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later, a chrome and leather monster of a Harley Davidson pulls into the lot. The rider is dressed in an almost comical array of leather, silver and suede.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He waves to the Caddy as it parks a few yards from Keaton and the others. It sits quietly, almost menacing.

As he gets closer, we can see he is wearing one black boot and one red. Keaton is still looking at them when the bike pulls up to them and stops.

	L.A., was good for about two hours. We were from New York. There's no place to eat after one; you can't get a pizza that doesn't taste like a fried fruit-bat, and the broads don't want to know you if you don't look like a broad. Within a few days the last of us was ready to go back to N.Y., but Keaton wouldn't have it, so he really didn't have a choice. We went to work.

INT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McManus walks along a line of cars. He comes across a black Mercedes and stops. He looks down at the license plate and walks over to the next car, a green Honda. He pulls a slim- jim out of his jacket and pops the lock an the Honda. He reaches in and opens the hood. He walks around and sticks his head in the engine.

INT. VAN

Verbal sits behind the wheel. Keaton is beside him. Hockney and Fenster are in the back. They all watch McManus from where they are parked a few dozen yards away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARKING GARAGE DING-DING The elevator bell sounds at the far end of the garage. The doors open. Two men in ill-fitting suits get out and look around cautiously. The first is TUCCI, a big bellied, white haired menace. The other is HIGHAM, lean and bad skinned. They are bodyguards and give it away by their every careful move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They turn back to the elevator and motion to someone inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out walks SAUL BERG, a slightly overweight man in his forties with an open collar silk shirt and a thick gold chain on his hairy chest. He carries a LARGE ALUMINUM BRIEFCASE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lets his guards do the worrying. He walks straight to his car. Saul passes McManus under the hood of the Honda. He takes out his keys and pushes a button on his key chain. The Mercedes beeps three times and tells Saul his alarm is off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tucci keeps an eye on McManus. Higham watches Saul.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McManus pretends to tinker with the car's engine. He has put a pistol just inside the grill and keeps it within reach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The van on the other side of the garage starts and pulls out of the spot. It cruises over toward the Mercedes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tucci sees the van. He and Higham are suddenly busy trying to keep track. They hear laughing behind them and turn around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FENSTER and HOCKNEY are walking towards them. They are sporting mustaches and sunglasses in addition to matching suits, each with loud plaid sport coats, decades out of style. Saul glances at Tucci and Higham.

Tucci and Higham throw their hands in the air. Hockney and Fenster grab them and reach into their belts to get their guns .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keaton jumps out of the van and runs up to Saul's car, his face covered in a ski mask. He yanks on the door handle but it is locked. Saul sits in terror behind the wheel. Keaton pulls out a pistol and smashes the window with it.
</DIRECTION>
<KEATON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me the case.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEATON>
<DIRECTION>
Saul reaches over for the case. Keaton trains the gun on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY, Saul comes up with a pistol and points it at Keaton. Keaton sidesteps and grabs his wrist. The gun goes off into the fender of the Honda.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hockney and Fenster both look over at the sound of the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tucci and Higham seize the opportunity. Tucci grabs Hockney, Higham grabs Fenster. The four men grapple for the guns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fenster's gun falls to the floor. McManus picks it up. He trains a pistol on each bodyguard and takes a breath. They are some ten feet apart and moving erratically. Hockney and Fenster constantly fall in the line of fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McManus walks around the four men, keeping a pistol trained on each of the guards. Finally he comes to an angle where they are all in front of him. One guard is a few feet away, the other is ten feet past him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McMANUS' P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The closer of the two moves in and out of the sights of the pistol in McManus' right hand, the one farther away does the same with the left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Verbal gets out of the van and moves towards them to help. BOOM Both of McManus' guns go off like one shot. Tucci and Higham collapse, each with a bullet in his head
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The only sound is Saul grappling with Keaton for the gun. His arm is halfway out the window. His elbow rests in the door frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keaton cannot get the gun out of his hand. Finally, he pushes down with all his weight. Saul's elbow breaks backwards on the door frame. He screams in agony. The gun falls from his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All five of the men look at each other for an impossibly long moment. The confusion is only aggravated by Saul's screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOWLY, Keaton raises his pistol and aims it at Saul. His hand trembles, his eyes squint to near slits. His finger tenses and slacks off over and over again on the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM

<DIRECTION>
VERBAL SHOOTS SAUL. Keaton looks at him in surprise. Verbal trembles more than he does.

The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist. One story the guys told me - the story I believe - was from his days in Turkey. There was a petty gang of Hungarians that wanted their own mob. They realized that to be in power you didn't need guns or money or even numbers. You just needed the will to do what the other guy wouldn't. After a while they come to power, and then they come after Soze He was small time then, just running dope, they say...

Verbal arrives at the top of the ramp leading from the dock to the pier. He ducks down behind a guardrail beside the ramp. He turns and sees Hockney's dead body next to the van.

	I'11 take my chances, thank you. It's tougher to buy the cheapest bag-man than it is to buy a cop.

<KUJAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you going to go, Verbal? You gonna run? Turn states evidence. You might never see trial. If somebody wants to get you, you know They'll get you out there.

</KUJAN>
<VERBAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe so, but I'm no rat, Agent Kujan. You tricked me, that's all. I won't keep my mouth shut 'cause I'm scared. I'11 keep it shut 'cause I let Keaton down by getting caught - Edie Finneran too. And if they kill me, it's

</VERBAL>
<DIRECTION>
Verbal stands, mustering his shattered dignity and walks towards the door. Rabin opens it for him from outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For once Kujan cannot bring himself to look at Verbal. Verbal turns to the door, stopping to look Rabin in the eye.

He steps out of the room and into the hall. Rabin follows him.

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Daniel Metzheiser comes out of Arkosh Kovash's room with a single sheet of 15x20 inch paper in his hand. He inspects the sketch with great interest. He folds the edges of the paper back to make it smaller.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL RECEPTION ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Metzheiser walks behind the reception desk without asking the nurse for permission and helps himself to the fax machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DEPOT - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Verbal is downstairs in the depot of the police station picking up his personal belongings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FAT, WHITE-HAIRED COP is checking off the items as he takes them out of the tray in which they are kept.
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One watch: gold. One cigarette lighter: gold. One wallet: brown. One pack of cigarettes.

<DIRECTION>
Verbal collects his personal items and shuffles on his lame leg toward the exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DISPATCHER'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack Baer stands by a fax machine. A green light comes on next to a digital display.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The display reads: RECEIVING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RABIN'S OFFICE Kujan stares solemnly at the bulletin board, drinking from Rabin's coffee cup. Rabin sits at the desk, sifting through the mound of gapers as though considering organizing them once and for all.

Rabin regards the mess of his office.

	</DIALOGUE>
</RABIN>
<DIRECTION>
Kujan is not listening. He has been staring at the bulletin board, lost in thought, his unfocused eyes drifting across the mess of papers, not looking at anything at all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Verbal steps out into the sunlight, putting on a pair of cheap sunglasses. He looks up and down the crowded street. People on their way to and from lunch, no doubt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cars choke the street in front of the police department as they wait for pedestrians to clear the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DISPATCHER'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A single sheet of paper comes out of the fax machine, face down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RABIN'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kujan still stares at the bulletin board.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY, Kujan's face changes. He leans in closer to the bulletin board and squints his eyes. His face changes again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
First a look of puzzlement, then confusion - finally realization.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The coffee cup tumbles from his hand. It hits the floor with the SMASH of cheap porcelain. Coffee splatters everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rabin snaps out of his droning and looks up in surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KUJAN'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kujan is staring not at what is on the bulletin board, but at the bulletin board itself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes follow the aluminum frame, mounted firmly to the wall. One might note it's sturdy construction and it's convenient size. Big enough to hold a lifetime of forgotten and disregarded notes and facts. Years of police trivia that has been hung and forgotten with the intention of finding a use for it all someday. One might want such a bulletin board for one's self. One would look to see who makes such a bulletin board. Kujan's eyes are locked on a metal plate bearing the manufacturer's name.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It reads: QUARTET - SKOKIE, ILLINOIS Kujan's eyes flash all' over the bulletin board. He finds a picture of Rabin in the far corner. He stands beside a scale in fishing gear. He proudly holds a hand out to his freshly caught marlin. His eyes skim quickly over and stop on an eight and a half by eleven inch fax sheet of what must be a THREE HUNDRED POUND BLACK MAN. Kujan glazes over his name, it is irrelevant. His aliases stand out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slavin, BRICKS, Shank, REDFOOT, Thee, Rooster...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KUJAN'S EYES WIDEN with sudden realization. He runs for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His foot crushes the broken pieces of Rabin's coffee cup. The cup that hovered over Verbal's head for two hours.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kujan is in too much of a hurry to notice the two words printed on the jagged piece that had been the bottom of the cheap mug. KOBAYASHI PORCELAIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kujan is sprinting wildly down the hall for the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Verbal looks behind him and sees ANOTHER COP standing just inside the doorway, lighting a cigarette. The cop notices Verbal and watches him in the way that cops look at people they cannot place in the category of idiot citizen, or stupid criminal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Verbal smiles politely, meekly at the cop and walks down the steps into the moving throng.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DEPOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kujan runs up to the desk where Verbal had only moments before picked up his belongings. Rabin is right behind him, a look of absolute confusion on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<KUJAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHERE IS HE? DID YOU SEE HIM?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KUJAN>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Cripple? He went that way.

</COP>
<DIRECTION>
The cog gestures towards the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kujan runs outside looking around frantically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDEWALK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Verbal limps his way carefully across the sidewalk, avoiding people as best as he can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks over his shoulder, getting farther away from the police station. He can see Rabin and the cop on the steps, looking around with strange, lost expressions on their faces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He does not notice the car creeping along the curb beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR DRIVER'S P.O.V. The driver's hands tap the wheel patiently. His eyes follow Verbal as he fumbles through the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDEWALK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kujan pushes and shoves, looking this way and that. EXT. STREET LOW ANGLE on the feet of dozens of people. Verbal's feet emerge from the crowd on the far side. They hobble along the curb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY, the right foot seems to relax a little, the inward angle straightens itself out in a few paces and the limp ceases as though the leg has grown another inch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRANE UP VERBAL'S BODY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Verbal's hands are rummaging around in his pockets. The good left hand comes up with a pack of cigarettes, the bad right hand comes up with a lighter. The right hand flexes with all of the grace and coordination of a sculptor's, flicking the clasp on the antique lighter with the thumb, striking the flint with the index finger. It is a fluid motion, somewhat showy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Verbal lights a cigarette and smiles to himself. He turns and sees the car running alongside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DISPATCHER'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack Beer pulls the sheet out of the fax machine and turns it over, revealing the composite sketch of Keyser SOZE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Though crude and distorted, one cannot help but notice how much it leaks like VERBAL KINT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET The car stops. The driver gets out. IT IS KOBAYASHI, or the man we have come to know as such. He smiles to Verbal. Verbal steps off of the curb, returning the smile as he opens the passenger door and gets in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man called Kobayashi gets in the driver's seat and pulls away . A moment later, Agent David Kujan of U.S. Customs wanders into the frame, looking around much in the way a child would when lost at the circus. He takes no notice of the car pulling out into traffic, blending in with the rest of the cars filled with people on their way back to work.
