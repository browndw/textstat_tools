</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA STOPS on the window of the ticket office. Inside the office can be glimpsed the Station Agent dozing in a chair with his feet up against the grill of the ticket window. The clicking of the signal indicator is heard. The agent opens his eyes, flips up the indicator and begins to get to his feet sleepily.

<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT -- with the line of men now standing on the edge of the platform looking toward camera. Train steams slowly in past camera, and stops, with a tall, wide-shouldered man of about 28 (Rocklin), dressed in new store clothes, cowboots and a broad-brimmed white hat, in f. g. standing on steps of day coach with a small valise and saddle in his hands. Behind Rocklin a conductor.

TRUCKING SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Rocklin comes along the platform carrying the valise in one hand and balancing the saddle on his shoulder with the other, a man behind him picks up the two mail sacks and exits from scene. The station bums look at Rocklin curiously. His expression giving no encouragement, they slink back out of the sun and begin to settle down in their old places again. At the ticket office, Rocklin pauses and looks around uncertainly.

EXT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY

<DIRECTION>
The stage is drawn up in front of the depot, over which is a sign --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RED ROCK STAGE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
J. Harolday Proprietor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocklin, making his way along the walk, almost reaches the depot when his attention is arrested by the sight of Dave, the stage driver, who has just rounded in front of the lead horses. He pauses close to one horse's head. Rocklin sees Dave take a bottle from his person, uncork it as he glances around, and raise it to drink. The bottle is almost to Dave's lips when the horse shies, swinging its head. The bottle is knocked from the old fellow's hands and smashes on the ground. Now Rocklin witnesses a scene of intense fury, which he finds amusing despite its seriousness. Old Dave rants and snorts -- beats his thighs, his heads, flings his arms wildly and exhibits his utter disgust generally.

</DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
He stops talking abruptly because his hand has, quite by chance, felt the spare bottle he carries, which he has forgotten in his anger. A most satisfying smile lights his bewhiskered face as he brings the bottle into view. He uncorks it, and stepping a few paces from the horse, raises the bottle.

PAN SHOT. Rocklin enters and moves over to the counter, behind which is the stage agent, a mild-looking man with pebble- lens glasses. During the scene, the character who picked up the mail sacks from the platform, comes in, dumps the sacks on the counter and leaves.

The Stage Agent turns to make out the ticket. Rocklin takes some tobacco and paper from his vest pocket as he glances outside.

He shakes his head and hands Rocklin the ticket, and moves over to the door with one of the mail sacks in his hand.

EXT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>

The Stage Agent, carrying a mail sack, and Rocklin come from the stage depot and reach the stage as Dave is in the act of climbing up to the driver's seat.
</DIRECTION>
<STAGE_AGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's your mail, Dave --
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAGE_AGENT>

Dave looks over his shoulder at the Agent and steps to the ground, as Rocklin climbs up to the driver's seat.

<ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(as he steps up to the seat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Dave glares at Rocklin climbing up to the seat, and he is about to order him down when Rocklin, now seated, looks down at him and asks rather wistfully --
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mind if I ride up here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Dave does mind, but his better judgment tells him to step carefully in his attitude toward this stranger, who does things first, then asks permission. His only answer to Rocklin is a characteristic grimace which is eloquent enough. And now Dave turns on the Agent, who becomes the target of his pent-up wrath.
</DIRECTION>

Dave stalks around the rear of the coach. The Agent meantime stretches himself up toward Rocklin.

	Hold tight when you git in the mountains, mister -- When he gits riled you can hear the passengers prayin' for miles.

Before the handyman can answer, Dave's attention is taken by someone calling his name from across the street. Meantime, an Indian squaw wobbles from the hotel with bow and arrow, etc. Rocklin buys bow and arrow.

Miss Martin steps out onto the porch followed by Clara and a gentleman, presumably the hotel manager or clerk. The women are obviously Easterners and are attired in the good taste of the period.

FULL SHOT from doorway. It is a large barn-like room on one side of which is a bar. On the other side is a fireplace and a partition behind which is a rough dining table and benches. Standing at the bar drinking with his back to the door is a wizened little man, dressed in an odd assortment of ragged garments of unrecognizable origin. On the counter is a travelling prospector's pack, to which is strapped an assortment of prospector's equipment, including a pick and shovel. As Dave enters, the man (Zeke) turns around and reveals a face even hairier than Dave's.

Clint again looks around for approval, but gets no response. Rocklin comes slowly forward, picks up the money from the table and turns back to the stairs. As he reaches the foot of the stairs, he turns and looks straight at Garvey with a peculiar expression.

CAMERA PULLS BACK to show that the owner of tie voice is Rocklin, who has almost finished shaving. As he scrapes his chin and whistles, peering at himself in the little cracked mirror, he hears the sound of the door opening and turns, then ducks quickly as a boot flies past him, just missing the mirror. There is the sound of the door slamming and Rocklin grins. He picks up the boot and goes to the door leading to Dave's room.

INT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is quite full and the atmosphere is one of expectancy despite the outward casualness of the patrons. A group lolls near the window, looking toward the stage office. At the door a couple of customers peer out over the swinging doors. The bar supports other customers engaged in various private conversations but all are mindful of the presence of George Clews who, with his brother, Bob, stands at the bar's center, morosely toying with a glass of whisky in front of him. He is quite conscious of the subtle glances of the others, but regards them all with disdain. He downs his drink, and speaks his thought to Bob.
</DIRECTION>

Suddenly Old Dave appears in a high state of excitement, and halts with the swinging doors half open.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Rocklin says if you don't come out, he'll come in here after you, an' tear you apart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
George Clews frowns. His eye catches sight of a king-size glass of beer being slid across the bar to Shorty Davis, standing alongside him. That quick, Clews beats Shorty to the glass and hurls it at Dave, who ducks out. Cap, anticipating trouble, brings a sawed-off shotgun up from under the bar and now watches Clews and Shorty.

</GEORGE_CLEWS>
<DIRECTION>
Before Shorty can reply, Clews yanks his hat down over the little fellow's eyes, and gives him a backward shove that sends him sprawling into a corner where we leave him struggling to get his hat off. The crowd resents this, but doesn't dare do anything, except Cap, who holds his shotgun in sight.

She takes Clara by the arm and sweeps past them towards the hotel. Rocklin looks after them with a grim expression and then up at Arly, who has been listening intently. She returns his look steadily for a second. Then, with a mocking smile, she wheels the mare and canters out of shot, followed by Juan.

Rocklin throws an amused glance, at Juan, who has been watching with an enigmatic expression. He returns Rocklin's look with a stern, menacing frown. Then, with a gentle flick of the rein, he urges his horse after Arly. Completely baffled, Rocklin scratches his head for a second, then follows.

Shelley, a Negro servant of the Harolday household, is discovered sweeping the front porch. Behind him we see Clint open the door -- peer furtively out -- then cross the porch to its edge when he looks o.s. as though searching for someone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shelley, meantime, has noticed Clint, but goes right on with his sweeping. His only reaction is a disparaging glance over his shoulder.

To emphasize his point, Shelley puckers his mouth in a whistle.

<SHELLEY>

	Plenty mad!

</SHELLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Clint's face tightens as he anticipates what is in store for him. Over the scene comes the gradually increasing sound of a feminine voice, gayly humming the notes of a popular tune of the period. Clint's strained features relax in a can-that- be-Arly expression, while Shelley stops dead in the middle of a sweep, and now both stare incredulously, o.s.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE

<DIRECTION>
From their ANGLE we first see only the corner of the house, while the owner of the voice approaches from the other side. Now Arly comes into view, entirely oblivious of Clint and Shelley watching her. She seems more attractive, in a feminine way, this morning. It may be the skirt and blouse she is wearing. Then again it may be the flower she is, even now, adjusting in her hair. The presence of the two men suddenly startles her. The song ends abruptly, while her hands fall quickly away from the flower.

A night shot of the mountain road near Table-Top. It is a wooded section of the plateau, and occasional flashes of lightning illuminate the big trees skirting the road. Dave, in his wagon, looms out of the b.g., and as he nears the camera we hear him urging the team through the downpour. As he passes and continues hurriedly on his way, we

INT. CABIN - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT on a soiled and wrinkled envelope lying on a table. It is addressed to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Rocklin c/o Santee Ranch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PULLS BACK and Rocklin is revealed at the table, looking down at the letter. His hat is tipped back on his head, and his sleeves are rolled up. He is mixing dough in a bowl sitting on the table near the letter, and his hands are all gooey. Dave is discovered in front of the fireplace where his outer shirt and socks are drying. It is dark outside, but the storm has abated. Rocklin goes to a shelf near the fireplace to get a pan.

<DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
(during the above)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Durn funny -- that storm quittin' just about the time I get here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No funnier than you sloggin' through it, just to deliver a letter from a woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DAVE>

(disgustedly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reckon I'm gettin' to be more of a fool the older I get.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
Dave watches Rocklin at the table shaping the dough for biscuits and putting it in the pan.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When are we gonna get around to readin' it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
Rocklin cannot help smiling a bit at the way Dave includes himself in.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thought I'd wait till mornin' -- might be bad news an' I wouldn't be able to sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Dave screws up his face in utter disgust and turns his attention to his drying clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocklin, meanwhile, takes a flour sack from the table, wipes the dough from his hands and picks up the letter. He goes over to the fireplace, opening the letter the while, and sits on the bench. Dave, seeing this, edges discreetly around in back of Rocklin in order to see over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The letter open, Rocklin takes out a roll of bills along with the folded message. He lays the envelope on the bench.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmmm -- dineroo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
Rocklin places the money in his shirt pocket for the moment, and opens the folded message.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LETTER. It begins with the usual Dear Mr. Rocklin.

<DIRECTION>
Rocklin's voice is heard over the insert as he reads from here.

<ROCKLIN_S_VOICE>

(continues to read)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am desperately in need of help and advice from someone whom I feel I can trust, and I am appealing to you, because I regard you in the same way my Uncle surely must have. I heartily dislike and distrust Judge Garvey --

	<DIALOGUE>

<ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(going on)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But my Aunt seems to have suddenly revised her opinion of him, and now wants me to place all my affairs in the Judge's hands and return east. Such is certainly not my wish.

(significantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks kinda like she's formed an attachment.

	Might's well -- come this far.

<ROCKLIN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to apologize for what took place this afternoon. And I am returning the 150, because I feel it is rightfully yours. You must take it. Faithfully yours, Clara Caldwell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
The letter finished, Rocklin regards it a moment, then slowly returns it to the envelope as he gazes thoughtfully into the fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dave meantime straightens up -- scratches his shaggy top, and turns his attention once more to his drying clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
(feeling his socks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- what do you make of it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
Rocklin continues looking into the fire as he lays the letter back on the bench and takes out tobacco to roll a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somebody's sure bustin' to get her out of there.

Dave sits alongside Rocklin and begins putting on his socks.

Rocklin has been mulling things over.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>

	Don't know how I could help her -- even if I wanted to -- I don't know any thing about this Garvey -- or Caldwell -- or --

	Well, now -- I could mebbe help you out some, there -- Fact, I could tell you somethin' 'bout ole Red that might be interestin'.

Rocklin goes to the table and resumes molding biscuits.

Dave has his boots on and is putting on his outer shirt.

</ROCKLIN>
<DAVE>

(anigmatically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what you'd say. Garvey managed all Red's business. Besides which they was regular drinkin' pals -- played poker together most nights -- tho' they do say Red got the worst of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Red was a gambler, eh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah -- reckon a pretty poor one, tho' -- still you'd say him and Garvey was friends.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Think you can trust me?

</ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Dave grimaces his confidence.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The last time I seen Red was the day he died --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
In the pause Rocklin remains silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- 'Twas in town -- he jus' come out of the stage office. Tried to book passage to Garden City but couldn't on account I had a full load. -- Well, sir, he took me aside and give me a printed sheet of paper and says, "Read it." I looked it over and fer as I could see it was a paper from one of them Chicago sportin' firms, tellin' how to manipulate trick playin' cards.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marked cards.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reckon so. -- Seems Red found some cards and this paper in a coat one of his friends loaned him one night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whose was it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, now that's just what I asked -- but all he said, was that it belonged to a good friend. Then he said he wasn't waitin' fer the next coach, but was ridin' over to see the district judge about it alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's when they got him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir -- 'bout a mile or so from Stan's place. A bullet in the back an' his pockets empty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come you never told this before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who was there to tell? -- Sheriff Jackson? -- Him an' Garvey's thick as thieves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about what's his name -- Harolday? -- He's no friend of the Judge's, is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hates his guts -- sure riles him to see young Clint hangin' onto the Judge's coattails. All the same, I jus' decided to keep my mouth shut and my eyes open.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(after a pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even if it was Garvey Red was talkin' about -- it don't follow that he killed him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- general opinion is that it was rustlers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would rustlers take the evidence Caldwell had with him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Rocklin moves away to a large earthen jug holding water as Dave talks.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks to me if you get the man who owned the marked cards, you get the killer.

	Funny tho' -- first the K.C. foreman -- then Caldwell -- an' now these women.

</DAVE>

(slowly, to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not so sure somebody hasn't tried already --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Dave)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember, when we stopped to change horses on the way Over from Garden City --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shore -- you told me how Jackson and Clews tried to frame Stan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Like they wanted to be sure he'd keep his mouth shut about something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Dave sits down on a box sitting against the wall, directly under the large earthen jug of water.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And layin' that gun across my skull -- an' offerin' to drive the coach themselves.

A dark, mysterious figure on a horse raises his rifle --

<DIRECTION>
INT. OF CABIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was almost as if --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
A shot splinters the windowpane and shatters the earthen jug on the shelf directly above Dave's head. The contents pour down on Dave and he topples over. Rocklin meanwhile has wiped the lantern off the table and ducked. They are both on the floor in the faint glow coming from the fireplace.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(going to Dave)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
(blustering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will be if I ever get dry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
Rocklin takes off his hat and puts his finger through two holes drilled by the bullet.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lookit that --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good Lord --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
Rocklin puts the hat aside -- crawls over to his gun belt -- straps it on.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the door cautiously. Then sneaks out, followed by Dave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OF CABIN - MOONLIGHT - AFTER THE STORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocklin and Dave stand close to the cabin, just clear of the door, tensely scanning the surrounding darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Water can be heard dripping from the cabin roof, and an owl hoots in a near-by tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of neighing horses comes from the direction of the corral. Both men re-act.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My team.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
Almost immediately the neighing is repeated, but this time from another direction entirely -- and from a distance.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not your team.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
He moves to the corner of the cabin, followed by Dave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HORSE IS STOMPING NERVOUSLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and now it starts away, galloping through the deep grass at the edge of the clearing. Only the lower part of the animal is seen, along with the legs of the rider.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROCKLIN AND DAVE HEAR THE SOUND OF RETREATING HOOF BEATS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And they can barely make out their quarry riding hell-bent toward the deep blackness of the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocklin fires and runs out into the moonlight in the clearing -- Dave close behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocklin halts -- fires again -- and again. Dave fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mysterious rider is now swallowed by the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dave starts after him again. Looking back, he sees Rocklin has not moved.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No use -- he's gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mebbe we winged him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
He starts through the wet grass alone. Rocklin turns back toward the cabin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVE - PLOUGHING THROUGH THE GRASS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has reached the edge of the clearing where a slight embankment leads to the level of the trees. He is just starting up to higher ground when his eyes catch something on the embankment, shining in the moonlight. It proves to be a tobacco pouch bearing a steer's head of hammered sliver. It is dry, so has evidently just been dropped. Dave pockets it, and proceeds warily along the mystery rider's trail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROCLKLIN - WHO HAS JUST ABOUT REACHED THE CABIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks back in Dave's direction, and then looking toward the cabin, suddenly stops and tenses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CABIN DOOR IS PARTLY OPEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and through it Rocklin can plainly see an indistinct form moving in the faint glow of the dying fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROCKLIN DRAWS HIS GUN AND MOVES STEALTHILY TOWARDS THE CABIN DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OF CABIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocklin has reached the entrance unheard, and silently watches the strange figure, its back to him, now headed for the fireplace with his saddlebag, taken from the bunk. He sees the intruder start emptying his saddlebag on the bench in the light of the fire. He sees him suddenly stop and pick up something hidden from his view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At that instant, Rocklin slams the door shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The intruder whirls around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is Arly -- tense -- and now defiant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two regard each other like vicious animals in the same cage. Arly's heart is pounding, but you would never know it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now Rocklin, his gun away, starts closing in, slowly -- but Arly holds her ground -- her eyes never leaving his.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Rocklin reaches Arly, he takes her one hand from behind her back, and slowly forcing it up sees what is obviously Clara's letter in her tightly clenched fist. He tries to open her hand, and Arly, knowing she lacks the strength to prevent it, suddenly whips out a knife with her free hand. But that quick, Rocklin grabs the knife hand, and without any apparent effort, wrenches it free of her grasp and tosses it across the room, where it lands on the bunk. Arly relaxes her grip on the letter meanwhile, and Rocklin gets it, and tears it very deliberately, letting the pieces fall at her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns his back on her now, going over to his hat on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Arly is furious in her helplessness and humiliation. And Rocklin's smug manner isn't helping any. He picks up his hat and, glancing at Arly, puts his finger once more through the bullet holes.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling wryly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not bad shootin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<ARLY>
<DIRECTION>
(right back at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think I did that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLY>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure -- to draw us away from here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at his hat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, you cut it mighty close -- Good thing I ain't got brains enough to fill it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Rocklin puts his hat on. He sees Arly looking down at the torn letter.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(suppressing smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too bad you had to come 'way up here through that storm for nothin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<ARLY>
<DIRECTION>
(affectedly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't minded a bit --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(harshly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- because I came up to fire you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLY>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Rocklin goes toward the bunk with his saddlebag.
</DIRECTION>
<ARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out of here -- get off the Santee and don't ever come back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLY>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mind if I wait for Dave? He ought to be along any minute -- Be funny if he winged that shadow of yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<ARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you mean Juan -- you're loco. He's not even up here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLY>
<ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(mildly surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You came up alone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<ARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLY>
<ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(half believing her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then who was that we took out after?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<ARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The man who shot at you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLY>
<DIRECTION>
Rocklin sits on the bunk and casually picks up Arly's knife.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who was he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<ARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLY>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean you won't tell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<ARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean I don't know -- Why should I lie to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLY>
<DIRECTION>
That last from Arly brings a kind of smile to Rocklin's face -- a smile that says in effect -- "Are you kidding?" He gets up from the bunk to go to the door, and finding himself still holding Arly's knife, throws it back to her in a seemingly casual manner. It passes too close to Arly for comfort and, Rocklin just opening the door, gets the knife right back -- that close to his ear he feels the breeze. He looks at it, quivering in the door. Then, moving to Arly in what could be construed as a threatening manner, he takes her in his arms and kisses her. Arly is caught completely unaware. Rocklin's action disarms her. But it is, after all, what she really wants, so before the kiss ends, Arly's arms slowly entwine themselves around Rocklin's neck. In the middle of the kiss Rocklin gently but forcefully takes her arms from around his neck and puts her from him.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess you forgot -- you jes' fired me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to the bunk -- picks up his saddlebag, coat, etc., and starts for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Arly has been silently watching.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(turning near the open door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Dave's voice is heard just outside the cabin door.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Rock --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Dave now rushes through the door, puffing and excited.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- He got away -- but guess what, I --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
He sees Arly and pulls up abruptly.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(slowly to Dave)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guess --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Rocklin gives Arly a disparaging side glance and starts out.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Dave, who is trying to figure things out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on.

INT. OF CABIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Arly, her back to us, is standing in the open doorway watching the two headed for the corral.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her mood is evidenced by the manner in which she suddenly slams shut the door. As she turns and leans against it, we see tears in her eyes, and hear suppressed sobs. Her eyes light on the bits of torn letter, and presently we see her face set itself grimly, and now she walks toward the fireplace and, passing the torn bite of paper, kicks at them viciously.

INT. HAROLDAY'S OFFICE - DAY

PANNING SHOT on Harolday as he sits at the desk working on a ledger. The sound of a door opening is heard. Harolday looks up casually as if expecting a customer, then suddenly gapes. CAMERA PANS to include doorway in which stands Rocklin.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you you'd regret letting that rat Clews off so easy.

Rocklin looks at him with a queer expression without replying.

</HAROLDAY>
<ROCKLIN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I been figgerin'. Don't seem reasonable Clews was in condition to take that sort of chance alone... Besides -- how could he have known I was up there -- that soon. And -- George Clews ain't the only one I've run contrariwise to in this town. There's that Mexican, for instance.

Rocklin's disdainful smile takes the speech out of Clint, who just sort of runs out of words. Rocklin hesitates for a second then moves toward the door.

Harolday and Clint are at window looking past camera toward the street. They see Rocklin carrying his saddle, walking toward the Sun-Up. Shorty Davis hails Rocklin, says something to him and points to the Sun-Up. Rocklin leaves, walking faster.

Rocklin comes down the hall carrying his saddle and looking at the room numbers. As he nears the f.g. he locates the room he is looking for (it is a room facing toward the rear of the Sun-Up). He knocks. Almost immediately the door opens and Clara stands there -- flushed and embarrassed.

</ROCKLIN>
<CLARA>

	Got anything to prove you're not underage?

INT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT -- a letter written in a bold feminine hand. It reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAR MR. GARVEY:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In answer to your letter of the 25th, kindly be advised that my niece, Clara Caldwell, became of age January 11th of this year. And, although I am no longer her legal guardian, it behooves me, as her nearest kin, to show continued interest in her affairs --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA HOLDS LONG ENOUGH for the letter to be read. And now the letter begins to be consumed in a flame as the CAMERA PULLS BACK showing the burning letter in Judge Garvey's hand. He is standing over the potbellied stove in his office, and Miss Martin is close to him watching the letter burn. Garvey finally lets it fall from his fingers onto the top of the stove. He lifts the lid, lets the remains fall inside, and smiles to Miss Martin.
</DIRECTION>
<GARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That takes care of that --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(crosses to his desk)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, I'll draw up an affidavit right away and everything will be taken care of as we want it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARVEY>
<MISS_MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(not too enthusiastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I certainly hope so -- it's not myself I'm concerned about --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_MARTIN>
<GARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(getting out the papers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Of course not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARVEY>
<MISS_MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't say I'm very happy about doing this -- I only hope it works out for the best.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_MARTIN>
<GARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the better choice of two evils -- now let's see --

(begins to write)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I, Elizabeth --

<GARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Elizabeth Martin, of Danvers, Massachusetts, do hereby --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and Rocklin enters. Miss Martin, who has been pacing nervously, stops in her tracks. Garvey, taken completely by surprise, feigns an affected casualness. Rocklin eyes them both suspiciously as he slowly closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<GARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(leaning back in his chair)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Mr. Rocklin, this is indeed a surprise. Didn't expect to see you so soon. I understood you were riding for the Santee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARVEY>
<ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(coldly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
It is quite obvious to Garvey that Rocklin is here on business. He turns to Miss Martin.
</DIRECTION>
<GARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Miss Martin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps you'd better come back later --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Miss Martin is in accord with that suggestion, and after giving Rocklin the frigid eye, flounces out, slamming the door.

Garvey shakes his head, wipes his brow, and is returning to his desk.

<DIRECTION>
Rocklin goes to the filing cabinet where he opens the drawer marked "C." As he fingers through the papers, Garvey sits back in his chair, watching.
</DIRECTION>
<GARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is your interest in this letter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARVEY>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My only interest is getting' it.

<GARVEY>

Rocklin pulls open the "M" drawer.

<GARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I warn you, you're in for a disappointment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Not finding the letter in the "M" drawer, Rocklin goes to the desk and pulls the handle of one of the drawers. It is locked.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<GARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(has had about enough)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listens, you --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly controls himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nothing in there that'd interest you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARVEY>
<ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(grimly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to make up my own mind about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<GARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(forces a chuckle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right -- I'll open it -- just to convince you I'm not hiding any letter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Garvey unlocks the drawer and opens it. It is found to contain nothing but two brand new decks of playing cards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The UNOPENED DECKS OF CARDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE. Garvey seems a little too anxious to close the drawer, and before he can do so, Rocklin has one hand inside. Garvey, checked for a second, looks up at Rocklin.
</DIRECTION>
<GARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the idea?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Rocklin slowly withdraws his hand, holding one of the decks.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These cards --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<GARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(attempting to bluff it out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything wrong in a man having cards in his possession?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARVEY>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Depends on what kind they are -- 'specially when they're under lock and key.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
The two regard each other silently a moment. Now Rocklin casually slips the deck he holds into his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<GARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(too politely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're taking those, I presume.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARVEY>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a step away. Garvey turns him by touching his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<GARVEY>

	Now, you look here --

<GARVEY>
<DIRECTION>
(with an affected

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you believe a story like that?

</GARVEY>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will until I hear a better one.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(puts deck he holds, in his pocket)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll just take this along -- the district judge at Garden City should be mighty interested.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
He starts around the desk toward the door. From the corner of his eye he catches Garvey reaching for a gun in the middle drawer. Before he can raise it, Rocklin is on him with a blow that sends Garvey reeling back toward the stove.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocklin starts for the door again, and just misses being struck by a chair which Garvey hurls with vicious fury. The chair crashes against a window.

Rocklin and Dave as they walk from Garvey's office. Dave has a time hopping along against Rocklin's strides.

Dave leaves and exits from shot in the direction of the stage office. Rocklin goes off toward the Sun-Up.

EXT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PANNING SHOT. Juan is lounging against the corner of the building, soberly watching Rocklin's approach. As Rocklin comes into the scene he spots Juan, and stops a moment as though deciding whether or not to question him. During this, Juan casually takes his ornamental tobacco pouch from his pocket and begins to roll a cigarette.

<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PANS Rocklin to the side of the building and up the outer stairs.

INT. UPPER HALL - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

Rocklin comes through the door and down the hall. He reaches his room, and is about to open the door when he hears a familiar voice inside. He listens.

<ARLY_S_VOICE>

	-- So now you know the truth. And if you think you can steal him away from me, you're welcome to try it.

Rocklin frowns and enters.

INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY

Rocklin steps into the room, holding the door partly open as he focuses his attention on Arly. Clara, who has been sitting in the rocker near the window, gets up and is the first to speak.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you get it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARA>
<DIRECTION>
Rocklin closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- but I don't think it's gonna matter much -- you go on back to the K.C. and I'll be out in the mornin' and take you with me to Garden City to see the district judge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<CLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I hate putting you to that trouble.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLY>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Deny what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<CLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That she was with you last night at the cabin in the mountains.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARA>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- why should I deny it?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<ARLY>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And didn't you make love to me?

</ARLY>
<ROCKLIN>

(this is getting a bit thick for him)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Make love to you --

</ROCKLIN>
<ARLY>
<DIRECTION>
(forcing her point)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't kiss me -- I suppose?

	Did you expect me to deny that, too?

	You see?

<DIRECTION>
(to Clara)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, maybe you ought to hear what I've got to say --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Clara is terribly hurt, but struggles to be grown-up about it.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please -- you needn't explain. After all, it really isn't any of my business, is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARA>
<ROCKLIN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it -- start swearin'--

<DIRECTION>
(to Clara)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just like a man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLY>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If there wasn't a lady here, I'd do more to you than swear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<CLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know how I can ever thank you for trying to help me. I do appreciate it ever so much --

(to Arly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't think too harshly of me, will you -- I --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARA>
<DIRECTION>
Clara can say no more without breaking. So she turns away quickly and hurries out the door. Rocklin does a slow burn as he glares at Arly.
</DIRECTION>
<ARLY>
<DIRECTION>
(sincerely -- after a pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's lovely, isn't she? -- So sweet -- honest, and helpless.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLY>
<DIRECTION>
Rocklin makes no reply.
</DIRECTION>
<ARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pity you didn't fall in love with her, instead of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLY>
<DIRECTION>
Arly is being ridiculous now. He ignores her remarks and concentrates his attention on one of his hands -- he may have sprained it slightly in the fight.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You might's well know right now that you or no woman is ever goin' to get me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<ARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be so sure -- I don't think I'm doin' so badly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLY>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<ARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLY>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know there ain't a dirty trick you wouldn't play to get what you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<ARLY>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I always get what I want.

She takes a folded piece of paper out of her pocket and drops it on the dresser as Rocklin watches her.
</DIRECTION>
<ARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- See?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(opens the door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- 'Bye now --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLY>
<DIRECTION>
The door closes. Rocklin stands a moment. Now curiosity brings him to the dresser where he takes up the paper and unfolds it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLARA'S LETTER. The torn pieces have all been sorted and pasted together on a sheet of paper
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE. Rocklin holds the letter. He is mad. He shakes his head -- What a gal --- Now he is almost smiling -- almost. He folds the letter -- puts it in his pocket. Takes off his gun-belt and hangs it over the rocker near the window, and stretches out on the bed, as we

Clara enters hastily and beats a path to the door of her room.

The door flies open. Clara bursts in, closing the door in the same movement. Her eyes swing to someone o.s. and she freezes to the spot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miss Martin, standing by the window, cold and threatening. She has not taken the time to remove her hat. After a moment's pause, she moves slowly toward Clara.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PANS WITH her into a TWO SHOT. Clara, her back pressing harder and harder against the door, becomes more terrified at the other's approach. Miss Martin appraises the girl a short moment and now suddenly slaps her hard across the face. Clara opens her mouth, about to scream, but even stifles this impulse under the cold stare of her aunt.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly but viciously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever is to become of you?

Clara can only stare as one under an hypnotic spell.

	Have you no sense of pride, or decency? Throwing yourself at that -- that wretch, like any shameless hussy.

Clara hasn't moved.

	I thought we'd done with him -- but no -- you have to run to him and tell him all our business --

Clara merely gasps for a breath of air, but Miss Martin, thinking her about to speak, goes on, more forcefully now.

<MISS_MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you dare deny it -- you know very well you told him about that letter I wrote Mr. Garvey.

Clara remains silent.

Clara, now utterly broken, moves away. Miss Martin, her eyes still rivited on the girl, follows.

The office has been more or less cleaned up since the fight. Garvey is discovered near the window. He has cleaned himself up but bears some evidence of the fight. He is reading a letter as Sammy, the K.C. China-boy, stands waiting near the door.

<DIRECTION>
LETTER. The message is written in the same bold hand of Miss Martin already seen in the previous letter:

I have just learned that despicable Rocklin person intends to take Clara to Garden City in the morning -- evidently to have you investigated. I thought you had better know about it.

The area in front of the Sun-Up. Dave's wagon pulls up to the hitching rail in front of the saloon. Clint, stripped of his gun, is driving with Dave, alertly watching him. They get down from the wagon and Dave prods Clint toward the corner of the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDE OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Garvey has left the spot where we saw him look up to Rocklin's window. We now see him as he rounds a rear corner of the building and goes toward the outer stairs leading to the Sun- Up's second floor. He starts up the steps and stops almost immediately and stares o.s.

From Garvey's ANGLE as he sees Dave bringing Clint from around in front of the building toward the stairway.

CAMERA HOLDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Garvey steps quickly to the ground and takes up a position around the roar corner. He watches the two men approach the stairway and go up. He moves out of the shot now, going toward the street. The CAMERA HOLDS on the corner, and we see Tala come into view, as though from nowhere, and take the exact position at the building's corner vacated by Garvey only a moment before. It is apparent that he is watching Garvey, and after a momentary pause he too moves stealthily out of the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PANNING SHOT on Rocklin asleep. He is fully dressed, as we last saw him, with the exception of his boots. He is stretched full length on top of the covers. His gun-belt still hangs over the rocker, close to the open window. A knock on the door brings him to a sitting position.

EXT. SIDE OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An unidentifiable form is seen moving through the darkness toward the outer stairway. As it nears the stairway, the CAMERA MOVES IN so that as the mysterious figure begins stealthily up the stairs, we see only the feet through the rungs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA THEN PANS QUICKLY AND ZOOMS INTO A CLOSE SHOT of Juan, across the alley. And now through Juan's eyes we watch the ascent of the mysterious intruder: The Mexican's line of vision gradually raises, then the eyes slowly move across the camera as the dark figure proceeds along to the rear portion of the verandah.

CLOSE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clint and Rocklin. The latter is still looking toward the window. With a swift movement Clint picks up the water jug from the washstand and brings it down on Rocklin's head. As Rocklin falls out of shot, Clint turns to the window with a triumphant smile. Suddenly his expression changes.

Lined up at the bar are Dave, Pap Fossler, Shorty Davis and a few others. Cap is in his usual place. At the poker table are Doc Riding, Sam Haynes, Ab Jenkins and one or two others.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shot has evidently been heard, for everything seems to have stopped, and Dave and Pap Fussier are looking up toward the ceiling, as are others. Now Dave snaps back to life -- gulps down his drink, and hurries toward the stairs. As he starts up, the others move slowly in the same direction.
</DIRECTION>

INT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocklin is on the floor, groggy. He shakes his head, and as his senses return, he picks up the gun and just gets to his feet as Dave rushes in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dave sees Clint's body on the floor -- notices the gun in Rocklin's hand. He opens his mouth to speak but nothing comes out. All he can do is stare and grimace. The sound of hurrying feet comes from the hall, and presently the mob closes in, crowding the room and the hall.

Pap Fossler, who has been one of the first to enter, kneels over Clint.

	Don't be a fool, Rocklin. You know you can't get away with a yarn like that. Why don't you save yourself and everyone else a lot of trouble by surrendering to the Sheriff? After all, it isn't such a crime in these parts to kill a man in self-defense.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Self-defense?

He moves over to the open window, and with his gun leveled on the mob, steps out onto the verandah. Once outside, he suddenly lets the window fall and disappears. A shot from Jackson's gun shatters a pane, during which time there has been a rush to the window. It is Arly and Dave who reach it first, and feigning an attempt to raise the window, they momentarily delay pursuit.

Jackson and Garvey come from around the corner of the porch followed by Harolday, Arly, Dave, and others.

There is another jam on the landing as the mob all try to get down at once.

THE DOOR TO CLARA'S BEDROOM

It is open and Rocklin stands there looking o.s.

	Well -- I do declare --

</MISS_MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
She can say no more.

<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocklin steps away from the door, where Dave and Clara now stand. He has Garvey covered. Dave is pointing his gun, and grimacing at Miss Martin.

EXT. FRONT OF CALDWELL HOUSE -DAWN

At hall window -- on Harolday watching.

INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Garvey is stepping back, in a cold sweat, toward Miss Martin, as Rocklin advances toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Garvey, quite casually)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talk.

Miss Martin opens her mouth, about to speak.

CLOSE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miss Martin. Her mouth snaps shut like a trap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Garvey, Rocklin, Miss Martin. Rocklin takes the tobacco pouch out of his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Garvey)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Ever see that before?

EXT. FRONT OF CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harolday at hall window. He raises his gun -- he is about to fire when a knife whirls out of nowhere and sticks in the window frame, inches from Harolday's head. He spins around and stares wildly here and there at the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GROUNDS AND BUSHES NEAR THE FRONT DOOR - FROM HAROLDAY'S ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is no one in evidence.
</DIRECTION>
<ARLY_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drop that gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
ON HAROLDAY AT THE HALL WINDOW - STARING HARD - TRYING TO LOCATE THE VOICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drops the gun. Arly and Juan come in to him. Arly has him covered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PULLS BACK to a WIDER ANGLE, getting the front door as it is opened by Rocklin, who evidently heard Arly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT FRONT DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Arly is prodding Harolday into the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<ARLY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Rocklin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was just getting ready to finish you off, through that window.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harolday is herded inside, close to Garvey and Miss Martin.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(almost enjoying this)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You seem to like to do business through windows, Mr. Harolday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
In the pause Harolday remains sneeringly silent.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not Clint's killer, by any chance --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<ARLY>
<DIRECTION>
(cutting in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By one bad chance --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(glares at Harolday)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Juan saw you do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLY>
<DIRECTION>
Harolday looks at Juan, who slowly nods.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, now we're gettin' some place --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
He brings up the tobacco pouch. But before he can ask about it, Arly speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<ARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That pouch is his --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicates Harolday)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Juan made it for him a long time ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Juan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLY>
<DIRECTION>
Juan nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocklin, with a sudden transition, speaks to Harolday in a hard, threatening tone.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Harolday)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you kill Caldwell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Harolday doesn't answer. He finally looks at Garvey in desperation. Perspiration runs down Garvey's forehead. Suddenly Harolday makes a mad dash for the door. Rocklin shoots, but Arly pushes his arm and sends the shot wild. Rocklin looks at her in amazement. Julio hurries out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT OF CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On Harolday as he rushes madly across the clearing toward the bushes where his horse waits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA SWINGS BACK to the porch in time to catch Julio crossing it in pursuit of Harolday. Arly and Rocklin come through the open door and stand on the porch watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BUSHES WHERE HAROLDAY'S HORSE IS HIDDEN - ARLY AND ROCKLIN'S ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They see Julio disappear in the brush. For a moment nothing happens; now Harolday's horse bolts out, riderless, and gallops away. Now Julio comes slowly into view. He moves slowly and deliberately back toward the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT PORCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julio comes in to Rocklin and Arly. The three exchange significant glances as we
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the hall are Clara and Miss Martin, Rocklin, Arly and Julio, Dave and Garvey. Garvey is seated and has evidently been talking in the way of confession.
</DIRECTION>
<GARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Harolday wanted the K.C. like he wanted the Santee and the Hardman place, for his land scheme -- He planned on breaking up the ranches into small holdings and selling to dirt farmers. He pretended to be on the outs with me so I could get Caldwell's confidence. And when Red caught me with the crooked cards and threatened to expose me -- Harolday shot him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARVEY>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did he kill Clint? An' not me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<GARVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That shot was an accident -- it was meant for you. We planned on getting the women to let me handle their business --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARVEY>
<MISS_MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting, furious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- And do us out of everything --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(moves close to Garvey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You vile -- wicked -- despicable --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
She is beside herself in her anger -- and taking up a large vase sitting nearby, she smashes it to pieces over Garvey's head. Garvey goes down unconscious. Miss Martin rushes to her room screaming. Clara follows her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON DAVE GRINNING BROADLY - ROCKLIN COMES TO HIM
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When he wakes up -- we'll have him put everything on paper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DAVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you'll have to do the writin' -- 'cause I don't know how to write.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
CLARA HURRIES BACK TO THE GROUP FROM UP THE HALL
</DIRECTION>
<CLARA>
<DIRECTION>
(genuinely concerned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Mr. Rocklin -- please -- I think Auntie is out of her mind -- she's in her room -- laughing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARA>
<DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
(grimaces)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What that ole pelican needs is a good spankin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<ARLY>
<DIRECTION>
(who has been silently listening)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'll bet you're just the one who can do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLY>
<DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
(his eyes flash with an idea)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah -- I believe I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at the group)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVE>
<DIRECTION>
He starts away down the hall, rolling up his sleeves. Rocklin's eyes wander to Clara, who seems quite at a loss. Now he moves slowly toward her. In the b.g. Arly watches Rocklin's every move.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess there's no rush for you to get to Garden City, now --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
After a slight pause in which she becomes conscious of Arly, Clara speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- I don't suppose there's any -- rush --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARA>
<DIRECTION>
There is another short pause. Rocklin glances at Arly, and Arly assuming they want to be alone, turns and goes out the door, leaving Julio attending Garvey.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARA>
<DIRECTION>
(after Arly goes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I was like her, I'd stay in the West.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARA>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That means you're goin' back East -- Cousin Clara?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<CLARA>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles, nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's where I belong -- I know that now --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARA>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's good to know where you Belong, I reckon -- Wish I knew.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<CLARA>
<DIRECTION>
(wistfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can tell you -- you belong with her --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARA>
<DIRECTION>
Rocklin takes it -- a faint smile brushes his face. He turns now and walks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE IN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GROUNDS NEAR CALDWELL HOUSE - SUN-UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Arly is seated on the shaft of an old wagon. The first rays of the morning sun streak through the trees across her as she smiles wistfully down at the antics of a little woodchuck cavorting on the ground close to her. In a moment Rocklin comes into view in the b.g. He spots Arly, who has her back to him, and walks over. His approach frightens the woodchuck away, and turns Arly's head toward him. Neither has anything to say. Now Rocklin sits beside Arly, but faces the other way.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(after a pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<ARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLY>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
There is another stilted pause.
</DIRECTION>
<ARLY>
<DIRECTION>
(her eyes sweeping the morning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beautiful day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLY>
<ROCKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(reflecting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It didn't start out so beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<ARLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's true of lots of things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLY>
<ROCKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fer instance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKLIN>
<ARLY>
<DIRECTION>
(hesitantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- you and -- me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARLY>
<DIRECTION>
There is another pause. But worlds are being said in the language of eyes. Their heads move closer and now Rocklin's arms sweep around the girl and they kiss.
</DIRECTION>
