EXT. A BODY OF WATER - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A glimpse of sunlight desperately tries to force its way through a gray sky before being obliterated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN, sunburned and bearded, lets himself fall from the edge of a boat and into the ocean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER, through shafts of light, white limbs are FLAILING. The MAN struggles, alone. Bubbles stream upward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He breaks the surface and gasps for air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He begins to swim. His massive arms and shoulders grab at the tide in large, hard strokes. His legs and feet are buried beneath the dark ocean water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A floating tenement. A crane LOWERS a fishing net into the water. The MAN swims into it. The net is RAISED as he lays, motionless, within its grip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOAT DECK - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crane swings around with the MAN in the net.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is EMPTIED out onto the deck like a fish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AHIVERING on the rotting wooden planks he FLIPS himself over on his stomach. Slowly, using the palms of his hands, he DRAGS his trunk and withered limbs across the deck in a labored lobster-walk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He uses his chest muscles to swing his legs around the edge of the boat. They dangle like pieces of rope, his feet white and flaccid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A towel, a bottle and a glass are wordlessly placed next to him by a CREW PERSON. He pours himself a generous amount of scotch and begins drinking.
</DIRECTION>

INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same MAN is illuminated by the light of a single candle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is dancing, holding on tightly to a WOMAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Though the light is dim it is clear that he is clean shaven, with his hair neatly trimmed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their connection is powerful and alive. They stop dancing, overwhelmed with mutual desire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He holds the WOMAN's face in his hands and KISSES it all over, moving into a realm of feeling that is foreign to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her passionately on the mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my dear...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
His fingers run softly over the outside of her breasts. She begins to undo the back of her dress and slips it down around her ankles. Wearing only her tight corset she brings his hands to the laces and together they undo it.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering softly)

INT. HALLWAY - MORNING

OSCAR, a manservant, is carrying both a silver tray and a pair of pants over his extended arm.

<A_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oscar! Where the devil are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Deftly, Oscar opens the door to a spacious bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<OSCAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My apologies, Mr. Roosevelt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSCAR>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There with his bare legs, muscular and lean, sporting black socks held up with garters is FRANKLIN DELANO ROOSEVELT, 39.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He projects a natural elegance and the confidence of a man who can have anything he wants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Right now... he wants his pants.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been standing here for five minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Oscar offers the tray to Franklin which bear cuff links and a Tiffany watch which Franklin grabs.
</DIRECTION>
<OSCAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you sleep well, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSCAR>
<FRANKLIN>

</FRANKLIN>
<OSCAR>
	<DIALOGUE>

</OSCAR>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin takes his pants from Oscar and steps into them, pulling the suspenders up and over his shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Striding into the dining room, Franklin lifts a silver lid off a breakfast plate. He dismisses it and instead pours himself a cup of coffee from a silver pot on the sideboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He overhears a voice from the nearby sitting room.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could not be more delighted to have received your most charming letter. It has been far too long since we last corresponded. However, it is with great reluctance I must decline your kind speaking invitation...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SITTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELEANOR ROOSEVELT, 34, is dictating a letter. Her enormous eyes, liquid and blue, reveal a woman of extraordinary intelligence and depth.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unfortunately, I would be of little assistance to the Junior Assistance League. Particularly if my purpose were to appear as an alumna who is gifted at public speaking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
She is dictating to LUCY MERCER, 27, deeply feminine with a head of soft dark hair and an accommodating nature. She is Eleanor's social secretary and closest friend.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is also the WOMAN dancing with Franklin the night before.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what do you really want me to say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you and if you ask again I shall scream?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
They share a laugh -- which is not shared by the homely rumpled mess of a man draped over a sofa in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you ask your husband for some pointers? He's a pretty gifted public speaker, don't you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
LOUIS HOWE, 48, is a wizened man of limited stature and unlimited soul. Franklin's political advisor extraordinaire -- part consiglieri and part priest. He is the mastermind behind what he believes will be the greatest political career of the twentieth century.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up and leans in closely to Eleanor. A cigarette dangles off his lip and the smoke rises up and curls in her face.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should get out once in a while. Accepting that invitation would be good for Franklin's career.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Howe, wouldn't you be more comfortable waiting for my husband outside?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the street, Mrs. Roosevelt?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
Eleanor smiles oh-so politely at Louis, as Franklin enters from the dining room.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see it's not even eight a.m. and already the gloves are off.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(kissing Eleanor on the cheek)

</FRANKLIN>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, sir.

</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
Quickly, she lowers her eyes to her work.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(annoyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're late. Honestly, why do you enjoy keeping people waiting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because they always seem more grateful to see me when I arrive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
He leans in and kisses Eleanor on the cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have a lovely day, Babs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should I expect you for dinner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have the Navy reception this evening. I'll be home quite late. Unless you've changed your mind about coming?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Louis looks up from his paper at Lucy who is writing furiously.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you wish me to come?

</ELEANOR>
<FRANKLIN>

	Well... whatever you'd like.

<DIRECTION>
(tipping his hat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good day, Miss Mercer.

</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Lucy nods and Franklin exits. Then Louis tips his hat to the ladies and follows him out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WASHINGTON, D.C. SIDEWALK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A car pulls over and Franklin is first out, followed by Louis, walking at a brisk pace as they cross the opposite side of the street. Louis struggles to keep up while consulting a small appointment book.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At ten you've got a meeting with representatives from Pittsburgh Steel. Their bid on the ship building contract has already been turned in and is on your desk for approval.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did I think of it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
An AFRICAN-AMERICAN man steps off the curb, letting Franklin and Louis pass.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had some problems with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I better read it. Steel workers tend to vote democratic. Next.

</LOUIS>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?

</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Louis shoots him a look that says "you know who."
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People know. It's time to stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can handle my own affairs, Louis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not this one. This is Washington, D.C., not the Harvard Club.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off-put by Franklin's arrogance)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you be so cavalier?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You say that like it's a bad thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>

Louis takes a quick last drag on his cigarette and follows him inside a building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large grandfather clock reads 3:00.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of a key in the front door turns and Franklin quietly enters. His hair is a mess and his clothing is slightly askew.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he comes through the hall two eyes shine in the darkness. They belong to Eleanor sitting rigidly on a settee, listening to the sound of Franklin's footsteps going up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UPPER LANDING - CONTINUING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin goes into his bedroom. Eleanor quietly comes up the stairs and stops for a brief moment by Franklin's door, then goes off to her bedroom closing the door behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRANKLIN'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin lays sleeping in his bed as Eleanor enters quietly so as not to wake him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carefully she picks up a set of keys on the dresser then turns and notices a packet of letters sitting on top of an open duffle bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tentatively she reaches for them. She brings the packet, tied with a piece of ribbon, up to her nose. She is shocked by their familiar scent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With trembling hands she unties the ribbon. Tears flood down her cheeks as she reads.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin opens his eyes.

Springwood is the three-story Roosevelt mansion. It is surrounded by a thousand acres of forests, fields, bridal paths and a glorious view of the Hudson River.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FIVE ROOSEVELT CHILDREN are screaming on the front lawn playing a boisterous game of croquet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SPRINGWOOD - DINING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARA ROOSEVELT, 65, sits at the head of the table. She is one for whom the expression "Grande Dame" was coined.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin is at the opposite end of the table, looking pale. Louis, as always, is by his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eleanor, like a prisoner who has accepted her fate, sits across from them, calm and composed.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have offered Franklin his freedom.

</ELEANOR>
<FRANKLIN>

<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lord save us from fools in love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Falling in love is out of the question. Why do you think men have mistresses? Duty. Duty to their families and their careers.

Eleanor rises from the table.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where do you think you're going?

</SARA>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's obvious that my input in this matter is of little importance.

She begins to exit the room, but Franklin is up like a shot.

Franklin chases Eleanor. Midway up the stairs, she turns.

	I don't know whether to hate you or thank you.

</ELEANOR>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For forcing me to face my life honestly for the first time.

</ELEANOR>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't mean to hurt you, Babs.

	You never do. You live your life skimming the surface... never aware of the attachments beneath.

Franklin turns away. He looks out the large picture window and attempts to light a cigarette, but his hands shake.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Franklin sees his son, ELLIOT, 10, playing separately from the rest of his siblings. Elliot looks up at his father as Franklin bares his best politician's smile at him.

A ROAR begins to fill his ears. It becomes clearer that it is the sound of a CROWD CHEERING.

CONVENTIONEERS shout out Franklin's name holding up PLACARDS emblazoned with:
</DIRECTION>
<COX_ROOSEVELT_IN_20>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin BOLTS, running vigorously down the center aisle of the hall lit by the circle of a spotlight. The CROWD goes wild over this unconventional entrance. When he reaches the edge of the stage he LEAPS onto it. This final act of daring pushes the crowd into frenzy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP - FRANKLIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiling for no one. For everyone.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(breathless)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I humbly accept your nomination for Vice-President!

The CROWD roars back in reaction to his less-than-humble stance.

<FRANKLIN>

	They say the best way to get rid of a man is to have him run for Vice- President.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You might well have asked my cousin Teddy if that's how they got rid of him!

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A harp playing in an elegant tea room. The hushed tones of polite conversation wafts through the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin sits with his cousin, ALICE ROOSEVELT, 36, daughter of Teddy. Brilliant and acerbic, she would have had a career in politics had she been born a man.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course you lost. A Roosevelt on the democratic ticket? Our ancestors are turning in their graves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cousin Alice, if Teddy were alive he'd be a democrat -- and you know it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rubbish. But I do know one thing: You're exactly like him. My father was born wanting only one thing: to be President.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what's wrong with that?

They both share a laugh.

	No, but I'm sure you'll tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They say F.D.R. stands for "featherduster." That you're a lightweight. A dilettante with no substance; no point of view.

<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that what you think?

As Guiseppe splashes some of the water on his face, Franklin, not to be outdone, does so as well. It's all for the cameras.

A large but unpretentious house with a sweeping lawn that looks out over the icy waters of the Bay of Fundy.

EXT. PORCH - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eleanor sits quietly on the front porch knitting -- in a world of her own.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few feet away -- also in a world of his own -- sits Louis, overdressed for summer in a three piece suit. An overflowing ashtray is by his side and piles of newspaper lie at his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He holds up a paper to Eleanor with the photo of Franklin and the Boy Scouts.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a natural.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Eleanor gives it a cursory glance then looks out to where Franklin and the children come bounding up the lawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin and Elliot break out from the rest and begin racing up the lawn. Franklin, no match for his son's speed, loses. He doubles over, trying to catch his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vae victis!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
("Woe to the conquered!") Caught up in his victory, Elliot doesn't see Franklin sneak up behind him and tackle him to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Festina lente!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
("Not so fast!")
</DIRECTION>

One by one the other children all pile on top of Franklin and Elliot.

Everyone runs up the porch stairs and into the house except Franklin.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go wash up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
Utterly spent, Franklin lays on the grass, not moving.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, boss! Are you all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, Franklin gets up and walks with great effort up the porch stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(re: her knitting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that's pretty, Babs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his hand on Eleanor's shoulder and leans in to buss her cheek but Eleanor quickly stands.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must check on dinner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
There is a cursory formality to her words and little warmth.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
She goes into the house. Louis then hands Franklin letters.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tired?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of you? Never.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Wearily, he sorts through the envelopes.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you nap before dinner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, dear.

Franklin heads into the house leaning heavily against the screen door struggling for control.

Franklin lays on a chaise being examined by a DOCTOR, who leans over him holding out his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you take my hand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin tries, but can't. Almost his entire body is paralyzed. He can only breathe and blink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Doctor glances at Eleanor, Louis and Sara indicating they should follow him out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SCREENED PORCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the door from the sun room opens onto the porch, Elliot is there waiting. Seeing them coming, he dashes off into the yard so as not to be seen as Eleanor, Louis, Sara and the Doctor enter.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has Infantile Paralysis. Polio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Sara sinks into a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew it. I knew it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought it only struck children.

</ELEANOR>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not necessarily.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did he get it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some experts believe it is linked to contaminated water. But that theory is speculative at best.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was the visit to that god damned Boy Scout Camp!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In all honesty you need to be looking forward, not back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is the prognosis?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DR_LOVETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The damage to his leg muscles is extensive. I suspect he will be paralyzed from the waist down.

Sara stands -- her bearing once again erect and proud.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then we must count our blessings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DR_LOVETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will need to prepare yourselves. There is a deep depression that follows an illness of this magnitude. I'm afraid life as he knew it is over.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Their discussion is suddenly interrupted by the sound of a child crying. Eleanor rushes off the porch to the bushes.
</DIRECTION>

Eleanor finds Elliot, having heard everything, curled up in a ball, weeping. She leans down and wraps her arms around him.

<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - WEEKS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UP - WALLPAPER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pink background covered in small white flowers with red centers and green leaves. There is a seam in the paper. A tiny white spot where glue has soaked through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK TO REVEAL - Franklin in bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is all he stares at -- hour after hour after hour.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His lips are dry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A glass of water sits tantalizingly on the night stand. He reaches for it but it's a few inches out of his reach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, he begins to rock his torso back and forth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HYDE PARK - PARLOR - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara, Eleanor and Louis are in heated conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that politics are out of the question he can stay here at home with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what kind of life is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've rented him an office downtown. He can still practice law.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would you want to do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because he needs it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He can pursue a career, Mama.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A man as proud and vital as Franklin... you're inviting him to be hurt. And you, Mr. Howe, engaged in the fantasy of a political future for my son... is there nothing you won't do to keep your job?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Sara leaves as Eleanor goes after her.

	Mama! That's not fair!

Franklin, still rocking his torso, has now gained some momentum, managing to have moved just a few inches.

INT. SUN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

<DIRECTION>
Sara busies herself arranging flowers.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of life is it to be pitied and stared at?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of life is it to be hidden away? I know you believe that what you are suggesting for Franklin is best. But I think you are making it harder for him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I know what's best for Franklin. I am his mother!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I am his wife.

Sara stares at Eleanor in disbelief. Eleanor stares back -- unflinching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin reaches his arm towards the glass only to fall from the bed to the floor with a thud. Frustrated beyond words, Franklin lunges at his wheelchair and shoves it across the floor letting out an anguished cry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In agony, from both the pain and the humiliation, he stares up and fixes his gaze on the ornate ceiling overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, closing his eyes, a POUNDING in his head starts to get louder and louder --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOAT - DAY - BACK TO PRESENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin, on his back, his face and body drenched with sweat, is asleep in his bunk in the boat. He awakens to the sound of the POUNDING. Voices are calling him accompanied by FISTS smashing at the door. He opens his eyes and is disoriented. He tries to sit up -- momentarily forgetting that he can't. He lifts the sheet and visibly WINCES in disgust at the sight of his crippled legs. BONES covered by FLESH with barely an ounce of muscle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally the door BURSTS open. Two young crewman, EUGENE and STANLEY enter.
</DIRECTION>
<EUGENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Roosevelt, we got a storm comin'!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EUGENE>
<DIRECTION>
He lifts Franklin over his shoulder. Stanley grabs clothes and pulls a set of long iron leg braces from a hook off the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eugene grabs a bucket and holds Franklin up to urinate.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(while peeing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave me here. Let the ocean swallow me up. Burial at sea. Perfect for a navy man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Stripped to his underwear Franklin is laid across the bunk. Eugene kneels and puts on Franklin's socks and shoes. Then he and Stanley slide on his braces and pants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their hands zipper, clasp, buckle and tie. Each hand works in synchronicity with the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clumsily they lift Franklin up, struggling under his weight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOAT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eugene and Stanley carry Franklin off in the driving rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINER OFF THE FLORIDA COAST - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kerosene lamps light the diner which is filled with people, mostly fishermen, seeking refuge from the coming storm. Franklin, soaked-to-the-skin and wrapped in a blanket, is being pushed through the door by Eugene in a wheelchair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The restaurant collectively pauses to take them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin is slowly wheeled across the restaurant. He shrinks from the stares of the patrons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LITTLE GIRL eating with her parents gets excited when she sees Franklin's braces and points. Franklin gives her a hard look and she is hurt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What he can't see is that under the table she wears a set of braces like his.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin is wheeled up to his table and EUGENE and STANLEY sit down with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis enters resembling a drowned rat. He rips off his hat and raincoat and puts down his suitcase.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(genuinely surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Louis?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never miss Florida in the rainy season.

</LOUIS>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No letter? No wire?

</FRANKLIN>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? Would you have answered it?

</LOUIS>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good to see you too. Nice whiskers. You look like Chester Arthur.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stanley, this is Mr. Howe. He gets sea-sick at the mere sight of a boat so he's probably happy that it's being Ldestroyed right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boys, I need to talk to Mr. Roosevelt alone. Find your own breakfast. Here's a five spot. Make it a feast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
They look at the money and take their leave.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're always so generous with my money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean your mother's, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
The Waitress puts down two cups of coffee. Franklin pulls out a flask and pours some into his cup. He then lights a cigarette and begins smoking, but doesn't offer one to Louis. Without asking, Louis helps himself.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So Mama financed this fool's errand, has she? Well, it's a waste of a trip.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was Eleanor's idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin's face is immobile.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can I get you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like some ham and eggs, sunny side up, please?

<DIRECTION>
(to Franklin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your fancy, boss?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. I fancy nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll have the same.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
The Waitress grabs their menus and scurries away. Louis opens his briefcase and hands Franklin a stack of mail. Franklin glances it, but doesn't open any.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are a few from your children.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can still read.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin flips through the mail and finds a letter that interests him, opening it.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your wife wants you to come home.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(choosing his words)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's concerned. I'm concerned. This life on a boat... where is it getting you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Getting me? For one thing, no one gets to see me and I don't get to see them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't say that. Everyone's waiting for you to come home. The kids... they're aching to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(reading)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?

Louis looks sadly at his friend.

<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(skimming the letter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From George Foster Peabody. He owns a resort in rural Georgia for investment purposes. Hot springs or something. He claims that only recently a crippled boy swam in the waters and can walk again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, for Chrissake...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(reading)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"The high magnesium content of these natural springs will hold anyone up. Although it is not a resort for infirm types I am extending you my personal invitation to come visit in the off- season."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(putting the letter aside)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm only welcome in the "off- season."

Eugene and Stanley approach the table.
</DIRECTION>
<EUGENE>

</EUGENE>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>

<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the boat... it got banged up real bad tied to the dock.

<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How bad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think you can stay there anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin absorbs this.
</DIRECTION>
<EUGENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it's a blessing in disguise, Mr. Roosevelt. I don't know about you, but I'm homesick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EUGENE>
<FRANKLIN>

</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
He hands Franklin the letter who rereads it.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not miracle waters? I've drunk the oil of monkey glands, been zapped with electricity and hung upside down in harnesses. After all that, this sounds downright peaceful.

Franklin and Eleanor sit next to one another. Franklin is now shaved and cleaned up considerably.

However, the tension between them is palpable. Eleanor knits furiously while talking. Franklin looks out the window at African-American FIELD HANDS hard at work in the red clay hills of Georgia.

	Meanwhile, any suggestion I make to Anna for her future -- she dismisses me. I am going to have to enlist your support in this, Franklin. She listens to you.

She looks over at Franklin and sees that he is staring out the window, deep in thought -- not having heard a word she's said.

EXT. BULLOCHVILLE TRAIN STATION - GEORGIA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM LOYLESS, 39, stands waiting by a car dressed in a white suit. Laconic, with a dry sense of humor, Tom is a man of few words whose poker face hides a true desperation. He holds a telegram from Franklin in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the train pulls in Tom looks for Franklin among the passengers making their exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are two different exits on the platform clearly marked WHITE and COLORED. Whites exit from the front of the train and Blacks from the rear.

LIONEL PURDY, tiny, and dressed in a mailman's uniform, approaches Tom. Of indeterminate age and dubious intellect, his mail bag is almost as big as he is.

Pine trees tower over the sides of the dirt road. In occasional clearings, Franklin spies barefoot children playing out in front of broken-down shacks. They stop their play to look at the car.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(covering his discomfort)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beautiful country.

They BANG over a large pothole. They all fly up and land hard.

<FRANKLIN>

EXT. THE MERIWETHER INN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom's car turns into a driveway. Franklin has a brochure for "The Meriwether Inn" opened in his lap. He tries to spy the building through the trees but cannot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks back at the brochure. The picture is of a lavish Victorian Hotel and the words, "Our renowned mineral hot springs can cure whatever ails you!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin looks up and sees a three-story hideous green and yellow monstrosity leaning slightly to one side. Paint is peeling everywhere. What once were flower beds are overgrown with weeds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car pulls to a stop.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll have a great deal of privacy. There are only a few guests right now as it's the off- season... I'm hoping to make some improvements by next Spring --
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin puts out his arm preventing Tom from getting out of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(panicked)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... I can't stay here. This place is a wreck.

</FRANKLIN>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Franklin!

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's true, we've fallen on some hard times...

<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hard times? This is a disaster! It should be condemned!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Tom's southern manners are being put to the test, but he stays remarkably calm.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, we've seen better days.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But then I imagine so have you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin blinks incomprehensibly at Tom and what he has just said.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm happy to drive you back to the train station right now, if that's what you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
They lock eyes. Franklin wonders if Tom's bluffing, but he can't tell.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(in a low voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fire. I'm frightened of fire. I can't get out if I'm upstairs.

Franklin and Eleanor sit in the car, watching.

INT. COTTAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheets cover the furniture, cobwebs span the beams and dust particles fill the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Tom maneuvers the wheelchair through the front door, Franklin notices a broken window.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(caustic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well ventilated, at least.
	</DIALOGUE>

Roy enters with a suitcase.

<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where do you want this, Mr. Roosevelt?

</ROY>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The bedroom, Roy, thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
He looks after Roy as he exits.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tom, this young man appears quite competent. Would you ask him if he'd like to stay on as my valet?

</FRANKLIN>
<TOM>

Pete, alone, drives the wagon past the Inn and out onto the road.

INT. COTTAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eleanor stands in the middle of the tiny living room stunned by the squalor. She speaks to Franklin who is changing in the other room.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is madness.

</ELEANOR>
<FRANKLIN>

Roy wheels Franklin while Tom walks in front of them leading the way.

</TOM>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Roosevelt doesn't know how.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin takes in the surroundings. Deserted horse stables in total ruin and tennis courts covered with underbrush mar the landscape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. POOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An immense, T-shaped pool rimmed in concrete. The bluish water is clear and sparkling and a delicate steam rises out of the warmth. A MOTHER, eyeing Franklin approaching in his wheelchair, comes to the edge of the pool and coaxes her CHILDREN out of the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AUNT SALLY, an ancient, gaunt, African American woman, stands guard by the edge of the water.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Roosevelt, I'd like you to meet Aunt Sally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aunt Sally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<AUNT_SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good day, sir. I have towels for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUNT_SALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Roy wheels Franklin as close to the rim of the pool as possible. Tom lends his assistance and both he and Roy HOIST Franklin out of the chair and place him at the edge, letting his feet dangle in the warm water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Twisting on his massive arms, Franklin lowers himself cautiously.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now give it a minute. You'll see that the mineralization makes the water more buoyant. The crippled boy who swam here was actually able to walk in the water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin's legs flop as his useless feet touch the shallow bottom. Crushed, all hope drains from his face.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't even stand.

INT. MERIWETHER INN - DINING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A handful of guests are spread out in a huge dining room. Franklin and Eleanor sit together. He is eating heartily, but Eleanor merely moves her food around.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is simply revolting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not very good, but it is mysterious.

<DIRECTION>
(holding out his plate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What in the world do you think they've poured over this chicken? Or is it possum?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Eleanor sizes Franklin up. She knows this is a preamble.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to stay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	New York has the best doctors and hospitals in the country.

<FRANKLIN>

	I need something new.

</FRANKLIN>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't about getting better is it? You don't want to come home. You don't want to live with us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I refuse to be a burden to anyone.

</FRANKLIN>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not a burden, you're my husband.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches out and takes her hand in his.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to offer you the freedom you once so generously offered me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she pulls it away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All you've ever known is duty. To me and to a political career that unless I can walk no longer exists. You've been exemplary. Now I'm telling you you're free to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
(her voice rising)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want freedom. I want a marriage. I want a life with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin won't let himself believe it.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't imagine what you think that life is going to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
This takes the wind out of Eleanor.

<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Franklin... it's not up to me to imagine, it's up to you.

Eleanor folds her napkin and gets up from the table.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. COTTAGE DRIVEWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pete helps Eleanor into his livery wagon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin watches from the porch as Eleanor rides away. Her suitcase slides across the open wagon bed, as the wagon makes the tight turn from the driveway onto the main road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ELEANOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking out -- straight ahead.

Alone and scared as he watches the wagon fade from sight.

<DIRECTION>
(suddenly overwhelmed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we've lost him.

Her pent-up tears burst in a free-flow. Louis leads her to a nearby settee and hands her his handkerchief.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please excuse me, Mr. Howe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>

<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Louis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we've been going about this all wrong. He's down there to be alone so let's give him what he wants. We change our focus.

Franklin is seated on the ramshackle porch in his chair. His cigarette hangs from his lip as he mixes martinis in a glass milk bottle. He pours one for Tom, then himself.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To your mineral pool, or whatever you call it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Warm Springs.

They clink their glasses. Tom takes a polite sip, then chokes back the bad taste.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too strong?

</FRANKLIN>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Haven't been in a drinking mood lately.

</TOM>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Actually, its the most god-awful martini I've ever tasted.

<FRANKLIN>

	Are you always this direct, Tom?

</FRANKLIN>
<TOM>

Franklin takes another sip, checking. It tastes fine to him.

EXT. POOL - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aunt Sally is seated, talking with Roy while Franklin lies on his back in the water, swimming. All his movement comes from his shoulders and arms. The morning sun streams down on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom sits off to one side reading the newspaper.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me more about what that boy did, Aunt Sally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<AUNT_SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, first he'd always swim over to the side of the pool and hold himself there -- make sure he righted himself. Then... before he knew it... he'd be standing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUNT_SALLY>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it was only that easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<AUNT_SALLY>

	Now you got to remember how you did it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUNT_SALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin holds the edge of the pool, closing his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a long moment there is silence. Almost without realizing it, Franklin lets go of the edge of the pool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he opens his eyes -- he is standing -- all by himself in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(a nervous laugh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm standing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
His laughter gets stronger. Tom, Aunt Sally and Roy look on.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm standing.

The release is powerful as Franklin dissolves into tears.

</LIONEL>
<DIRECTION>
He hands an already opened letter to Franklin.

	Reading other people's mail is not only impolite, it's illegal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<LIONEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheriff don't mind. He likes I read his mail. Saves him the time. Plus a lot of folks around here can't read, so it's more a public service, really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIONEL>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Astonishing. Thank you, Lionel.

	Ah, here she is now. Ladies, Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAIRWOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
A small crowd of about two dozen women offer up polite, but scant applause for Eleanor.

<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good afternoon. I am so pleased to be invited here today.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking down at her cards)

A PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a picture which throws Eleanor off.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too often...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
She stops. The pause is deadly. Louis looks ready to jump out a window. Eleanor continues, her voice still pitched too high.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too often the great decisions are originated and given form in bodies made up wholly of men...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, she begins to find her voice.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that whatever political value women have to offer is shunted aside... without expression. This is a mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up from her cards and stares at the audience... and for the first time speaks spontaneously.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think this might be the reason I am having such a difficult time giving voice to my own thoughts here today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
The immediacy of her self-effacing comment charms the room.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm reminded of what someone once said about looking at an elephant. That it is impossible to ever see an entire elephant from one place -- you must walk around it. If our elected leaders are to be truly effective then they must be willing to go out of their way to look beyond what is right in front of them. To see the entire elephant. And for that... they need our help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
The ladies applaud her, much to her relief. Louis beams.

At a reception following the speech, Eleanor and the Chairwoman are drinking tea.
</DIRECTION>
<CHAIRWOMAN>

<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Small town -- word gets out. It probably won't amount to more than a provincial puff piece but it might give us some free publicity for the Inn.

Franklin looks at Tom knowing full well he's arranged this.

<TOM>

	All right, I know the gentleman. I'm doing him a favor. You know, I used to be a journalist.

<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you mean all this time I've been talking to a newspaper man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not anymore. I got in a bit of trouble in Atlanta. Seems some of the editorial pieces I wrote offended the sensibilities of a local civic group. So I needed to lay low for a while.

	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that explains a few things. For the life of me, I couldn't figure out why someone like you was running this --

	<DIALOGUE>
	Rat-trap?

EXT. FRANKLIN'S COTTAGE - FRONT PORCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin is seated -- but not in his wheelchair. He wears long pants even though it's blisteringly hot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLEBURNE GREGORY, 28, sits across from Franklin -- a second string reporter in a three-piece suit.
</DIRECTION>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now in 1920 when you were running for Vice-President...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't imagine your readers are interested in ancient history. Cox and I lost the election by a wide margin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was only a few years ago, Mr. Roosevelt...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now it's the waters extra minerals plus its warmth that makes all the difference. At 90 degrees I can work my muscles for hours and not get cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As Assistant Secretary of the Navy during the Great War did you condone the use of...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I forgot one more thing you will need to write down. Poor circulation is a chronic problem for people in my condition.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Gregory looks at Franklin. It's clear he's not going to get the interview he came for.
</DIRECTION>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So... you think it could be a cure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<GREGORY>

Franklin is laid out on the bed as Roy slides the braces off his legs. Roy unlaces his shoes and slips them off his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is about to put them under the bed when Franklin motions for Roy to hand them to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still flat on his back, Franklin luxuriates in the rich leather cobbled by hand. He examines their smooth, immaculate soles... worn but never walked in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COTTAGE - MORNING

A newspaper clipping of Eleanor in her speech to the League is taped to the wall.

	Exactly.

</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
There is a knock at the screen door. An earnest young man, BENJAMIN PRENDERGAST, 18, is peering in. He has a newspaper.
</DIRECTION>
<PRENDERGAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, are you Mr. Roosevelt?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRENDERGAST>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>

Roy opens the door to Prendergast, who enters.
</DIRECTION>
<PRENDERGAST>

	My name is Benjamin Prendergast. I've come to see if you could speak at this year's graduation ceremony at the schoolhouse. You being so famous and all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRENDERGAST>
<DIRECTION>
Prendergast unfolds the newspaper. There is a picture of Franklin under the heading "FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT SWIMS HIS WAY TO HEALTH!"
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>

<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How is that possible?

A small breeze or a decent rain would knock it to the ground.

INT. SCHOOLROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bookshelf with four books.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few FARMERS and their WIVES sit with large groups of filthy children. They look at Franklin askance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Prendergast stands proudly beside three GRADUATES-TO-BE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom stands in the back observing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin, in his wheelchair, sits uncomfortably before the gathering. He notices a FATHER staring at his legs.
</DIRECTION>
<PRENDERGAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that we're all here let me introduce to you to our guest speaker today, Mr. Franklin Roosevelt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRENDERGAST>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good afternoon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
A fly begins buzzing around his head. He laughs derisively, almost to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At Groton, where I graduated from high school, our beloved Headmaster encouraged his students to enter public life...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up and catches the glazed eyes of an undernourished child which unsettles him.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I chose to attend Harvard for my undergraduate work and then Columbia for my law degree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
He takes in their uncomprehending expressions.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I followed my Headmaster's advice and sought a career in public life. But circumstances beyond my control have made that... very difficult...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at his tiny audience, all of whom know something about circumstances beyond their control.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've given many speeches in my life... I don't know why I'm having such a hard time making this one...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>

Horrified and unable to speak, Franklin seems temporarily lost, but the tiny audience doesn't seem to notice. They just see Franklin.

	They welcomed your company, Franklin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't patronize me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Tom is losing his patience.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't patronize them. These people go to bed night after night with half-empty stomachs -- your legs are the least of their worries.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
They continue to drive in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. POOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a cold day and Franklin is swimming in the pool.
</DIRECTION>

Roy is wearing a sweater. Aunt Sally is there, too, wearing a patched up coat with a scarf around her neck. Tom is nearby raking leaves.

<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Roosevelt, you're gonna catch the chill if you don't get out of the water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin ignores them and dips under the water as Tom comes over.
</DIRECTION>
<AUNT_SALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got to tell him, Mr. Loyless. He won't listen to us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUNT_SALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin comes up from under.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Franklin, we need to talk... Normally we close up this time of year and the staff goes home for the holidays.
	</DIALOGUE>

Franklin looks at Tom, then at Roy and Aunt Sally, acknowledging.

Sara sits at a piano between FRANKLIN, JR., 9, and JOHN, 7. They are finishing a rousing rendition of "Angels We Have Heard on High" as an enormous Christmas tree gets decorated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAMES, 18, is at the top of a ladder while his sister, ANNA, 19, decorates from the lowest rung.

Eleanor holds up a tiny porcelain ornament to Anna.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grandmother Delano brought this from China.

Franklin, working from his wheelchair is filling out the lower branches of the tree, his lap filled with ornaments.

<ELLIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever been to China, Father?

</ELLIOT>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Elliot. Just your grandmama.

	That sounds like an adventure.

</SARA>

Anna looks over at her father, sadly and Franklin catches her eye. She quickly looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From behind his back, John, pulls out the Christmas star and places it on his father's knee.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put it on top.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
Silence descends over the room. No one dares to breathe.

</JOHN>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can do it.

</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin tosses the star in an attempt to reach the top. It almost catches, but it falls to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quickly, aiding to avoid his father's embarrassment, James climbs back up and puts the star on top. Sara sensing the awkwardness of the moment begins to play and sing an overly cheery rendition of "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing."

Roy is spotting Franklin as he pulls himself along a set of parallel bars. Eleanor observes as Franklin uses his arms to drag his legs behind him.

	That's marvelous, Babs.

Eleanor is flushed with pride. Franklin, catching her look, slips slightly on the bars as Roy grabs hold of him.
</DIRECTION>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got you, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin then takes note that Eleanor's expression has turned to one of pure heartbreak.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wonder why I want to go back to Georgia... it's to avoid people who look at me the way you just did.

</TOM>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We missed you at the station...

The smile on Franklin's face slips to a look of shock as he takes in Tom's changed appearance. His face is sallow and his trademark white suit is hanging on him.

As they get closer, Franklin is stunned by what he sees --

A DOZEN PEOPLE -- all in different groupings -- some on crutches, others in wheelchairs, are gathered around the pool.

This news hits Franklin with the force of a sledgehammer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAT DOYLE, 50, is stuffed into his wheelchair with a huge cigar between his fat lips.

<DIRECTION>
His eyebrows have a life of their own. He wheels himself to Franklin.
</DIRECTION>
<PAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Roosevelt, Pat Doyle. I've come all the way from Minneapolis to shake your hand, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAT>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches out his hand to Franklin.
</DIRECTION>
<PAT>

	Stuck in this chair I do nothing but read. Newspapers, mostly. Usually I'm just looking for something -- anything -- that'll tell me there's even the slightest chance I'll walk again.

Franklin is uncomfortable, especially as Pat won't let go of his hand.

<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Such ignorance! Don't they know that after the fever breaks we are no longer contagious?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to have to ask that you not use the pool during regular hours. I'll put time aside for you late in the day... and it won't be possible for you to eat in the dining room either. But I promise I'll find someplace suitable.

<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They don't want us to eat in their presence?

</FRED>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did she sell it?

<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do me one more favor? Throw me in?

</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Roy tosses Jake to the heavens and he SAILS through the air emitting a jungle cry of pure emotional release before SPLASHING down hard in the water. He bobs up to the surface. There is applause.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now folks, these exercises are of my own devising so bear with me.

</FRANKLIN>

Some laugh, some are confused. This is new territory for everyone.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My hope is that in repeating these movements over and over in the water I'm in some way causing the muscles to regenerate themselves and repair the damage.

He swims to the edge of the pool.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So everybody grab the edge of the pool and move what you can!

They disperse, eagerly ready to do what Franklin tells them.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead now, do your best!

Their legs barely rise up to splash the surface. Undeterred, Franklin leads them on, spiritedly.

She begins to giggle. It's infectious and soon everyone has a smile on their face, overriding the awkwardness of the situation.

Tom and Franklin come out. Franklin gives a questioning look to Helena, pondering how these boys have suddenly appeared.

<HELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good news... I raided the pool hall. I call them my Push Boys.

Franklin is smiling like the cat that ate the canary.

INT. COTTAGE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A free wheeling game of poker. Heavy with cigarette and cigar smoke, Franklin, Tom, Fred, Jake and Pat are playing.
</DIRECTION>
<PAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Polio's always going to be a losing financial proposition, but it doesn't mean you shouldn't buy the place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAT>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am buying it. Make no mistake about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<PAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good for you, Doc.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAT>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you don't mind my asking, how will people pay for the services you are going to offer here? Most people with polio have a hard enough time making ends meet as it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<TOM>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The boy makes a good point, Franklin.

</TOM>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon will ya! The night's still young.

</JAKE>
<TOM>

	It's twenty-five cents not twenty- five dollars.

</TOM>
<PAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't mind him, Tom. He's a cheap bastard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAT>

Fred and Pat fold immediately as does Franklin.

<FRANKLIN>

They eyeball each other. Gunfight at the O.K. Corral.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>

Gleefully, Jake slaps his hands together and rakes in the pot.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your deal, Doc.
	</DIALOGUE>

<FRANKLIN>

EXT. MERIWETHER INN - GROUNDS - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun is about to rise. Tom's car is parked in front of the Inn, pulled up very close to the main entrance. The trunk is open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom, struggling with a suitcase, comes down the ramp. He deposits it in the trunk and then walks precariously back up the ramp, having difficulty navigating the incline.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes back into the house for one last bag. When he comes out, he's surprised by what he sees --
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where do you think you're going?

</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin is being pushed by Roy in his wheelchair. They are both dressed in pajamas and bathrobes, though Franklin has a blanket around his shoulders to shield him from the morning chill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom is caught. This is everything he wanted to avoid.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Going to Asheville to see my parents.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
From the sight of Tom's car stuffed with luggage, it is clear he is not coming back.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't do this without you... we're only just beginning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<TOM>

(You're beginning, not me. a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got cancer, Franklin. It's spread everywhere.

</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin is stunned -- utterly thrown.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... I'll take you to the best doctors. We'll go to Atlanta right now --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've seen the best doctors. When you were in New York they opened me up for the second time. Now I just want to die in the bed I was born.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin is struggling with this.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to do great things. This place has an identity now -- a purpose. It has you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Any guard Franklin had is gone. He reaches out and takes Tom by the sleeve slipping his hand into Tom's gripping it tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take care of yourself, Roy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God be with you, Mr. Loyless.

</ROY>
<DIRECTION>
Tom takes one last look at Franklin.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never pitied me. Thank you for that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On the contrary, I envy you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will miss you all the days of my life.

Tom gets into his car and looks at Franklin with a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good luck, Franklin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>

With a wave he slowly lurches down the long driveway and turns onto the main road. Franklin watches the car until it is out of sight.

<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	If it's of any comfort to you, I agree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm against it as well. It will consume too much of his time and energy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then it is settled. We tell him no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it is not settled. We must hear him out. Louis and I must see for ourselves the work that he has been doing then we will all discuss this further.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And tell him no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
They all look at each other for a moment. For once they agree.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>

	Perhaps I have underestimated you.

The BEEPING of a car horn gets their immediate attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roy leaps off the porch, skipping the stairs as his brother Pete drives up in Tom's car. He parks it and steps out.

<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>

	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DIRECTION>
He begins showing off a system of pulleys and levers that have been attached to both pedals. They thread through holes in a second dashboard, attached to polished wood knobs. It's a hand-controlled automobile.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That one there is your brake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>

Franklin begins running his hands over the polished wood knobs.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you got to push it real smooth or it goes all herky-jerky.

</PETE>

Franklin excitedly turns the key and starts it up.

<PETE>

	Wait, Mr. Roosevelt, you're not ready to drive yet!

</PETE>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes I am!

Franklin hits the gas as the car begins HALTING and JERKING the whole way down the driveway. Pete is yelling out instructions but Franklin ignores him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They all watch as he pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the car hits the end of the driveway Franklin reaches across Pete and opens his passenger door pushing him out. Franklin tears off alone -- out on his first solo spin.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

He points to a dilapidated gardener's shed.

<FRANKLIN>

	We also require a blacksmith's shop so we can craft braces here on the premises. I've found a wonderful local man who can make crutches and canes. His work is outstanding. Of course what is most desperately needed is a hospital. That's going to put my fund raising abilities to the test.

	What exactly are you proposing, Franklin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That this will be the first polio rehabilitation and treatment center in the world. My personal trust almost covers the price of the Inn and the surrounding land. There will be a modest tuition charged to the patients which should hold us over while I seek out investors.

</FRANKLIN>
<LOUIS>

Eleanor approaches the pool. It is as quiet as a church. She is stunned to observe over a dozen tables set up in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On each table is a child or an adult polio wearing their bathing suit. Next to them is a Physical Therapist also in bathing attire conducting therapy. In hushed tones the Physical Therapists encourage and work the distressed limbs of the patients as Helena swims to each table overseeing the work being done.

Eleanor sits down in a chair and watches fascinated.

INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING

The camera pans various tables revealing legs in braces, legs in wheelchairs, shapely legs, flaccid legs, children's legs... some reveal illicit romances, betrayed by secret hand holding and hands on thighs.

Jake and a new physical therapist, MARY BETH, are particularly cozy.

Eleanor, seated next to Franklin, watches as Franklin, in a rare moment of emotional nakedness, is at a loss for words.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right then, if I may do the honors of presenting to you the lovely Miss Eloise Hutchison of Cottage C.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Eloise wheels herself out. In a sweet, but untrained voice, she begins the introduction to her song:
</DIRECTION>
<ELOISE>
<DIRECTION>
(singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Think of what you're losing by constantly refusing to dance with me. You'd be the idol of France with me. And yet you stand there And shake your foolish head dramatically, While I sit here so ecstatically. You just look and say emphatically: Not this season! There's a reason!"
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELOISE>
<DIRECTION>
Some members of the audience begin to smile, knowing what's coming. Various STAFF step out from the kitchen to watch.

Eloise is joined by three others -- all of them in wheelchairs.

<ELOISE_CHORUS>
<DIRECTION>
(singing)

	<DIALOGUE>
	"But oh! What you do to me! I'm like an ocean wave that's bumped on the shore; I feel so absolutely stumped on the floor!"
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHORUS>
<DIRECTION>
This is too much for the crowd, including Franklin, Eleanor and Louis. They laugh and cry in equal measure at the sight of Eloise and her Chorus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The song finished, Franklin quiets down the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>

Daisy's mother, Cecile, carries Daisy to the center of the room where Helena meets them. Helena bends down and removes Daisy's braces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is hushed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Daisy then begins to WALK tentatively towards her mother.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON FRANKLIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Overwhelmed by what is taking place. He looks around and takes in the sight of so many different faces...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some are beaming, some are fighting back tears, some look away... the sight of it almost too painful... a reminder of their own private battles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON DAISY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only a step or two away from her mother she FALLS the short distance and lands in her mother's outstretched arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILD CHEERS go up in the room while Daisy's face glows with pride. She connects with Franklin, who matches her smile with his own -- genuine and beatific.

Roy lifts Franklin out of the wheelchair and on to the bed.

Eleanor enters holding a lit candle.

<DIRECTION>
Roy is about to begin Franklin's bedtime routine, but Eleanor gently reaches out and touches him on the arm.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
Roy looks to Franklin, who nods it's all right, and exits. Eleanor closes the door and puts the candle on the bureau. After a beat, Franklin begins to unbuckle his pants. He then lies back on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is your most pressing concern?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
Eleanor kneels before him and tugs the pants down, slowly, so as not to catch on the braces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eleanor folds the pants and carefully places them over the back of a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Getting a doctor to live on the premises full-time. Someone who, at the very least, could monitor our progress. Make us legitimate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
She begins to take off Franklin's braces -- a series of intricate buckles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eleanor slides the braces off his legs. His legs, though now deeply tanned are withered and spindly. He is still wearing his shoes.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that costs more money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Eleanor puts the heavy braces against the wall and kneels once again to untie his shoelaces.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the real problem is no one is interested. The annual Orthopedics Convention is being held in Atlanta this weekend and I offered to speak.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They turned me down flat.

Eleanor takes Franklin's pajama bottoms off the bed and with tender care pulls them up his legs.

<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A few weeks ago, the conditions at a garment factory on West 27th Street were brought to my attention. The owners claimed everything was satisfactory, but would never let anyone in to conduct a proper inspection.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches for Franklin's hands and pulls him up to a seated position. They are now face to face.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It took awhile, but we finally got in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
He searches her face for clues as to the woman she's become. He starts to unbutton his shirt and put on his pajama top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eleanor sits in a chair across from him.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I showed up with someone from the Labor Board and we refused to leave until they let us in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you suggesting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At the risk of my good standing with the Junior Assistance League, I suggest we crash the party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
She stands and walks over to Franklin and runs her hand through his hair. E
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	LEANOR Good night, Franklin.

She goes to the door and opens it letting in a shaft of light against the candle-lit room.

<FRANKLIN>

<DIRECTION>
She blows the candle out and closes the door.

EXT. ATLANTA STREET - DAY

Franklin's car pulls up to a massive stone building built in Greek revival style. Franklin looks intimidated -- there are two dozen stairs leading up to the main entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roy climbs the stairs like a stevedore with Franklin slung over his shoulder. Using enormous force, Eleanor is pulling the chair up and over each step while walking backwards up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AMPHITHEATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stage is lit with a skeleton hanging on a stand and large projections on a screen of spinal discs while a DOCTOR, in a dull litany, intones a prepared speech.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A clinical situation where the radicular or nerve root is compressed by the prolapsed disc is referred to as a radiculopathy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>

Double doors fly open with a BANG as all heads turn to see Franklin and Eleanor.

</ELEANOR>
<FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure this worked on 27th Street?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
(under her breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It seemed to at the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
They reach the befuddled Doctor on stage whose name tag reads, "Dr. Bissell."
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Dr. Bissell for agreeing to let us share the stage with you today. It was so generous of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Bissell smiles limply, saving face. The audience vaguely applauds. Franklin and Eleanor are now center stage.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My husband, as many of you may have read, is a victim of polio. However, victim is only a definition, not a state of mind. Franklin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her completely amazed. Eleanor gives him an encouraging nod to take over.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We all know that poor circulation is a chronic problem for limbs damaged by polio... I've never been able to swim more than a few minutes without becoming too cold. But there's a place, gentlemen... a miraculous place not three hours from here where the water is filled with natural minerals at a temperature of almost 90 degrees. That place, gentlemen, is called Warm Springs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One DOCTOR in particular, 60's, leans forward in his chair, listening with great interest.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Patients can stay in these waters for up to an hour. This is essential in allowing them the time to work on strengthening their muscles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have come to the shared conclusion that research for the cause and the cure for infantile paralysis is paramount. However, until that day arrives more emphasis has be placed on rehabilitation. We personally invite you to Warm Springs to come and take a look. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE AUDIENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
These "men of science" are mesmerized by Eleanor's style, both warm and immediate. She has disarmed them with her lack of pretension.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON FRANKLIN and ELEANOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their two separate journeys intersecting -- lightning in a bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOBBY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a receiving line in place to get a last word or an autograph with Franklin and Eleanor. DR. WILLIS, bespectacled, speaks with them.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_WILLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw you speak at the Legion Hall in Cleveland last Spring.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_WILLIS>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the League of Women Voters?

</ELEANOR>
<DR_WILLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You created quite a stir. Not sure you'll be asked back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_WILLIS>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin is ready to intervene but Eleanor puts her hand on his shoulder stopping him.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
(all smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I believe you must say what you feel in your heart -- what you feel is right, for you'll be criticized anyway. Damned if you do -- damned if you don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
DR. HEBERT, military in bearing -- the doctor who listened so intensely -- steps up in line and shakes hands with Eleanor and then Franklin.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HEBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Peter Hebert. I've been doing my own studies in this area. If it is possible I'd like to come and make an evaluation for the Journal of Orthopedic Medicine.
	</DIALOGUE>

Franklin looks to Eleanor, elated.

<FRANKLIN>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRANKLIN'S CAR - TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roy is fast asleep tucked around the wheelchair in the back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin smiles in Eleanor's direction. She looks back at him shyly and smiles in return. But her expression changes when she sees something in his eyes -- something she hasn't seen for a long time.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin reaches out and takes her hand, pulling her close. He stretches his whole arm around her and places her hand on one of the driving knobs, his hand on top of hers.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know how to drive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<FRANKLIN>

</ELEANOR>

Franklin smiles as they look at each other like two naughty children.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's going to be fun.

	I expect the Boll Weevil is always gonna be a situation, Mr. Roosevelt, but thanks for askin'.

INT. TRAIN CAR - DAY

A beaming Eleanor sits down next to Louis. He too is looking very pleased. Eleanor takes notice.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do I get the feeling we're not smiling about the same thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
The train begins pulling out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They both look out at Franklin. Locals are coming up to his car surrounding him -- he is a magnet.

INT. STATE ASSEMBLY, N.Y. - VIEWING SECTION - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Also seated are two politicos, JAMES HASTINGS and STEPHEN TELLER.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't kiss babies from a wheelchair. It'll scare their mothers half to death.

</HASTINGS>
<TELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Al Smith's got a lock on the presidential nomination.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TELLER>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't you think even after all these years that old Al's still a little rough around the edges?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
They laugh knowing this is a huge understatement.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Franklin can help soften his image.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<HASTINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How?

</HASTINGS>
<LOUIS>

Bluffing is one of Louis's strong suits and it looks like they're buying it.

Just then, Louis notices a familiar face down on the floor.

<LOUIS>

	Hey, Stansbury, give my best to the Misses!

An empty wheelchair, illuminated by a sliver of moonlight.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several yards away, across the lawn, Eloise is in Woodhall's arms -- they are dancing. He is singing softly into her ear as they sway, her feet never touching the ground.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MERIWETHER INN - NIGHT

Helena, in a nightgown, is looking out a window into the distance. Fiercely protective and slightly envious of her charges, she pulls a pack of cigarettes from her bathrobe pocket and steals a solitary smoke.

EXT. GROUNDS - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Franklin is walking on crutches aided by Roy. Nearby, a group of children practice on parallel bars with Helena.

	I'm here to take you to Houston. You started your speech yet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at Franklin, drinking. Shaking his head, he goes over to the sidebar and pours one for himself.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what this is, don't you? It's a golden opportunity. A springboard for you to run for Governor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin is silent. Frustrated, Louis takes a seat in Franklin's empty wheelchair.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ever hear of a Civil War General named Francis Nicholls?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I never heard of him either. But this was one brave son-of-a- bitch. Fought for the Confederacy and lost his left arm in one battle and his left foot in another. Then after the war he ran and won the Governorship of Louisiana -- twice!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was a war hero.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(with emphasis)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twice.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I've worked like a dog to keep your name in play, grovelling at the feet of the powers-that-be in back rooms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As much for you as for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be damned if I'm going to let you pass up a chance like this. It's time -- and you're ready.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COTTAGE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Waiting on the porch are Eleanor and Helena, who are seated, talking. Louis exits the cottage, defeated.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your turn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Eleanor rises and goes into the cottage as Louis takes her seat next to Helena.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COTTAGE - CONTINUING
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roy, so good to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<ROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very good to see you, Mrs. Roosevelt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY>
<DIRECTION>
She approaches a surprised Franklin. Leaning in, she runs a hand across his stubbly beard. He looks up at her.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a mess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The report. I'll never...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
She sits by his side and Franklin begins to cry. His sobs grow louder connecting to the despair deep inside him. It unleashes an avalanche of grief.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my darling...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm useless, Eleanor. I feel so useless.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not true. No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, his sobs subside.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have done a brilliant thing here -- a magnificent thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
Eleanor picks up the doctor's report and puts it in the fire.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get you in the water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE POOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin is wheeled down to the pool by Roy and Eleanor. When they get closer, Franklin makes out someone already swimming.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Pop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(squinting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
ELLIOT ROOSEVELT is now 17 years old. He has his mother's enormous blue eyes and his father's natural charisma.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elliot!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<ELLIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on! You getting in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DIRECTION>
Louis and Helena approach the pool.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sense a conspiracy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ain't seen nothin' yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin smiles, warily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A CLEARING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot is climbing a rope dangling high from a tree as Franklin and Eleanor look up at him. Franklin is standing on crutches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot descends with a flourish as Helena approaches Franklin with a single cane.
</DIRECTION>
<HELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Franklin, let go of your crutches. You're not going to need them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELENA>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<HELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going to make your arms function as your legs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELENA>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How is that possible?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<HELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elliot, go to your father and stand on his left side.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELENA>
<ELLIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think this may work, Pop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<HELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eleanor, take the crutch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELENA>
<DIRECTION>
Eleanor takes one crutch as Helena takes the other, replacing it in Franklin's hand with a cane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, with Elliot on Franklin's left side she bends Elliot's arm at a right angle, like a parallel bar, and hooks Franklin's left arm around his.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Going over to Franklin's right side she puts a cane in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<HELENA>
<DIRECTION>
(to Franklin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now use your right shoulder and pull your left leg forward.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELENA>
<DIRECTION>
He does so.
</DIRECTION>
<HELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good! Now with the muscles in your left shoulder, pull your right leg.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELENA>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One small bump and I'll land right on my keister!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<HELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what Elliot is for. He's going to hold you up. Hitch your leg! Come on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELENA>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin and Elliot attempt to walk. It requires immense strength and effort on both their parts.
</DIRECTION>
<HELENA>
<DIRECTION>
(ever the taskmaster)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elliot, don't lean in -- stand up straight. Pull against him. He needs you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELENA>
<DIRECTION>
After one or two steps the enormity of it overwhelms Franklin.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<ELLIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm strong, pop. You can't hurt me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<HELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can do this, Franklin! Keep going!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELENA>
<DIRECTION>
They start the walk again. It's awkward... difficult... but it's working.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
(under his breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be damned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin stops, exhausted.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Franklin, are you all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine. I'm just...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Roy runs in with a chair and helps Franklin into it as Helena, Eleanor, Louis, Elliot and Roy all look at him, concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<HELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't a replacement for the real work we're doing to get you on your feet again, understand? No one is throwing in the towel or even agreeing with that doctor's report...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELENA>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<HELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know it's not practical --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELENA>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's not.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's political.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin looks at Louis, then to Eleanor, and realizes that this could be it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GROUNDS - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin and Elliot are walking. Helena is close behind, coaching.
</DIRECTION>
<HELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Use Elliot, not the cane. Switch your weight to Elliot... good! Keep your head up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELENA>
<DIRECTION>
Off to the side Pat, Jake, Eloise, Woodhall and Daisy are having an informal picnic, observing Franklin.
</DIRECTION>
<ELOISE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why is he working so hard to hide it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELOISE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He doesn't have a choice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<ELOISE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I disagree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELOISE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you disagree? "There but for the grace of God goes us," that's what they're saying. As if our bodies is who we are, but it's not. It's our souls is who we are, but they don't know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<ELOISE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish he could just wheel himself out there in front of everybody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELOISE>
<PAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He can't do that Eloise, it's politics.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAT>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not gonna matter if he hides his legs as long as he don't hide what he knows. And what he knows is what it's like to be one of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin, getting closer, raises his cane in greeting.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good afternoon, everyone!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Off-balance Franklin goes down hard bringing Elliot down with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eleanor, Louis and Roy all rush to his aid, but Helena is there first.
</DIRECTION>
<HELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take a moment to catch your breath...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELENA>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn. You okay son?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<ELLIOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine, Pop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIOT>
<DAISY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fell down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAISY>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I did, Daisy. Twelfth time today. Must be a new record!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Daisy laughs as do the others, though some can't hide their concern.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin struggles hard as Roy and Elliot help him to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COTTAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eleanor is packing Franklin's suitcase while Franklin, sitting up in bed dressed in pajamas, works on his speech.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(reading aloud)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so America must find...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reconsidering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, America needs a pathfinder...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Louis, pacing in shirtsleeves, nods approvingly.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To emblaze the trail along a high road that will avoid... avoid the bottomless morass...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Discouraged, Franklin pushes aside the pages.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it? What's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if I fall... trying to get to the podium.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you fall, you show them how to get up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, if I fall in front of thousands of people I lose everything but their pity.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll be writing my obituary before I get up off the floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elliot won't let you fall, he'll be there. All the arrangements have been made, boss. It'll be fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are we fooling? This will never work. They'll never let me back into politics. They'll never see past my legs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My darling, they'll never see past your legs unless you do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MERIWETHER INN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin is settling into the driver's seat of his car, aided by Roy. Eleanor is seated next to him; Louis and Elliot in back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin's attention is diverted by something he sees straight ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is the entire Warm Springs group coming down the driveway in chairs and on crutches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the patients, the Push Boys, the physical therapists, Helena, Jake, Fred, Aunt Sally, Eloise and Lionel.
</DIRECTION>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, Doc -- we're not coming with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you'll be with me. No question of that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am proud more than you will ever know to be part of this community.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(his voice growing stronger)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A community based not on birthright or privilege, but on compassion and courage. The true power of these waters is that they brought us all together. Our ability to help one another is what will make our victory over polio endure. Our ability to survive... despite the odds.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin looks out at the sea of faces.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What we have done and will continue to do until this disease is defeated is come together -- like a family -- and do what we do best...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(his voice breaking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lift each other up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin starts the car as the crowd begins to disperse. Then, spying Helena, Franklin calls out to her.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Mahoney I need to speak with you, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<HELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, Doc.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELENA>
<DIRECTION>
Off her smile, Franklin reaches into his pocket and withdraws a small box.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
He hands it to Helena. She just stares at it, at a loss for words.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
She does so, tentatively, revealing a ladies watch.
</DIRECTION>
<HELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELENA>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't wear it in the pool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<HELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll try not to. Good luck, Franklin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELENA>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm throwing myself to the wolves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<HELENA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've faced worse. And if they bite, you can come back here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELENA>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll always come back here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Helena steps away and Franklin pulls out and down the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSTON TRAIN STATION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark and deserted Roy is carrying Franklin down a flight of stairs. Louis is hastily checking over his shoulder. If possible, Eleanor appears even more nervous than Louis.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're being superstitious, Louis. There aren't any reporters here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly out of the darkness a FLASHBULB POPS revealing a dozen or more REPORTERS staring incomprehensibly at the sight of a six foot, 200 lb. man being carried like a baby in the arms of a black man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No one does or says a thing. The PHOTOGRAPHER who had the wherewithal to snap the one picture raises his camera to take another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But DAN REED, a reporter for The New York Herald Tribune and a gentle giant at over six foot-four, reaches out and places a massive hand over the lens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, but firmly, he pulls the camera down.
</DIRECTION>
<REED>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REED>
<DIRECTION>
Louis and Eleanor stand stock still, tense, watching the scene unfold
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roy is sweating; his arms growing weak. Elliot brings the chair around and Roy gently lowers Franklin into it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a measure of Reed's standing with this group that his authority is unquestioned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the Photographer raises his camera again. Only now Reed isn't as kind. He grabs the camera from him and opens the back, pulling out the film and exposing it.
</DIRECTION>
<PHOTOGRAPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHOTOGRAPHER>
<REED>
<DIRECTION>
(tipping his hat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good to see you, Mr. Roosevelt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REED>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONVENTION HALL - HOUSTON - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The enormous arena is empty but for some maintenance WORKERS and JANITORS. Louis enters and makes his way to the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He approaches dead center and stands behind the podium looking out. GRIPPING the podium hard he ROCKS it back and forth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taking no chances, he pulls a hammer out from the rear of his waistband and a bunch of nails from his coat pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking around to see if anyone is paying any attention to him he quickly ducks down behind the podium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of HAMMERING fills the hall as Louis, on his knees, NAILS the podium to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONVENTION HALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Twenty thousand CONVENTIONEERS are roasting in the hall. It is Houston in the summer and it's broiling hot. A sea of hand- held red, white and blue fans are being waved all at once -- most bearing the words "SMITH FOR PRESIDENT."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Near the stage is a long table where the new breed of RADIO REPORTERS are seated, each in front of a primitive looking microphone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hovering in a group off to the side are Dan Reed and the REPORTERS from the previous night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin is standing ramrod straight holding onto Elliot's arm. He looks handsome in a navy pin-striped suit. As everyone else is sweating no one notices that Franklin is perspiring more than most.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is she seated?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Louis, a human train wreck himself, reaches over to mop Franklin's brow with a handkerchief.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a box stage left. Give me your hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin takes his hand off his cane. It's soaking wet. Louis wipes it, gently.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Louis, what the hell am I doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Putting your big toe in the water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUIS>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, a VOICE booms out from the loudspeakers:
</DIRECTION>
<LOUDSPEAKER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to introduce to you a man who as Assistant Secretary of the Navy served our country with distinction. A member of an illustrious family of long-standing political commitment to our great nation... Ladies and gentlemen: Franklin Delano Roosevelt!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUDSPEAKER>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin turns to Elliot and they both take deep breaths.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Elliot)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
The curtains part and they begin moving forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE STAGE OF THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION - CONTINUING 137
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BLINDING SPOTLIGHT picks up Franklin and Elliot. The SPOTLIGHT follows them as they make their way to the podium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin is hitching each leg forward, slowly. The tip of his cane hits the floor with pinpoint accuracy for balance and support.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leans heavily on Elliot's arm. The walk appears effortless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He chats with Elliot the whole way, still managing to flash the CONVENTIONEERS his million dollar smile. But the walk is slow and the ovation is beginning to fade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BACKSTAGE - CONTINUING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Louis stands in the wings clutching the curtain with one hand and covering his eyes with the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION BOX - CONTINUING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eleanor sits looking down at her lap, afraid to even breathe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE STAGE - CONTINUING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin and Elliot are still ten steps away from the podium. Sensing the crowd noise weakening, he whispers to Elliot.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Laugh as if I'm making a joke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANKLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot throws back his head and laughs. The crowd, wanting to be in on it, rise as one in a sustained CHEER!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But a puddle of sweat caused by the dripping perspiration from Franklin's hands is causing the tip of his cane to slip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elliot, ever aware, grips him tighter, averting disaster and finally they reach the podium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin grabs one side of the podium while Elliot, with a sleight of hand Houdini would admire, LOCKS his father's braces, whisks the cane away, pulls his father's speech from his breast pocket and lays it smoothly on the podium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE VIEW FROM BEHIND displays how Franklin's legs are spread wide for stability as he clutches the podium. He holds on tightly, as if the wood might snap from his grip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM OUT FRONT the crowd sees only a powerful man standing tall amidst the flashbulbs POPPING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Franklin has made it. He is home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MERIWETHER INN - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the denizens of Warm Springs are crowded around the radio.
</DIRECTION>
<RADIO_ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here on the stage is Franklin Roosevelt... a figure tall and proud even in suffering; a face of classic profile; a frame nervous and yet self-controlled. A man softened, cleansed and illumined with pain.

INT. WARWICK HOTEL, HOUSTON - SMITH'S SUITE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GOVERNOR AL SMITH, 51, is seated by a radio, surrounded by CRONIES. An overblown Irishman with gold capped teeth and heavy New York accent. He chomps on a lit cigar that never leaves the side of his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<CRONY_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell of an ovation, Al. Couldn't have asked for anything more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRONY_1>
<DIRECTION>
Smith sits silently puffing on his cigar.
</DIRECTION>
<CRONY_2>
