	Were you bothering by those waitresses making a fuss?

</GERALD>
<TOM>

	No. But, honest. What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks? I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."

Gerald stiffs a grin.

AARON ALTMAN, looking almost preposterously young in his graduation gown -- is delivering his valedictory. He is a rare bread -- a battle-scarred innocent.

	...and finally to the teachers of Whitman High School, I don't have the words to express my gratitude which may have more to say about the quality of the English Department here than my own limitations...

He awaits a laugh and gets only the weird sound of collective discomfort.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...that was, of course, not meant to be taken seriously. A personal note. I am frequently asked what the special difficulties are in being graduated from High School two months shy of my fifteenth birthday. I sometimes think it was the difficulties themselves which enabled me to do it. If I'd been appreciated or even tolerated I wouldn't have been in such a hurry to graduate. I hope the next student who comes along and is able to excel isn't made to feel so much an outcast. But I'm looking forward to college; this is the happiest day I've had in a long time. I thank you and I forgive you.

JANE CRAIG, ten years old, is in her room typing. Above the desk where she works is a bulletin board with letters and pictures tacked to each one. Her desk has several file racks which contain bulging but neat stacks of air mail envelopes -- a roll of stamps in a dispenser is to one side. Jane types very well in the glare of her desk lamp.

<DIRECTION>
(enunciating)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...please correct me if I am, 'obsession' is practically a psychiatric term... concerning people who don't have anything else but the object of their obsession -- who can't stop and do anything else. Well, Here I am stopping to tell you this. Okay? So would you please try and be a little more precise instead of calling a person something like 'obsessive.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She advances furiously on her Father since even this strung out, even with two additional pen pal letters to get off, she had enough sense of duty to kiss him good night before storming from the room. She exits the room INTO BLACK.

Stay on BLACK as we begin MAIN TITLES:

Emerging from the blackness -- Jane Craig -- now a twenty-eight-year-old woman -- a long speed walker wearing a jacket to which reflecting stripes have been glued -- the kind of gear only possessed by someone who runs at off-hours. The Jacket itself is a wish-I-had-it souvenir from some important news assignment, the sort of treasure you love about all else yet never mention. She stops running as she feeds quarters into the first of a phalanx of newspaper machines -- getting seven different papers before moving on.

She hangs up -- takes the phone off the hook and lays it on the bed for a moment's solitude. She sits stiffly, palms on top of her legs. It looks like someone with unusually good posture, waiting for something, and now we BEGIN TO SEE the first signs redden and she begins to cry. Now she sobs -- then miraculously shakes it off and exits quickly to the bathroom. This crying episode is clearly part of her morning routine.

Not a peep -- she is thrown but doggedly presses on with her prepared speech though her throat constricts a bit, her voice begins to rasp.

BACK TO JANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fumbling with her cards, sunk but game -- gamer than she would wish.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was going to talk about other trends but...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(mumbling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...the magazine shows, news at profit, influence of Entertainment Tonight, the danger, the hope, the dream, the question...Oh, I was going to show you a tape -- a story that was carried by all networks on the same night -- the same night -- not one network noted a major policy change in Salt Two nuclear disarmament talks... Here's what they ran instead...Go ahead. Show the tape.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
ON MONITORS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Showing the Japanese Domino Championships as broadcast by all networks in the Spring of 1985. It is quite spectacular -- the dominoes falling into one another provoking waves, crossing tiny bridges, setting off little fireworks. JANE'S AUDIENCE applauds loudly and squeals with delight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane between the two monitors. She begins to speak loudly OVER the AUDIENCE NOISES of approval.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(loudly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know it's good film. I know it's fun. I like fun. It's just not news.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as they continue to applaud)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you're lucky you love it -- you're going to get a lot more just like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
STRAY VOICE - SHOUT "GOOD"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane sitting rocked into momentary catatonia, by the event. Dazed as an animal stung by a tranquilizer dart. She takes some irregular breaths waiting for normal life to return.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom the last person remaining in the room. He approaches her -- she is totally unaware of his presence, even when he casually mounts the stage with an athletic leap. It takes courage for Tom to fully intrude himself, which he now does:
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Earnest, nervous -- handsome...Just when she needed a mirage there it is.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just wanted to tell you how great you were. My name's Tom Grunick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(dumbly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They hated me. I don't hate them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, they say if you can reach even one person, it means something... And you did that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Jane looks up at his smile -- a beat then:
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like to have dinner with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane arrives at the maitre d' stand. She has attempted to dress up to the extent that packing for a short-day trip allows. She looks for Tom. Tom rises from a table and is immediately at her side.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. I was worried I was early.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was a lot earlier.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
They are lead to a table and sit down.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight. More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(picking one)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like "godsend."
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't been in news that long. I've just been looking for the right person to talk to. I have about two thousand questions for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
He notices that her head has gone into her hands where it continues to rest. He looks at her a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's possible now's not the right time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
She lifts her head.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we could just eat first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Totally understood. Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had. Totally sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nooo. If I could just have a roll, I'd be okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a roll from the roll plate. He smiles at her. She takes a bite.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONVENTION HOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they walk along -- dumping occasionally and self-consciously. Jane is feeling a version of being turned on -- that is, a little adrift and temporarily free of obligations. She is open to making a memorable mistake.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Another thing I can't stand -- Is this dull?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Tom shakes his head almost violently.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, no, no...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Jane looks at him curiously -- then:
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(broadly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "White House" sources say...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That actually goes on...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. My room is down here -- I'm not tired. Do you want to keep talking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JANE'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small good room -- her working paraphernalia very much in evidence...the quality briefcase...the reams of well organized notes...the thick contact book -- Jane is sitting on the bed -- Tom, not far away in the room's only chair. One lamp is on and it serves to place Jane in the shadows and cast Tom in an enormously flattering light. MUSIC comes from her miniature portable STEREO system.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Jane smiles a calming smile.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail. So they made me anchor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So great -- right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you at back rubs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Jane shifts her position so that her back is to Tom... He is immobilized by the sudden turn. Jane waits, just a bit longer than it would take a man to run from the chair to her side before experiencing the ghost-like clutch of rejection. She moves briskly past the moment -- grabbing a "good night" chocolate from the pillow and munching it as she return to his agenda.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's sort of normal -- the way you feel. In graduate school everyone thought the only mistake the admission committee made was letting them in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
He moves to the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me. You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it. I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about. It isn't that I'm down on myself. Trust me, I stink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(levelly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I trust you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports. I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things. Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't write.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Jane laughs or, more accurately, scoffs as Tom Continues.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track. Did you go to college?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One year...almost one year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
He nods agreement.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'm making a fortune.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Jane laughs very briefly -- then rubs her face vigorously with her hands... He's making her feel a little crazy. She gets off the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(holding it in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I agree with you -- you're not qualified.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(letting it out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So get qualified. You can insist on being better prepared. You don't have to just leave it as...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(mimicking him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'I don't write. I'm not schooled. I don't understand the news I'm reading. But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
A beat, then he mumbles softly to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa, this was a mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just what do you want from me, anyway? Permission to be a fake? Stop whining and do something about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up to leave. She follows him.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you don't have to start right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to her.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hated the way you talked to me just now...and it wasn't just because you were right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
He exits.

INT. JANE'S HOTEL - NIGHT

She is on the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It wasn't just the speech -- the same thing happened with this guy. I have passed some line some place. I am beginning to repel people I'm trying to seduce.

INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

As he talks with Jane.

	He must have been great-looking, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you say that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because nobody invites a bad- looking idiot to their bedroom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Let's do me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This conversation is not worthy of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd give anything if that were true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night.

</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive? If needy were a turn-on?

	Call if you get weird.

</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JANE'S HOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hangs up -- pulls back the bedspread on the double bed -- on the other half are papers, schedules -- tapes. She doesn't clear them off so that she is literally sleeping with her work. The PHONE RINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(answering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was just thinking it was the shortest phone conversation we ever had.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PHONE BOOTH

A deserted well-lit area. Tom on the phone.

INTERCUT:

	Those audition tapes I sent out... I've been hired by your network for the Washington bureau. So I'll probably see you at work. Sorry.

Jane is rocked and soured.

</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. STREET - MORNING

Jane and Aaron walking to work -- agitated.

<AARON>

	They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the Times and he had a great audition tape.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to start going over who they could have gotten? They can't take on people like this for network news. For God's sake. What's going on?

INT. NEWS BUILDING LOBBY - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Tom arrives for first day of work.

<DIRECTION>
INT. ERNIE MERRIMAN'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ERNIE MERRIMAN is the network's Washington Bureau Chief. He is in his early 60's, has worked for the network about 40 years -- part of the golden age -- a family man, an honorable man, a good guy. Right now he is welcoming Tom to the network thereby good-naturedly helping with the destruction of all he holds dear. As he hands Tom his credentials:
</DIRECTION>
<ERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any particular area you feel strongest in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERNIE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To be honest, I was best at anchor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Ernie gives him a long look -- is he kidding?
</DIRECTION>
<ERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you take a few days observing the system? Then we'll put you on general assignment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
EDITING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two small TV monitors -- a smallish room. Jane goes over her timing notes which correspond to the time code SUPERED on the monitors. BOBBIE -- an extraordinarily silent man -- is doing Jane's bidding. On the monitor we SEE the mercenary piece which Jane is editing against a tightening deadline. The PHONE RINGS periodically -- Jane conducting abrupt conversations which continuing to edit. The pressure is palpable to begin with but builds and builds; almost like a family fight getting out of hand and threatening to bend lives. Through it all, Jane remains remarkable calm. Her focus is amazing; her command sexy.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(consulting notes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go back to 316, Bobbie. The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<BOBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We could...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBIE>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
As Bobbie expertly reverses the tape, Tom's face appears in the glass doorway and then he enters the already crowded room -- Jane's eyes click to him briefly. She makes not a move to welcome him. He pauses, but is committed and tries to find a piece for himself against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They said I should observe the...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Jane is distracted by the noise... Tom leaning over towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They said it would be okay if...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(incredulous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're working here!! You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She momentarily can't think of the word 'corner.' Then back to Bobbie:
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Play back the last line...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<BOBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said something about...

</BOBBIE>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(sharply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me hear it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Bobbie, taking the sharp commands with ever increasing, yet still repressed resentment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Assistant Director, BLAIR LITTON, enters the editing room. She is about 26 and every night since she got her job as Assistant Director she has been the first to crack under pressure.
</DIRECTION>
<BLAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll need it in ten minutes. We're putting it directly into...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
Jane holds up a finger of warning to Blair as she picks up a ringing phone and talks to Bobbie at the same time.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Craig, just a second --

<DIRECTION>
(to Bobbie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me hear it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Through much of this chaos we focus on:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wedged into an uncomfortable position between two tape racks -- He is wide-eyed at this circus of tension and fear. His eyes dart around constantly -- trying to take in as much as he can, always returning with wonder to focus on Jane.
</DIRECTION>
<MERCENARY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been a long time since I've seen my folks and all but...I don't expect any big-deal homecoming.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be right down. It's right tight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She crosses out.

<BLAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got to tell Ernie...because there isn't enough time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLAIR>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, there is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Blair leaves, as Jane gathers up her notes. She charges out leaving Tom awkwardly along with Bobbie.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Tom Grunick. I started on General Assignment today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Bobbie stops the machine, turns in his chair and shakes hands. Then he smiles secretly and speaks his first full sentence.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBIE>

Tom exits.

Aaron is having a theoretical discussion with Ernie and JENNIFER MACK, a correspondent in her early 40's, a pioneer beauties in news. She is well-schooled, bred, trained and known... GEORGE WEIN, a black correspondent in his 40s, and MARTIN KLEIN, formerly with the Johnson administration -- State Department correspondent for the network.
</DIRECTION>
<KLEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, what about this? Here's a tough ethical one. Would you tell a source that you loved them just to get some information?

<AARON>

	Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a Homecoming The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children. But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal.

INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blair hikes up her skirt and takes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our "chase scene" as Blair soars through the newsroom, leaping a chair smoothly, smashing her leg against a table in full flight, the adrenaline deadening the pain -- she arrives at a waiting elevator -- uses a key dangling from her neck to unlock it... jumps nervously during the ride and now, in FULL EXTENDED FLIGHT, barrels down the long corridor heading to the control room where she arrives; slamming the tape into a technician's hand even as it is introduced on the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aaron, Jane, the others looking at the end of the piece on the air -- Tom in the b.g. as Blair enters -- relaxed, almost jaunty.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The end of the piece -- the Rockwell painting giving way to the mercenary's actual homecoming which matches the portrait. The irony works nicely. The network anchorman comes up for his close. BILL RORISH, 50 years old and able to flutter much younger pulses. He is able and experienced -- a reporter who has become a journalistic king.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
<DIRECTION>
(on monitor, smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bill Rorish...Thank you...Good night.

EXT. CENTRAL AMERICAN JUNGLE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Aaron, Jane and their CREW march along with a CONTRA SQUAD deep in their own conversation. Except for the DIN of TROPICAL BIRDS they seem almost like a cranky married couple on their way to work.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't sleep. They're giving me less and less air time. They don't think I'm at all anchor material.

</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
They have entered a clearing where supplies have been dropped, the Guerrillas already tearing apart boxes with army boots inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A guerrilla soldier rubbing his shoeless foot. A pair of new boots sit alongside him. Jane's Cameraman prepares to shoot, saying in Spanish, then English:
</DIRECTION>
<CAMERAMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put on the boot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERAMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Jane rushes into the scene incensed.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop! We are not here to stage the news. Wait and see what he does.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Then to the totally confused soldier.

<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, you do whatever you want. It's your choice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
By now there is a fair-sized cluster of armed men as well as the news team staring at the guerrilla, who is at loss as to what is expected. He looks to Jane, who can offer no help save her own determination not to interfere. Finally he puts on the boot.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Cameraman)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.

Tom has a real sense of the moment -- of having arrived. The strange bubble of pleasure rises to the surface as he walks off to cover his first story. He laughs out loud, loving his lot.

Jane in the f.g. with her crew while Aaron talks in rapid Spanish to the GUERRILLA LEADERS.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you guys kidding or do you really think you'll run into something...? I mean, do you feel that every time and it never happens? Or is it the first time it felt that way and it's going to happen?... I mean, how bad can it be?... Are you nervous...? What's the chances on a scale of one to ten -- that we're going to be in a war within the next few hours?... Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to walk towards Jane -- one of the men he was talking with calling after him with an added thought.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, you speak English very well too.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jane)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great news. He says they've been engaging the Sandinistas pretty regularly and that he'd be really surprised if we didn't take fire tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>

Jane reacts -- a flash of exhilaration. Aaron is amazed at her attitude.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jane)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If anything happens to me tell every woman I've ever dated I was talking about them at the end. That way they'll have to reevaluate me.

Jane laughs out loud, attracting the Guerrillas' attention. Aaron repeats his speech in Spanish. The Guerrillas laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aaron and Jane in line behind the Guerrillas. They HEAR A SHOT. The head of the patrol gestures -- deploying his men. Aaron grabs Jane and heads for some cover to the left. As they run -- more SHOTS. Jane in work mode. As soon as they settle.

As they start taping he is breathless with the nervousness of the nearly gunfire.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The first shots were fired not thirty seconds ago. The Contras feel they must be outnumbered this is so small a unit: that's a given. Still they hold their ground despite the fact that their weapons have been acting up -- misfiring or jamming. A new shipment of rifles is expected tomorrow -- all they got today were the shoes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
There is the SOUND OF GUNFIRE.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM'S P.O.V.

<DIRECTION>
The mass of journalists and technicians shouting questions. "Will you dispatch troops?" after the Ambassador they've been awaiting -- clumping on his limo and then being shaken by the movement of the vehicle.

	Will you just get packed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She waves him off -- then she walks several yards away, holding a knapsack in her hand. She takes off a brush and runs it through her hair -- opens a plastic case and takes out a travel toothbrush, brushes her teeth and rinses her mouth with water from her canteen. She puts everything back in place, then looks about, sobs for several beats. One of the Guerrillas hears her sobbing and enters the scene -- he stands a respectful distance away. Jane finishes, notices him, makes a face by way of explanation, and exits the scene feeling measurably better.

</CAMERAWOMAN>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Cause for the interview they're going to use a screen and disguise me to protect my anonymity so could I see myself before that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<CAMERAWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMERAWOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Camerawoman punches a button and immediately Buddy's image comes up on a standing monitor on the studio floor. He's not happy with the image -- but works at concealing his reaction -- gasping a bit of air -- trying to touch it. Aaron enters. Tom smiles a friendly smile which flusters Buddy momentarily. But again he almost manages to conceal his private rush. Buddy's internal drama is such he invariably finds himself covering up, fearful roomfuls of people will simultaneously guess his thoughts.

Aaron directs him behind a screen and looks at his notes.

As Aaron walks out -- Tom is momentarily fixed on the sight of Buddy walking in small circles giving himself a talking to.
</DIRECTION>
<BUDDY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Great time to act out, Buddy. You won't be happy until you turn the whole world off.

He notices Tom.

	Thank you for not shunning me and all.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really did have all that information but I thought I might just be being vindictive to get a little hunk of the ol' spotlight. I know, horrible -- but I didn't do it, so okay? And thanks again and would you like to have a drink -- at a regular bar?

Tom and Buddy on adjoining stools. For Tom, the last weeks have been humbling, antagonistic. He's enjoying Buddy who listens attentively and wholeheartedly endorses every word Tom speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me. I'm in no rush for anything. It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bad manners.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. That's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight. You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing.

(looks right at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honestly.

</TOM>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. At least let me show my appreciation. The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
At the bar getting a drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer ENTERS THE SCENE... and leads Jane down the hall until they are standing alone.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is very awkward.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead -- what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ummm -- it's dumb dorm stuff but I see Tom around you a lot and this is such a small office and I'd like to see him outside of work, unless there's some reason for you to mind... in which case I just won't do anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God Almighty -- Whew. Do I mind? Why do I mind? I do mind. What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him. I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?

</JANE>
<JENNIFER>

	You're saying stay away from him.

She blinks in wonder.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't have to settle this definitively right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer moves toward the drinking table -- Jane, unsteadied by the dose of self-revelation, moves towards Aaron's circle and scratches his back in friendship... Tom approaches an she moves off -- not wanting to deal with him. She takes a few breaths as she keeps walking. We HEAR snatches of PARTY CONVERSATIONS, i.e:
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE_WELN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me one person who ever left television news to work on a newspaper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE_WELN>

She moves on; Tom still following.

Jane turns -- sees that Tom is still looking at her from a few feet away.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(badly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Tom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She stands there, genuinely frightened. She must deal with him now. He crosses to her.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the firs time I've seen you dressed like this. You look so clean and pretty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean clean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At work there's always this sort of film over you.

	Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.

</JANE>
<TOM>

Jane starts twitching. She pauses -- holds a hand lightly on his arm to steady herself.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Just don't say anything mean for a while. Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She meets his gaze for an instant -- and, in that instant, loses control for the first time in her memory. She looks strange as she retreats from this glimpse of upheaval.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got to find someone. It's important. Excuse me.

ON AARON AND ERNIE
</DIRECTION>
<ERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had the strangest thing happen yesterday. Anne and I have been married what? -- Thirty-six years... Everything fine -- two days after the promotion came through, I was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back. So yesterday I looked in the mirror and she was doing it again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERNIE>
<AARON>

</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
ON JANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she passes a chair with an afghan shawl on the back -- she picks it up and wraps it around herself, a bit chilled. She sees Jennifer on the stairs and moves toward her calling in a too loud, anxiety-ridden voice as she goes.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jennifer. Hey, Jennifer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>

She pushes at Jennifer a little.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, there's nothing I'm going to do right this second.

Jane pushes her again.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it's a party, right?

</JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
Jane smiles back feigning female bonding -- Jennifer goes back down the steps and crosses to Tom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aaron takes in Jane, who is taking in Jennifer and Tom -- then Aaron begins to sense a new dynamic in the room as Ernie re-enters and huddles briefly with Paul... The News President is intent... The two of them walk over to Tom and Jennifer. We PICK UP just a few words:
</DIRECTION>
<ERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This would be a good time to tap that source of yours. He could have an angle or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
AARON'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom is startled but cool -- nods his head -- Jennifer is amazed looking at Tom with new and even prettier eyes... Paul and Ernie now move toward Jane, a whole flow of movement creating a new energy in the area. Jane sheds her Afghan as she rises to meet them.
</DIRECTION>
<ERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jane)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We want you to exec produce a Special Report...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERNIE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Aaron has come over to join them now in time to HEAR.

<ERNIE>

	A Libyan plane shot up one of our bases in Egypt. It's all still happening.

</ERNIE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's figure out the field.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<ERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unfortunately, since Paul's here, he's made out the assignments... Jennifer at the White House... George at the Pentagon...Martin at State...and we need an anchor since Rorish is in his boat, so we're gonna do the whole report this afternoon from here...with Tom.

	I'll tell you what. I'll stay if Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ernie, as much as I like you, I think I have to tell Paul what I think, because this is really sort of obscenely stupid.

	Jane, if you want to, go ahead. I don't disagree with you.

Jane moves quickly off, awed at the prospect of taking on the big boss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON JANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she moves past Tom who is talking on the phone, eventually catching up with Paul. In the b.g. Tom has just HEARD the "BEEP" of an ANSWERING MACHINE.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Buddy. It's 1:35 -- and this is Tom. You can reach me at the office. It's important. I can use a little help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Jane, because of the proximity to Tom is speaking in whispered intensity.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him. Not near ready. Not by the longest shot. Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story. I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, that's your opinion. I don't agree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not opinion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're just absolutely right and I'm absolutely wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
She nods.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It must be nice to always believe you know better. To think you're always the smartest person in the room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(from her depths)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's awful. Oh my, it's awful.

</JANE>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to leave)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'd better get moving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
As they move out... Jane goes to Aaron... He moves with her towards the door.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?

<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch? --

</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She runs out the door. Aaron turns mean and mocks Jane's last words -- screwing up his face in a savage burlesque.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, love you, too.

EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY

Jane looks over at him -- there's no question he's just told the truth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the b.g. we SEE the Bureau Newsroom beginning to pulse with activity. Tom closes the door. He sits down behind his desk and opens a bottom drawer -- a clean whit shirt lies there. He opens the center drawer -- two ties are inside. He picks one. He reaches for a package of new red suspenders. He takes off the shirt and puts on the new one -- all of this the work of an expert craftsman. By the time he finishes he looks like the authority figure we know he's now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUREAU NEWSROOM - JANE AND BLAIR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane is NOT hyper. She is purposeful -- organized -- even calming Blair with a little physical contact -- a touch on the arm, to still her colleague's hysterical demons.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell George and Jessica to try and cover everything without Tom having to ask additional questions.

</JANE>
<BLAIR>

</JANE>
<BLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
(a breath, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</BLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
In the b.g. Tom has exited his office and looks about -- waiting for some indication as to what to do next.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the most important thing make sure his earpiece works, have back-ups ready. That's never been more vital. He must be able to hear me at every second and clearly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Jane sees him. She moves across the room -- takes Tom by the arm.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have twenty minutes -- you can wait in the studio.

Tom coughs nervously into his hand and takes a pen from a nearby desk, clips it into his inside pocket and walks off.
</DIRECTION>

GRAPHICS ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane is screening and asking corrections in a graphic representation of an F-14 shooting down a Libyan Air Force Mirage Fighter.

She uses the stylus from the ELECTRONIC PAINT MACHINE to outline an American Air Force E-2C Hawkeyes Radar Plane. Her work is stunning.

INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has a glass in hand -- some chips on the table with a bottle of wine as he selects a Cassette Desk to play. He picks a French song -- looks at some of his books. He might even read. He is feigning disinterest for an audience of no one. He SINGS ALONG with the RECORD in perfect French.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STUDIO HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom checking copy in the long hallway leading to the studio -- there is the merest of hubbubs causing him to look up. Buddy is being stopped at the other end of the hallway.

	Well, then check -- but hurry -- There he is!!!

Buddy runs the length of the hallway to Tom's aide despite Tom's gestures to slow down.
</DIRECTION>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is everything all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<TOM>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong?

Tom stands there -- a man at home in this media castle.

	Good. He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.

</TOM>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, who knows. Just let m tell you what my favorite teacher ever, told me -- 'Don't be afraid to be wonderful.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
He leans forward, gives Tom a quick embrace, a small kiss on the cheek. Tom turns and walks off down the hallway to meet his immediate destiny as Buddy looks on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane mounts some steps in the control room -- she moves past the DIRECTOR and TECHNICAL CREW up to the next level where the two news execs, Ernie and Paul stand with their backs to the wall, and then up one more step slightly above the desk and table occupied by Blair. Now she slips into the large well paddled throne-like seat -- as WE BEGIN MUSIC CUE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Literally at her fingertips is the row of buttons which provide immediate access to the field reporters at the Pentagon, State and the White House. In front of her the bank of monitors, the Technical Team and past them the studio where Tom is seated at Anchor, a FLOOR PRODUCER and WRITER feeding him copy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE FAVORING BLAIR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she looks at Jane, poised to control the complicated apparatus of minds and machines comprising the big time network news. And Jane Craig is at the helm. Blair experiences a flash of emotion which transcends envy and verbalizes it.
</DIRECTION>
<BLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
(sotto to Jane)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Executive Producer -- wow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
Jane looks at her and, in a moment of atypical merriment, does a choking gesture at her own throat as the monitors flash a graphic reading: SPECIAL REPORT... We HEAR an ANNOUNCER'S VOICE say, "This is a Special Report from..."

<DIRECTION>
INSERT: JANE'S CONTROL PANEL

Gulping the air in relief, she slumps nonetheless impressed by the macho cool as:

	<DIALOGUE>

He begins his report. He seems authoritative, compelling, even in a low key way. We trust him.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Good afternoon. A Libyan fighter plane attacked a United States Military Installation early this morning and was, itself, shot down by American F-14 Interceptors.

Another monitor shows the Graphic running. In the b.g. two men approaches Paul. They look out of place, decidedly non-business like.

INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Aaron is seated, feet up, drinking, listening to MUSIC -- reading a book, two remote controls are on the cushion next to him. He SINGS OUT LOUD with the record as he reads -- at one point providing his own lyric line OVER THE MUSIC.

<AARON>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Me again. Hi. Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything. When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
ON JANE
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.

Her finger hits the "Tom" button.

Jolted by the shriek in his earpiece but nonetheless continuing.

BACK TO JANE

As she SCREAMS INTO the phone -- this is more than volume, she is over-the-top livid, her face red, neck cords popping.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We only have ten minutes left -- how can you talk to me about parking problems? No, not you'll try...you'll do it -- do it or I'll fry your fat ass, Estelle. Good-bye.

INT. STUDIO - EIGHT MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING CAMERA FROM Tom's left profile TOWARDS HIS RIGHT PROFILE, TAKING IN THE Production Assistant who madly shuffles pages, even as Tom talks on camera, the monitor through which he sees the subject of his interview at the Pentagon, the clusters of a assistants on the floor and now WE CONTINUE TO CIRCLE BEHIND him, beginning to SEE the Control Room in the b.g. and as we MOVE IN TOWARDS HIS EAR, the white ear piece firmly in place, we BEGIN TO HEAR, the barely audible crackle of Jane's VOICE as she tells him roughly what to say and how long he has to say it.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...So, Commander, it must have been a bit tougher today -- shooting down the French-made Mirage Jet. The one you got was a SU-22...etc...

And NOW ALL IS OBSCURED EXCEPT THE ANCHOR'S EARS, the ear piece and the RED LIGHT on the CAMERA and beyond... almost an abstract vision.

The special report ended, Jane breathes a breath -- she and Blair momentarily grasp hands. The first talk concerns Tom.

She exits the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Usher brothers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was important for Tom -- there's that bonding thing that happens with the public and an anchorman during a crisis. It's not the conventions anymore; it's this kind of moment.

Tom enters. He is exuberant.

Man Two has the keyboard out and begins playing the prospective news theme: a suite meant to have majesty and drive, a towering composition -- the effect of it somewhat lessened by the fact that the two men VOCALIZE OTHER INSTRUMENTS over the keyboard.

INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. It was an unusual place to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indescribable -- you knew just when to feed me the next thing, just a split second before I needed it. There was a rhythm we got into, like great sex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Jane looks at him and nods slightly -- an unconscious spasm of truthfulness.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to celebrate with me, don't you? Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going over to Aaron's. Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later. How long do you think you'll be there?

Tom indicates that it's an impossible question to answer. They enters the elevator.

EXT. NEWS BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As several people cross the street towards the bar. Tom has been holding back on one question.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>

	It's tempting to ask you how you think I did.

<DIRECTION>
(she starts to reply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I'm enjoying myself. Take it easy.

He starts across the street.

<TOM>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.

Tom races to catch up with the others -- Jane in the distant b.g. pauses a beat before walking off in the opposite direction. Jane moving quickly along.
</DIRECTION>

SOUND OF MEN VOCALIZING NEWS THEME comes UP AND continues through:

EXT. AARON'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING

As Jane approaches and is surprised to find him sitting on the stoop outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON AARON

</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
He nods and APPLAUDS some more.

<JANE>

	Your calling in that information -- you're the classiest guy I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
He waves her off... And sits down on the stoop.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was strange to watch him. What's the next step? Lip synching?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
She sits a step or two above him, waiting to gauge his mood.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been doing some of the most important thinking of my life. I wonder if this is the right time to tell you about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>

She steals a glance at her watch.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, whatever you think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better. That's why.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds like you may be on to something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not tell you? -- it's a happy thing. In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further. Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
He tales her by the arm and leads her to the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?

He leaves her on the corner and walks back.

	We're going to Caps Bar at Seventeenth and Vermont; Connecticut is clear on Sunday... take that over to Fifteenth, then around Vermont and we'll bypass the circle that way...if you don't go over forty we should catch mostly green lights.

	I didn't think you'd make it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here. I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.

	There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.

<TOM>

	Thanks for getting me through.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his hand behind her neck in an awkward gesture of camaraderie. She awkwardly disengages... waves and steps inside the door to the restaurant... standing there between the two sets of doors watching Tom and Jennifer walk away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TOM AND JENNIFER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they walk to his car, first exchanging a look of reflection over Jane... then bumping accidentally, then bumping back, a look, then kissing with passion, wrapped around each other.

ON TOM AND JENNIFER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom taken aback by the outburst from this woman he's just made love to.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's okay...People say different things. They do...the plural threw me.

</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
She laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The last time I was with someone we went through this awful mutual disease questionnaire but I guess it beats getting paranoid the next day. Okay, I'll go first. I haven't...

(stopping her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would never occur to me to worry at all about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer is touched...
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know something? I'm deeply complimented. Isn't it strange to be deeply complimented because the man you're with doesn't think you have a venereal disease?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<DIRECTION>
Tom slides out of bed naked -- she moves quickly across the bed one outstretched hand reaching for his ass, a free -- even lusty sort of motion punctuated by her comment:
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me some of that.

He dances away -- out of range -- liking the action, a stupid grin on his face.

He opens the door and turns on the light in the closet.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CLOSET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a converted room -- given over the racks of clothes and shoes extraordinarily well organized. Tom stands there agape. Various rain coats -- clothes for all climates -- lots of luggage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She joins him in the closet -- holding out a sheet in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I converted a bedroom -- this stuff builds up. Wait till you've been doing this sixteen years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIFER>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not knocking it. It's a great solution. Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer laughs -- he follows her gaze and sees himself in silhouette against the door -- his penis prominent in outline.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIFER>

	Do you do bunny rabbits?

Tom is enjoying himself immensely.

INT. JANE'S EDITING CUBICLE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane feeds another tape in -- she is taking editing notes alone and SCRATCHING her arm. She looks worn out -- STOCK FOOTAGE OF STATESMEN move across the small screen. She sighs and, without realizing, implores the heavens to help cure a malady she's yet to recognize in herself.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>

</JANE>

He starts massaging her neck as the phone rings. she lets it ring for a beat as Aaron works on her. As she picks up the receiver we HEAR a CRACK. She reacts to it at the same time she utters a greeting.

	Aaah --

<DIRECTION>
INT. MANAGEMENT MEETING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul is running the meeting from behind Ernie's desk. TWO OTHER NON-EDITORIAL MEN are in attendance. As Paul discusses the more pressing problems of the network news division, Jane sits near the window strangely unmoved by her first moment at the seat of power. She has the blues.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, they seem to be very serious about making me out eight million from the budget and that means massive firings. I'm doing everything I can... It's too early to make up a 'death list' but I just wanted you to be aware of the situation... We're also going to cover the Alaskan serial killer trial on a continuing basis. I'd like it done out of Washington which means we've got to get somebody on a plane for Anchorage. We can't fool around anymore...Jane...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up at him -- a bit sleepy-eyed.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>

<JANE>

	It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.

AARON'S P.O.V.

<DIRECTION>
From the excited group of people blocking his view, it's clear there is some personage in attendance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON AARON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now he sees that it's Tom.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is God testing me or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<MARTIN_KLEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul loves him. I heard him give him the most poetic compliment in his command. 'He's hot.' Sometimes groups of executives get together just to say that work back and forth...'He's hot, oh, she's hot. Oh, he's really hot.' Hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot...

	And here we are.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe Jane would like my food idea as a spot...Try the one in the middle.

</MARTIN_KLEIN>
<DIRECTION>
He moves off to intercept Jane -- as he stops her... Tom is stranded -- then sees Aaron and moves over to his side.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Same old stuff. I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>

A MAN stops and introduces himself to Tom -- shaking his hand:
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>

	You want to go out there --

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	get out of this for a second?

</TOM>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you lead? I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
Tom turns -- the sharpness of the tone unsettles him.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did I do to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've made my dreams silly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
Tom decides not to deal with the remark. He's jolted by the hostility. He leads the way out French Doors to a ground floor terrace, where Aaron joins him, closes the door and the two men stare at the party.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing at the party)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heavy hitters.

Aaron nods.

They look inside.

	<DIALOGUE>
	How you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<TOM>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. Network news, Washington... I love it. What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?

</TOM>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep it to yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, stop it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
On Tom's reaction.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world. It's unseemly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<TOM>

	I'm not buying into any of that. I have a load to learn. I'm not going to act as if...

	I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...

</TOM>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the rule was...

	Never to pretend to know more than I did.

</AARON>
<TOM>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, let's drop it. I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind. What are they?

</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
Tom is getting pissed.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>

Aaron's suddenly a good deal happier -- damned if it isn't a little infectious.

Jane's confused by this. She looks at him.

Jane clamps a hand over her own mouth.

	Okay -- good move. Keep it there.

She continues to clamp her mouth shut as he exits the car, opens her door and then begins to half carry, half pull her out. She keeps her hand clamped over her mouth. Laughing from behind her door and runs for it.

<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'd gone out twice and I hadn't enjoyed myself that much but it gets to a point -- I don't know if you can appreciate this but where you don't want to sit home or be with your girlfriends and people had always been telling me that I was 'too picky.' I'm not. It's just you want to meet a nice guy...So anyways, it was that 'give-him-a-chance' thing. No, it wasn't. I was lonely. So we went to a movie and when he brought me home he said could he just come up and have one beer and then he'd go. How do you say 'no', to that? So first it was this wrestling match which was awful enough because it got to be really a fight...because I'm a modest person... then he ripped my clothes and he forced me to...make love. He stayed in my apartment and forced me more times -- he didn't leave until...

	It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you. Just on superficial performance things.

Several beats.

	<DIALOGUE>

	Okay. I think I'd better be alone for a while.

INT. SMALL TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aaron is seated behind a desk -- some old news copy in his hand. An unmanned camera is pointing at him. Tom is standing a few feet further back studying him.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is uncomfortable for me -- because, well, I don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We sure do. I don't mean it as a knock either.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead. I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It just might not work for me because of our different approaches.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
Tom nods and gestures that he proceed. Aaron begins reading the news. Barely a sentence in, he is interrupted.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your coat jacket is rising up in back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Aaron ignores the tip.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you sit down -- sit on your jacket a little -- that gives you a good line. Look at yourself in the monitor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Aaron looks but is unimpressed and resumes reading the news. Tom, not about to be ignored when he knows it's important, moves behind Aaron and begins to force his jacket down.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
<DIRECTION>
(very uncomfortable)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like being handled.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit on it! Now look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just don't physically...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he sees himself in the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	monitor and is suddenly
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
enthusiastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fantastic tip -- fantastic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to read again.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. That's not going to tell us anything. Let's get this prompter going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not loaded.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll find some copy. Be right back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Tom exits -- Aaron looking after him, clearly taken with the genuine camaraderie... the unmistakable joy Tom derives from helping out. Several beats and Tom comes back with a CAMERAMAN in tow.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got copy, I got Ellen to heat up the camera and I got Master Control taping so you can study it later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
He puts the roll of copy in the prompter.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Tom...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
Tom turns.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm very appreciative.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
SAME SCENE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom totally focused on him down one knee checking him from various angles. He interrupts. Aaron reading from the prompter.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that. You don't want to look shifty, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God, no!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the left side of your face is the good one. Go again. And try to punch one word or phrase in every sentence -- punch one idea a story. Punch -- come on --
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Aaron does same with the story he is reading...
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good...very nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Aaron acknowledges the compliment in news mode. Punching the first words.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you for the compliment, Tom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
He draws a laugh from the Cameraman as he goes right into the next story.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try not to move your head or wrinkle your forehead...this is good, very good...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEWS BUREAU - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aaron, tape in head, is saying his farewell to Tom. He is facing his left side as he will do for the rest of his life on earth.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were smokin' toward the end there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The pointers were great. I'll study the tape.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
Tom is into helping Aaron he finds himself delivering a locker room pep talk:
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And remember -- you're not just reading the news or narrating. Everybody has to sell a little. You're selling them this idea of you. You know, what you're sort of saying is, 'trust me. I'm, uh, credible.' So whenever you catch yourself just reading...stop and start selling a little. So long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
He moves off -- Aaron watching him go, feeling decidedly uncomfortable by this last piece of advice and vaguely corrupted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JANE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane FLIES INTO FRAME, carrying her dress, two large shoulder pads clipped to her bra-straps. She is obviously running a little late. Now she slips on the dress -- her pace so quickened that it momentarily dulls the effect of seeing her in a pretty formal gown; the kind good girls wear on special nights. The DOORBELL RINGS... She opens the door while trying to put on her necklace... Aaron enters carrying four bulging garment bags and a fistful of neckties.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I spilled some rum on the outfit you picked out. Let me show you the alternates.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
She eyes the amount of clothing, goes to the phone and dials.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much? Wow...Okay...See you there...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't know you were going with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you bring your grey suit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
She holds them in her hand -- indicates with the necklace that she wants him to help her... he fastens her necklace while looking over her bare right shoulder as she riffles through his tie collection.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(the clasp in place)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. Try this one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She hands him the tie and he extracts his grey jacket from a bag -- puts it on and ties the tie... She reaches into a white paper bag full of fresh purchases and takes out a vial of perfume with a built-in atomizer and sprays the air in front of hr and walks into the mist. ON Aaron's reaction:
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(flaring)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not a date. It's co-workers going to a professional conclave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Jane, unnoticed, reaches into the paper bag, takes a small box of condoms and drops it into her evening bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane on a public phone, Aaron standing nearby within sight of a taxi stand.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(on phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long will it tale you to send one?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She hangs up... paces... Then looks at Aaron, relaxes.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look terrific.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Aaron poses a question which he feels in his deepest core:
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
Jane nods.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because this is important -- so don't just be polite. I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As good as humanly possible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, great -- good luck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Before she can deal with that, a cab arrives.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Jane. Have a good time tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Aaron takes her in -- she looks lovely.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd hug you, but why risk mussing either of us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
She half-laughs... kisses him, wipes the slight lipstick mark from his cheek and, in a sudden decision, takes each of her shoulder pads from her jacket and puts them in his -- improving his look while diminishing her own. She gets in the cab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AARON'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane, leaning all the way over the front seat, giving detailed instructions to the DRIVER as the cab pulls away... As Aaron turns and walks off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane, in her formal, sitting back -- anticipating her date.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WASHINGTON HOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hefty percentage of the Washington journalism industry's men and women dressed formally for one of those evenings where they can finally assert their own glamour. Jane ENTERS THE SCENE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WASHINGTON HOTEL - ATRIUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Jane enters, lost momentarily in the lobby -- greenhouse, the majority of the throng passing through in formal clothes. A bit of DIALOGUE OVERHEAD from TWO MEN in dinner jackets.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_ONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The L.A. times is a great outfit. Best severance pay in the business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_ONE>
<DIRECTION>
Jane keeps looking for Tom -- passing another MAN, talking to his SHARP-LOOKING DATE.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_THREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was lecturing me and finally I just said -- I'm sorry, I refuse to look at it as a negative that I'm young and my news appeals to people my age.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_THREE>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it's not like he just didn't hire a twenty-six-year-old producer himself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No kidding, twenty-six.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Jane moves to the steps and starts up, greeting several people nervously. More bits of DIALOGUE, leaking from conversations of both substance and expedience.
</DIRECTION>
<ANONYMOUS_OLDER_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember Brinkley's great line -- "It's as irrevocable as a haircut."
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANONYMOUS_OLDER_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Now, on the second level, she scans the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JANE'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The floor below. Tom in the world's best-fitting tux... Clusters of people from around him but he works his way easily through them as he looks for Jane and grins his greetings, men are buoyed, women's pulses throb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON JANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she silently mouths the words -- "smile and move and smile and move." Which is exactly what he's doing. Then a contract with the gods.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If he doesn't see me soon, we're not supposed to be together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
ON TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing her. -- He does a tap step -- a brief giddy burst, the meaning of which is not lost on Jane. He is acting like her boyfriend.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON JANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anxiety stripped away revealing a first glimpse of Jane as a joyous pretty young woman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving quickly up the stairs -- as she walks toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(excitedly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's incredible who's here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
She laughs. Almost completes an affectionate gesture -- takes his arm instead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEWSROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aaron seated in the main newsroom in shirt-sleeves, writing. He takes the just-completed page out of the typewriter and walks over to the weekend news PRODUCER. (W.N.P.)
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want to look at this?

	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<AARON>
<DIRECTION>
(feigning casualness)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The weekend news...anchoring... anchoring the weekend news.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Way to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Aaron nods, as the Producer finishes the copy.
</DIRECTION>
<W_N_P>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is terrific news, Aaron. It's a pleasure to read.
	</DIALOGUE>
</W_N_P>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. Oh, there's water on the set, isn't there, in case I get an attack of cotton mouth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<W_N_P>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. You'll be fine.

INT. BALLROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bomb sniffing dogs, SECRET SERVICE MEN and D.C. POLICE monitoring the members of Washington's most trustworthy elite as they pass through the metal detector. The line moves slowly -- Jane and Tom several couples back.
</DIRECTION>
<OFF_CAMERA_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I have your autograph for my wife?
	</DIALOGUE>

Tom and Jane turn to see a grinning Paul.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How you doing, Paul?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So this is why you wouldn't do the Weekend New, you can't turn down a free meal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, born to party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Paul enjoys the riposte, looks at Jane who is shrinking within herself.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see you two inside -- I think we're all at the same table.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sotto to Jane)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're finally learning to be flexible. Glad you changed your mind about Tom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
He passes through the detector... Tom starts to step through it -- she pulls him back.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I don't want to go in there and sit with everybody.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(imagining it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't...why don't you go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
He considers this option as she waits.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar. How's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. That's it...See you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She walks off. He runs a few steps to stop her.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
She turns.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not going to take off on me, are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-uh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She steps on the escalator... Riding upwards, concern deepens, anxiety flows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watching her to up the escalator, he finds himself doing simplest thing, stepping onto a moving step.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane four steps ahead of him -- not yet aware of him. He moves past one other man until he is standing directly behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just want you to know that my giving up the Correspondents' Dinner puts tremendous pressure on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Jane turns and is a bit blown away by his gesture -- life threatens to be good. And now Jane bumps a bit at the top of the escalator, regaining her balance by grabbing Tom's offered hand. As they walk they continue to deliberately hold hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEWS STUDIO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE are on the studio floor, FOCUSING on the activity around the Anchor Desk and three cameras... The FLOOR MANAGER stands ready to cue Aaron, the script is ready to roll on the prompter machine.

	Twenty seconds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLOOR_MANAGER>
<DIRECTION>
ON AARON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Making sure he is seated on his jacket -- taking one last look at the hand mirror being held by the MAKEUP WOMAN. She starts off -- but Aaron regrabs the mirror almost making her lose her footing -- a check -- then another check -- he points to a spot on his forehead which she dabs with the makeup sponge... Both of them fuss enormously with his hair -- four busy hands.
</DIRECTION>
<FLOOR_MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten seconds.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
He watches the Makeup Woman scurry underneath a camera lens, resits on his jacket and finally has the moment the system has been denying him for years. We can HEAR the END OF HIS CUE in a barely AUDIBLE CRACKLE from the Floor Manager's earphones... "...with Aaron Altman."
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
<DIRECTION>
(on TV)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good Evening...In mood and language better suited to an espionage novel than the delicate world of the Western Alliance, the British Foreign Secretary today pounced on what he termed, 'The nest of profession spies and amateur traitors who were turning NATO Headquarters into an instrument whose only true function is folly.' We begin our coverage with Edward Towne in London.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
Aaron looks up -- takes a breath. He's done well -- he's punched his words and his one thought for the story. His gaze has been steady, his voice firm but he has begun to perspire. He dabs with his finger at the first trickles from his brow -- brushes some more prominent sweat from his upper lip... He beckons nervously to the Makeup Woman -- who comes in and dabs -- then dabs again as Aaron feels himself under his arms...
</DIRECTION>
<MAKEUP_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee whiz.

She scurries away, Aaron reaching for another Kleenex from her box and missing it... A graphic illustrating his next scripted section appears behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...the sub-bases referred to are located in five countries...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
And now the moisture on his face is clearly discernible -- the Floor Manager and Makeup Woman grimacing at the growing specter as they look at a large monitor.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain as...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
And now so much moisture sprouts from his upper lip that he pushes his lower lip out to slurp away the sweat... The Makeup Woman laughs briefly out loud before catching herself... Aaron's eyes dart angrily in her direction.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We well as Great Britain...Our own State Department was rocked not only by the revelation but from the highly unusual persistence from the State Press Corps. Martin Klein reports on the ruckus at Foggy Bottom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>

Half-beat until he's sure that he's off -- his shirt now showing distinct sweat stains...
</DIRECTION>

Tom and Jane walking drinks in hand, her arm around his waist. They stop -- he rests a drink on a ledge and boosts her up and then sits next to her.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVEALING that they are sitting on an anti-terrorist concrete abutment protecting a major government building on a beautiful night in our capitol. He is still holding her hand -- and now he notes this.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(loudly to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why can't I let go of this woman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
He interrupts her with the smallest of kisses -- so mall and swift a kiss that she is left doing her return kisses to mid- air. And then he does something he's thought about many times before -- he briefly caresses her breasts -- while continuing to look at her.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least kiss me when you do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(a grin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is hysterical.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She laughs a little -- then kisses him. They break -- surprised and aroused and look at each other...
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight. You know why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because you're nuts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
He leans forward and speaks softly and truly.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More and more lately when I've watched you in action -- seen all your energy -- I've been wondering what it would be like to be inside all that energy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a gulp of her drink -- puts a hand to feel the heat on her own cheek. Then turns to him.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right back at you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Several beats.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(immediately at work)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good...Another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him -- he's thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or it's that great feeling that you don't want to hold anything back. You know, intimacy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She elbows him. Tom takes in the choices -- then:
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, shit. I'm a creep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She moves off the concrete wall.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I forgot all about Aaron. I promised to stop by and see how he did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to know. I'll go along.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I'll see you at your apartment as soon as I can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to flurry with activity -- moves to the curb when out of nowhere Tom barks a sharp command, the first time any of his actions has been tinged with fury.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	JANE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Thrown, she stops and turns. He walks to her.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't run off -- like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not that it's hard. I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she hugs him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(another beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't yell at me like that again, you scared the life out of me.

<DIRECTION>
As Jane exits a cab and moves up the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AARON'S APARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is at the top of a flight of steps. She KNOCKS on the DOOR. RINGS. KNOCKS. Aaron opens it. He is wearing a sweatshirt and cords.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was in the shower.
	</DIALOGUE>

She enters.

<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd it go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then it went well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did it really go well?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Define your terms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you feel good about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do others feel that you did well?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then what was good about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I lost six pounds...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaron, will you tell me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again. Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People phoned in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop kidding. I want to know what happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not kidding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny. My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway. And I'm chipper because you finally showed up. I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to be somewhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at a clock reading 1:15 in the morning.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(now the plunge)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I may be in love with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
<DIRECTION>
(as if he just burned his hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!!!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
She starts for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is important to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Well...I think it is important for you too. Sit down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
She sits. He walks to a desk and looks at her briefly... Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me think a second. It's tough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
A remarkably long silence -- her mind wanders, she takes stock... it is evident that he is straining to get it right, reaching into himself.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaach...Jane...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(glancing at note)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me. Let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you. You know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(testy and wary but fair)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I guess. Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah -- being a basket case.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you care about him. I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't friendship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think the Devil is going to look like if he's around? Nobody is going to be taken in if he has a long, red, pointy tail. No. I'm semi-serious here. He will look attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great God-fearing nation and he will never do an evil thing...he will just bit by little bit lower standards where they are important. Just coax along flash over substance... Just a tiny bit. And he will talk about all of us really being salesmen.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(seeing he's not reaching her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he'll get all the great women.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
She is getting pissed.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you're the Devil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You know that I'm not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
She's briefly impressed. He has a point.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, yes. I know. Right. And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(realizing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you like that? -- I buried the lead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
He pauses to catch his breath -- breathing deeply through his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
<DIRECTION>
(an aside)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(thawing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down, stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Aaron slumps down -- it's been a long round.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never fought for anyone before. Does anybody win one of these things?

INT. TOM'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CAR DOOR SLAMS in the street below -- he goes towards the window which is blocked by his sofa -- puts his knees in and looks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A woman walking from a car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TOM
</DIRECTION>

Momentarily thinking it's Jane. Elated.

It is not Jane. The PHONE RINGS.

INTERCUT:

</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, when?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure. It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. I taped it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.' Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy. You want me to talk to him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes meet Aaron's.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-uh.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Aaron)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says you could hardly notice it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Aaron beckons for the phone. Jane hands it to him, as she does so:
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't say anything about anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. Will I ever sing again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody has one like that. I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late. Sorry.

<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Don't worry about it.

<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.

</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.

	Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh? Good night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She puts the phone down. A beat -- she looks stricken. Aaron looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He just cancelled. He had a chance to think and he cancelled.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She bows her head.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>

	I can't breathe.

(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I can't -- I can't breathe. Damn it!

</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She gulps a breath. Her hands on her knees, leaning over -- another deep breath. Aaron takes in the specter.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Jane, it was nice of you to drop by.

As she enters -- goes immediately to the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON PHONE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cradled in an answering machine -- indexes for sixteen one-button calls, mostly people from work -- "Parents" etc. Jane plays her answering tape. It is silent -- no messages... She fast forwards to double-check. Just the SOUND of blank tape. She pushes the button next to the "Tom Grunick." We HEAR a busy signal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON JANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hangs up the phone. Then compulsively hits the "Tom" button again. Busy. And again. Busy. She considers for a moment hitting the button next to Aaron's name.

<DIRECTION>
Blair EXITS... Jane pops the tape in, automatically making timing notes, then standing -- looking again towards Tom's door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JANE'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door now closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stops the tape -- summons herself. She walks towards Tom's
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
office and opens the door. Tom is seated behind his desk.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(without passion)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I kept trying to call you -- you never called me. Were you just diddling me? Is that it--? I'm great if I'm helping your career.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(mimicking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But when I'm a woman for a second, I get immediately fucked around by you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She is obviously in pain but still alert enough to catch Tom's answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jane, this is my Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
And, now OPENING the door a bit more -- Tom's father is REVEALED seated across from him.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(that quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please forgive what I said.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Tom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
As she retreats:
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just light up a room and leave, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
She laughs nervously as she exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM AND HIS DAD
</DIRECTION>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want my opinion?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The thing that's easy to miss about Jane is...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want my opinion? And it's okay if you don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<DIRECTION>
Tom thinks a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I would.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The way she just acted is not the way an affectionate person acts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<DIRECTION>
Tom finds the comment off-the-wall enough to be thought provoking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEWSROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paul arriving with Bill Rorish. The first time we have seen the multi-millionaire anchorman in the flesh. He has the grace and dignity of a man who spends every waking moment working on grace and dignity,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He and Paul are in the midst of an important conversation -- muted and ominous.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just when do you start, telling people?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Almost immediately.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to take everyone out after the show.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bill...This is hard on all of us and it's no time for compliments. But I think it's extraordinary of you to come down here for this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we're not here for each other during the tough time, we're not a news organization.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
Blair ENTERS scene. The smallest flicker of interest from Bill, but more than enough to justify her going into hock for the outfit.
</DIRECTION>
<BLAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome back to Washington.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLAIR>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
A self-conscious look of greeting to Paul and she's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've forgotten. Was she on the list?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
Paul nods "yes."
</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a brutal layoff...And all because they couldn't program Wednesdays.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(can't resist)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can make it a little less brutal by knocking a million dollars or so off your salary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
AS Bill turns:
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a bad joke. I'm sorry. Awful. It's a miserable day and that was some kind of totally sick-joke defense mechanism which does not indicate any of my feelings -- not one -- but just shows the kind of stress this represents for all of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Tom and his Father ENTER the scene from Tom's office. Bill walks to Tom.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. It's about time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good to see you, Bill.

</TOM>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good to meet you, sir.

</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
ON TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Equally touched as he watches the world's most prominent journalist greet his Dad, who turns goofy with excitement.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_GRUNICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good-bye, Tom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_GRUNICK>
<DIRECTION>
He puts a big hand on his son's cheek -- a farewell pat. Then whispers in his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_GRUNICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to go back home and tell all your old teachers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_GRUNICK>

Tom watches his father walk off and moves immediately to Jane's editing room.

<DIRECTION>
INT. JANE'S EDITING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AS Tom enters...
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(enormously pleased)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Did he really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Then he said a really weird thing...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(so softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(he means this)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's so perfectly...It really makes me feel a little faint...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(actually woozy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whooo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Blair enters wildly into the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<BLAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They canned me. Well, my brother will feel great -- now he's not the only screw-up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLAIR>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's started.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>

Bobbie sticks his head out of his office...
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBIE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBIE>
<DIRECTION>
AS Tom focuses and moves off:

INT. NEWSROOM AND HALLWAYS - DAY

Moving with Tom. Nervousness growing, confidence gone, he proceeds down the hallway.

INT. ERNIE'S OUTER OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<SECRETARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll just be a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECRETARY>
<DIRECTION>
Tom sits down -- pats his tie in place... A beat and the door opens. Paul leads out Martin Klein. They shake hands.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN_KLEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I'm just old enough to be flattered by the term, 'early retirement.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN_KLEIN>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's wonderful...what a lovely line. If there's anything I can do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
They shake.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN_KLEIN>
<DIRECTION>
(evenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I certainly hope you die soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN_KLEIN>
<DIRECTION>
A little smile to Tom and he's off.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
Tom enters the room. A nervous cough in evidence as he crosses to a seat.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're having a severe cutback, Tom -- 17 people in this bureau including technical personnel and we're going to reorganize at the same time. We're going to take you out of Washington for a while and assign you to London.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEWSROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aaron and Ernie are off to the side in the newsroom -- People are packing their belongings -- as secretaries cry and embrace -- from an office rumbles a shouted denunciation:
</DIRECTION>
<ANONYMOUS_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I won't keep my voice down. Those sons-of-bitches...They are worse than accountants -- they are bad accountants.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANONYMOUS_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Tom enters scene.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you guys seen Jane?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<ERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's in there becoming the first woman bureau chief we've had here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Tom takes this in.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did they do with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They booted me out of Washington.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Impossible. There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? What did they do to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<ERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing at Aaron)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's what he did. I'm proud of him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERNIE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<ERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The cost-efficient reporter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERNIE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I quit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
A weeping woman bursts into their circle and sweeps Ernie away. Tom and Aaron stand there -- comrades at last -- victims of the same sword.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You packing up tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	London.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<AARON>
<DIRECTION>
(incensed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	London. That's a promotion!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(defensively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is. Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor. I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold it down, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I ask you something? You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
He extends his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
Aaron looks at people packing their belongings in boxes -- a few pockets of conversation... Ernie reading some copy.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This story they won't cover. And if the network doesn't cover it -- it must not be important so why worry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(eyeing him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to miss you -- you're a prick in a great way...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Aaron taken by surprise -- laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay. Be good. So long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
He exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOM'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AS he picks up a clean wastebasket and deposits his belongings. A scheduled book, clean shirt, two ties, cuff-links, a travel mirror, cassettes of his Washington reporting. His desk clear -- he writes on a clean piece of copy paper. He centers it on his desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT - PAPER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Good luck, you'll love the bureau chief... Previous Occupants."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEWSROOM - DAY

AS Tom enters from his office, a wake is slowly igniting. Tom moves along the edge of the room, carrying his wastebasket full of belongings, not really a part of the mournful festivities.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane across the room hugging one person after another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</OLDER_SECRETARY>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shhh. This isn't the last time we'll see each other. It's not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
A two-armed tight embrace of Martin Klein.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll get them back -- it's going to change.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Blair is at hand as they embrace.
</DIRECTION>
<BLAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Except for socially, you're my role model.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLAIR>
<DIRECTION>
And now she sees Tom -- he mouths one word at her -- "London." She nods that she already knows and then lets her body sag a little. He gestures her towards her editing room, so they can rendezvous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EDITING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AS Tom enters and waits for Jane. When she enters he closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These people -- it's all so awful. It just hurts physically, doesn't it? Like something's wrong with your bones, like your organs are shifting inside your body.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him expectantly. It's not what he's feeling.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I haven't been here long enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(great)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you say that to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't stand here feeing bad that I don't feel worse. This has happened at every station I ever worked for. Look, I think it's crazy for you to come in here tomorrow and start a new job. I have a week to get to my job. Let's get the hell away to some island fast and find out how we are together away from this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
A beat -- Jane takes it in.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's more than 'yes' -- that's 'you bet.'

INT. SIDEWALK - RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Across the street from the bureau's building. Aaron and Jane are having a beer. They are in mid-conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not try it for a few weeks?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop. Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help. My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland. The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks. Personally, I think he should aim higher.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ernie told this story. How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried. He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits. He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should have quit this place three years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're just trying to say all great stuff so I'll feel even worse that you're not around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe the best part of your life is over and you don't want to get up and start the bad part.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
Jane looks at him levelly.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are now required to sit here with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat; then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, that's very easy. Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(smile, it's like old times)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(deliberately)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope so...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(on her look he relents)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I'm not really mad.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding head as if reciting a catechism)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always be friends...we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
Jane smiles -- Aaron has grown suddenly angry. He rises, walks away, then turns.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jane, you know how Tom had tears in the piece the other night? Ask yourself how we were able to see them when he only had one camera and that was pointing at the girl during the interview.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(on her reaction)
</DIRECTION>

	I'm fairly sure I was right to tell you.

She cries. We HEAR Tom.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, that will do it. You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The tape is rocky now -- the Sound Woman and Cameraman continue to roll as they move towards their next shot -- at times the camera pointing towards the carpet -- but the sound continues. The crew chatting -- mentioning that the tape is still rolling.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's enough. That's enough.

<SOUNDWOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It kills me we didn't have a second camera. It was so powerful seeing your reaction.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOUNDWOMAN_S_VOICE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<YOUNG_WOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<SOUND_WOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For a second there, I thought you were gonna cry yourself. That would have been something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOUND_WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(considering, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then give me a minute...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(fully realizing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fucking...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
As Jane watches we SEE Tom work up the tears we saw in the Evening News piece -- as he does so:
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_WOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that's amazing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
ON Jane's shocked reaction:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BWI AIRPORT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane's cab pulls up to the curb. She gets out -- she is carrying no luggage. She sees Tom who hurriedly walks up to her. Jane is fighting to maintain a calm.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look who's the organized one. I've got everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
He briefly opens a paper gift shop bag he is holding and shows her he has bought them each a bathing suit.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her with anticipatory distaste evident on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl. I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Tom half turns from her and moves back toward the bench. Jane close behind, stalking him.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I felt funny about it afterwards. It's verboten, huh? I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you. That's not the reason you're not coming?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(raising her voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course it's the reason. It's terrible what you did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We disagree on how God-awful it was. Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(livid)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it. I was up all night and...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(calmly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It made me ill. You could get fired for things like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got promoted for things like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(distaste)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It just proves that the difference we have are...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a one-way argument. We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home. If you don't go? Well, that's a much bigger deal. I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here. The plane's boarding. You're good at deadline. Here's your ticket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(taking ticket)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's amazing. You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking. Try and get this. When you edited that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(deliberately)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm leaving now. Gate 43.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
He simply turns and walks away -- looking back once as Jane stands there mucked up by his sudden departure -- the lack of resolution to their confrontation is palpable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TERMINAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On Tom moving past the metal detector. He too is frustrated -- pissed off at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OTHER TERMINAL AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane moving quickly along towards the metal detectors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. METAL DETECTOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Jane passes through and sets off the buzzer. She stands there -- the heel of her hand pressed to her brow trying to stem the tears. As others look on, she takes a huge key ring from her pocket -- deposits it in the box -- walks through without a buzzer and moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOARDING RAMP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom waiting while in the b.g. "People Eater" busses ferry passengers to the plane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As one full "People Eater" pulls away and another empty one arrives.
</DIRECTION>
<TICKET_AGENT>
<DIRECTION>
(to Tom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the last one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TICKET_AGENT>
<DIRECTION>
Others start to board. He sees Jane moving towards him. He walks to her, she gestures back towards the street.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not going to be the way we say good-bye. Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal. You mean something to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You keep coming after me and looking down on me. It's starting to make me batty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't help it that they like me. And I like that they like me. And I think there's a lot of this job that I do well. What do you think it takes to do this job -- the way they have it now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't wan to discuss work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew what you meant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(old habit)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(catching himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never mind what you think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I am. Thanks. I mean it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TICKET_AGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TICKET_AGENT>
<DIRECTION>
The pressure begins to bend Jane's resolve.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(wary but hopeful)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to come?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(totally open)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(giving up -- sadly, finally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you should stay here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's better when you let me say it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
He hugs her. Now that it's over, they can each openly care for each other. While in the embrace:
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did I have to do this to myself? Watch you take off.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call me if you need anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her lightly -- looking at her... Then heartfelt:
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, honey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
He walks to the People Eater and gets on, still holding his paper bags of bathing suits. The bus pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON JANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watching him go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JANE'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom standing at the front window of the bus -- framed very much as he is when on television.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AIRPORT TAXICAB - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane gets quickly into cab.
</DIRECTION>
<CABBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABBIE>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(after collecting herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dupont Circle, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
The cab pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't take the beltway, because at this time of day there's gonna be a lot...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(stops herself, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Go any way you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She sits back in the seat (containing herself) before finally and quietly adding what she knows to be true:
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But New York Avenue's faster.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONVENTION CENTER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Much the same place where Jane and Tom first met. The words "SEVEN YEAS LATER" appears on the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sign off to one side tells us it's the annual meeting of the Local Television Broadcasters... and that at 2 P.M. Tom Grunick will be speaking on "Responsibilities of Broadcast Journalism for the '90s."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Much the same audience, though two members of the audience may strike particular interest -- curly haired man seen from behind holding a similarly curly haired five-year-old. Tom is in mid-speech.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... when they told me Bill had decided to retire and offered me the Evening News, I thought it was the same kind of joke we used to pull back at the station -- turning off somebody's prompter in the middle of a show.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Some good-natured laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then when they heard my reaction -- they thought I was kidding. I told them I'd be their anchor but I didn't want to be the Managing Editor -- that there were people better qualified than I to control the content and if there weren't we were all in trouble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
The audience really enjoys this:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAME SCENE -- SOME MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING SHOT...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The anchor teams -- leaning forward. They love this man, a humble specialist refusing the generalist trap. Imagine the feeling -- you see, on the top of the mountain, a man not unlike yourself.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now to something more important... I'd like to introduce my bride.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gestures to a woman in the front row)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lila?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
A svelte, classic, warm beauty gets to her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON CURLY HAIRED MAN AND BOY...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aaron and his son as Aaron cranes for a look at Mrs. Grunick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AUDITORIUM - STAGE AREA - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom and Lila shaking hand. Aaron, his son in his arms, wait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he sees Aaron... he is clearly delighted.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit, Aaron.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
He claps him on the back... Aaron is as pleased as he is uncomfortable with the attention.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lila -- this is Aaron Altman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<LILA>
<DIRECTION>
(high British accent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes -- you're one of Tom's 50 or so role models.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILA>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else. What's your name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clifford...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<AARON>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating Tom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know who this is, Cliff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The big joke?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<DIRECTION>
Tom looks at him -- Aaron gives his son a disciplinary nudge.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought she'd be here. I'll go with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(to Lila)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see you back at the hotel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<LILA>
<DIRECTION>
(cool)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILA>
<DIRECTION>
He starts off. She pulls him back for an urgent communication.
</DIRECTION>
<LILA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tom, the speech was magnificent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILA>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I didn't say anything about your speech.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I appreciate it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WALKWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom, Aaron and the boy walking along. Tom plays with Cliff as they move. The boy is delighted. Jane is in a park -- a blanket spread out -- she is wearing shorts and a top -- she has some wine and a small picnic -- a toy for Clifford.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She HEARS her name being called.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON JANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shielding her eyes from the sun -- now making out Tom. As they reach her.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as they arrive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, what is this? My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A picnic?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought for ol' Cliff here -- Look at you? You're more adorable than your pictures. Look what I got for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She hands him a toy.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you say, Cliff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
The boy kisses Jane's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He excels at gratitude.

</AARON>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jane)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you any closer to a decision?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Tom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to take it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a great surprise. I didn't think we had a chance. I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we should talk. You going to have time for dinner? I'd like you to meet Lila.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay...It's so good to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
She gives him a quick kiss. He shakes hands with Aaron.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(to Aaron)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's nice to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
Tom shuffles uncomfortably.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON JANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiling, appreciating Aaron's attitude toward a blandishment of the powerful.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jane as he leaves)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bye...boss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Tom walks away. He's a good twenty yards away when Aaron looks up to see his son running after Tom.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
<DIRECTION>
(calling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Cliff! Cliff!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
Tom now notices the boy, leans down and pats him.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(to Clifford)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go back to your daddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
The boy starts back.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Cliff. Come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
As Clifford runs back to his father, Aaron sits next to Jane.
</DIRECTION>
<AARON>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jane)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So who's the guy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating. So, he's been getting me into water skiing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Aaron laughs at the very notion of Jane finding water sports a lure. Jane deliberately moves past this moment.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like it! So, doll, what about you lately?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<AARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- my wife got this new job...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON>
<DIRECTION>
He continues to talk. As the two former colleagues catch up, their ease returns, if not their intimacy, as the frame locks and the scene slowly recedes into a black b.g. and we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
