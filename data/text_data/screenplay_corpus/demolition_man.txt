To the naked eye, out the window, tucked against the wall of cars, a large tarp. To the thermo, the still warm inner workings of the muni bus. Faint outlines of the engine, drive train, even seats and frame. Bingo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan takes a deep breath. Loosens up his right shoulder. Loosens up his left. Checks the gun on his right hip. Checks the gun on his left. They both cross draw. Reaches down to the bag at his feet. LAPD in reflective letters on the side of a backpack. Spartan yanks some kind of rope out of it.

EXT. BLIMP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan falls three hundred feet from the blimp. Dead silent. The line runs free behind him. It's a giant fireproof bungee cord. As the downward force of gravity and the upward pull of the bungee become exactly the same, Spartan stops dead in the air for just the briefest moment. Whips out a Bowie knife and slashes the cord above his head. Falls free the last ten feet to the roof of the building. Lands on his feet. Lightning cross draw. A gun appears in each hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FORTRESS - MAIN BUILDING - ROOFTOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lookout pops up on Spartan's right. Spartan clobbers him. Another lookout pops up on Spartan's left. Spartan ducks, rolls quietly, clobbers him, too. Listens. No one's taken notice. Holsters the guns. Moves in towards the roof hatch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FORTRESS - MAIN BUILDING - THIRD FLOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stacked with armaments and stolen goods. M70's straight outta the National Guard Armory. Crates of ammo. Stacks of looted Sony HoloSets still in the boxes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan makes his way carefully along. Ready. Spins at a SOUND. Nothing there. Spartan crouches low. Slips around the crates. At the far end, a very large guard is doing just the same thing to peer at where Spartan just was.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan launches himself at the guard. Hammers his head against the floor. This guy is not getting up again for a long time. Spartan spins at a SOUND. Another equally large guard dives on Spartan from behind. He never makes contact. Spartan uses his momentum to fling him past and into the wall. This guy isn't getting up again in the near future either. Now the room is clear. Moves towards the stairs.
</DIRECTION>

INT. FORTRESS - MAIN BUILDING - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
SIMON PHOENIX snorts a long pale blue line up one nostril. A long pink line up the other. One blue eye, one brown eye. Blond hair. Black skin. Looks up at another thug. Punches up the security cams on half a dozen slightly futuristic monitors. Unconscious guards can be seen on all of them. And on the last, Spartan, coming... Phoenix jabs a loaded orange syringe into an arm. The drugs all hit various lobes.

Spartan creeps quietly down. Looking, watching, listening. Suddenly, the stairs are racked with MACHINE GUN FIRE. Chips of concrete fly from around his feet. Spartan flattens against the wall. Half a beat. Steps out FIRING. The machine gun stops. A body plummets by down the center shaft of the stairs.

A wild melange of white, white light and dark, dark shadows. The gas fumes ripple, refract in the air. Lights bounce off the pools of gasoline. Spartan rolls into the room. Both guns come up.

	Fuck you, Spartan. They're gone. I told the city no one comes down here anymore. Cops figured it out, postmen figured it out. Damn bus drivers wouldn't listen. Arrest me? You've got no jurisdiction here. You're in my kingdom now. Fifty blocks in every direction. And it's mine.

</PHOENIX>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan keeps the guns trained on Phoenix. Simon scratches his arm. It's a junkie's twitch. Or is it... Spartan can't see it, but there's a kitchen match tucked behind Simon's ear. Phoenix reaches up to scratch another itch. Frees the match in one gestures, strikes it and tosses it into the pool of gas. Smiles. A friendly happy smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room bursts into flames. He throws back his head and laughs. Spartan dives on him. Tries to hurl them both through the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Phoenix is either stronger or just far crazier and drugged up. Smashes the two of them into the wall instead. They trade blows. The building gets worse. AMMO starts to EXPLODE downstairs.

A giant LAPD wrecker with a cow catcher front blasts through the main gates. LAPD Humvees follow.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FORTRESS - MAIN YARD - NIGHT (AFTERMATH)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dust begins to settle. Flaming wreckage and embers are still dropping from five hundred feet up. A beat. A beam shifts in the wreckage. It's a big beam. It moves aside. Spartan emerges dragging his prisoner out behind him. As he's being dragged along, Phoenix comes to. Spartan hands him off to another officer to be booked. Captain STEVE HEALY, Spartan's long-suffering captain and friend, comes out of the crowd of officers.
</DIRECTION>

	What's the matter with you? That's why nobody ever invites you over.

Healy continues to shake his head in consternation. No way he believes that... Spartan ignores him. Wipes the soot from his face. Shakes his head in disgust, walks away...

The Tactical Fire Response vehicles have arrived. Fully- armored firemen wearing bulletproof gear fight the blaze. Spartan continues to stride away. And then everything fucks up. One of the TFR OFFICERS in the wreckage calls out --

Spartan in stark white overalls. A beautiful, shaken woman holding the hand of a small child. About six. Spartan bends down to the little girl. Unclenches his fist. His LAPD badge inside. Pins it on the little girl, KATIE.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to be back. I'll still be your dad. I promise.

She's young enough that it's unclear whether she understands that her father is going away for good. Spartan chokes back a sob. Stands back up. Kisses his wife. Everything that can be said, has been said. They kiss again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him, in front of two locked doors, are a pair of prison guards in odd, heavily-insulated uniforms. Tanks, heater batteries, guns. Spartan heads towards the far doors. They follow. Spartan steps through the doors, the guards now at either elbow. And into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CRYO PRISON - MAIN ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CryoPenitentiary is a Godel-esque nightmare of architecturally-perverse layers and levels, the Guggenheim mixed with industrial meat locker. All still half under construction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan is led along the middle ring to where a doctor, two white-coated technicians and a young-looking WARDEN SMITHERS are waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above him prisoners are encased into the ground in massive glass hockey pucks, contracted into pained fetal positions. Their faces are hauntingly twisted into gargoyle expressions of tortured struggle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The group arrives at an empty chamber. The technicians nod to Spartan. He drops off the white overalls. Steps free. Stands naked. Doctor injects him with luminescent blue fluid. The techies slap on sensor pads. Head, heart, all over... Spraying him down with Freon. Mist everywhere... We see the temperature dropping on the monitors. The Warden looks at a crib sheet. Clears his throat.

TITLES BEGIN as...

The casing door is closed over him. MONITORS down the lining of the circular chamber show a digital rap sheet, a dropping thermometer, a parole date, and today's date: November 20, 1998. A super-chilled clear goo flows in, packing and preserving isolated Michelangeloesque segments of the defiant statue that is John Spartan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he's still conscious. Still even struggling a bit. On the arm above the chamber, inside a vacuum bell a small vial is auto unscrewed. LOCKED and SAFETY lights cycle. We see a tiny white chip inside. The vial is moved into place by a tiny robot arm. Bottom vent is opened. The chip is dumped into the chamber. It's the opposite of watching ice shatter. Instead, the whole hockey puck goes solid in an instant and a half. The thermo read-out drops in an instant to a half degree above 0 degrees Kelvin. It's done.

The VIEWER makes a GENTLY DIZZYING JOURNEY AROUND the chamber, SETTLING FOR A MOMENT ON Spartan's contorted- into-a-defiant-sneer face.

The VIEWER'S VIEWPOINT KEEPS PULLING OUT to see that the date on Spartan's MONITOR now reads August 3, 2042. Warden Smithers, now a bespectacled, gray-haired old man, in a peculiar uniform, shuffles past the completely unaged Spartan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He grumbles by in a phone headset equipped with fiberoptic video gear, and OUT OF FRAME we see that the prison has become vaster, stranger, with multiple grated catwalks and more networks of artfully-engineered piping. And heavily, heavily stocked with prisoners...

A small sharp EXPLOSION. Like an ink jet, the yellow ink is flung through a nozzle against the wall in an 8 x 20 foot swath. The red ratchets and FIRES, the blue as well. Now we can see the graffiti bomb has screened a message on the wall -- "Life Is Hell." The black EXPLODES. Little Death's Heads are sprinkled around the message. The ink jet MACHINE BLOWS itself up. Pedestrians gather and stare at the message. Mouths open, dumbstruck.

Two shock poles emerge from hidden panels in the side of the building. A sheet of LIGHTNING FLASHES between them. The message turns to ash and falls to the ground. The poles tuck back into their boxes. A small rabbit- sized VACUUM SWEEPER emerges, ZINGS along on its own power and SUCKS up the ash.

A pair of frosted doors reading S.A. and P.D. slide open to the presence of Lenina Huxley.

ON a Status panel: Cellular activity: Null. Tempera- ture: .5 degree K. Lights begin to cycle. A SERVO WHINES. The CAMERA MOVES TO the chamber as the autolock begins to unwind. Unlock. The arm moves aside. The frozen puck rises from its chamber. Spartan hasn't moved, blinked in 40 years.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two Techs in insulated suits and gloves stand on either side. Both wear tiny flip-up welding goggles. The first, takes out a Durameter. Tests the puck. Harder than steel, a little less than a diamond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tech #2, holds a handheld Magnesium Thermite Laser. About the size of a skill saw. For the first time we notice there are six small raised half domes on top of the puck. Indices. Drops the guide ring at the end of the MTL over an index. Flips down his goggles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fires the MTL. The entire puck lights up white white. We almost get the feeling Spartan can sense what's going on. A burst of energy melts a small hole in side of puck. We STAY ON Spartan.

Tech #1 drives over a crane with a six-clawed arm. Like a standing forklift. Or a gladiator... the fingers drop into the laser cut holes. They raise the puck. Carry it away.

The puck sits on a stainless steel podium. Completely alone in a round stainless steel room.

Three MTL lasers begin to pulsate madly. One from above cutting in, spiraling in towards Spartan. The others top and bottom shaving an eighth of an inch in a tenth of a second with each pass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The puck shrinks away, the beams grow closer and closer to Spartan. Just before they would hit him, the beams turn blue. Steam bursts from the puck. Fills the air. Obscures everything. The lasers stop. Darkness.

The entire chamber splits open. A room within a room. Spartan rolls over limp and supple collapsing, onto his back. Med Techs rush in.

The exhibit begins with the crudest weapons, cavemen with clubs, stone axes, arrowheads, and moves up the ladder of history toward modern day --

Western Colt revolvers, an old-time gangster Tommy gun... In the middle of the room is a Civil War cannon. A stack of cannonballs sits next to it.

Punches the glass in the exhibit. Hard. His fist bounces off. It hurts. He looks around for something to break it with. Nothing. Side kicks a larger expanse of glass in front of another display. Almost breaks it. Not quite. Growls. A MUSEUM HELPER/GUARD comes into the room. Moves towards the annoyed Phoenix smiling pleasantly.

A very mellow ALARM GOES OFF MURMURING "PLEASE EXIT" over and over. Simon begins sorting through weapons available. Loads a SHOTGUN from the case. Tests it by BLOWING up another display. Works just fine. The ALARM changes to "PLEASE EXIT RAPIDLY." It begins to annoy him. He BLOWS the loudspeaker away. BLOWS up the AcMag case. Grabs the gun. There doesn't seem to be any cartridges. No way to load them either. Aims, fires. Nothing.

Huxley looks seriously pleased and flattered. Spartan just has no clue as to this choice of restaurants. Huxley discreetly elbows him. Hard.

Spartan is staring at a vid screen on a wall: Cocteau, grinning, arms spread, his utopia behind him, and the Behavioral Engineering logo.

<SPARTAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spacely Sprockets here, who is now in charge, the 'Mayor/Gov,' who wants to take me to dinner at Taco Bell -- though Lord knows I wouldn't mind a burrito -- is also one of the guys who invented the cryoprison?!

A flustered Earle gives a look to the morality box. Spartan turns to another vid screen. A map of San Angeles on it.

	Phoenix could be anywhere, but not having a code could hurt him. Limits his options.

<SPARTAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I keep looking around, thinking about my daughter growing up in a place like this. I'm afraid she's gonna think I'm some kind of disgusting primate from the past. As much as I want to see her, I almost don't wanna know. I'm not gonna fit into the picture very well.

Huxley reaches for the car terminal; thrilled with this small mischief.

<HUXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would be a minor misuse of police powers but I could do a search for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUXLEY>

Spartan reaches over, stops her hand. Shakes his head "no." There's a moment between the two of them. He remembers he shouldn't touch her. Lets go. She doesn't seem to mind.
</DIRECTION>
<SPARTAN>
<DIRECTION>
(then; changing subjects)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what's with this Cocteau guy? He thanks me for saving his life -- which I'm not sure I did -- invites me to dinner, and where does he take me... Taco Bell. I mean, hey, I like Mexican but come on...

EXT. TACO BELL - NIGHT

It is unlike any Taco Bell we will ever see. Holographic images hover in the air in front of the marble entrance. A row of jacketed valets stands ready. One rushes up.

As they enter, a periscope pipe pops up, looks around, disappears. No one notices it.

INT. TACO BELL - FRONT COUNTER AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sparse, elegant and Melrose-dark. As Huxley and Spartan enter a mariachi band takes their place in the corner. Huxley and Spartan walk up to a sultry future version of a Taco Bell order counter. Spartan is trying to assimilate it all when the COUNTER-GIRL breaks the ultra- cool character of the restaurant to give him a typical fast food happy face.

	Burrito Supreme. Shake. BE well.

Spartan looks down to a miniscule cylinder of pressed kelp topped with a dab of salsa and small sesame-seed- type bits. The tiny shake is in a thimble-sized frost- covered glass.

	Oooh. Yum... Good thing I'm hungry.

The mariachi band launches into the Mexican hat dance song as Spartan and Lenina, carrying their trays, are escorted by a maitre d' to a table set in a secluded section of the restaurant. Cocteau and Associate Bob wait for them. Cocteau stands --

	John Spartan, the hero of the hour. I congratulate you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COCTEAU>
<ASSOCIATE_BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Greetings and salutations, I am Associate Bob. We met before, ever so briefly but I was groveling in fear in the humus at the time. You have had quite the exciting first day in San Angeles. Imagine, chasing a real criminal.

Spartan glares her quiet, pokes at his "Burrito Supreme." A beat. Cocteau muses --
</DIRECTION>
<COCTEAU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, John Spartan, tell me, what do you think of San Angeles, 2042?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COCTEAU>
<SPARTAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess, considering the way things were going when I went in -- I thought the future would be a sick, decaying pit of suffering and hate with a thick, foul stench.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPARTAN>

Cocteau gloats.

Associate Bob roars in appreciative empty laughter. Think Ed McMahon. Spartan looks at him. It wasn't funny. Pokes at his burrito. Ugh...
</DIRECTION>

	Look at you, John Spartan, pouting for the old cheeseburger -- the flesh of dying animals covered with cholesterol laden butterfat. You miss the bad old days.

	Yeah, maybe.

	Civilization tried to destroy itself. People just wanted the madness over. And when I saw the chance to make things right, I grabbed it. San Angeles would not be here. It would be your pit of stench.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COCTEAU>
<SPARTAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? Maybe you can book me a flight to New York when this is done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPARTAN>
<DIRECTION>
Lenina's shocked. Cocteau's not thrilled with his attitude either.
</DIRECTION>
<COCTEAU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For your crimes, John Spartan, you would have surely rotted and died in jail by now. Even you have to appreciate the persuasively tranquil humanity of the Cryo-Prison system...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COCTEAU>
<SPARTAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to piss on your parade, pal, but my 'cryo- sentence' wasn't a sweet lullaby. I had feelings -- I had thoughts -- a 44 year-old bad dream about thirty people in a burning building -- about my wife, beating her fists against an ice bucket. It woulda been more humane to stake me down and leave me to the crows.

Spartan stares out the window. Across the street he sees a scragly SCRAP on a sputtery patched together motor bike in front of a large food store across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<COCTEAU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am saddened and stunned. If there's anything I can do...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COCTEAU>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan goes back to staring out the window. Two, three, then four Scraps loitering, looking around, they've done nothing yet, but to Spartan's eye it's clear they're up to no good.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The food truck approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<SPARTAN>

EXT. COURT OF STORES - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The court of stores are located outside the restaurant. Spartan steps past the holographic images toward the food store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No one can mistake him for an exiting patron. He radiates attitude. Spartan picks up his pace. The food truck is just pulling in. The Motorcycle Scrap sees him. REVS the BIKE in a ferocious swerve towards Spartan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan looks around. Beside him is a street SIGN MURMURING "Third and Alemeda, Third and Alemeda, Third..." Spartan rips it from the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Lenina, and the rest of the restaurant gather at the window to ooh in fear. Cocteau scowls angrily at the Scraps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COURT OF STORES - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Scrap on the motorcycle has no time to dodge as Spartan stands his ground, jousts him clear out of his seat. The motorcycle skids by, barely missing him, hits the curb, somersaults and explodes through the holograms. Spartan doesn't even flinch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still clutching the pole, Spartan makes a swift kempo- swing into the three other attackers. And then, all hell breaks loose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXPLOSIVE DEVICES EXPLODE the concrete inside nearby stores. Scraps come pouring out. Sewer COVERS are BLOWN asunder followed by chain- and nunchuck-wielding Scraps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ALARM SCREAMS strangely and melodically. The food truck is swarmed. Inside the foodstore ten, twenty, thirty Scraps attack and loot. Spartan sees there's a lot of them here. A whole lot.
</DIRECTION>
<SPARTAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great, they brought the whole team.

Three more Scraps come charging out of the store. Clutching packages. They hurl EXPLOSIVE DEVICES towards Spartan to make their escape.

Spartan dodges the fusillade, looks around, takes stock of the whole situation. An oncoming trolley comes around the corner into the complex.

The Scraps freeze for a moment. This guy means business in a way they've never seen before. But Spartan is dis- tracted for a moment by an excited yell --
</DIRECTION>
<SCRAP_RAIDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Protein! I've found protein!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCRAP_RAIDER>
<DIRECTION>
This doesn't sound like hardened criminals to Spartan. More Scraps rush over to help him carry this booty away. A SCRAP appears beside Spartan, swinging a pair of nunchucks made from two knobby table legs.
</DIRECTION>
<SPARTAN>

(wearily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to regret this for the rest of your life. Both seconds of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPARTAN>
<DIRECTION>
Nunchuck Scrap thwaps Spartan. Spartan just looks annoyed, not hurt. Slams him again. Still no reaction. Spartan latches onto a nunchuck in the air as it comes toward him. Yanks it forward as he shoves the Scrap backward into the food store window. The Scrap bounces off the window like a nerf ball, not remotely cracking it. Spartan frowns to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<SPARTAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I'm losing my touch.

Two other Scraps attack him. Spartan fends off one, shotputs the other into the WINDOW, this time SHATTERING it competely.

Spartan stops. Backs away. Watches oddly as the Scrap escapes. He lets them go. Steps back away as the others escape. They don't know why he changed his mind, but they're not staying around to find out.

Huxley and the restaurant patrons rush up to give him a blast of adulation. Spartan's attention stays on the fleeing Scraps.

	John Spartan, there is of course a well-known and documented connection between sex and violence. Not so much a causal effect, but a state of general neurological arousal.

<DIRECTION>
Spartan looks at her. He has no idea what her point is.
</DIRECTION>
<HUXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And after observing your behavior and my resultant condition, I was wondering if you would like to have sex?

He had no idea that was going to be her point.

She turns quickly to a cabinet and removes two strange high-tech helmets and a towel. Lenina, all excited, puts one of the helmets on his head and hands him the towel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flicks a switch on the side of the helmet -- read-out lights come on; activated. Lenina sits upon a bed opposite Spartan, and repeats the operation on herself with the other helmet.

A beat of open-mouthed amazement and enjoyment and then Spartan tears the helmet from his head and throws down his towel with a mixture of confusion and anxiety. Lenina is still seated across the room.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After AIDS there was NRS. After NRS there was UBT. One of the first things Dr. Cocteau was able to do was outlaw and behaviorally engineer all fluid transfer out of societally-acceptable behavior. Not even mouth transfer is condoned.

In darkness, Spartan loudly bangs into something.
</DIRECTION>
<SPARTAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahh. Lights.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPARTAN>
<DIRECTION>
Lights come up. The place is, well, spartan. Exact same shape and size as Huxley's, but stunningly sterile and unwarm. Spartan tragically takes in the place, pokes his head into a clinical bathroom, a bathroom with no toilet paper and a strange shelf with three seashells. Shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan's hands start to quiver toward a knitting needle and a ball of red yarn. Curiously furrowing his brow, Spartan plops into a strenuously uncomfortable futuristic chair and begins almost unconsciously knitting the red yarn. He stops himself in perplexed surprise...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a LOUD BOPPING noise fills the air. A beautiful NUDE WOMAN, casually brushing her teeth, appears on a vidscreen before Spartan.
</DIRECTION>

The image blinks out, replaced by clouds and the "BE WELL" slogan. An annoyed Spartan stares at the screen. He picks up the strange box Lenina gave him. Inside it is a stack of petite laserdiscs. Spartan sticks the first laserdisc in his television.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A surveillance camera shot shows the image of the explo- sion at the museum. Spartan pops the disc and puts another in. This time the surveillance village shows Cocteau and Associate Bob walking through the courtyard. Then the gunshot. Then finally Spartan comes to the strange face-to-face between Cocteau and Phoenix. Spartan back-and-forth watches the stand~off with growing fascination. He almost unconsciously reaches out to the sewing needles and the red yarn...

Huxley visibly recoils. The morality box BRAAAPS. It never gets any further. Spartan shoots it without a look, dead center. His eyes never leave Cocteau.

EXT. TACO BELL/COURT OF STORES - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scene of the Scraps' food truck attack. As, ON THE CUT, Spartan wrenches off one of the steel planks. It splits open with RUSH of AIR. Earle had no idea how to stop Spartan, but he tries --

<EARLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please cease this madness, enhance your calm, John Spartan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARLE>
<SPARTAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've had it with enhancing my calm. I'm going to find Phoenix and enhance his calm instead. I'm the only one here who can handle this situation.

Spartan wrenches away another plank. The others back off in fear. It's like he's opening up the mouth to hell.
</DIRECTION>
<HUXLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John Spartan, even if Simon Phoenix was programmed to escape, extinguish life and steal contraband weapons -- by forces known or unknown -- pray tell why are you proceeding to the depths of Wasteland?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUXLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan wrenches off another plank. Now the hole is big enough to enter. A set of rungs can be discerned. Stops, looks at Earle. How can they all not get it?
</DIRECTION>
<SPARTAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The reason the citywide manhunt didn't work was because Phoenix was down in the one place you A, can't monitor, B, are afraid to visit, and C don't give a shit about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPARTAN>
<EARLE>
<DIRECTION>
(then; braver)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Whether Phoenix is down there or not, you just can't drop in. Resonate some understanding, the Wasteland is filled with thugs and...

	Hooligans, I know. We might never come back.

The trio creeps into an ornate piece of piping. Lenina gasps at what she sees before her... They spill out into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WASTELAND - UNDERGROUND STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are in the Wasteland which is surprisingly busy and crowded. People living in tents, lean-tos, whatever their ingenuity can provide. Think Third World refugee camp underground, a souk. Marketplaces, food stalls...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The underbelly of the city lit from above by strand after strand of bulbs in construction cages and other fortui- tously salvaged lights, revealing odd tunnels of indeterminate former usage, abandoned subway platforms, natural caverns, a cutway of fifty years of sanitary landfill, the striations of decades of now useful trash being harvested. Giant belt driven ventilation fans whirl in enormous airshafts overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three move along taking in the curious but unfrightened glances. More than one person recognizes Spartan from the battle the night before. You can feel the buzz work down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<SPARTAN>

	Thugs and hooligans, huh?

The trio drifts toward a large, square hole in the sewer wall in front of which a smiling OLD WOMAN is smoking up some meat and tortillas on a makeshift grill. Other Scraps sit in the space square behind, smoking cigarettes and eating on ratty armchairs between shabby travel posters.

INT. WASTELAND - BAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's as low life a place there is down here. It's further dragged down by the presence, in the furthest back, darkest corner, of Simon Phoenix and Six Cryocons, freshly defrosted and each the size of a major appliance, ALBERT, BEPPO, CHARLIE, DANZIG, ELVIN and FRANCIS. All a little groggy. Phoenix, very execu-criminal, sits at the head of the raggedy bar table.

	Gentlemen, let's review. It's 2042. That's two oh four two, as in the Twenty-First Century. The world is a pussy-whipped Disney Channel version of itself and all we gotta do to run the whole place is kill this guy, named Raymond, who put it all together. Then as an added bonus, you get to kill the man who put most of us in the freezer, your pal and mine, John Spartan.
	</DIALOGUE>

INT. WASTELAND - LARGE CAVERN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan, Huxley and Garcia step in. A meeting place of sorts. A machine shop. Off to one side, a giant belt driven machine shop out of 1900, taking its power from a water wheel, attached to an enormous transmission spinning furiously. Mechanics fix and combine various vehicles into working fashion. Blow torches, bellows. Another flume feeds a wildly churning wheel running the fans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can see stalls and houses around the rim. Out of date cars are being used as homes. Spartan takes it all in. His eye catches a bright red 1969 Pontiac GTO beside the machine shop. He's drawn to it in admiration, Huxley and Garcia in his wake.
</DIRECTION>
<SPARTAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice... A 1969 Pontiac LeMans GTO convertible with rear spoiler and hot wheel mags... Seriously beyond the standard package.

A very large caliber revolver appears alongside Spartan's head.

Spartan does. The man with the gun is Payne. Six other SCRAP TOUGHS have the drop on Lenina and Garcia with giant crude shotguns. One of them wears a familiar periscope around his neck.

Spartan shakes his head in disbelief. Payne shifts his aim. FIRES. Blows a hole in the side of an abandoned car the size of a grapefruit.

	</DIALOGUE>
</SPARTAN>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan still waits. A crowd begins to grow. Payne, despite the fact that he's the guy with the gun, decides to answer.
</DIRECTION>
<PAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some of us didn't tow the line. Some of us didn't make the grade.

Spartan stares past Payne to wild pieces of graffiti on a wall behind him that includes "I HATE SAN ANGELES and SUCK MY COCTEAU!"

Payne stares at him. Spartan's sincere. Payne lets his gun drop. The others follow.

<HUXLEY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John Spartan, you must uphold the law.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUXLEY>
<DIRECTION>
A good-looking woman of about fifty looks up from the edge of the crowd with sudden interest at the mention of Spartan's name.

(off Payne's tacit approval)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're looking for a guy. Black skin, white hair, one blue eye, bad attitude. He's from my time, and if I don't find him, we're all in trouble.

Suddenly, the viewer is pulled out for a long view of Spartan talking to Payne. Then one, two, three, four, five, six bodies step INTO the F.G. Simon and his goons walking down the street.

He turns and quietly starts dispensing instructions to the cryocons.

Spartan's grin, though it seems impossible, gets wider. He kisses her on the forehead. Holds her back out at arm's length, just looking at her with this great big smile...

	<DIALOGUE>

Huxley, Garcia, and the Scraps who have a clue dive as the ACMAG FIRES with the resulting tremendous EXPLOSION.
</DIRECTION>
<PHOENIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spartan, buddy, I brought some old friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHOENIX>
<DIRECTION>
The Cryocons OPEN UP with all manner of WEAPONRY on the crowd. Mayhem and slaughter. Huxley and Garcia have taken cover as well. Their stun batons look exceedingly useless. Spartan is momentarily trapped under a collapsed beam. Doesn't last long. Growls. Hurls it aside. Comes up FIRING with the BERETTA.
</DIRECTION>
<SPARTAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPARTAN>
<DIRECTION>
Phoenix FIRES again. The AcMag round barely misses them. Spartan's blasted brutally by the EXPLOSION. Stays on his feet. Keeps FIRING. Albert goes down. He's not going to get back up again. Payne rises to his feet FIRING a giant REVOLVER. The other armed Scraps follow his lead. Another AcMag ROUND GOES OFF. The lights dim. Spartan sprints for where he last saw Phoenix.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan can hear Phoenix CLATTERING off up a culvert behind him. He bolts up after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WASTELAND - CULVERT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It forks upwards. Sixty degree incline. Flattens out. Splits again. Spartan halts, listens. Follows the FOOTSTEPS. Same trick works backwards, as Phoenix stops dead, hears Spartan COMING. FIRES the ACMAG. Misses as Spartan is just about to round a bend into range.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CULVERT itself EXPLODES, blowing shrapnel everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fifteen feet of it are gone. It's an ugly, ugly jump. Two hundred feet down and no room to miss. Off to one side, one of the fans spins madly. Spartan leaps. Hits the other side, grasping at shards of metal. Pulls himself in. It heads back up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan ascends. Up. Up. Now almost, and then completely vertical. He climbs spread-eagled after Simon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WASTELAND - CROSS PIPE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pipe "T"s at the top. Spartan mantles up as Phoenix CLATTERS off. Down below in the pipe, the sound of SOMEONE ELSE FOLLOWING as well. A gasketed porthole glints beside Spartan, he slams it open. Looking down, he is a hundred yards above the cavern floor. Beside him the chain arcing up from the machine shop below ratchets around a joint and heads off into the darkness in the direction Phoenix has fled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Half a beat. Spartan reaches out, way out, and just manages to snag the chain. Hauls madly. CHAIN CLATTERS and CLATTERS. Half a beat. A long, low RUMBLE. Phoenix stops a moment, wondering what the hell it is. A giant blast of water tidals through the pipe. The AcMag is swept away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan looks up to see Phoenix and a wall of water headed his way.
</DIRECTION>
<SPARTAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit.

Simon smashes into him. The two are swept along. The force blows them off the side.

INT. WASTELAND CORRUGATED CONDUIT - NIGHT

Spartan and Phoenix are carried along by the water into an aqueduct. Phoenix heaves himself over the side. Spartan follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WASTELAND - LARGE CAVERN/SUPPORT GRID - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Every Scrap can see. The two hang on a suspension grid of an old rusty rebar, directly over one of the WHIRRING VENTILATOR FANS. It's not meant to take any weight. Slippery as hell from the spray above. The REBAR CREAKS and MOANS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No one dares move. Below, Charlie lies dead. No other cryocons can be seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan and Phoenix scrabble madly, yet in slow motion as not to break the old joints as they stay on. Hand over hand, Phoenix makes his way along as ---
</DIRECTION>
<PHOENIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, since we're just hanging out, I have to tell you something -- remember those muni passengers you blew to pieces trying to catch me...? They were already dead, pal, before you even touched the building. Cold as Haagen Dazs.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Simon grins his scary grin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See ya...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHOENIX>
<DIRECTION>
Simon swings himself back and forth, gaining momentum. The rebar's about to give as he launches himself out into space, just clearing the fan. A wild twisting fall ending in a CLANGOROUS landing through three levels of Scrap lean-tos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan feels the rebar starting to fail around him. As he tries to haul himself up, it just gives way more. The whole fan structure is giving way. BITS of METAL fall, hit the fan and are sent CLANGING off into space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then... it gets worse. A NOISE from above. Beppo appears. Hangs from a firm support. He begins to stomp on Spartan's fingers. Laughing wildly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan moves, he stomps them again. Spartan moves again, but this time seeing a heavier piece of rebar nearby. Snags it. And as Beppo's foot comes down again, grabs it. Hauls. Beppo starts to scream. His grip comes loose on the wet bar above. Screams past Spartan as he falls. There's a tremendous CUISINART SOUND. Blood flies up past Spartan as he climbs up to safety.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves down the grid past the fan. Sees below as Phoenix scrambles to his feet, starts to run. Spartan doesn't want to do it. No choice. Growls. Leaps. Falls. Falls. Falls. Smashes into a garbage heap.

Simon pounds a rushing up Garcia unconscious in a single blow. Recovers and empties a TOMMY GUN at the crowd. Scraps crawl for cover. Payne and two others FIRE back. Phoenix disappears. Spartan blitzkriegs out of the refuse. Crazed.

Spartan stampedes away.

Knocked to the ground before her burrito stand, the Old Woman points inside the square room.

Spartan comes in low, gun out, ready to fire. No one there. Spartan pivots into the square space, looking all around. Then up. An open trapdoor. Spartan peers in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELEVATOR SHAFT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A humongous steelwalled vertical shaft which rises up into the blackness. The Old Woman's cubbyhole is really a huge freight elevator. Phoenix is climbing up a cable with speedy precision.

INT. 2042 GM DEALERSHIP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shoppers wander about admiring the cars. Half a beat. The ELEVATOR can be heard SCREECHING upward. And then a CRUNCHING stop. The floor begins to buckle. Customers flee in terror. The VROOM of an ENGINE can be heard. The FLOOR CRACKS asunder. The freight elevator emerges. A 2042 model is tossed aside as the elevator rises from the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Wasteland Pontiac GTO convertible is jamparked in burrito joint crunching the place's chairs in a heap. Driver Spartan REVS the ENGINE as passenger Lenina shudders about what is to happen next.

A maintenance hatch in the ground rises open. Phoenix scrambles out. Exhausted, greasy, dripping with sweat. At the far end of the courtyard, he sees ---
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lamb keeping watch on the entrance. A giant puff of smoke has come billowing out. Lamb looks seriously concerned. And at the same time kinda pleased.

<LAMB>

<DIRECTION>
PONTIAC GTO
</DIRECTION>

Tears along, divoting up the pristine 2042 green, the car flinging a solar tower in its path to the ground, generally leaving trouble in its wake. Spartan sees, in the extreme distance, Phoenix dashing from Lamb's crumpled body and the stolen police car pulling away.
</DIRECTION>
<SPARTAN>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. SOME OTHER SAN ANGELES STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GTO CRUSHES a computer kiosk as it ROARS onto the street, aggressively PLOWING through the gentle user- friendly cars on the road in its terrifying pursuit of Phoenix and Lamb's stolen police car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan FIRES out the window at the wildly fishtailing Phoenix, but the angle's just wrong. Can't see and drive and aim.
</DIRECTION>
<SPARTAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPARTAN>
<DIRECTION>
Pulls the gun back in. One hand on the wheel, Spartan straight-arms the Beretta and aims through his own wind- shield. It's like a video game. Phoenix's fishtailing brings him into the sights. Spartan FIRES. His own windshield SHATTERS. Blows into glass pebbles all around them.

She FLOORS the GAS and the GTO BURNS RUBBER, PEELING down the street. Spartan is thrown back against the roof of the car, manages to hang on. He opens FIRE on Phoenix's car. Perforating it, blowing off side mirrors, generally making a mess of it as Phoenix weaves wildly back and forth trying to shake them off.

	Whoa, whoa, slow down!
	</DIALOGUE>

Phoenix turns around to see Spartan hanging on. He shoves a MACHINE PISTOL out his open side window and FIRES back at Spartan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SOME OTHER SAN ANGELES STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan ducks back from Phoenix's stream of bullets. Smashes the machine gun against the car, knocking it from Phoenix's grasp. Just manages to trap it against the side of the car as it falls. Snatches it up, lifts it up to take aim as ---

</PHOENIX>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SOME OTHER SAN ANGELES STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both gull wing doors slam open. The gun is bashed from Spartan's hand. Spartan himself is smashed from one door to the other on the roof of the car. A hundred miles per hour and nothing to grab onto. He starts to slide off. Completely aerodynamic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grabs onto a door. Shoves a shoulder underneath as ---
</DIRECTION>
<PHOENIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Close doors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHOENIX>
<DIRECTION>
The right hand door slams shut. The left hand door crushes against Spartan. The MECHANISM GROANS. Spartan growls back. Spartan and the door strain against each other. The man wins. Wrenches the door clean off. Jumps in the car. Punches Phoenix square in the head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phoenix is knocked to his side. Sidekicks Spartan dead in the groin. Spartan folds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phoenix leaps back up, triple-punches Spartan in the chest. Spartan's hands come free, he falls back, as Phoenix jumps on him and slams his head repeatedly against the hundred mile an hour ground rushing by as the car drives itself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan continues to fight back, smashing Phoenix, but he's forced to avoid the close calls with cars, street signs and the like. Finally, Phoenix grabs Spartan's throat and holds him down in the road where an upcoming futuristic fire hydrant is about to tear his head off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan sees it coming, has no choice. Lets go. Phoenix thinks he's rid of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No. Spartan slides free for a moment on the road and barely manages to hook a hand on the open door frame. Shirt three-quarters torn off, blood streaming, he climbs onto the back of the car. Brutally punches his hand through what remains of the back window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phoenix screams in rage as Spartan's hand comes at him and grabs him by the hair, yanking Phoenix's head back.

Spartan freaks as the back of the car suddenly separates from the rest of the car. It shoots rearward while the cab with Phoenix drops a third wheel in back and shoots off. Spartan, hanging on for dear life, turns to see him and the pod are jetting backwards for the front of a truly massive freight truck. Four full trailers behind a massive cab. The thing's gotta be eighty feet long. It's more of a locomotive than a truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The burly TRUCKER also freaks when he sees he will impact with Spartan. At the last moment Spartan leaps off the pod.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phoenix sees the truck collide with the pod, BLASTING it to smithereens. He laughs as he enters a long tunnel.

Spartan pushes the burly Trucker over and climbs into the driver's seat. The Trucker takes one look at this mad man and decides his fate is safer elsewhere. Leaps from the truck. Lands safely in some shrubbery. Sobs. Spartan GUNS the massive TRUCK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phoenix thinks everything is A-okay until he looks in his rearview and sees a bunch of streetlights being taken out by the too huge truck and getting closer. The truck harshly rams Phoenix, nearly jarring him from his seat but for the restraints.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The truck and Phoenix's car ROAR out of the tunnel and move straight for the police station. The truck smashes him again. Phoenix's steering wheel locks up and his seat restraint pops up as he races out of control for the station. He screams in rage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan slams on the truck brakes, smokes, slips, slides, into the most horrific jackknife ever seen. All four trailers lock up and accordian in on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phoenix's vehicle slaps the street curb and begins to roll, convulsing into a spectacularly flaming series of somersaults that violently climax at the base of the SAPD sign in front of the station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Half a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A charring Phoenix bursts from the vehicle, sees the approaching, out of control truck and turns and runs like hell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The truck slides in a full, unstoppable quadruple jack- knife towards the police station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan tries one last ditch attempt to bailout, but his door won't open, forced in by the first trailer bent over from the force of those behind.

The truck hits the curb, flips, collapses and plows into the police station.

Fire drones fight the blaze. The cab of the truck, a door torn off, lies askew. It's entirely filled with dense, solid foam. Half a beat... It CRACKS open, Spartan appears tearing giant hunks of foam away. Eyes wild.

Danzig and Francis look a touch more concerned. They split up.

Spartan moves cautiously down the hall. Huxley a pace or two behind. High above in an overly futuristic frieze looking much the modern gargoyle, is Danzig. Grins. Dives on Spartan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan is slammed to the ground. We can feel the breath knocked out of him. Tussles with Danzig as ---
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Huxley pulls out her stun baton. Pokes at them, pulls back, pokes again -- unable with the twisting, turning struggling bodies to be sure she won't get Spartan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And misses the fact that Francis is coming up from behind. He slaps the baton out of her hand. Grabs her around the neck, lifts her in the air. Begins to strangle her to death. She kicks and claws at him without effect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan's still busy with Danzig. She starts to choke. Francis brings her closer to watch her die. A beat of this, and Huxley reaches down and yanks the GUN out of his belt and SHOOTS him repeatedly.

<DIRECTION>
Leans into the GTO. Pushes in the cigarette lighter. Puts it into neutral. Wedges the accelerator down. The GTO BELLOWS. The cigarette lighter pops out and Spartan uses it to light the fuses on the explosive devices. Drops the car into gear. Pulls his head out just in time as it ROARS off.
</DIRECTION>

The GTO SMASHES into the front GATES. Wedges itself in from the impact. Half a beat later, a long, low, THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION. Smoke everywhere. Smoke clears...

Half a beat. Realizes what he's done. In the next moment, four insane megadrenalized cryocons come screaming through the door. Barehanded, barefooted. Spartan SHOOTS the first two out of hand, without a thought. But before he can fire again, the second two are on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One gun goes flying. Spartan beats on Howie with his free hand. Ignacious fights for control of his gun hand.

Spartan bashes Howie back for a moment, continues to tussle with Ignacious. Finally, he's had enough --

He lets go of the gun. Ignacious grabs it and, still in shock over this turn of events, begins to fumble with it. Spartan reaches up with both hands and breaks his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Howie leaps on him from behind, trying to do the same to Spartan. Spartan squat presses down with this three hundred pound behemoth wrapped around his neck, retrieves the GUN out of Ignacious's stiffening fingers. Turns the barrel around towards himself. Howie reaches desperately, but it's just out of reach. Spartan FIRES over his shoulder. Howie, or what's left of him, slides away...

A pair of double doors slip silently open. Spartan, a gun in each hand, slides in. He is back in the stark white corridor where he once said good-bye to his wife and daughter. Looks at the empty alcove. It gives him the creeps. He makes his way to the door at the far end, and steps in --
</DIRECTION>

INT. CRYO PRISON - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Spartan prowls through the now depleted multilifer wing. Empty pods everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The displays all read: CRYO PRISONER EXITED. Yeeesh. There's a lot of them that way. A WHIR, followed by TROTTING FOOTSTEPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan whirls. A crane WHIRRING by and Associate Bob trotting behind. Spartan follows. Creeps slowly around the corner. GUNS up... Comes around a turn to spot Phoenix locking the arm into a puck. Takes aim. Phoenix sees him at the same time. Yanks a control on the crane. The puck pivots up as Spartan FIRES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The 40mm bullet lodges half in, half out of the puck in front of Phoenix's grinning face.

Spartan FIRES again. The puck barely vibrates. Absorbs another round beside the unharmed cryocon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phoenix unleashes an entire magazine from an HK91 slung over his back. Spartan FIRES once, dives for cover. Although unhit, he gets seriously frosted from a pipe blow open next to him. Forced to roll through the line of fire to avoid permanent freezer burn. There are pipes burst everywhere.

<DIRECTION>
Spartan hears FOOTSTEPS coming. Whirls. FIRES. Blows Bob away. A momentary distraction, but it's enough. Phoenix is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan turns slowly. Guns out in each direction. Searching. A sound. FIRES. No Simon. More PIPES BURST. It's ten or twenty degrees below zero in there already. Everything is coated with supercooled ice. Footing becomes treacherous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phoenix crawls through a jungle of pipe. Gets a bead on Spartan's lower body. Starts to strafe the area. Dh uh. Everything has become so slick, the recoil drives him back across the ice into the open. Spartan sees him, FIRES. The recoil slams him back against a wall. He FIRES again with something firm to lean on, but the recoil from Phoenix's sputtering weapon drives him right over the edge. He drops off into the center out of Spartan's sight. Slipping and sliding, Spartan slithers down the stairs to --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAIN LEVEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A familiar WHIRRING. Turns. Half a beat later he is bodyslammed and smashed and grabbed by a six-armed crane. His guns go flying, off into God knows where...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan is hoisted high in air, smashed again and again against a pillar. Phoenix slams him through a web of pipes. Holds him in the freezing blast. Ice forms all over Spartan. He struggles. It cracks off, reforms. Struggles again. It cracks off. Reforms. Struggles again. He's weakening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reaches up. Grabs the pipe, wrests it over, directs the blast at Phoenix. Holds it steady. Phoenix is frozen in place. Coats in ice. We can see the madness in his eyes. Everything else is still. He roars, breaks free. Retreats from the blast. Disappears as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan wrenches the pipe over to the claw arm. Holds it directly over one joint. Then clobbers it with the pipe. It SHATTERS. He drops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIGHTS are beginning to EXPLODE from the cold. It's dropped 30 degrees below zero in there by now. Spartan spots Phoenix on the far side of the room. Hundred feet away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Half a moment to catch his breath in the freezing cold, leans on exposed cryopuck. It slides effortlessly. Spartan hurls it across the floor at Phoenix. A five hundred pound hockey puck. Phoenix barely avoids the crushing blow. It rebounds back off the steel...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No point fighting the elements. Spartan hurls himself across the floor. Spins slowly twice along the way. It's like zero grav in two dimensions. No friction coefficient at all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three quarters of a second across the floor. Right hook into Phoenix's surprised face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phoenix goes flying a hundred feet back into the far side. Crashes and falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CRYO PRISON CREAKS and SCREAMS in protest from the cold. LIGHTING, grids, struts SHATTER, fall about them. They hurl themselves together again. Spartan lands a horrific blow. All but drives Phoenix's nose and eye sockets through the back of his head. Spartan's forearm is terribly cut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blood freezes solid as it sprays, sealing the wound, and leaving a giant six foot red feather spray. Spartan brushes it away, breaks off, bleeds, freezes again instantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They fly apart again. Spartan comes to a stop near a tool cart. Pokes at the tools. One is an MTL cutting laser. He has no idea what it is. Nothing there he recognizes. Picks up a four foot wrench. That, he recognizes. He looks like a caveman. A very angry caveman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The building complains loudly. Falling apart around them. More and more PIPES EXPLODE, BURST, it gets colder and colder. 50 degrees below by now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phoenix, on the far side, also scrambles for a weapon. He sees an MTL as well, but he knows what it is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIRES it up. Focused three inch cutting beam comes out. Rips off the top cover, pulls out five optical elements, pulls out the choke tube, rips the whole front off the MTL. Doesn't look very sleek now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIRES it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A thirty foot long spray of white white magnesium- thermite flame comes flying out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One swipe, he clears the ice from a path he can walk towards Spartan on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Metal bars melt away as the thermite flare crosses through them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the top level of the cryo prison, the first batch of raving psychopath defrosted cryocons wanders in to watch John Spartan die.

Spartan looks up at them. Like he needs this shit...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simon continues to melt himself a path across the floor towards Spartan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The heat from the MTL is furious. The difference between the 2000 degrees plus and 80 degrees below is more than any metal can handle. Fissures appear in giant lightning strike cracks in all directions where the MTL hits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Every bit of ice in the building melts. Water boiling away instantaneously in the path of the MTL. Spartan has nowhere to run. And nothing but a big fucking club. To his left he suddenly sees an empty chamber. Except this one was never filled. The display reads: READY FOR CRYO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a tiny white chip in the vial inside the vacuum bell. Spartan looks at it. It's like a very bad memory coming back. But he knows what it is and knows what it does. Smashes the vacuum bell with the wrench.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simon grows closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan bashes the robot arm out of the way. Picks up the vial. Looks around desperately. No point using it if it's going to kill him too. Grabs the grid of the floor above him. Heaves himself up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simon lifts the MTL towards him. It almost reaches up to the landing above. Spartan hurls the VIAL at Simon's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It SHATTERS. Nothing happens. The heat from the MTL has boiled off all the water in a ten foot circle nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MTL flame comes closer. In a moment Spartan will get cooked. Instead of running away, he moves closer. Stands up on the railing of the second landing. And just as his clothes begin to catch fire from the heat, leaps --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over the oncoming thermal flame as it arcs up towards him. And over and past Phoenix.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan lands behind him, coming around with an elbow into Phoenix's kidney, causing Phoenix to drop the MTL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside their circle of heat, the tiny chip hits the water. Melts. And again, like the opposite of watching ice shatter, the water everywhere goes steel solid, stuttering out in all directions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phoenix still has a free hand. Smashes a nerve center on the side of Spartan's neck. Spartan twitches visibly from it. Grunts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan punches him right, left, right in the sternum. Phoenix coughs blood, spits it away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steps back to launch a mighty blow at Spartan and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His heel just steps into a puddle of water. The tiniest rivulet drifts over, connects it to the main ice solid locked water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simon feels his foot stuck. And as he looks down in consternation, realizes in shock what's happened and then looks up, Spartan hits him straight from the shoulder with everything he has left, dead in the face, as Phoenix solidifies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phoenix's head snaps clean off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hits, like a ball bearing on polished steel. Bounces with a CLANG. Rolls off. CLANG, CLANG, CLANG, CLANG, CLANG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spartan reaches desperately for the still spewing MTL as the rivulets close in towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grabs onto it just in time. Spins, melts off a protective circle around him. Looks up at the peanut gallery of cryocons.
</DIRECTION>
<SPARTAN>

MTL still blazing, the hall bursts into flame around him as he leaves. He takes no chances. Continues to melt and burn his way out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CRYO PRISON - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Outside the building, but still inside the gate. Spartan pauses, still holding the flaming MTL, thinks about it a sec, torches the rest of the whole evil fucking place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GATE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Spartan steps through, the MTL sputters to a halt. He tosses it aside. The cryo prison burns, explodes, freezes, contracts, expands behind him.
</DIRECTION>

A far greater crowd has gathered. Police, citizens, Scraps. They watch in silent awe and shock as Spartan re-emerges. Katherine walks up. Deadpan as her father --
