<DIRECTION>
Helium3 is a gas ejected from the surface of the sun and blown through space by solar winds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It plays an essential role in Cold Fusion, often toted as the solution to humanity's future energy needs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is one major problem...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helium3 is extremely scarce on Earth. The gas does, however, exist in abundance on the Earth's only natural satellite:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Moon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Should we turn to Cold Fusion in the future, it is conceivable that man will mine the Moon for Helium3 and bring the precious gas back to Earth...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BLACK:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear something -- a machine -- CHURNING and POUNDING. Constant. Rhythmic. Though the sound is slightly familiar, we're not sure what it is yet. Hold for a few seconds and then

<DIRECTION>
INT. REC ROOM -- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound belongs to a regular old TREADMILL like you see in most gyms across the world. Running on it: SAM BELL, mid thirties, thick beard, handsome, striking blue eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam's face is flushed and glistening with sweat. He lunges for a towel draped over the treadmill's bar, dabs his face as he runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see OUTSIDE THE WINDOW: A gray, powdery landscape stretching beneath a BLACK SKY.

EXT. MOON -- MORNING

<DIRECTION>
Aerial view of the Earth's only natural satellite, the camera roaming about a hundred feet off the surface.
</DIRECTION>

Desolation. Serious, uncompromising, desolation. This place makes Antarctica look like Tokyo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And utter silence.

Eventually the camera arrives at a moon base, DIVING DOWN towards it --

INT. BATHROOM\SHOWER -- MORNING

<DIRECTION>
Sam takes a shower, treading in a tight circle beneath the nozzle, eyes closed, hot water blasting his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COMMS ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His hair still wet from the shower, Sam sits before a COMMS UNIT, dressed in a "Lunar Industries" boiler suit, a zip up the front, colorful patches sewn into the arms. He begins to record a message.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tess. Hi. It's me. How are you, sweetheart? It's the morning here. In a few minutes Gerty and I will sit down for breakfast, go over the day's itinerary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
As Sam continues his message, we are given a TOUR of the mining base. Beginning with:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MONITORING STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is where you want to be if the shit hits the fan. The base's equivalent of HQ. A wall of computers and flickering digital displays.

	Today begins my 154th week on Selene. I officially have two weeks to go before I climb into that Return Vehicle...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RETURN VEHICLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small space craft attached to the base. It is essentially a tiny room with a coffin like, sealed bed in the middle of it: a cryogenic POD with an array of complicated controls surrounding it.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And blast home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REC ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam spends most of his time here. It is kitchen and play room combined. We PICK OUT a television set, an armchair, a Ping-Pong table, the treadmill.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never dreamed I'd make it this far.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
DETAIL: A WOODEN MODEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a table, we also PICK OUT a LARGE MODEL carved out of BOLSER WOOD. It's a TOWN. Intricately done down to the tiniest details.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There were times, as you know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
We go even CLOSER to the model, seeing that there are actual people, actual characters in the little town; actual buildings: a CHURCH, a TOWN HALL, etc. Clearly someone has put a ton of work into this thing.

And the tour of the base continues. Onto a new room. A dark storage area Sam has repurposed to grow a handful of plants. They sit surrounded by darkness, glowing under pools of artificial light.

INT. INFIRMARY

A strange angular room, obviously purposeful, but its design more geared to a computer than a human being. A single bed dominates.

	In many ways, this place is all about contradictions.

EXT. EARTH -- AS SEEN FROM THE MOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From up here it is easy to see why the Earth is sometimes referred to as "the blue marble." A swirl of color.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The earth is thousands and thousands of miles away, but sometimes looks so close I feel like I could reach out and snatch it with my hand.

</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam's bed -- A New York Jets poster on the wall -- a few knickknacks bedside, rock samples in jars, a lucky tambourine Sam got in Mexico some years ago -- a red stress ball -- a photograph by the bed in a frame --

We MOVE CLOSER to the PHOTO by the bed.

Of a slightly younger and clean-shaven Sam with his arms wrapped around his wife of four years, TESS BELL.

</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Tess is a far cry from the stereotypical Astronaut's Wife of the 1960's/70's with the plastic smile and beehive hairdo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tess is modern, sophisticated, and jaw-droppingly beautiful. She looks like she'd be a hard woman to leave behind.

Note: In the photograph Tess is visibly PREGNANT.

Back with Sam at the Comms Unit as he wraps up the message.

INT. CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The main corridor connecting the different rooms. We've seen everything there is to see now. The base is small. Confined. Claustrophobic. It is easy to imagine how someone could crack up here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam leaves the Comms Room and heads down the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REC ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A state of the art robot, a GERTY 3000 -- known simply as "GERTY" -- is preparing Sam's breakfast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gerty is in three sections and moves along a horizontal rail that runs throughout the base. He has a readout screen that perpetually spews data. His hands resemble pincers, but are perfectly nimble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For the purposes of helping run the base and looking after Sam, Gerty is as good as human, if not better.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam enters.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning, Gerty.

<GERTY>

	Morning, Sam. How are you today?

	Fine. Fine. You?

</SAM>
<GERTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm very well. How's your headache?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERTY>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Much better, thanks, pal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Sam treats Gerty more like a person than a robot. Whether this is down to Gerty's intelligence or Sam's desperation for company isn't clear just yet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Note: Gerty talks like a well-educated older man. His language doesn't have a great deal of inflection (i.e. Monotone) but he is friendly enough.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam switches a dial on a radio but gets nothing but static - - he sticks in a mini cd and skips the first few tracks. We hear brief clips of talk radio and shuttle through it before he allows it to play on, on some random American station -- an old weather report:

INT. MONITORING STATION -- DAY
</DIRECTION>

Sam sits before Selene's main computer, known as THE OLD MAN. Data flickering off Sam's face. He is making a log entry. A CLOCK is running on the monitor.

Sam stands before the Big Board. The names of the four Harvesters (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John) in a collum. The red light is flashing next to Matthew.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam presses an INTERCOM BUTTON, dips down, speaks into it.

<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gerty, we've got a live one on Mark. I'm going out now to rope her in.

A SPACE SUIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Resembling an unmanned puppet. Sam begins to insinuate his body into the suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three Rovers (moon buggies) parked in their separate bays. The Rovers are caked in lunar soil, as though sand blasted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In his space suit Sam bends into one of the Rovers, starts the engine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. ROVER/MOON SURFACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam drives along, dwarfed by an enormous lunar bolder and the rising slopes of the valley beyond. A toy car in this vast and alien terrain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HARVESTER/MOON SURFACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second in a fleet of four Harvesters (this one known as Mark) collecting lunar soil. The Harvester resembles a tank and kicks up clouds of dust. Booming, hulking, efficient.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam catches up in his Rover and accelerates into the back of the Harvester up a couple of ramps. An intricate and dangerous maneuver he executes deftly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HARVESTER/BELLY -- CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is in an area of the Harvester -- a kind of hatch -- not dissimilar to a garage and known as THE BELLY. Once safely inside Sam closes the door. He is able to breathe in the Belly without his helmet, which he duly removes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam steps up to a wall of computers. A light is flashing to indicate one of the pods is filled with Helium3.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam does his thing, eventually removing a keg-size pod of Helium3. He hauls it over to the Rover and sticks it in a special slot in the equivalent of the Rover's trunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A new pod -- an empty -- replaces the pod Sam just removed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam puts his helmet back on, returns to the Rover, reverses out of the Harvester carefully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. ROVER/MOON SURFACE

Sam snakes through the soil on his way back to base, the tracks of the Rover as sharp as if they had been made through talcum powder. The Harvester churns into the distance.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR -- LATER

Sam loads the filled pod into a CARGO CONTAINER. The Cargo Container is about the size of a fridge and can take a maximum of five pods. There are four pods already inside, Sam's new pod taking up the fifth and final slot.

INT. COMMS ROOM

<DIRECTION>
Sam is seated at the Comms Unit recording a message for his superiors back on Earth.

	Overmeyers, Thompson? It's Sam. How goes it? I've got a full container of Helium3 ready to roll. The purity is pretty good, so assuming your last market prices are still relevant I think you are looking at getting about 3 million dollars per kilo with this load. By the time this message reaches you it should be in transit.

All of a sudden Sam STOPS. He has the feeling someone is standing behind him. He slowly turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GIRL is standing in the doorway watching him. She is perhaps fifteen or sixteen years old. A yellow dress. Long, wheat-colored hair. Freckles. At once beautiful and haunting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam gets the FRIGHT of his life. He FLIES against the wall.

WIDEN to reveal Sam and the Girl facing off. Sam POP-EYED and SHAKING. The Girl IMMOBILE, arms at her sides, head tilted ever so slightly to one side.

<DIRECTION>
The Cargo Container is sent hurtling through space. A TERRIFIC BLAST. It distracts Sam's attention, breaks his stare...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And just like that, the Girl is gone. Sam is just staring at an empty doorway. Nothing there.

Sam is baffled. Had to be his imagination. Had to be. After a few seconds he shakes his head dismissively and continues working.

INT. COMMS ROOM

<DIRECTION>
Sam sits at the comms unit watching a message from his superiors, OVERMEYERS and THOMPSON, a purposeful looking woman in charge and her earnest second.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two talk RAPIDLY and trade off like a tag team. At times their tone can be almost bizarrely whimsical.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Overmeyers and Thompson seem to have known Sam for a while, but even so, there is a practised casualness to the repartee. It's a professional friendliness on Overmeyers part, no more and for Thompson it's merely an eagerness to be involved.

<OVERMEYERS>

	Delighted to hear about the latest shipment, Sam.

Sam stands before the toilet urinating. Rather ironically he is whistling I'm Walking on Sunshine -- focussed ahead at his reflection in the mirror -- angling his face, admiring his haircut, his beard.

Then he looks down to flush the toilet and his WHISTLING abruptly STOPS.

INT. BATHROOM\TOILET

It looks like someone just poured a glass of CRANBERRY JUICE into the toilet bowl. Literally. The red urine clouding the water like a squirt of octopus ink. Yeah, Sam just pissed blood.

There is a "PING!" and Gerty's voice crackles from the intercom.

A pause. Tess just stares into the camera. She is hundreds and thousands of miles away, but for a second it feels like she's right there in the Comms Room with Sam. It's intimate.

She finally shakes her head, self-conscious, shy.

It might be baby back ribs with french fries and spinach, but it's made from a packet by adding hot water. Nasty.

Sam HUMS along to the music. A man at peace.

INT. REC ROOM -- NIGHT/LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is working on his wooden model of the town. Across the room the Ed Sullivan Show is on TV. Ed's guest is a very young Goldie Hawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Note: Whenever any TV is watched in the film, it is always a show from 1970's America. (Mash, Six Million Dollar Man, Laugh-In, etc.) No explanation is given for this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is half-watching the TV, but his focus is chiefly on the SMALL HOUSE he is carving. And carving beautifully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a few seconds he stands and snaps off the TV with a remote. He crosses to the kitchen section of the Rec Room to make some tea. The water has just boiled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Sam is about to pour the boiling water, tea kettle in hand, he glances across the Rec Room and sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Girl. She's taken Sam's chair before the model. She is motionless, staring down at the model like she recognizes one of the little figures walking the tiny streets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam calmly puts the tea kettle down and begins to move towards the Girl, slowly, cautiously, like he wants to sneak up on her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam walks right up to the Girl and reaches out his hand...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then we CUT to Sam standing in the kitchen. Over by the model there is no sign of the Girl. The chair is empty. She's gone. Her sitting there, Sam's walk across the room -- apparently he imagined it all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam looks down. The tea kettle is dangling at an angle and BOILING WATER is DRIBBLING onto his left hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simultaneously: Sam SNAPS his hand AWAY, Sam SCREAMS. The tea kettle CLATTERS to the floor.

Sam HURRIES to the sink and jerks his hand under a stream of cold water. Cursing under his breath the whole time: "Shit, piss, fuck..."

A pause. Gerty is wrapping Sam's hand with a bandage.

	Sam, you said it was the TV that distracted you, but when I came in the TV wasn't on.

Sam wakes up and lunges across the bed to shut off his alarm clock. We notice a WHITE BANDAGE on the hand that he scolded.

And then another BLIP -- another BLAST of STATIC -- and the screen turns completely BLACK.

A single word begins to flash in the center of the screen: "ERROR."

The word flashes three times -- before the screen returns to normal, the CLOCK running again.

It all happened so quickly Sam wonders if he didn't just imagine it. After an awkward pause he simply continues the original log entry.

HARVESTER/MATTHEW

As Sam gets closer to the Harvester, he suddenly sees something:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Girl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is standing maybe a hundred yards away in her yellow dress, resembling a FLAME or a FLOWER in the barren and colorless landscape. She appears to be staring directly at Sam's rover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His face unfolding with panic, alarm, curiosity. An intense, yearning, curiosity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drives closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But like in a dream, Sam can't seem to make up any distance between the Rover and the Girl. He CRUSHES the accelerator peddle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment Sam drives right alongside the Harvester, clouds of lunar dust being kicked up, cascading against the side window. But Sam is looking away from the Harvester, focussed on the Girl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SAM: He doesn't notice Matthew (The Harvester) suddenly veer RIGHT, slamming into the side of the Rover and causing Sam to lose control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The steering wheel swings left and right as Sam desperately tries to STRAIGHTEN the path of the vehicle, but a split second later the Rover is FLIPPED like a matchbox, and SPUN into the path of the Harvester -- a HIDEOUS SCREECH of MANGLED METAL -- the Rover gobbled up by the front of the Harvester, DEVOURED.

<DIRECTION>
The Rover is JAMMED under the Harvester's monstrous AXLE, resembling a crushed beer can in a fist -- and with a BIG, BOOMING GROAN the Harvester slides to a STANDSTILL.

No sign of the robot. Sam is feeling well enough to walk. He swings his legs out of bed, begins to plod around the room. He is tentative at first, slow, as if walking is something he is having to learn from scratch.

Eventually when he is moving fluidly he goes to the door and pokes his head out into the corridor.

Sam's face taught with irritation. He isn't happy.

Gerty gives him the next puzzle to solve. WE MOVE IN ON SAM'S LEFT HAND as he takes the puzzle, the same hand he scolded in an earlier scene.

Sam walking down the corridor in the direction of the Sleeping Quarters. He stops at a RED LIGHT on the corridor wall, beneath it the word, "EXIT DOORS."

He's locked inside the base.

Sam pulls a face, disgruntled, continues down the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS -- CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam takes in the New York Jets poster on the wall and walks over to the bed -- studies his lucky tambourine and the glass jar of lunar rock samples -- like he's trying to reacquaint himself with his own belongings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes arrive on the red stress ball. Sam scoops up the ball and PITCHES it at the wall like he expects the thing to bounce back to him. The stress ball doesn't bounce back, simply hits the wall with a dull THUD and DROPS to the FLOOR.

EXT. THE MOON -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A desolation special. The blacker than black sky above. None of the ingredients of life. On Earth we have rainforests, and flowers, and birds. We have color. Up here we realize how lucky we are. The base is lit by large halogen comfort lights, alone in the lunar desert. This is a lunar night.

Sam sees something that pulls him CLOSER to the monitor.

Gerty approaches. Sam taps the screen.

	There's no way to tell from here if a track's been thrown, or if it's just something jammed in an axle, or what... I can shoot out there, check it out, get some video and maybe save you guys the expense of floating in a whole crew! I know how tight money is right now....

Sam really frustrated now. He feels cooped up, stir crazy, idle.

Sam and Gerty are seated at the Comms Unit watching a video message from Central. Sam is holding a carved HOUSE, examining it as he listens to the video.

Sam stares at Gerty.

SAM'S TROUBLED DREAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam and Tess making love. We remain very close to their bodies in bed. The background a blur. It's the same dream we saw earlier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something is different though.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We drift past Sam and Tess, and under the sheets of the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Down between their entwined feet huddles a bearded, wide- eyed Sam, staring directly at us from under the sheets at the end of the bed!

Sam is quietly eating breakfast, lost in thought. Gerty puttering around in the background. The radio drones away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COMMS ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is seated at the Comms Unit watching a message from Tess.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We assume this is an old message since Tess is heavily PREGNANT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her slender hands are spread over her prodigious belly as she beams at the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<TESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's kicking...or she's kicking. I'm certain he's a boy. I wish you could feel it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat, shifting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we made the right choice, Sam. I really do. We need some time apart. We got stuck. That happens in marriages sometimes. It's nothing terrible.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well listen, I love you lots -- and we'll talk soon, okay? Bye Sam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TESS>
<DIRECTION>
A POP and Tess is gone -- the monitor filled with STATIC. Sam sits staring into space. Tess' message seems to have agitated him.
</DIRECTION>

He JUMPS from his chair and HEADS OUT of the Comms Room at pace.

Sam strides in -- swipes a KNIFE from beside the wooden model -- strides out again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam glances left and right -- making sure there's no sign of Gerty -- then begins to PRY open a VENT with the knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once the vent is removed he reaches deep inside and YANKS out a bundle of interwoven WIRES -- Sam bends the wires around the BLADE of the knife -- and CUTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GAS ISSUES from the cut wires. An ALARM sounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam hides the knife away, shouts down the corridor:
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gerty! Get over here! Quickly!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Gerty comes out of the Monitoring Station and SHUTTLES down the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<GERTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERTY>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't know -- Micro meteorites, maybe? Either way there might be damage to the exterior shell. I'd better go outside and take a look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<GERTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no damage to the exterior shell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERTY>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not that I don't believe you, Gerty, but the inner skin is springing leaks like an ACME fire hose. Maybe you better let me take a look, just in case, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<GERTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam, I'm not supposed to let you go outside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERTY>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then let's keep it between you and me then. Ok?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
The robot takes an inordinate amount of time to think this through. The syrupy gas distorts the light as it collects at Sam's ankles. Gerty's arms work away as they speedily repair the damage Sam has done. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<GERTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Sam.

The "Exit Doors" LIGHT turns from RED to GREEN. For Sam this is like the BLAST of a STARTING PISTOL -- he immediately takes off down the corridor --

Sam finds his space suit is gone, so grabs the spare suit and scrambles into it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two Rovers parked side by side. One of the parking bays is EMPTY. Sam stands before the empty bay for a moment -- why is one of the Rovers missing?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
If Sam suspected something was wrong before, he is certain of it now. He climbs into one of the two remaining Rovers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. ROVER/MOON SURFACE

Sam speeding along in the Rover. He has Matthew's coordinates plugged into his Navigation System and is following a MAP on a small monitor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOON -- CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam heading towards the stalled Harvester. It soon becomes apparent that there is something STUCK under the front of the Harvester's AXLE. A second later it is apparent what that something is: inevitably, it's the MISSING ROVER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam slows his Rover down, approaching the scene with CAUTION. He parks a few feet away from the wreck and opens the door of his Rover, stepping outside gingerly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONE SIXTH GRAVITY is like walking on a trampoline. Sam takes long strides, bobbing over to the front of the Harvester to take a closer look, his boots leaving deep FOOTPRINTS in the lunar soil.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FRONT OF THE HARVESTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crashed Rover is exactly as we left it after the accident, mangled, crushed, captured beneath the trundles of the Harvester. Sam peers closer and sees that there is an UNCONSCIOUS MAN in a Lunar Industries space suit trapped inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam can't see the man's face -- he has his back to Sam, his body sprawled across the passenger seat like he's searching for loose change on the floor of the vehicle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With great effort Sam manages to prize the Rover's door open. He reaches inside and begins to pull the man out -- Sam's sheer ADRENALINE giving him the strength of a YETI.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam DRAGS the unconscious man away from the crashed Rover, his body leaving a big TRACK MARK in the gray soil. Sam takes a second to catch his breath, then leans down and turns the unconscious man onto his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He BRUSHES DUST from the glass of the man's HELMET, leans down even closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP -- THE MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through his helmet we see a BLOODY and BEARDED SAM. Sam as we remember him. The Sam from the opening twenty minutes of the film.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam's face as the PANIC, the ALARM, the SHOCK, the REALIZATION hit him like a wrecking ball: this man he has just pulled out of the crashed Rover is himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE SHOT -- THE STALLED HARVESTER

Sam gathers his wits and manages to lift the unconscious Sam up over his shoulder, fireman's lift style, taking him to the parked Rover.

He reaches into the Rover, lifting out the unconscious Sam. He carries him in both arms, staggering across the dock -- back arched, arms beginning to sag -- and into the corridor.

Sam promptly collapses and DROPS the unconscious Sam onto the floor.

Gerty approaches, gliding along his rail. Sam is freaking out big time, exhausted, panic-stricken, bewildered.

Lying in the Infirmary bed, propped on a pillow, is the first Sam, the bearded Sam, who we will now refer to as SAM 1.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has a wicked black eye and a purple bruise on the right side of his face, looks like he was on the losing end of a brawl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has a DRIP stuck in his arm and a tangle of WIRES attached to his bare chest. A MACHINE is BEEPING away.

Gerty hovers over him, redressing the BANDAGE on Sam 1's left hand, the one he scolded a while back.

For a second this is playing out like the other Infirmary scene. A case of deja-vu.

Sam 1's eyes twitch as he catalogues through his memory. Yes he remembers the crash. He remembers something else, too.

As he says this Sam 2 crosses slowly from one side of the room to the other, never taking his eyes off Sam 1. It's like Sam 2 is purposefully keeping his distance, reluctant, afraid even, to approach any closer.

Meanwhile Sam 1 is beginning to look spooked.

Sam 1 sinks to his knees before the toilet bowl. With great effort he is able to remove his helmet, placing it on the floor next to him. He stares into the toilet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment all is calm. The gentle "ping-ping-ping" of a computer somewhere inside the base. Sam breathing steadily. Spots of sweat on his upper lip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then he VOMITS. He vomits LOUD, he vomits VIOLENTLY. His whole body THRUSTS forward in the process, taught, tense, like a dog being YANKED on a CHAIN.

Sam 1 vomits again. And again. And again. And stops.

Sam 1 stands, moves to the mirror, opening his mouth wide to look for the missing teeth -- he uses his thumbs, shows his gums -- revealing: yes, he's lost at least a couple of teeth.

He flushes the toilet.

One of Gerty's long spindly ARMS slides into the room. Sam backs away from the intimidating piece of machinery, but it stops within reach of the computer.

Sam 1 watches as the arm reaches forward and taps the password in for him. It leaves the room the way it came in.

Sam 1 continues to go further and further back -- and suddenly he POPS up on the screen again -- or is it him? -- this Sam up on the screen has stubble -- no beard -- and looks seriously ILL --

We see the others Sams returning to Earth -- yet they don't seem to go anywhere -- when they blast off the RETURN VEHICLE remains in its bay --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam 1 views different Sams blasting back to earth in the return vehicle -- always with the same result -- the return vehicle remaining in its bay, the Sams seemingly VANISHING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In one particularly GRAINY SEQUENCE Sam 1 views Gerty opening the lid to the cryo pod in the return vehicle and beginning to VACUUM what appears to be DUST or DEBRIS --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam 1 understands now that the Return Vehicle is not a spacecraft, but some kind of INCINERATOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RETURN VEHICLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam 1 heads into the Return Vehicle. Its dominated by the cryo pod, used to hold astronauts in a state of cryogenic sleep on their way back to Earth. Sam 1 pops open the lid and starts frantically searching the chamber for TRACES of the previous Sams, eventually finding particles of DUST in the cracks --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He closes the lid. A video showing a TECHNICIAN in a white lab coat begins to play on a screen aimed at the glass lid of the pod. It's mute, but we can hear a tinny version of the audio coming from the cryo pod. Sam 1 pushes a button on the monitor and we hear the audio properly.
</DIRECTION>
<TECHNICIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...relax and breathe deeply. The cryo pod is designed to put you into a deep sleep for the duration of your three day return journey back to Earth. As you begin to get sleepy, think about the magnificent job you've done, and how proud your family are of what you've accomplished.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TECHNICIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Relaxing music begins to play. After a moment the music stops. There is a pause. Then an almighty pulse of light from the cryo pod. This is how Sams past have met their end. Nuked to ash like microwave meals in the cryo pod.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam 1 inspects the controls of the spacecraft to see if it really is a vehicle -- in the process of his search he finds himself down on his knees checking out the wiring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Sam 1's attention is on the floor BENEATH HIM. He appears to be kneeling on some kind of PANEL -- like a tablet in the return vehicle's floor -- he presses his ear against the panel -- KNOCKS --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The panel sounds HOLLOW.

CUBBY

Sam 1 opens a cubby, swipes something similar to a CROW BAR, heads out of the frame --

Back in the Return Vehicle, Sam 1 stands over the panel in the floor. He uses the CROW BAR to prize the panel open -- this takes an extraordinary effort -- the panel eventually LIFTING like a manhole cover.

Sam 1 can't believe his eyes. At the top of the OPEN PANEL, leading down into darkness...there's A LADDER.

Sam 1 reaches the bottom of the ladder. He's in a dark room, a kind of CHAMBER -- if NASA did crypts, it would look like this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The only light source right now is the coming from the Return Vehicle up above. Sam 2 hops down beside Sam 1, squints into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM_2>

</SAM_2>
<DIRECTION>
Both Sams FUMBLE along opposing walls -- Sam 1 eventually finding a SWITCH, snaps it on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An array of overhead fluorescent bulbs begin to STUTTER and FLASH before ILLUMINATING the chamber completely --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two Sams can hardly believe their eyes: stretching back maybe fifty feet are rows and rows of PODS -- like upright glass coffins -- and standing inside each pod, an as-of-yet UNAWAKENED CLONE. It's like an ENTIRE ARMY of Sam Bells...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spooky as hell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a few moments Sam 1 and 2 are too stunned to speak. They walk to the end of the chamber and back again, looking at each clone one at a time -- all the clones are bare chested and wear some kind of white cloth to cover their genitals, like a diaper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Of course they all look the same, that's why they're clones, but this piece of scientific wizardry is mind- boggling to Sam 1 and 2 -- they MARVEL at how each of the clones is identical in every way, and down to the minutest of details -- same length of hair, same skin tone, same fingernails --

Sam 1 marches up to his Rover, tosses in the backpack and dips inside without his helmet, closes the door and backs out into the black day.

INT./EXT. SAM 1'S ROVER/MOON SURFACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam 1 at the wheel, flooring the Rover -- he looks possessed, determined -- a man on a mission --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam's Rover approaches one of the many Jammers that we now know circle the perimeter of the base.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam 1 stops the Rover on the other side of the Jammer. Here, outside the range of the Jammers, he figures he might be able to get a signal through to Earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SAM as he removes his equipment from the backpack and starts to uncoil wires -- inserts a small BATTERY PACK onto the back of the VP, sits the VP on his lap. The VP resembles a Play Station Portable with its small but nonetheless high-quality screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam isn't sure who to contact at first...finally he enters some numbers from memory. The VP shaking in his hands. He is nervous, scared. He disables the video mode on his end, so he is only sending audio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment of silence. The VP seems dead.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on...come on...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM_1>
<DIRECTION>
Then the VP BEEPS -- the monitor BLIPS -- the message seems to have gone through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And suddenly a GIRL appears on the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam 1 can't believe it. It's the same Girl from his hallucinations. Same wheat-colored hair. Same freckles dotting her cheek bones. Same yellow dress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The moment Sam 1 sees the Girl he thinks -- naturally -- that he's imagining things again. But then she speaks:
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
That's never happened before. Sam 1 finally manages to respond:
</DIRECTION>
<SAM_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, Bell residence?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM_1>
<DIRECTION>
The conversation has a very slight delay, maybe a second or two, and the Girl isn't completely clear on the monitor. We assume that these minor technical glitches are the same on the Girl's end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Girl is sweet, chirpy -- nothing like the haunting, ghost-like figure from Sam 1's hallucinations.

<GIRL>

<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, she passed away some years ago.

<DIRECTION>
Sam 1 GASPS. He literally gasps. Like someone just plunged a paring knife into his belly.

<SAM_1>

</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
And astonishingly, the news of Tess's death actually takes a back seat as Sam 1 is forced to confront this new revelation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girl is EVE BELL. Sam 1 is talking to his DAUGHTER.

Sam 1 tilts his head, a smile twitches on his face.

Sam 1 can't believe it. She's beautiful. She's beautiful.

Sam 1 hurriedly shuts off the VP.

Sam 2 hears a sound from the corridor. Moments later Sam 1 appears in the doorway wearing the backpack.

Sam 1 is beginning to look alarmingly ILL. His depleting health has been evident throughout the film, but now it seems to have jumped to a new level.

INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS

Sam 1's eyes open slowly. He's awake.

<DIRECTION>
Was his dream a memory? A premonition? Or was it simply made up?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE -- SAM 1
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BLEARY Sam 1 yawns and stretches his arms over his head. He reaches across the bed and rips a couple of tissues from a box of Kleenex, blows his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Afterwards he checks the tissues: a thick RED GOO came out of his nose, the color and consistency of tomato purée. Yeah, gross.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam 1 rolls out of bed, plants his feet on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The base seems eerily quiet. Too quiet. Sam 1 stands and crosses to the door.

Sam 1 begins to walk left, down towards the Rec Room and the Monitoring Station, but hesitates -- he turns the other way, towards the Infirmary, heads that way instead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INFIRMARY -- CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lying in one of the Infirmary beds, eyes closed, a NETWORK of WIRES attached to his chest...Sam. We don't know which Sam it is yet. He is clean shaven. He looks like any one of the clones down in the secret chamber; then again he could just as easily be Sam 2.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And that's what Sam 1 naturally assumes as he enters the Infirmary and sees him lying there. Sam 1 moves closer, curious, until he is standing right at the edge of the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam 1 reaches out his hand to wake him up when there is a voice from the doorway behind:
</DIRECTION>
<SAM_2>

He starts to frantically type, altering the PATH of the HARVESTERS.

EXT. MARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark trundling along at half-speed. The Harvester suddenly changes direction -- veering sharply to the left and heading up over a steep slope.

INT. MONITORING STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back on Sam 2 as he RAPIDLY types, makes an error, screams:
</DIRECTION>
<SAM_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM_2>
<DIRECTION>
Pounds the delete button, continuing to type coordinates into the Old Man -- He's done! He leaps out of his chair and tears off through the base towards the cargo container.

EXT. WIDE SHOT -- THE MOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Eliza's spacecraft sets its sights on Selene, we see the Cargo Container ROCKET through the sky in the opposite direction.

INT. MOON BASE SELENE/QUICK SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a few moments all is quiet inside the base.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The "PING-PING-PING" of the Old Man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The grinding GURGLE of a computer readout.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This sequence echoes the tour at the very start of the film, but the base has a decidedly different feel to it now. It's like an abandoned house.

INT. COMMS ROOM

CLOSE UP -- THE OLD MAN
</DIRECTION>

On the monitor: "RESCUE UNIT ELIZA: ARRIVED."

EXT. ELIZA'S SPACECRAFT/MOON SURFACE
</DIRECTION>

INT. INFIRMARY -- LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gerty sits lifeless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the sounds of pressure doors opening. Unrecognized voices as the landing crew enters the base, calling for Sam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gerty comes to life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His principal monitor POPS ON and his pincer-like HANDS begin to TWITCH. His READOUT SCREEN streams with DATA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gerty's head begins to swivel left and right -- as if he's awoken with a stiff neck -- eventually he SEES Sam 3, crosses to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just like that, Gerty continues his routine checks of Sam 3 -- studying Sam 3's heartbeat, his brain activity -- the robot literally picking up where he left off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then Sam 3's eyes open. He is awake. He blinks at Gerty, cloudy, groggy.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where am I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM_3>
<GERTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam, you're in the Infirmary. You had an accident.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERTY>
<DIRECTION>
Sam 3 staring ahead, trying to dig up the memory.
</DIRECTION>
<GERTY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you remember what happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERTY>
<SAM_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Gerty.

<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't remember a thing.

We hear heavy footsteps and voices closer now, just outside the infirmary.

EXT. MARK/JAMMER/MOON SURFACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CLOSE UP of MARK as the Harvester churns along and SLAMS into an JAMMER with full force.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Jammer wobbles unsteadily from the IMPACT, before finally TOPPLING over, HAZING the air with lunar dust.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. CARGO CONTAINER/SPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cargo Container BULLETING through space, fire blasting from its jets like the petals of an exotic flower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CARGO CONTAINER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam 2 is seriously cramped inside one of the Helium 3 containers, about as comfortable as a pony in a dog kennel, but nonetheless WHOOPING RAUCOUSLY at the sheer velocity of the container -- as well as, and perhaps even more so, the fact that he has successfully escaped the base.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's going home.

Sam 1 has stopped breathing. The sun shines on his face.

SAM'S DREAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam walks towards Tess. He sits down in front of her on the blanket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beautiful picnic is spread out before them. Tess has never looked so radiant, so beautiful. Light from the sky pours into her upturned face.
</DIRECTION>
<TESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What took you so long?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TESS>
<DIRECTION>
Sam just smiles back at her. She hands him a bottle of wine and a corkscrew.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS UPWARD -- not a cloud in sight -- but we are just able to pick out the chalky outline of the MOON, resembling a white thumb print in the blue sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLD THIS shot of the Moon for a few seconds before we
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.

INT. COMMS ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the Comms Unit monitor there is a BLAST of STATIC, followed by a FLASHING MESSAGE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"LIVE FEED AVAILABLE."

THE END
