	Ya gotta get way from New York, Charlie. Maranzano. Masseria. Them old Dons are never gonna give ya any daylight. Colosimo was the same way. Couldn't see the future if it bit him in the ass. But in Chicago you can get away with axin' the Capo. Here, you're stuck with 'em.

Capone sticks a cigar in his mouth, and strikes a match to light it. The side window EXPLODES under a shower of bullets from a passing car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAPONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
dives to the floor. Charlie pulls a pistol from his jacket and returns the fire, as the Limo Driver JERKS the steering wheel to the left, ramming the limousine into the side of the other car. A second hail of bullets cuts the Limo Diver dead. The two cars careen together, crashing into a parked car.

CHARLIE CRAWLS DOWN THE ALLEY

Peering over the trash cans, Charlie can see that the alley is a dead end, but he still can't make out the Gunman. Luciano grabs a bottle and tosses it down the alley. As the gunman wastes a shot on the decoy, Charlie dashes across the alley, ducking behind a dumpster.

THE GUNMAN

cowering at the end of the alley, drops his emptied gun to the pavement. He looks to the right of the dumpster, then the left. Torn over which path to take. He makes a run to the left.

	I have exclusive deals with four distillers in Scotland, and ships under contract to bring ten thousand cases a month onto the Jersey coast.

Charlie walks to a large rosewood wardrobe, and pulls it open. A BURST of confetti explodes from within, followed by the rude honk of noisemakers. A gorgeous showgirl in the briefest of glittering costumes steps out to the wild cheers of the guys. Followed by another, and another. Meyer squirms as a leggy blonde slides onto his lap and runs her tongue along his neck.

Charlie leans back against the bar, surveying the customers clustered around roulette wheels and cocktail tables. A fine- featured Young Man stands next to Charlie, trying to get the attention of the bartender. Charlie snaps his fingers, and points out the fellow to the bartender.

A PORCELAIN-SKINNED BEAUTY shrieks in delighted terror as she races up a massive marble staircase. Halfway up she stops. At the bottom of the stairs, Bugsy stands with his arms across his chest, feigning indifference. The Beauty's panties bounce off his face. Bugsy charges up the stairs.

TWO NEGRO CHAUFFEURS

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PANICKED DRIVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slams the truck into gear, running over the body of the Gunman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIEGEL FIRES AGAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shattering the windshield, then leaps back into the ditch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TRUCK MOVES HALFWAY UP THE GRADE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where its rear wheels spin helplessly on the ice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DRIVER SEES SIEGEL CLIMB BACK OUT OF THE DITCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and calmly pull a pistol from his coat. He struggles to get the truck into reverse. As Siegel levels his gun, the truck lurches backward, bumping sickeningly over the body of the Gunman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON LUCIANO AND COSTELLO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they push mightily against the tree trunk. It CRACKS, and CRASHES across the road, cutting off the path of the truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LANSKY AND LUCIANO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
scarves pulled across their faces, race toward the truck from opposite sides of the road. They beat their pistols on its sides, and order the men to throw their guns out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIEGEL RIPS THE TOP OFF A BAG OF ROCK SALT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and pours the contents across the grade. He trots toward the front of the truck, his pistol leveled at the Driver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COSTELLO -- ALSO MASKED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
moves out of the woods toward the rear of the truck, as Siegel roughly drags the Driver around to the back of the truck. Costello shoves his pistol under the Driver's chin.

</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
The Guards comply, and step off the truck, hands raised over their heads. Luciano, Lansky, Costello, and Siegel surround them, all still masked, all with guns leveled. Siegel pats the First Guard down. He pulls an antique gold watch from the man's vest pocket. The Guard grabs for Siegel's hand.

Siegel jerks his hand away, gripping the watch in his fist beside his face. The Guard grabs at the watch, catching Bugsy's scarf, and pulling it from his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIEGEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Knocks the Guard to the ground, beating him viciously with his pistol. As the Guard begs for mercy, Siegel slams the barrel of his pistol into the Guard's mouth, and fires. Siegel stands up and looks to the Second Guard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRUCK HORN BLASTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pair of headlight beams swing across the scene, as a second truck, identical to the first, screeches to a halt just short of the fallen tree. The Second Guard makes a run, but Siegel cuts him down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DRIVER BREAKS AWAY FROM COSTELLO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and dives into the foliage of the fallen tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUNMEN

pour out of the second truck and open fire. Shots ring out from both sides, with the Driver caught in the middle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LUCIANO

<DIRECTION>
COSTELLO AND LANSKY

<DIRECTION>
seek cover along the sides of the truck, but Siegel charges boldly out into the open, firing into the foliage of the tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE ROOF OF THE SECOND TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a gunman draws a bead on Siegel as he advances on the tree. As if by instinct, Siegel looks up at the gunman on the roof and blasts him away. Tossing the pistol aside, he pulls another from his coat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AS THE TRUCK ROARS TO LIFE - COSTELLO AND LANSKY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
climb into the back, shouting for Siegel to join them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIEGEL CONTINUES TO BLAST AWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
at the fallen tree, when another gunman jumps out from behind the truck, and wings Bugsy on the right hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BUGSY RETREATS TO THE DEPARTING TRUCK
</DIRECTION>

Looking back as Meyer and Frank pull him aboard. The Driver crawls out of the branches of the fallen tree, and on toward the second truck.
</DIRECTION>

OUTSIDE THE TRUCK

SOMETIME LATER

Frank and Charlie sit back in their chairs, the remnants of their lunches before them. Across the table, Masseria has managed to consume an incredibly large amount of food. He shoves an entire pastry in his mouth, washing it down with wine. He scratches his distended belly, and belches.

	YOU FUCKIN' WEASEL! YOU STUPID SHIT EATIN' WEASEL!!

AT THE SERVICE ENTRANCE TO SEVENTH AVENUE FASHIONS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WORKMAN finishes loading a sidewalk elevator, and yells below for a co-worker to bring it down.

<DIRECTION>
AS THE PAYROLL MESSENGER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
nears Seventh Avenue Fashions, Vito hurries to catch him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Feeling for his gun, Charlie heads across the alley toward Vito. A HORN BLARES. He jumps back and a long truck rolls slowly past, cutting off his path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VITO TACKLES THE PAYROLL MESSENGER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sending the satchel skidding across the wet sidewalk and down the shaft of the sidewalk elevator. The Young Man pushing the garment rack pulls a pistol from his coat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VITO SCRAMBLES TO HIS FEET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and races to the elevator as the cover CLOSES. He heaves it back open. The Workman stands in the receding elevator, satchel at his feet, looking up into the barrel of Vito's gun. The Workman squats and grabs the satchel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AS THE TRUCK FINALLY PASSES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie spots the Young Man with his gun out, trying to maneuver the rack out of his path. Desperate, he pushes the clothes aside, and steps halfway through the rack, gun drawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

CHARLIE GARBS THE RACK AND JERKS IT DOWN INTO THE STREET

pulling the gunman along with it. Charlie races to Vito and pulls him to his feet. Blood seeps through a hole in his chest. Charlie grabs the satchel from his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MOUNTED POLICEMAN

Appears at Seventh Avenue and charges up the alley on horseback, as Charlie drags Vito up the sidewalk. Charlie pulls out his pistol and fires at the horse.

CHARLIE PUSHES VITO INTO THE BACK SEAT OF THE CAR

tosses the satchel into the front, and climbs behind the wheel. The car spins off the wet sidewalk, crashing to the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the Dismounted Policeman fires, shattering the rear window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it slows, its path blocked by the long truck that stopped Charlie as he tried to cross the street. Charlie JERKS the steering wheel, sending the car up onto the sidewalk and past the truck.

AN HASIDIC JEW CARRYING A PACKAGE

backs out of a doorway into the path of the oncoming car.

CHARLIE SLAMS ON THE BRAKES

but the car slides on the wet pavement, slamming into the man with a sickening thud, and sending him flying over the hood, up the windshield, and across the roof of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE BEATS ON THE STEERING WHEEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in frustration, as the car pulls out onto Eighth Avenue. The rain cutting the smear of blood on the windshield. Charlie looks back at Vito, sprawled in the back seat, dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CONSUMED WITH RAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie grabs the satchel and dumps the money out the window.

CLOSE - ON THE SECOND BODYGUARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he digs under one of his nails with the file, intent on the job. A shadow looms. A hand clasps over his mouth from behind. His body goes rigid. The tip of a knife BURSTS from under his larynx. As he struggles, the knife ROTATES 180 degrees in his neck. Blood gurgles out of his mouth as his eyes roll back in his head. He slides along the wall to the floor.

who seems to stir awake, then doze off again, then finally rouse himself to consciousness. As his eyes blink open, a knife comes crashing into the top of his skull, freezing his bemused expression for eternity. He slumps over in his chair, the knife still planted in his head. Coll fishes the keys to the apartment from the man's pocket.

The other two Accountants stand with their backs to the door, their guns trained on the Bodyguards. Grace sits trembling at her desk. She gasps as the door swings open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAD DOG COLL STEPS INSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the Bodyguards turns toward the door, and Coll opens fire. BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! He blasts away both Accountants and the Bodyguards. As an afterthought, he turns toward Grace, whimpering behind her desk. Can't have a witness running around. BLAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE INNER OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maranzano bellows like a dying elephant, swinging his arms wildly, trying to ward off the knives as he crawls backwards on the floor. Blood bubbles from his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DOOR FLIES OPEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The glass shattering as it slams against the wall. Mad Dog Coll stands in the doorway. His gun trained on Lansky. Maranzano gasps for air.
</DIRECTION>
<MAD_DOG_COLL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a cozy little scene.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAD_DOG_COLL>
<MARANZANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill them! Kill them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARANZANO>
<MAD_DOG_COLL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's it worth to ya, Boss?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAD_DOG_COLL>
<MARANZANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARANZANO>
<MAD_DOG_COLL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything ain't a very hard number.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAD_DOG_COLL>
<MARANZANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One hundred thousand. No... three hundred thousand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARANZANO>
<MAD_DOG_COLL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that's a hard number.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAD_DOG_COLL>
<DIRECTION>
Coll aims carefully at Lansky. Squeezes the trigger. BLAM! COLL'S FOREHEAD EXPLODES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE STEPS INTO THE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sawed-off shotgun smoking in his hands. He advances on Maranzano, whose whole body shakes. He lowers the barrel to Maranzano's head.
</DIRECTION>
<LANSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way, Charlie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LANSKY>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie trembles, fighting his lust for revenge, as Lansky moves to his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - ON CHARLIE'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Lansky takes the weapon from Charlie, and aims it at Maranzano. BLAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thirty top mobsters are arrayed around a conference table. Mangano. Profaci. Bonnano. Anastasia. Gagliano. Dalitz. Hoff. Costello. Siegel. Lansky. A single chair, at the head of the table, remains empty. Al Capone sits to the right of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LUCIANO ENTERS THE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looks around the table for a place to sit. Capone calls him to the head of the table.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Up here, Boss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPONE>
<LUCIANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That ain't exactly been the lucky spot lately.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIANO>
<CAPONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But from now on it's Lucky's spot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPONE>
<DIRECTION>
The men applaud and call out in agreement as Charlie makes his way to the head of the table and settles in.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCIANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you better hear what I got to say first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIANO>
<CAPONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever you say, Boss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPONE>
<LUCIANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Al. Whatever we say. We're all Bosses here. We don' need another.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIANO>
<JOE_PROFACI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Charlie. We gotta have a top guy. Otherwise these wars ain't never gonna stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE_PROFACI>
<LUCIANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As long as ya got one top Boss, somebody else's always gonna be looking to knock him off. And that's war on top of war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIANO>
<JOE_PROFACI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who'll make the rules?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE_PROFACI>
<LUCIANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll make 'em, and we'll enforce 'em. All of us. Together. We all get one vote. Includin' me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIANO>
<JOE_PROFACI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie, I'm from the old country, and these American ways get me sometimes confused. You tellin' us you refuse the title of Boss of All the Bosses?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE_PROFACI>
<LUCIANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care what anybody calls me, Joe. Long as it ain't to dirty. And if you fellas get together every year and say, "Charlie, we still want you to run things for us", I ain't gonna insult ya by sayin' no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIANO>
<DIRECTION>
Costello stands up at his chair.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I propose we make Charlie Luciano head of our National Commission for the next year. All in favor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Several hands shot up quickly, others respond more slowly, uncomfortable with this new-fangled democracy. Finally, only Profaci's hand remains down.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCIANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanna be Boss, Joe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIANO>
<DIRECTION>
Profaci lifts his hand up.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE_PROFACI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Julius Caesar never took no vote.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE_PROFACI>
<LUCIANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And maybe that's why he ended up dead in the streets of Rome.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIANO>
<DIRECTION>
The men LAUGH and Profaci joins in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: INT. GRAND CONCOURSE HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the same set of three hundred mobsters gathered together to hail a new leader for the second time in two weeks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE LOBBY OUTSIDE THE HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie makes his way through a throng of well-wishers. Al Capone catches Charlie in a bear hug and slips a fat envelope into his hand. Charlie shakes his head and gives it back.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCIANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why should you be payin' me when we're all equals?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIANO>
<CAPONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You scare me, Charlie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPONE>
<LUCIANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe that's why I'm the Boss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIANO>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Charlie makes his way up the center aisle with Lansky, Siegel, and Costello, accepting the cheers and handshakes of the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: INT. CHARLIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still dressed from the banquet, Charlie comes through the front door. He removes his coat, and tosses it across the sofa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE WALKS DOWN THE HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rubbing the exhaustion from his face. At the bedroom door, he flips the light switch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SCALLOP-SHELL LAMP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
casts it's mournful glow across the empty bed. Charlie stares wistfully for a moment, then flips the light back off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE DIMLY LIT MARBLE BATH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie lays back in the foamy bubbles in the tub. Lifting a cigar to his mouth, he strikes a match and lights it. He inhales deeply, holds the smoke for a moment, then expels it suddenly. He tosses the cigar into the toilet, where it sizzles and dies. He reaches over and flushes the toilet, then lays back into the bubbles, deep in thought.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
