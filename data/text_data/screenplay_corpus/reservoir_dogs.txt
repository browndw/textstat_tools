:SC: INT. UNCLE BOB'S PANCAKE HOUSE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eight men dressed in BLACK SUITS, sit around a table at a breakfast cafe. They are MR. WHITE, MR. PINK, MR. BLUE, MR. BLONDE, MR. ORANGE, MR. BROWN, NICE GUY EDDIE CABOT, and the big boss, JOE CABOT. Most are finished eating and are enjoying coffee and conversation. Joe flips through a small address book. Mr. Pink is telling a long and involved story about Madonna.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_PINK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Like a Virgin" is all about a girl who digs a guy with a big dick. The whole song is a metaphor for big dicks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_PINK>
<MR_BLUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No it's not. It's about a girl who is very vulnerable and she's been fucked over a few times. Then she meets some guy who's really sensitive--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BLUE>
<MR_PINK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--Whoa...whoa...time out Greenbay. Tell that bullshit to the tourists.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_PINK>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking through his address book)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Toby...who the fuck is Toby? Toby...Toby...think...think... think...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<MR_PINK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. Now granted that's what "True Blue" is about, no argument about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_PINK>
<MR_ORANGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which one is "True Blue?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_ORANGE>
<NICE_GUY_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't remember "True Blue?" That was a big ass hit for Madonna. Shit, I don't even follow this Tops In Pops shit, and I've at least heard of "True Blue."
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICE_GUY_EDDIE>
<MR_ORANGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, asshole, I didn't say I ain't heard of it. All I asked was how does it go? Excuse me for not being the world's biggest Madonna fan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_ORANGE>
<MR_BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate Madonna.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROWN>
<MR_BLUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like her early stuff. You know, "Lucky Star," "Borderline" - but once she got into her "Papa Don't Preach" phase, I don't know, I tuned out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BLUE>
<MR_PINK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, fuck all that, I'm making a point here. You're gonna make me lose my train of thought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_PINK>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh fuck, Toby's that little china girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<MR_WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_WHITE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I found this old address book in a jacket I ain't worn in a coon's age. Toby what? What the fuck was her last name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<MR_PINK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where was I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_PINK>
<MR_ORANGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said "True Blue" was about a nice girl who finds a sensitive fella. But "Like a Virgin" was a metaphor for big dicks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_ORANGE>
<MR_PINK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me tell ya what "Like a Virgin"'s about. It's about some cooze who's a regular fuck machine. I mean all the time, morning, day, night, afternoon, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_PINK>
<MR_BLUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many dicks was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BLUE>
<MR_WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_WHITE>
<MR_PINK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then one day she meets a John Holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. This mother fucker's like Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape." He's diggin tunnels. Now she's gettin this serious dick action, she's feelin something she ain't felt since forever. Pain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_PINK>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chew? Toby Chew? No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<MR_PINK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It hurts. It hurts her. It shouldn't hurt. Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now. But when this cat fucks her, it hurts. It hurts like the first time. The pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin. Hence, "Like a Virgin."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_PINK>
<DIRECTION>
The fellas crack up.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<MR_PINK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you, wrong. I'm right! What the fuck do you know about it anyway? You're still listening to Jerry-fucking-Vale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_PINK>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not wrong, dumb ass, Wong! You know, like the Chinese name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. White snatches the address book from Joe's hand. They fight, but they're not really mad at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me this fucking thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_WHITE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck do you think you're doin? Give me my book back!

</JOE>
<MR_WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sick of fuckin hearin it Joe, I'll give it back when we leave.

</MR_WHITE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<MR_WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "Toby...Toby...Toby... Toby Wong...Toby Wong...Toby Chung...fuckin Charlie Chan." I got Madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and Toby Jap I-don't- know-what, outta my left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_WHITE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you care?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<MR_WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you're annoying as hell, I care a lot.

	I'm gonna do whatever I wanna do with it.

	Well, then, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you guys been listening to K- BILLY's super sounds of the seventies weekend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICE_GUY_EDDIE>
<MR_PINK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it's fuckin great isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_PINK>
<NICE_GUY_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you believe the songs they been playin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICE_GUY_EDDIE>
<MR_PINK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I can't. You know what I heard the other day? "Heartbeat - It's Lovebeat," by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco Family. I haven't heard that since I was in fifth fuckin grade.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_PINK>
<NICE_GUY_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I was coming down here, I was playin it. And "The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on. Now I ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, I heard it a million- trillion times. I'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time I ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed Andy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICE_GUY_EDDIE>
<MR_BLUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't know Vicki Lawrence killed the guy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BLUE>
<NICE_GUY_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought the cheatin wife shot Andy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICE_GUY_EDDIE>
<MR_BLONDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They say it in the song.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BLONDE>
<NICE_GUY_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, I heard it. I musta zoned out whenever that part came on before. I thought when she said that little sister stuff, she was talkin about her sister- in-law, the cheatin wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICE_GUY_EDDIE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, she did it. She killed the cheatin wife, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<MR_PINK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know the part in "Gypsies, Tramps and Theives," when she says "Poppa woulda shot his if he knew what he'd done?" I could never figure out what he did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_PINK>

The table laughs. The WAITRESS comes over to the table. She has the check, and a pot of coffee.

<WAITRESS>

</MR_WHITE>
<DIRECTION>
Everybody laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<NICE_GUY_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't even know a Jew who'd have the balls to say that. So let's get this straight. You never ever tip?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICE_GUY_EDDIE>
<MR_WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't tip because society says I gotta. I tip when somebody deserves a tip. When somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. But this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin their job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_WHITE>
<MR_BLUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our girl was nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BLUE>
<MR_WHITE>

</NICE_GUY_EDDIE>
<MR_WRITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I ordered coffee. Now we've been here a long fuckin time, and she's only filled my cup three times. When I order coffee, I want it filled six times.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_WRITE>
<MR_BLONDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if she's too busy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BLONDE>
<MR_WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The words "too busy" shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_WHITE>
<NICE_GUY_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, Mr. White, but the last thing you need is another cup of coffee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICE_GUY_EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
They all laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These ladies aren't starvin to death. They make minimum wage. When I worked for minimum wage, I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_WHITE>
<NICE_GUY_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahh, now we're getting down to it. It's not just that he's a cheap bastard--

	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_ORANGE>
<NICE_GUY_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

<MR_BLONDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you don't care that they're counting on your tip to live?

	You don't have any idea what you're talking about. These people bust their ass. This is a hard job.

</MR_BLONDE>
<MR_WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So's working at McDonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them. They're servin ya food, you should tip em. But no, society says tip these guys over here, but not those guys over there. That's bullshit.

<MR_BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These people are taxed on the tips they make. When you stiff 'em, you cost them money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROWN>
<MR_BLONDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Waitressing is the number one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country. It's the one jab basically any woman can get, and make a living on. The reason is because of tips.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BLONDE>
<MR_WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck all that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_WHITE>
<DIRECTION>
They all laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_WHITE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I'm very sorry that the government taxes their tips. That's fucked up. But that ain't my fault. it would appear that waitresses are just one of the many groups the government fucks in the ass on a regular basis. You show me a paper says the government shouldn't do that, I'll sign it. Put it to a vote, I'll vote for it. But what I won't do is play ball. And this non- college bullshit you're telling me, I got two words for that: "Learn to fuckin type." Cause if you're expecting me to help out with the rent, you're in for a big fuckin surprise.

	You even doubt it? I don't think we got set up, I know we got set up! I mean really, seriously, where did all those cops come from, huh? One minute they're not there, the next minute they're there. I didn't hear any sirens. The alarm went off, okay. Okay, when an alarm goes off, you got an average of four minutes response time. Unless a patrol car is cruising that street, at that particular moment, you got four minutes before they can realistically respond. In one minute there were seventeen blue boys out there. All loaded for bear, all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all just there! Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars? Those were the ones responding to the alarm. but those other motherfuckers were already there, they were waiting for us.

	Well, you better start thinking about it. Cause I, sure as fuck, am thinking about it. In fact, that's all I'm thinking about. I came this close to just driving off.

You can't work with a guy like that. That mother- fucker's unstable. What do you think? Do you think he panicked, or ya think he's just trigger- happy?

But ya panic on the inside. Ya panic in your head. Ya give yourself a couple a seconds of panic, then you get a grip and deal with the situation. What you don't do, is shoot up the place and kill everybody.

They could both be dead or arrested. They could be sweatin 'em, down at the station house right now. Yeah they don't know the names, but they can sing about this place.

	Oh, you and Joe go back a long time. I known Joe since I was a kid. But me saying Joe definitely couldn't have done it is ridiculous.

They get him, they can get you, they get you, they get closer to me, and that can't happen. And you, you motherfucker, are looking at me like it's my fault. I didn't tell him my name. I didn't tell him where I was from. I didn't tell him what I knew better than to tell him. Fuck, fifteen minutes ago, you almost told me your name. You, buddy, are stuck in a situation you created.

You got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. And ya know dock workers don't do too bad. So you can move into a halfway decent place without Koons thinkin "what the fuck." And if Koons ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. That day we sent you to Tustin.

	...this was during the Los Angeles marijuana drought of '86. I still had a connection. Which was insane, 'cause you couldn't get weed anyfuckinwhere then. Anyway, I had a connection with this hippie chick up in Santa Cruz. All and my friends knew it. And they'd give me a call and say, "Hey, Freddy, you buyin some, you think you could buy me some too?" They knew I smoked, so they'd ask me to buy a little for them when I was buyin. But it got to be everytime I bought some weed, I was buyin for four or five different people. Finally I said, "Fuck this shit." I'm makin this bitch rich. She didn't have to do jack shit, she never even had to meet these people. I was fuckin doin all the work. So I got together with her and told her, "Hey, I'm sick of this shit. I'm comin through for everybody, and nobody's comin through for me. So, either I'm gonna tell all my friends to find their own source, or you give me a bunch of weed, I'll sell it to them, give you the money, minus ten percent, and I get my pot for free."

"Hey, Freddy, when's the next time you're gettin some?" "Motherfucker, I'm tryin to watch 'Lost Boys'-- when I have some, I'll let you know." And then these rinky-dink pot heads come by--there's my friends and everything, but still. I got all my shit laid out in sixty dollar bags. Well, they don't want sixty dollars worth. They want ten dollars worth. Breaking it up is a major fuckin pain in the ass. I don't even know how much ten dollars worth is. "Well, fuck, man, I don't want that much around. If I have that much around I'll smoke it." "Hey, if you guys can't control your smokin, that's not my problem. You motherfuckers been smokin for five years, be a adult about it." Finally I just told my connection, count me out. But as it turns out, I'm the best guy she had, and she depended alot on my business. But I was still sick to death of it. And she's trying to talk me into not quitin. Now this was a very weird situation, 'cause I don't know if you remember back in '86, there was a major fuckin drought. Nobody and anything. People were livin on resin and smokin the wood in their pipes for months. And this chick had a bunch, and was beggin me to sell it. So I told her I wasn't gonna be Joe the Pot Man anymore. But I would take a little bit and sell it to my close, close, close friends. She agreed to that, and said we'd keep the same arrangement as before, ten percent and free pot for me, as long as I helped her out that weekend. She had a brick of weed she was sellin, and she didn't want to go to the buy alone...

	Back in '83, got out late '86. I found something else out I think you two should be aware of. About a year and a half ago, up in Sacramento, an undercover cop, John Dolenz, worked his way into a bank job. Apparently before the job they found out he was a cop. Now picture this: It's Dolenz's birthday, a bunch of cops are waiting in his apartment for a surprise party. The door opens, everyone yells "Surprise!", and standing in the doorway is Dolenz and this other guy sticking a gun in Dolenz's ribs. Before anybody knows what's going on, this stranger shoots Dolenz dead and starts firing two .45 automatics into the crowd.

	Well, whoever she was, Elois looked like her. So one night I walk into the club, and no Elois. Now the bartender was a wetback, he was a friend of mine, his name was Carlos. So I asked him "Hey, Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?" Well apparently Lady E was married to this real piece of dog shit. I mean a real animal. And apparently he would so things to her.

	All right, let's get to know one another. With the exception of Eddie and myself, who you already know, you'll be using aliases. Under no circumstances are you to tell one another your real name or anything else about yourself. That includes where you're from, your wife's name, where you might've done time, about a bank in St. Petersburg you might've robbed. You guys don't say shit about who you are, where you been or what you've done. Only thing you guys can talk about is what you're going to do. This way the only ones who know who the members of the team are are Eddie and myself. And that's the way I like it. Because in the unlikely event of one of you getting apprehended by the cops, not that I expect that to happen - it most definitely should not happen - it hasn't happened, you don't have anything to deal with. You don't know any names. You know my name, you know Eddie's name. That I don't care about. You gotta prove it. I ain't worried. Besides, this way you gotta trust me. I like that. I set this up and picked the men I wanted for it. None of you came to me, I approached all of you. I know you. I know your work, I know your reputation. I know you as men. Except for this guy.

But give her a look, like you're gonna smash her in the face next. Watch her shut the fuck up. Now if it's a manager, that's a different story. The managers know better than to fuck around. So if one's givin you static, he probably thinks he's a real cowboy. So what you gotta do is break that son-of-a- bitch in two. If you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers. The little one. Then you tell 'im his thumb's next. After that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies underwear. I'm hungry, let's get a taco.

So, Mr. Orange, you're tellin me this very good friend of mine, who did four years for my father, who in four years never made a deal, no matter what they dangled in front of him, you're telling me that now, that now this man is free, and we're making good on our commitment to him, he's just gonna decide, right out of the fuckin blue, to rip us off?
