	The dress she was wearing had been altered to fit her. I noticed a different colored thread where the dress had been taken in. It wasn't her dress or she must have lost some weight.

Carl walks away towards his trailer. Desmond walks over and around Cliff's red trailer. He gets a strange feeling. He looks past Teresa's trailer to the edge of the trailer park, where he sees a HAND appear in the window of a trailer. Then the hand disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Desmond walks to that trailer. He knocks on the door but no one answers. He looks under the trailer and sees a _mound_of_dirt_with_ _a_small_indentation_at_the_top_. In the indentation is _Teresa_ _Bank's_ring_. As he reaches out and touches it, _he_disappears_.

Not only has Agent Chester Desmond disappeared but this is one of Cole's Blue Rose cases. The clues that were found by Agent Desmond and Agent Stanley have lead to dead ends.

</JOSIE>
<TRUMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw a guy eat a fish eye once in Seattle. He was digging through his food with his chopsticks for about five minutes till he found the fish eye and he dropped it into his throat. I guess it must have gotten stuck in his uvula because right away he started to have trouble. His throat began to flutter there like there was a wind blowing. And he couldn't swallow and they rushed to him and loosened his collar and they were asking him if he was alright and he started to turn blue and his eyes started to roll back into his head and he still couldn't get the fish eye out and they tried to do a Heimlich maneuver. I went over to him as they were preparing to do an emergency tracheotomy. They were over him with a knife when he suddenly shot the fish eye out of his throat and right onto the ceiling. Splat! It just stuck up there and spread out. It was about the size of a half dollar. And that's why I don't ever eat fish eyes.

He plays the guitar for Josie. Then stops.

<TRUMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(continued)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not saying it's right or wrong, it's just the way I feel. It's the custom thing I was thinking of. In America we don't use any part of the fish but the meat just to the side of the insides. We throw away the tail, the rest of the insides and the head.

</TRUMAN>
<JOSIE>
