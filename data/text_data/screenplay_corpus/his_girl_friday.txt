CAMERA PULLS BACK to disclose the rest of the anteroom. To Camera left are the elevators -- at back wall directly behind switchboard are chairs and a table for visitors. Next to switchboard are stairs leading downward to the next floor. A waist-high iron grill with a gate in it separates the switchboard from the anteroom, a similar grill separating it again from the city room which stretches on beyond switchboard. At a table in the switchboard enclosure sits an office boy, about fifteen, doing a crossword puzzle. The big clock on the back wall shows that it is nearly one o'clock.

<DIRECTION>
TRUCKING SHOT - HILDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she walks the length of the City Room. It's a long walk, because it's a room that takes up practically the whole floor. The scene is a busy one. But, gradually, as Hildy starts down, one after another recognize her. There are cries of: "Hildy!" "Hello, Hildy", etc., from the men as Hildy goes straight down the aisle. She never stops but waves her own greetings: "Jim!" "Hi, good-looking!" "Laura" "Hullo, Pop" "Nan!" "Eddie!" "Hello, Mac" "Pete!" "Frank" "Oscar!", and gets responses from each of them. One man is bent over his desk reading his copy -- he is standing up. Hildy slaps him as she goes by. He turns around: "Say, who did that?" As he sees Hildy: "Hello, Hildy!" Hildy: "Hi, Jake." She passes a middle-aged woman, almost an Edna May Oliver type, seated at a desk pounding out copy and smoking a cigarette. As Hildy comes up to her she slaps the woman on the back.

	Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.

Burns into phone:

<HILDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dead?

CLOSE SHOT BURNS AND HILDY
</DIRECTION>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?

	It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.

	Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<HILDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<HILDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.

Reporters conversing. They stop as Hildy and Burns enter scene.

TRUCKING SHOT

	Have Duffy call me in the restaurant in twenty minutes.

Hildy, a little out of breath, catches up with him. At the iron gate that opens into anteroom Hildy jumps ahead, opens the gate and holds it for Burns.

INT. ANTEROOM MED. SHOT

<DIRECTION>
as Hildy follows Burns in. Bruce is sitting on the bench. On the end of a bench sits an old, grizzled Western Union "boy". Ignoring Bruce, Burns strides over to the "boy", seizes his hand, shakes it and says:
</DIRECTION>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can see right away my wife picked out the right husband for herself.

Hildy behind him. Bruce registers amazement at this.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.

	Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.

<DIRECTION>
(crestfallen)

	Milk?

	Yes.

ANOTHER ANGLE - THE TRIO AT TABLE

Burns surveys the others quizzically.

<BURNS>
<DIRECTION>
(a sigh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUCE>
<BURNS>
<DIRECTION>
(it's the Puritan in him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Taking the train today -- and being married tomorrow?

</BURNS>
<DIRECTION>
He whistles.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUCE>

	Oh, it isn't like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUCE>
<HILDY>
<DIRECTION>
(reassuring Mrs. Grundy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mother? But your mother --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. My mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUCE>
<BURNS>
<DIRECTION>
(he gets it and underlines it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Your mother -- well, of course, that relieves my mind.

</BURNS>
<HILDY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Bruce)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't it sweet of Walter -- still wanting to protect me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<DIRECTION>
She gives Burns that too-sweet look.
</DIRECTION>
<BURNS>
<DIRECTION>
(apparently taking this at face value)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.

TWO SHOT - FEATURING BRUCE AND HILDY
</DIRECTION>
<BRUCE>
<DIRECTION>
(a little cookily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUCE>
<DIRECTION>
He pats Hildy's arm -- she smiles at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREE SHOT - HILDY, BRUCE AND BURNS
</DIRECTION>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<HILDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, I'm glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things I couldn't give her. You know, Hildy is about the best reporter in the country -- and that goes regardless of sex. But all she really ever wanted was a home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'll try to give her one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUCE>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just for the first year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUCE>
<BURNS>
<DIRECTION>
(sighing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<DIRECTION>
That "ow" is sotto voce, but it's the direct result of a kick under the table from Hildy.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUCE>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I know...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he chuckles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<DIRECTION>
His laugh stops cold and he clutches for his shin again. Hildy just looks. Providentially, the waiter enters the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, here we are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<DIRECTION>
He begins serving them.
</DIRECTION>
<BURNS>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to pick up again after a second)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's business, Bruce?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUCE>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't blame them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<DIRECTION>
Gus, who has just managed to come between Hildy and Burns, lets out a startled "ouch".
</DIRECTION>
<HILDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must have slipped.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<GUS>
<DIRECTION>
(a pained expression belies his words)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUCE>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see what you mean.

<BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've forgotten my milk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUCE>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. The milk. Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<DIRECTION>
He leaves scene, shaking his head. Burns sips his coffee. He likes it. He lifts his cup to Hildy.
</DIRECTION>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<HILDY>

<BUS_BOY>

</BUS_BOY>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>

Boy goes, Burns rises, starts off, comes back for his cup of coffee, which he then takes off with him.

TWO SHOT - BRUCE AND HILDY
</DIRECTION>
<BRUCE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking after him)

	You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.

</BRUCE>
<HILDY>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at him maternally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUCE>
<HILDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<BRUCE>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUCE>
<HILDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.

INT. PHONE BOOTH FULL SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burns is listening, has coffee on ledge and sips it now and then.
</DIRECTION>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get this -- get Sweeney off that yarn and out of town on a two weeks' vacation -- and right away... All right, Duffy, keep your shirt on. Hildy's coming back... No. She doesn't know it yet. But she'll be there. I promise you, Duffy. And tell Louie to stick around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up, smiles, and finishes the coffee. Then he girds himself for being crushed. He gradually begins to look sunk. He pulls out a small mirror to study his expression till he finally gets what he wants. He holds that expression as he comes out of the booth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RESTAURANT MED. SHOT AT TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gus is entering the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your milk, sir.

</GUS>
<DIRECTION>
He serves Bruce.
</DIRECTION>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I brought you another cup of coffee, Hildy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<DIRECTION>
Gus serves her and puts still another cup in front of Burns' chair.
</DIRECTION>
<HILDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Gus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a sip and almost chokes.

	Too hot?

	No. It's strong.

Gus goes, smiling.

	<DIALOGUE>
	He certainly -- hic -- does!

Burns comes into scene, looking like a 1929 banker just before jumping off a roof, and sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything the matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUCE>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<HILDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him.

	I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.

(sipping hers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said it.

<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUCE>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<HILDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<HILDY>
<DIRECTION>
(for Bruce's benefit)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.

</HILDY>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure Williams is not all there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUCE>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.

<HILDY_S_VOICE>

	Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We could take the six o'clock train, Hildy. If it would save a man's life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUCE>
<HILDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --

	Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!

	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<DIRECTION>
Bruce gulps.
</DIRECTION>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!

</BURNS>

	What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!

<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<HILDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<HILDY>

	I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.

</HILDY>
<BURNS>

(laughs, throws up his hands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.

	We're not interested.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<BURNS>
<DIRECTION>
(to Bruce)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young man. You let Hildy do this story for me and you can write out a $100,000.00 insurance policy for me. What do you say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUCE>
<HILDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUCE>
<HILDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUCE>
<HILDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could get a company doctor in twenty minutes.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.

	What tricks would I pull?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<HILDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About twenty-five hundred dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?

	<DIALOGUE>
	No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.

MED. SHOT REPORTERS

They are all talking at once as Hildy comes into the scene. There are ad libs of "Hildy!" "Where'd you come from?" "Holy Mackeral, Hildy Johnson!", etc. Hildy raises her hand for silence.
</DIRECTION>
<HILDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One at a time, boys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<DIRECTION>
She enters to a desk, places her bag on top of the desk, takes her hat off and hangs it on a clothes tree in the corner, comes back to desk and opens the travelling bag. All through the above action she is talking rapidly.
</DIRECTION>
<HILDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm not back for good. I'm just covering the Earl Williams story for Mr. Sweeney who had a sudden attack of something but will be all right by tomorrow. No, I haven't made up with Walter Burns -- far from it! As a matter of fact, I'm leaving tonight for Albany and I'll be married tomorrow morning. The lucky man is Mr. Bruce Baldwin, a gentleman in the insurance business -- and when I say gentleman, I mean gentleman! Are there any other questions?
	</DIALOGUE>

	If you ask us, no. If you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes.

<MCCUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a simple story. Earl Williams works for the E.J. McClosky Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. He starts in at twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty. A year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his job.

	Well -- Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into hiding.

Somebody sends out a tip that this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman, Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.

	Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.

INT. COUNTY JAIL MED. CLOSE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
at the door of Earl Williams' cell. Hildy sits on a stool at the door, pencil and copy paper in hand. Earl Williams sits at the edge of his cot, facing Hildy. There is a bouquet of roses in a water pitcher by the cot. Our first impression of Williams is that he's a rational, well-poised citizen. It is only under Hildy's questioning that he gradually reveals himself.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<WILLIAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAMS>
<HILDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are your beliefs, Earl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<WILLIAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAMS>
<HILDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<WILLIAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAMS>
<HILDY>
<DIRECTION>
(writing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<WILLIAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?

	Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?

	Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies.

<MAYOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?

</MAYOR>
<HARTMAN>

	I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.

	What do you mean -- through?

</HARTMAN>
<MAYOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.

</MAYOR>
<HARTMAN>

	I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.

He hangs up.

Sheriff winces.

	Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --

</HARTMAN>
<MAYOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYOR>
<HARTMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.

Sheriff opens the door. A small, very colorless and ineffectual man named Pinkus is there.

</MAYOR>
<DIRECTION>
Getting his bearings.

<HARTMAN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!

The Sheriff, with shaking hands, opens and begins to read the thing.

	You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PINKUS>
<MAYOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!

Pinkus is a little startled; the Mayor hastens to adopt a milder manner.

<MAYOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?

He pushes money into Pinkus's hand and pushes him through the door. Pinkus goes.

</LOUIS>
<HILDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!

Hildy stops short, arrested by a sound from the open window. She turns and sees Earl Williams, looking more inoffensive and exhausted than ever, indeed on the verge of collapse. He carries a large revolver. The search-lights that have been playing in the courtyard strike into the windows again.

He advances steadily toward Hildy, the gun aimed at her.

<HILDY>

Hildy stops.

<WILLIAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.

</WILLIAMS>
<HILDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<WILLIAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be let alone.

Hildy sneaks another step forward.

He drops the gun and clutches at the edge of the desk for support. Hildy lurches forward and she grabs the other side of the desk for support. And at this moment she looks more tired than he does. She looks at Earl and breathes heavily.
</DIRECTION>
<HILDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Earl, you must never do that again.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you?

</WILLIAMS>
<HILDY>

</WILLIAMS>
<DIRECTION>
He abruptly crumples and falls to the floor. Hildy stands for a second, desperate. Then she picks him up and half carries, half drags him over toward a chair and places him in it. Then she makes a quick dash for her phone.

	We've certainly been in some swell jams.

<HILDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?

	Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
	</DIALOGUE>

<HILDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --

	It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.

	Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.

</HILDY>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURNS>
<HILDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HILDY>
<BURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
