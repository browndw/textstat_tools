INT. COFFEE SHOP - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles. It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed, there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching on bacon and eating eggs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and, like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're going out of style.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or how old she is; everything she does contradicts something she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is to be said in a rapid-pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm through doin' that shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You always say that, the same thing every time: never again, I'm through, too dangerous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know that's what I always say. I'm always right too, but --
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- but you forget about it in a day or two --
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- yeah, well, the days of me forgittin' are over, and the days of me rememberin' have just begun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you go on like this, you know what you sound like?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sound like a sensible fucking man, is what I sound like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sound like a duck.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(imitates a duck)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack...
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well take heart, 'cause you're never gonna hafta hear it again. Because since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna hafta hear me quack about how I'm never gonna do it again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in there, back and forth.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(with a smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Correct. I got all tonight to quack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I get anybody anymore coffee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes, thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man lights up another cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm doin' fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his smoke. The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Young Man goes right back into it.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean the way it is now, you're takin' the same fuckin' risk as when you rob a bank. You take more of a risk. Banks are easier! Federal banks aren't supposed to stop you anyway, during a robbery. They're insured, why should they care? You don't even need a gun in a federal bank. I heard about this guy, walked into a federal bank with a portable phone, handed the phone to the teller, the guy on the other end of the phone said: "We got this guy's little girl, and if you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill 'er."
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did it work?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, cleans the place out, and they don't lift a fuckin' finger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did they hurt the little girl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. There probably never was a little girl -- the point of the story isn't the little girl. The point of the story is they robbed the bank with a telephone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanna rob banks?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, I'm just illustrating that if we did, it would be easier than what we been doin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you don't want to be a bank robber?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naw, all those guys are goin' down the same road, either dead or servin' twenty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And no more liquor stores?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have we been talking about? Yeah, no-more-liquor-stores. Besides, it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too many foreigners own liquor stores. Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em: "Empty out the register," and they don't know what it fuckin' means. They make it too personal. We keep on, one of those gook motherfuckers' gonna make us kill 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not gonna kill anybody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't wanna kill anybody either. But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us of them. And if it's not the gooks, it these old Jews who've owned the store for fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try walkin' into one of those stores with nothin' but a telephone, see how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget it, we're out of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what else is there, day jobs?
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>

<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well what then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He calls to the Waitress.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Garcon! Coffee!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Then looks to his girl.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This place.

<DIRECTION>
The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	"Garcon" means boy.

</WAITRESS>
<DIRECTION>
She splits.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here? It's a coffee shop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong with that? People never rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor stores, gas stations, you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them. Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down. They're not expecting to get robbed, or not as expecting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(taking to idea)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bet in places like this you could cut down on the hero factor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Correct. Just like banks, these places are insured. The managers don't give a fuck, they're just tryin' to get ya out the door before you start pluggin' diners. Waitresses, forget it, they ain't takin' a bullet for the register. Busboys, some wetback gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour gonna really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner. Customers are sittin' there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's goin' on. One minute they're havin' a Denver omelette, next minute somebody's stickin' a gun in their face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man continues in a low voice.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, I got the idea last liquor store we stuck up. 'Member all those customers kept comin' in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They you got the idea to take everybody's wallet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was a good idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We made more from the wallets then we did the register.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes we did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<YOUNG_MAN>

</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty smart, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new information. She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The tires WAITRESS, taking orders. The BUSBOYS going through the motions, collecting dishes. The MANAGER complaining to the COOK about something. A smiles breaks out on the Young Woman's face.

And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons, stand up and rob the restaurant. Pumpkin's robbery persona is that of the in-control professional. Honey Bunny's is that of the psychopathic, hair-triggered, loose cannon.

INT. '74 CHEVY (MOVING) - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An old gas guzzling, dirty, white 1974 Chevy Nova BARRELS down a homeless-ridden street in Hollywood. In the front seat are two young fellas -- one white, one black -- both wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long green dusters. Their names are VINCENT VEGA (white) and JULES WINNFIELD (black). Jules is behind the wheel.

	What so you want to know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<JULES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, hash is legal there, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULES>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it's legal, but is ain't a hundred percent legal. I mean you can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint, and start puffin' away. You're only supposed to smoke in your home or certain designated places.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<JULES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those are hash bars?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULES>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it breaks down like this: it's legal to buy it, it's legal to own it and, if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it. It's legal to carry it, which doesn't really matter 'cause -- get a load of this -- if the cops stop you, it's illegal for this to search you. Searching you is a right that the cops in Amsterdam don't have.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Well, the way they pick the shows on TV is they make one show, and that show's called a pilot. And they show that one show to the people who pick the shows, and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they want to make more shows. Some get accepted and become TV programs, and some don't, and become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.

	Look, just because I wouldn't give no man a foot massage, don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a building into a glass- motherfuckin-house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. That ain't right, man. Motherfucker do that to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I'd kill'a motherfucker.

	I'm not sayin' he was right, but you're sayin' a foot massage don't mean nothing, and I'm sayin' it does. I've given a million ladies a million foot massages and they all meant somethin'. We act like they don't, but they do. That's what's so fuckin' cool about 'em. This sensual thing's goin' on that nobody's talkin about, but you know it and she knows it, fuckin' Marsellus knew it, and Antwan shoulda known fuckin' better. That's his fuckin' wife, man.

Vince smiles to himself. Jules has got style.

Brett has just shit his pants. He's not crying or whimpering, but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding.

	There's a passage I got memorized, seems appropriate for this situation: Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you."

EXT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the past six years, 50's diners have sprung up all over LA, giving Thai restaurants a run for their money. They're all basically the same. Decor out of an "Archie" comic book, Golden Oldies constantly emanating from a bubbly Wurlitzer, saucy waitresses in bobby socks, menus with items like the Fats Domino Cheeseburger, or the Wolfman Jack Omelette, and over prices that pay for all this bullshit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But then there's JACKRABBIT SLIM'S, the big mama of 50's diners. Either the best or the worst, depending on your point of view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent's Malibu pulls up to the restaurant. A big sign with a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a red windbreaker towers over the establishment. Underneath the cartoon is the name: JACKRABBIT SLIM'S. Underneath that is the slogan: "Next best thing to a time machine."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JACKRABBIT SLIM'S - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Compared to the interior, the exterior was that of a quaint English pub. Posters from 50's A.I.P. movies are all over the wall ("ROCK ALL NIGHT," "HIGH SCHOOL CONFIDENTIAL," "ATTACK OF THE CRAB MONSTER," and "MACHINE GUN KELLY"). The booths that the patrons sit in are made out of the cut up bodies of 50s cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the middle of the restaurant in a dance floor. A big sign on the wall states, "No shoes allowed." So wannabe beboppers (actually Melrose-types), do the twist in their socks or barefeet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The picture windows don't look out the street, but instead, B & W movies of 50's street scenes play behind them. The WAITRESSES and WAITERS are made up as replicas of 50's icons: MARILYN MONROE, ZORRO, JAMES DEAN, DONNA REED, MARTIN and LEWIS, and THE PHILIP MORRIS MIDGET, wait on tables wearing appropriate costumes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent and Mia study the menu in a booth made out of a red '59 Edsel. BUDDY HOLLY (their waiter), comes over, sporting a big button on his chest that says: "Hi I'm Buddy, pleasing you please me."

As this time, the SOUND of a subway car fills the diner, making everything SHAKE and RATTLE. Marilyn Monroe runs to a square vent in the floor. An imaginary subway train BLOWS the skirt of her white dress around her ears as she lets out a squeal. The entire restaurant applauds.

<MIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was show about a team of female secret agents called "Fox Force Five."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIA>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<MIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Fox Force Five." Fox, as in we're a bunch of foxy chicks. Force, as in we're a force to be reckoned with. Five, as in there's one..two ..three..four..five of us. There was a blonde one, Sommerset O'Neal from that show "Baton Rouge," she was the leader. A Japanese one, a black one, a French one and a brunette one, me. We all had special skills. Sommerset had a photographic memory, the Japanese fox was a kung fu master, the black girl was a demolition expert, the French fox' specialty was sex...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIA>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was your specialty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<MIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Knives. The character I played, Raven McCoy, her background was she was raised by circus performers. So she grew up doing a knife act. According to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife. But because she grew up in a circus, she was also something of an acrobat. She could do illusions, she was a trapeze artist -- when you're keeping the world safe from evil, you never know when being a trapeze artist's gonna come in handy. And she knew a zillion old jokes her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her. If we woulda got picked up, they woulda worked in a gimmick where every episode I woulda told and ol joke.

	Oooohhhh, this doesn't sound like mindless, boring, getting-to-know- you chit-chat. This sounds like you actually have something to say.

	Only if you promise not to get offended.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<MIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't promise something like that. I have no idea what you're gonna ask. You could ask me what you're gonna ask me, and my natural response could be to be offended. Then, through no fault of my own, I woulda broken my promise.
	</DIALOGUE>

<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>

<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Marsellus throwing Tony out of a four-story window for giving me a foot massage seemed reasonable?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIA>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it seemed excessive. But that doesn't mean it didn't happen. I heard Marsellus is very protective of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<MIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A husband being protective of his wife is one thing. A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else.

	<DIALOGUE>
	But did it happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<MIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand, when he shook it. I met Anwan once -- at my wedding -- then never again. The truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus tossed Tony Rocky Horror out of that window except Marsellus and Tony Rocky Horror. But when you scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle.

Vincent smiles and begins taking off his boots. Mia triumphantly casts hers off. He takes her hand, escorting her to the dance floor. The two face each other for that brief moment before you begin to dance, than they both break into a devilish twist. Mia's version of the twist is that of a sexy cat. Vincent is pure Mr. Cool as he gets into a hip- swivelling rhythm that would make Mr. Checker proud.
</DIRECTION>

The OTHER DANCERS on the floor are trying to do the same thing, but Vincent and Mia seem to be strangely shaking their asses in sync. The two definitely share a rhythm and share smiles as they SING ALONG with the last verse of the Golden Oldie.

Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs and selects one: k.d. lang. The speakers BLAST OUT a high energy country number, which Mia plays air-guitar to. She dances her way around the room and finds herself by Vincent's overcoat hanging on the rack. She touches its sleeve. It feels good.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch. Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, licks the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Maybe a little too fat, but not bad for a first try. Mia thinks so anyway. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg, trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up, then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance. Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her face.

We follow behind Vincent as he walks from the bathroom to the living room, where he finds Mia lying on the floor like a rag doll. She's twisted on her back. Blood and puke are down her front.

Vincent SPRINGS up and RUNS to his overcoat, hanging on the rack. He goes through the pockets FRANTICALLY. It's gone. Vincent makes a beeline to Mia. We follow.

	This watch I got here was first purchased by your great-granddaddy. It was bought during the First World War in a little general store in Knoxville, Tennessee. It was bought by private Doughboy Ernie Coolidge the day he set sail for Paris. It was your great- granddaddy's war watch, made by the first company to ever make wrist watches. You see, up until then, people just carried pocket watches. Your great-granddaddy wore that watch every day he was in the war. Then when he had done his duty, he went home to your great- grandmother, took the watch off his wrist and put it in an ol' coffee can. And in that can it stayed 'til your grandfather Dane Coolidge was called upon by his country to go overseas and fight the Germans once again. This time they called it World War Two. Your great-granddaddy gave it to your granddad for good luck. Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's. Your granddad was a Marine and he was killed with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake Island. Your granddad was facing death and he knew it. None of those boys had any illusions about ever leavin' that island alive. So three days before the Japanese took the island, your 22-year old grandfather asked a gunner on an Air Force transport named Winocki, a man he had never met before in his life, to deliver to his infant son, who he had never seen in the flesh, his gold watch. Three days later, your grandfather was dead. But Winocki kept his word. After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother, delivering to your infant father, his Dad's gold watch. This watch. This watch was on your Daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi. He was captured and put in a Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew if the gooks ever saw the watch it's be confiscated. The way your Daddy looked at it, that watch was your birthright. And he'd be damned if and slopeheads were gonna put their greasy yella hands on his boy's birthright. So he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide somethin'. His ass. Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. Then when he died of disentary, he gave me the watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass for two years. Then, after seven years, I was sent home to my family. And now, little man, I give the watch to you.

The 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia: trunks, shoes and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few zzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as WE CUT to him, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory, he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a little, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to be breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway.

<KLONDIKE>

	It's time, Butch.

</KLONDIKE>
<BUTCH>

	I'm ready.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
Klondike steps inside, closing the door on the WILD MOB outside. He goes to the long yellow robe hanging on a hook. Butch hops off the table and, without a word, Klondike helps him on with the robe, which says on the back: "BATTLING BUTCH COOLIDGE."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two men head for the door. Klondike opens the door for Butch. As Butch steps into the hallway, the Crowd goes apeshit. Klondike closes the door behind him, leaving us in the quiet, empty locker room.

Esmarelda shuts off the radio.

She takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in the alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A window about three stories high opens on the auditorium-side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage dumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to the dumpster below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gym bag in hand, Butch CLIMBS out of the dumpster and RUNS to the taxi. Before he climbs in, he takes off his robe and throws it to the ground.

INT. TAXI (PARKED/RAINING) - NIGHT

Butch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves, HOPS in the backseat, SLAMMING the door.

<DIRECTION>
Locker room door opens, English Dave fights his way through the pandemonium which is going on outside in the hall, shutting the door on the madness. Once inside, English Dave takes time to adjust his suit and tie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the room, black boxer FLOYD RAY WILLIS lies on a table -- dead. His face looks like he went dunking for bees. His TRAINER is on his knees, head on Floyd's chest, crying over the body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The huge figure that is Marsellus Wallace stands at the table, hand on the Trainer's shoulder, lending emotional support. We still do not see Marsellus clearly, only that he is big.

Esmarelda nods her head: "yes."

<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Cause I'm a boxer. And after you've said that, you've said pretty much all there is to say about me. Now maybe that son-of-a- bitch tonight was once at one time a boxer. If he was, then he was dead before his ass ever stepped in the ring. I just put the poor bastard outta his misery. And if he never was a boxer --

	Well you should be happy, 'cause you do.

</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to have a pot?

</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Pot bellies make a man look either oafish, or like a gorilla. But on a woman, a pot belly is very sexy. The rest of you is normal. Normal face, normal legs, normal hips, normal ass, but with a big, perfectly round pot belly. If I had one, I'd wear a tee-shirt two sizes too small to accentuate it.

</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think guys would find that attractive?

Same motel room, except empty. WE HEAR THE SHOWER RUNNING in the bathroom. The CAMERA MOVES to the bathroom doorway. We see Fabian in a white terry cloth robe that seems to swallow her up. She's drying her head with a towel. Butch is inside the shower washing up. We see the outline of his naked body through the smoky glass of the shower door. Steam fills the bathroom. Butch turns the shower off and opens the door, popping his head out.

	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh I like that, I like being called a tulip. Tulip is much better than Mongoloid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban on her head.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>

<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure yet. Wherever you want. We're gonna get a lot of money from this. But it ain't gonna be so much, we can live like hogs in the fat house forever. I was thinking we could go somewhere in the South Pacific. The kinda money we'll have'll carry us a long way down there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So if we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You betcha. And if after awhile you don't dig Bora Bora, then we can move over to Tahiti or Mexico.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I do not speak Spanish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>

Fabian brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or two, then she remember something.
</DIRECTION>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Butch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only to find him sound asleep in bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She exits frame, going back in the bathroom. WE STAY on the WIDE SHOT of the unconscious Butch in bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE UP:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOTEL ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAME SHOT AS BEFORE, the next morning. We find Butch still asleep in bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fabian brushes her teeth half in and half out of the bathroom so she can watch TV at the same time. She still wears the terry cloth robe from the night before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TV: WILLIAM SMITH and a bunch of Hell's Angels are taking on the entire Vietnamese army in the film "THE LOSERS."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing him. His start startles Fabian.
</DIRECTION>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merde! You startled me. Did you have a bad dream?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to focus.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...yeah...are you still brushing your teeth?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is me. I brush my teeth all night long and into the early morning. Do you think I have a problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Fabian goes back into the bathroom to spit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
If that was supposed to be sarcasm, it was lost on Butch at this early hour.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on TV Hell's Angels tear-assin' through a Vietnamese prison camp.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you watching?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A motorcycle movie, I'm not sure the name.

</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
Fabian enters the room.
</DIRECTION>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a way. Why? Would you like for me to switch it off?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches over and turns off the TV.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a little too early in the morning for explosions and war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was it about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How should I know, you were the one watchin' it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
Fabian laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, imbecile, what was your dream about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I...don't remember. It's really rare I remember a dream.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just woke up from it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fabian, I'm not lying to you, I don't remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, let's look at the grumpy man in the morning. I didn't say you were lying, it's just odd you don't remember your dreams. I always remember mine. Did you know you talk in your sleep?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't talk in my sleep, do I talk in my sleep?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>

</BUTCH>

Laying on top of him.
</DIRECTION>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I couldn't understand you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses Butch.
</DIRECTION>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you get up and we'll get some breakfast at that breakfast place with the pancakes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One more kiss and I'll get up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
Fabian gives Butch a sweet long kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Satisfied?

</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yep.

</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then get up, lazy bones.

</FABIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of the suitcase that Fabian brought.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What time is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Almost nine in the morning. What time does our train arrive?

</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eleven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing him looking at a pair of pants.
</DIRECTION>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those pants are very nice. Can you wear those with that nice blue shirt you have?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls a blue shirt of the suitcase.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the one. That matches.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
He puts the cloths on.
</DIRECTION>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna order a big plate of blueberry pancakes with maple syrup, eggs over easy, and five sausages.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised at her potential appetite)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything to drink with that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
Butch is finished dressing.
</DIRECTION>
<FABIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(referring to his clothes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes, that looks nice. To drink, a tall glass or orange juice and a black cup of coffee. After that, I'm going to have a slice of pie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<DIRECTION>
As he goes through the suitcase.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pie for breakfast?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any time of the day is a good time for pie. Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes. And on top, a thin slice of melted cheese --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- where's my watch?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's not. It's not here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you looked?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<DIRECTION>
By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes I've fuckin' looked!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
He's now throwing clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck do you think I'm doing?! Are you sure you got it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
Fabian can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way.
</DIRECTION>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uhhh...yes...beside the table drawer --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- on the little kangaroo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, it was on your little kangaroo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well it's not here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(on the verge of tears)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well it should be!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh it most definitely should be here, but it's not. So where is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
Fabian is crying and scared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more menacing.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fabian, that was my father's fuckin' watch. You know what my father went through to git me that watch?...I don't wanna get into it right now...but he went through a lot. Now all this other shit, you coulda set on fire, but I specifically reminded you not to forget my father's watch. Now think, did you get it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe so....
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You believe so? You either did, or you didn't, now which one is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Butch freaks out, he punches the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fabian SCREAMS and backs into a corner,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch picks up the motel TV and THROWS IT AGAINST the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fabian SCREAMS IN HORROR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch looks toward her, suddenly calm.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
(to Fabian)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! It's not your fault.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he approached her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You left it at the apartment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He touches her hand, she flinches.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you did leave it at the apartment, it's not your fault. I had you bring a bunch of stuff. I reminded you about it, but I didn't illustrate how personal the watch was to me. If all I gave a fuck about was my watch, I should've told you. You ain't a mind reader.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her hand. Then rises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fabian is still sniffling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch goes to the closet.
</DIRECTION>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Butch puts on his high school jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be. It just means I won't be able to eat breakfast with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why does it mean that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I'm going back to my apartment to get my watch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Won't the gangsters be looking for you there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I'm gonna find out. If they are, and I don't think I can handle it, I'll split.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
Rising from the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My darling, I don't want you to be murdered over a silly watch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One, it's not a silly watch. Two, I'm not gonna be murdered. And three, don't be scared. I won't let anything get in the way of us living a happy life together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
Butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't feel bad, sugar pop. Nothing you could ever do would make me permanently angry at you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you, remember?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he digs some money out of his wallet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now here's some money, order those pancakes and have a great breakfast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be back before you can say, blueberry pie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blueberry pie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well maybe not that fast, but fast. Okay? Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her once more and heads for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bye-bye, sugar pop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna take your Honda.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<FABIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FABIAN>
<DIRECTION>
And with that, he's out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fabian sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.

INT. HONDA (MOVING) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch is beating the steering wheel and the dash with his fists as he drives down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of all the fuckin' things she coulda forgot, she forgets my father's watch. I specifically reminded her not to forget it. "Bedside table -- on the kangaroo." I said the words: "Don't forget my father's watch."
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as its little engine will take it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HONDA (MOVING) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch continues:
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck am I doin'? Have I taken one too many hits to the head? That's gotta be it. Brain damage is the only excuse for this dumb a move. Stop the car, Butch.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he keeps on driving)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop the car, Butch.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he pays no attention to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Butch, I'm talkin' to you. Put- your-foot-on-the-break!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
Butch's foot SLAMS down hard on the break.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The little Honda SKIDS to a stop in the middle of the street. Butch HOPS out of the car like it was on fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch begins PACING back and forth, talking to himself, oblivious to PASSERSBY and traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ain't gonna do this. This is a punchy move and I ain't punchy! Daddy would totally fuckin' understand. If he was here right now, he'd say, "Butch, git a grip. It's a fuckin' watch, man. You lose one, ya git another. This is your life you're fuckin' around with, which you shouldn't be doin' 'cause you only got one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
Butch continues to pace, but now he's silent. Then....
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is my war. You see, Butch, what you're forgettin' is this watch isn't just a device that enables you to keep track of time. This watch is a symbol. It's a symbol of how your father, and his father before him, and his father before him, distinguished themselves in war. And when I took Marsellus Wallace's money, I started a war. This is my World War Two. That apartment in North Hollywood, that's my Wake Island. In fact, if you look at it that way, it's almost kismet that Fabian left it behind. And using that perspective, going back for it isn't stupid. It may be dangerous, but it's not stupid. Because there are certain things in this world that are worth going back for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
That's it, Butch has talked himself into it again. He HOPS in the car, starts it up and TAKES OFF.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A parking meter red flag rises up, then out, leaving the arrow pointing at one hour.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET CORNER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch isn't completely reckless. He has parked his car a couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before he goes boppin' through the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street, then he discreetly glances out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - BUTCH'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of place. None of them have a couple of goons sitting inside. Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of Butch's home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything looks hunky dorie. Looks can be deceiving, but this time I don't think they are. Why waste the manpower to stake out my place. I'd have to be a fuckin' idiot to come back here. That's how you're gonna beat 'em Butch, they keep underestimating you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the street from Butch's building, on the corner, is a combination donut shop and Japanese restaurant. A big sign sticks up in the air, with the name "Teriyaki Donut" and a graphic of a donut sticking out of a bowl of rice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT COURTYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment building. Once again, everything appears normal -- the laundry room, the pool, his apartment door -- nothing appears disturbed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12. He steps outside the door and listens inside. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His apartment hasn't been touched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick look around. Obviously, no one is there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the refrigerator. He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he goes to the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment -- neat, clean and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue of "Ring Magazine" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: on the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and puts them in the toaster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponary and examines it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then...a toilet FLUSHES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to the kitchen. There is someone behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not knowing what to do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book "MODESTY BLAISE" by Peter O'Donnell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent and Butch lock eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neither man opens his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then...the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That's all the situation needed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch's finger HITS the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets SIMULTANEOUSLY -- LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door at the end of the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent is annihilated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61 back on the kitchen counter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he exits the apartment, quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the courtyard....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...goes through the alley....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HONDA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide smile of a survivor breaks across his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his apartment building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HONDA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch looks out the window at his former home.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's how you're gonna beat 'em, Butch. They keep underestimatin' ya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he SINGS along with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on the corner across from Teriyaki Donut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD the big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut, carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street in front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see Marsellus clearly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances to his left, sees Butch, continues walking...then STOPS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOUBLE-TAKE: "Am I really seeing what I'm seeing?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch doesn't wait for the big man to answer his own question. He STOMPS on the gas pedal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending it up on the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what at one time was Fabian's Honda. Blood flows from his nostrils. The still-functional tape player continues to play. A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside.
</DIRECTION>
<PEDESTRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, are you okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEDESTRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Butch look at him, spaced-out.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS gather around the body.
</DIRECTION>
<GAWKER_1>
<DIRECTION>
(to the others)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's dead! He's dead!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAWKER_1>
<DIRECTION>
This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO PEDESTRIANS help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woozy Marsellus gets to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<GAWKER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you need a witness in court, I'll be glad to help. He was a drunken maniac. He hit you and crashed into that car.
	</DIALOGUE>

(still incoherent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSELLUS>
<GAWKER_2>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing at Butch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAWKER_2>
<DIRECTION>
Marsellus follows the Gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge down the street, looking a shambles.
</DIRECTION>
<MARSELLUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'll be damned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSELLUS>
<DIRECTION>
The big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the Gawkers back away. Marsellus starts moving toward Butch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly bee-line toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sacre bleu.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
Marsellus brings up his weapon and FIRES, but he's so hurt, shaky and dazed that his arm goes wild.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He HITS a LOOKY-LOO WOMAN in the hip. She falls to the ground, screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<LOOKY_LOO_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God, I've been shot!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOOKY_LOO_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
That's all Butch needs to see. He's outta here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marsellus RUNS after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CROWD looks agape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch is in a mad, limping RUN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The big man's hot on his ass with a cockeyed wobbly run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch cuts across traffic and dashes into a business with a sign that reads "MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAYNARD, a hillbilly-lookin' boy, stands behind the counter of his pawnshop when, all of a sudden, chaos in the form of Butch RACES into his world.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I help you wit' somethin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYNARD>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, than stands next to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you just wait one goddamn minute --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus CHARGES in. He doesn't get past the doorway because Butch LANDS his fist in Marsellus' face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gangster's feet go out from under him and the big man FALLS FLAT on his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside, two police cars with their SIRENS BLARING race by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch POUNCES on the fallen body, PUNCHING him twice more in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus' hand, than grabs ahold of his middle finger.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you like chasing people, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
He BREAKS the finger. Marsellus lets out a pain sound. Butch then places the barrel of the .45 between his eyes, PULLS back the hammer and places his open hand behind the gun to shield the splatter.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well guess what, big man, you caught me --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<MAYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
(OS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- hold it right there, godammit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a pump-action shotgun, aimed at the two men.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look mister, this ain't any of your business --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<MAYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I'm makin' it my business! Now toss that gun!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
Butch does.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you on top, stand up and come to the counter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
Butch slowly gets up and moves to the counter. As soon as he gets there, Maynard HAULS OFF, HITTING him hard in the face with the butt of the shotgun, knocking Butch down and out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After Butch goes down, Maynard calmly lays the shotgun on the counter and moves to the telephone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marsellus Wallace, from his position on the floor, groggily watches the pawnshop owner dial a number. Maynard waits on the line while the other end rings. Then it picks up.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zed? It's Maynard. The spider just caught a coupl'a flies.

<DIRECTION>
INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT - BUTCH AND MARSELLUS are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are two S&M-style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and a little red ball sticks in their mouths). Both men are unconscious. Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and SPRAYS both guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two prisoners look up at their captors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus' .45 sticking in his belt.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody kills anybody in my place of business except me or Zed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
A BUZZER buzzes.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That' Zed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs that lead to red curtains and goes through them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE HEAR, on the other side of the curtains, Maynard let Zed inside the store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch and Marsellus look around the room. The basement of the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. After taking in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other, all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both share at what they've gotten themselves into.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maynard and ZED come through the curtains. Zed is an even more intense version of Maynard, if such a thing is possible. The two hillbillys are obviously brothers. Where Maynard is a vicious pitbull, Zed is a deadly cobra. Zed walks in and stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a long time, then says:
</DIRECTION>
<ZED>
<DIRECTION>
(to Maynard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said you waited for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<MAYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYNARD>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then how come they're all beat up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<MAYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They did that to each other. They was fightin' when they came in. This one was gonna shoot that one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYNARD>
<ZED>
<DIRECTION>
(to Butch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were gonna shoot him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<DIRECTION>
Butch makes no reply.
</DIRECTION>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, is Grace gonna be okay in front of this place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<MAYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it ain't Tuesday is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYNARD>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's Thursday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<MAYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then she'll be fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYNARD>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bring out The Gimp.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<MAYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think The Gimp's asleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYNARD>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I guess you'll just wake 'em up then, won't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<DIRECTION>
Maynard opens a trap door in the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling in the hole)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wake up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
Maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a leash. He gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises THE GIMP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black leather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles and studs here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth. They keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large dog.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners, then lowers into it. Maynard hands The Gimp's leash to Zed, then backs away.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
(to The Gimp)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
The Gimp gets on its knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's first?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYNARD>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ain't fer sure yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<DIRECTION>
Then with his little finger, Zed does a silent "Eenie, meany, miney, moe..." just his mouth mouthing the words and his finger going back and forth between the two.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch are Marsellus are terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maynard looks back and forth at the victims.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving left to right, then it stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT - BUTCH AND MARSELLUS after a beat, THE CAMERA MOVES to the right, zeroing in on Marsellus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zed stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wanna do it here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<MAYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naw, drag big boy to Russell's old room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
Zed grabs Marsellus' chair and DRAGS him into Russell's old room. Russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the misfortune of stumbling into the Mason-Dixie pawnshop. Whatever happened to Russell is known only to Maynard and Zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the back room, is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before he disappears behind the door of Russell's old room.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
(to The Gimp)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
The Gimp rises. Maynard ties The Gimp's leash to a hook on the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<MAYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep an eye on this one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
The Gimp bows its head: "yes." Maynard disappears into Russell's old room. There must be a stereo in there because suddenly The Judds, singing in harmony, fills the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch looks at The Gimp. The Gimp giggles from underneath the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history of comedy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From behind the door we hear country MUSIC, struggling, and:
</DIRECTION>
<MAYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
(OS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight in 'em!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
We the HEAR Maynard and Zed beat on Marsellus.
</DIRECTION>
<ZED>
<DIRECTION>
(OS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanna fight? You wanna fight? Good, I like to fight!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<DIRECTION>
Butch pauses, listens to the voices. Then, in a panic, hurriedly struggles to get free.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Gimp is laughing wildly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ropes are on too tight and Butch can't break free.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Gimp slaps his knee laughing
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the back room, we hear:
</DIRECTION>
<MAYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
(OS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it...that's it boy, you're goin' fine. Oooooooh, just like that...that's good.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(grunting faster)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay still...stay still goddamn ya! Zed goddammit, git over here and hold 'em!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
Butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. Then, quite easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it were never connected by a bolt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Gimp sees this and its eyes widen.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_GIMP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huhng?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_GIMP>
<DIRECTION>
The Gimp FLAILS WILDLY, trying to get the leash off the hook. He tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles and grunts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three BOXER'S PUNCHES to its face. The punches knock The Gimp out, making him fall to his knees, this HANGING HIMSELF by the leash attached to the hook,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch removes the ball gag, then silently makes his way through the red curtains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PAWNSHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch sneaks to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the counter is a big set of keys with a large Z connected to the ring. Grabbing them, he's about to go out when he stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their way with Marsellus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in with.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards it: not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots what he's been looking for:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Samurai sword.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the wall, next to a neon "DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER" sign. Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs. Holding the sword pointed downward, Takakura Ken-style, he disappears through the red curtains to take care of business.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PAWNSHOP BACK ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch quietly sneaks down the stairs leading to the dungeon. Sodomy and the Judds can still be heard going string behind the closed door that leads to Russell's old room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RUSSELL'S OLD ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch's hand comes into frame, pushing the door open. It swings open silently, revealing the rapists, who have switched positions. Zed is now bent over Marsellus, who is bent over a wooden horse. Maynard watches. Both have their backs to Butch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maynard faces the CAMERA, grinning, while Butch comes up behind him with the sword.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miserable, violated, and looking like a rag doll, Marsellus, red ball gag still in mouth, opens his watery eyes to see Butch coming up behind Maynard. His eyes widen.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey hillbilly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
Maynard turns and sees Butch holding the sword.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch SCREAMS...with one mighty SWING, SLASHES Maynard across the front, moving past him, eyes and blade now locked on Zed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maynard stands trembling, his front sliced open, in shock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch, while never taking his eyes off Zed, THRUSTS the sword behind him, SKEWERING Maynard, then EXTRACTS it, pointing the blade toward Zed. Maynard COLLAPSES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zed disengages from Marsellus in a hurry and his eyes go from the tip of Butch's sword to Marsellus' .45 Automatic, which lies within reach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch's eyes follow Zed's.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want that gun, Zed? Pick it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
Zed's hand inches toward the weapon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch GRIPS the sword tighter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zed studies Butch,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch looks hard at Zed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then a VOICE says:
</DIRECTION>
<MARSELLUS>
<DIRECTION>
(OS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Step aside, Butch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARSELLUS>
<DIRECTION>
Butch steps aside, REVEALING Marsellus standing behind him, holding Maynard's pump-action shotgun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABOOM!!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zed is BLASTED in the groin. Down he goes, SCREAMING in AGONY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, EJECTS the used shotgun shell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch lowers the sword and hangs back. Not a word, until:
</DIRECTION>
<BUTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<MARSELLUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naw man. I'm pretty fuckin' far from okay!

</BUTCH>
<MARSELLUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah man, we're cool. One thing I ask -- two things I ask: don't tell nobody about this. This shit's between me and you and the soon-to-be-livin'-the-rest-of-his- short-ass-life-in-agonizing-pain, Mr. Rapist here. It ain't nobody else's business. Two: leave town. Tonight. Right now.

	Go on now, get your ass outta here.

</MARSELLUS>
<DIRECTION>
Butch leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains. Marsellus walks over to a phone, dialing a number.
</DIRECTION>
<MARSELLUS>

EXT. MASON-DIXIE PAWNSHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch, still shaking in his boots, exits the pawnshop. He looks ahead and sees, parked in front of the establishment, Zed's Big Chrome Chopper with a teardrop gas tank that has the name "GRACE" on it. He climbs aboard, takes out the keys with the big Z on them and starts up the huge hog. It RUMBLES to life, making sounds like a rocket fighting for orbit. Butch twists the accelerator handle and SPEEDS off.

INT. BATHROOM - DAY

<DIRECTION>
We're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in earlier. In fact, we're there at exactly the same time. Except this time, we're in the bathroom with the FOURTH MAN. The Fourth Man is pacing around the small room, listening hard to what's being said on the other side of the door, tightly CLUTCHING his huge silver ,357 Magnum.

	"...blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shephered the weak through the valley of darkness.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JULES>
<DIRECTION>
BANG! BANG! BOOM! POW! BAM BAM BAM BAM BAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Fourth Man freaks out. He THROWS himself against the back wall, gun outstretched in front of him, a look of yellow fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough to stick their head through that door.

He SCREAM until he's dry firing. Then a look of confusion crosses his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT - JULES AND VINCENT standing next to each other, unharmed. Amazing as it seems, none of the Fourth Man's shots appear to have hit anybody. Jules and Vincent exchange looks like, "Are we hit?" They're as confused at the shooter. After looking at each other, they bring their looks up to the Fourth Man.
</DIRECTION>

The Fourth Man is taken out of the scenario by the two men's bullets who, unlike his, HIT their marks. He drops DEAD.

	Take the body, stick it in the trunk. Now Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty domesticated house. That would lead me to believe that in the garage or under the sink, you got a bunch of cleaners and cleaners and shit like that, am I correct?

<JIMMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Exactly. Under the sink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMIE>
<THE_WOLF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. What I need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products and clean the inside of the car. And I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast. You need to go in the backseat, scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull. Get it out of there. Wipe down the upholstery -- now when it comes to upholstery, it don't need to be spic and span, you don't need to eat off in. Give it a good once over. What you need to take care of are the really messy parts. The pools of blood that have collected, you gotta soak that shit up. But the windows are a different story. Them you really clean. Get the Windex, do a good job. Now Jimmie, we need to raid your linen closet. I need blankets, I need comforters, I need quilts, I need bedspreads. The thicker the better, the darker the better. No whites, can't use 'em. We need to camouflage the interior of the car. We're gonna line the front seat and the backseat and the floor boards with quilts and blankets. If a cop stops us and starts stickin' his big snout in the car, the subterfuge won't last. But at a glance, the car will appear to be normal. Jimmie -- lead the way, boys -- get to work.

	A sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie. I'll never know 'cause even if it did, I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfucker. Pigs sleep and root in shit. That's a filthy animal. I don't wanna eat nothin' that ain't got enough sense to disregard its own feces.

	Yes, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<JULES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy, but they're definitely dirty. But a dog's got personality. And personality goes a long way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULES>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So by that rationale, if a pig had a better personality, he's cease to be a filthy animal?

	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCENT>
<JULES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you see, Vince, that shit don't matter. You're judging this thing the wrong way. It's not about what. It could be God stopped the bullets, he changed Coke into Pepsi, he found my fuckin' car keys. You don't judge shit like this based on merit. Whether or not what we experienced was an according-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant. What is significant is I felt God's touch, God got involved.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULES>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>

	No Jules, you're gonna be like those pieces of shit out there who beg for change. They walk around like a bunch of fuckin' zombies, they sleep in garbage bins, they eat what I throw away, and dogs piss on 'em. They got a word for 'em, they're called bums.

Cash register drawer opens. Pumpkin stuffs the money from the till in his pocket. Then walks from behind the counter with a trash bag in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<PUMPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay people, I'm going to go 'round and collect your wallets. Don't talk, just toss 'em in the bag. We clear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUMPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
Pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. Jules sits with his .45 ready to spit under the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pumpkin sees Jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet, briefcase next to him. Pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more respectful, him manner more on guard.
</DIRECTION>
<PUMPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the bag.
	</DIALOGUE>

Pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. He aims the gun right in the middle of Jules' face and pulls back the hammer.
</DIRECTION>
<PUMPKIN>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</PUMPKIN>

Jules SHOOTS Pumpkin twice, up through the table, sending him to the floor. While still in the booth, he SWINGS around to Honey Bunny, who has aimed at Jules, but slowed down by the shock of Pumpkin getting shot. He FIRES three times.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Honey Bunny takes all three HITS in the chest. As she FALLS SCREAMING, she FIRES wildly, HITTING a SURFER PATRON.
</DIRECTION>
<SURFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She shot me! I'm dying! Sally! Sally!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SURFER>
<DIRECTION>
Jules now brings the gun down to Pumpkin's face. Pumpkin lies shot on the floor at Jules' feet. Pumpkin looks up at the big gun.
</DIRECTION>
<JULES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wrong guy, Ringo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULES>
<DIRECTION>
Jules FIRES straight at the CAMERA, BLINDING UP with his FLASH.

<DIRECTION>
Jules' eyes, still closed, suddenly open.

Pumpkin still stands, holding the gun on him.

</PUMPKIN>
<DIRECTION>
Jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to Pumpkin but not to us. The same light SHINES from the case. Pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. Honey Bunny, across the room, can't see shit.
</DIRECTION>
<HONEY_BUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it? What is it?

</HONEY_BUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Jules SLAMS the case closed, then sits back, as if offering the case to Pumpkin. Pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to pick up the case.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like a rattlesnake, Jules' free hand GRABS the wrist of Pumpkin's gun hand, SLAMMING it on the table. His other hand comes from under the table and STICKS the barrel of his .45 hand under Pumpkin's chin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Honey Bunny freaks out, waving his gun in Jules' direction.
</DIRECTION>
<HONEY_BUNNY>

	Okay, now let him go!

</YOLANDA>
<JULES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yolanda, I thought you were gonna be cool. When you yell at me, it makes me nervous. When I get nervous, I get scared. And when motherfuckers get scared, that's when motherfuckers get accidentally shot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULES>
<YOLANDA>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now this is the situation. Normally both of your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken. But you happened to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period. I don't wanna kill ya, I want to help ya. But I'm afraid I can't give you the case. It don't belong to me.

	Not regularly.

</PUMPKIN>
<JULES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a passage I got memorized. Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. For he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you." I been sayin' that shit for years. And if you ever heard it, it meant your ass. I never really questioned what it meant. I thought it was just a cold-blooded thing to say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped a cap in his ass. But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice. Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're the evil man. And I'm the righteous man. And Mr. .45 here, he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. Or is could by you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish. I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth. The truth is you're the weak. And I'm the tyranny of evil men. But I'm tryin'. I'm tryin' real hard to be a shepherd.
