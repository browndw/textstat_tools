EXT NIGHT URBAN TERRACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONDON 2007.. NOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A row of rundown terrace houses. Some are boarded up. Not all the street lights work. Those that do cast shadows of parked vehicles glistening in the rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A front door opens and DON appears with rubbish which he puts in a bin. He hears something and looks up to see four big horses pulling a hulking great wagon down the middle of the street. The wagon is a gigantic windowless box. The horses are harnessed and there are reins but no sign of a driver. It's a very weird sight. DON, unable to take his eyes off this amazing apparition shouts back into the house from where light from a TV flickers.
</DIRECTION>

CAROL, disgusted, swats him on the head with the flat of her hand and goes back inside.

<DIRECTION>
EXT/INT NIGHT PARKED CAR IN STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A YOUNG COUPLE are snogging in the back of a parked car. Music is playing on the radio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are interrupted by heavy vibrations and the terrifying sight of the huge looming horse-drawn box as it trundles past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT NIGHT THE TOWN HALL CLOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The clock shows and strikes 2am.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT NIGHT A DINGY BACK STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wagon has stopped. The back begins to open, top, bottom and sides, like a dark menacing flower unfolding its petals.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shadowy FIGURES manoeuvre the side panels and begin to raise the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While this is happening THE CAMERA tracks around to reveal a garishly lit club across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of DRUNKEN YOUTHS emerge from the club, staggering, laughing, shouting, drinking, breaking bottles, and throwing up. The LADS grope the GIRLS. Everyone's having "a great time".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They see the wagon and stop, unsteadily, in their tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
We now see what they see. The wagon has been converted into a stage. We're looking at an old fashioned and very shabby travelling theatre. Electric footlights are powered by a clanking generator. The pediment above the stage carries the words: THE ASTONISHING IMAGINARIUM OF DOCTOR PARNASSUS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PERCY, a dwarf, dressed as a medieval demon and rigged out as a one-man band plays a fanfare introducing a young man (ANTON, 18-19 years old) who emerges from the back of the stage dressed as MERCURY, the messenger of the gods, with wings on his helmet and sandals.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTON_MERCURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and Gentlemen... Step up! Step up!... I, Mercury, the messenger of the gods, invite you... tonight, for one night only... at this very venue... to enter the mind, the very great mind, of Doctor Parnassus!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTON_MERCURY>
<DIRECTION>
PERCY does a roll on the drum as a curtain behind ANTON/MERCURY rises to reveal DOCTOR PARNASSUS - he appears to be an Indian holy man - long scraggly beard, chalk white make up, a large red circle on his bald head, a crown of yellow flowers, strings of beads, and partially covered in a loose-fitting swath of white cloth - apparently levitating several feet above the stage. (He's sitting on a glass plinth). DOCTOR PARNASSUS is seemingly in a trance. A bronze tripod containing burning incense stands beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTON_MERCURY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doctor Parnassus... as old as time... yes, ladies and gentlemen, more than a thousand years old ... he has the power to empower your mind. A secret learned in the mystic East. Let Doctor Parnassus open your imagination. Let him guide and transport you to worlds and possibilities you never dreamt of... If you dare. But... Beware... there are dangers. You will have to choose. Will your soul fly?... Or will it be dashed on the rocks of darkness? The choice is yours and yours alone. Transcend the heights on Beauty's wing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTON_MERCURY>
<DIRECTION>
A young woman, VALENTINA,(wearing a wig of long blonde hair and a white, flowing costume which gives her prominent hips and breasts) stands facing an elaborately framed full-length mirror nestled upstage amongst cut-out trees representing a forest... This is 'Beauty'. She turns and steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANTON takes her hand. They make a couple of dance steps together. They look enchanting and enchanted.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Take a ticket and join the queue! Only five quid a go! There's no greater bargain on planet earth!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PERCY>
<DIRECTION>
A beer bottle lands on the stage
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DRUNKEN YOUTHS cheer.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTON_MERCURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You choose... Fulfilment, grace and light or... Waste, filth and darkness.

MARTIN, with contempt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No prizes for guessing what you'll do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTON_MERCURY>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN has begun, with difficulty, to clamber onto the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His MATES laugh and shout encouragement.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTON>
<DIRECTION>
(not in character.. he stutters)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Sorry. That's n-not allowed. You have to t-take a t-ticket first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTON>
<DIRECTION>
ANTON tries to prevent MARTIN from getting on stage. But MARTIN thumps ANTON and pulls him into the 'audience'.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN'S drunken MATES laugh and applaud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN is now on stage and heading for DOCTOR PARNASSUS who is still in a trance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PERCY tries to head him off but MARTIN shoves PERCY off the stage. PERCY lands on the ground with a crash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More laughter from the MOB.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(drunkenly to PARNASSUS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey you...I wanna audition. I wan... I wanna be a star... I wanna...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN is on the verge of tweaking DOCTOR PARNASSUS' nose or pulling his beard when VALENTINA diverts him.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop! Get off the stage!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINA>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN turns his bleary focus to VALENTINA.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thas a nice pair of jugs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN'S mates roar their approval.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get off the stage!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINA>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I wan you... I wan you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN lunges at 'Beauty' who retreats up stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN blunders into the scenery as he pursues 'Beauty' who stays just out of reach. She takes cover behind a cut-out tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANTON and PERCY climb back onto the stage as MARTIN continues to chase 'Beauty'. VALENTINA evades him by ducking through the mirror (made of flexible reflective material slit down the middle). MARTIN crashes after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANTON and PERCY exchange worried looks. They look at DOCTOR PARNASSUS. Should they wake him from his trance? They decide not to but it's a difficult decision.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/EXT MAGICAL FOREST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stage set, which was clearly only a few feet deep, now seems much deeper and to contain many more cut-out trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
'Beauty' weaves in and out of the 2 dimensional trees as MARTIN chases her further into the increasingly magical forest. Beauty's costume has been transformed into something wonderful. (A rainbow studded with diamonds?)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALENTINA comes into view. MARTIN is in hot pursuit.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come here you little sexpot!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
VALENTINA stops, turns, smiles sweetly and slams her fist hard into MARTIN'S gut. He doubles up. VALENTINA pauses for a moment, contemplating doing some serious damage, before striding off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN staggers to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come back! You bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
He rushes after her but, trips on a root (a real 3 dimensional tree root) and pitches face first to the ground. Recovering, he looks up. Shock. He is surrounded by a dark, terrible, and very REAL forest. 'Beauty' has vanished.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT THE STAGE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALENTINA, 'Beauty', slips back on stage through the mirror. Her costume has reverted to its original state. She examines her knuckles on the hand with which she punched Martin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANTON looks at her. She shrugs. DR. PARNASSUS is still in a trance, his lips moving soundlessly. ANTON watches DOCTOR PARNASSUS in awe. 'Beauty' sighs. She's had enough.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT/EXT MAGICAL FOREST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN is lost and terrified in the dark forest.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mum...Mum!...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
His voice echoes through the giant trees. But his cries are interrupted by another sound...a Tarzan-like howl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN spins around. Strange creatures are swinging on vines through the giant trees. They are all around him. They look like HANDS... with little heads and arms where the wrists should be. They are all howling and jabbering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From behind, a HAND CREATURE swings down and grabs MARTIN by the collar, hoisting him high into the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clearing the trees, MARTIN sees he is not alone. There are many other people - all in the clutches of HAND CREATURES swinging on "vines".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But, the "vines" are actually long, slim tentacles... dangling from enormous, luridly coloured JELLYFISH that float through the dark, frightening, sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From some of the tentacles, bottles of booze dangle - just out of reach of the struggling crowd - all desperate for a drink.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please... I'll never...! Never again!. Honest!... From now on... I swear!.. Not a drop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
With a smile of satisfaction, the HAND CREATURE stops jabbering and let's go of MARTIN'S collar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Down he plummets. The ground rushes up. MATRTIN is as good as dead. But when he hits the ground, rather than going SPLAT!!, he bounces high in the air, turns a couple somersaults and lands on his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He can't believe what has just happened... and then he hears music. Beautiful, ethereal music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance a light is glowing. It's the sun, rising above a majestic mountain pass. Cut into the rock, is a long stairway winding up to the summit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The HAND CREATURE swings down, gives MARTIN the "thumbs up", and points encouragingly toward the stairway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reformed and determined, MARTIN heads for the stairs. But on reaching them he discovers that each one is 6 feet high. The stairway is ridiculously steep and difficult. Letters are carved into the first stair..."THE 12X12 STEP PROGRAM...GOOD LUCK". This is going to be tough.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of a honky-tonk piano makes him turn. Behind him the sky is dark. A roadside bar/nightclub with flashing neon lights has appeared. He hesitates. He could use a drink before the long climb. He heads for the club.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door to the club is opened by a mechanical fairground figure of a jolly smiling man (MR NICK) distinguished by a bowler hat and a red waistcoat.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi there. C'mon in. Looks like you could use a drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_NICK>
<DIRECTION>
MARTIN, relieved and reassured by the welcome, steps inside. The door closes followed by the sound from within of much gaiety and laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA pulls back as the nightclub suddenly EXPLODES IN A BALL OF FLAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT DINGY BACK STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of police sirens. We are back outside in front of the theatre.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DR. PARNASSUS rises unsteadily, coming out of his arduous trance.... 'Beauty" moves to support him as, exhausted, he loses his balance and snaps out of his trance.

	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PARNASSUS>
<DIRECTION>
The landscape, in response to DR. PARNASSUS' rage suddenly rips apart, fragmenting and spinning with ANTON inside it.

INT/EXT MAGICAL LANDSCAPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANTON, recovering, struggles out from between giant blocks of stone. The world has gone dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hears DIEGO crying somewhere in the distance and starts to clamber over the shattered monoliths..
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reaching the top, ANTON sees DIEGO on the peak of a distant rocky pinnacle surrounded by bottomless chasms. There are what appear to be two suspension bridges spanning the void on either side of the pinnacle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO DIEGO who is in a state of confusion and terror. Is he lost inside a video game he can't control? He presses the buttons on his gaming device - to no avail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the bridges leads to a bluff where war games are under way... all very video-game-like. Thrilling aggressive music blares forth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR NICK appears, still in red waist-coat and bowler hat, but this time in the form of a CUT-OUT shooting target with a bull's-eye on his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on laddy, cross the bridge! Join up! Be a man. Kill the enemy. Impress your dad. Unlimited ammo. Great fun. Pow! Pow! Pow!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_NICK>
<DIRECTION>
As he speaks bullets fly. Each time MR.NICK gets shot and is knocked flat, he pops back up continuing his spiel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other bridge appears to be made of black and white piano keys and looks very rickety and unsafe. The piano key bridge descends into a great cavern where hundreds of BOY AND GIRL PIANISTS are practising on hundreds of pianos, all playing the same tune - the tune DR. PARNASSUS is humming, but with stern, demanding, PIANO TEACHERS in attendance.
</DIRECTION>
<PIANO_TEACHERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, start again! Again! From the top! Again! Practice! Practice!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIANO_TEACHERS>
<DIRECTION>
DIEGO doesn't know what to do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him rises a strange Mongolfier balloon. DR. PARNASSUS's face is repeated again and again around its circumference. ANTON'S in the basket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DIEGO catches sight of ANTON.

	Attaboy, sonny. Join the men. Nothing to it. Hup two, hup two...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_NICK>
<DIRECTION>
He hesitates...the music from the pianos seems to have an effect on him. He comes to a decision. He drops his gaming device then very hesitantly steps onto the extremely wobbly piano keys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CUT-OUT shooting target MR NICK isn't happy.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, wait! That's the wrong choice! That bridge leads to failure and despair. You'll be dead before you're thirty. This is the one. This is the bridge to manhood!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_NICK>
<DIRECTION>
DIEGO looks uncertain, unnerved. For a moment we think he might change his mind, but he presses bravely on across the piano bridge.
</DIRECTION>

ANTON steps out of the mirror. He produces an inflated balloon which he releases and which then flies, zig-zagging out over the audience.
</DIRECTION>

THE FAMILY FROM HELL moves off.
</DIRECTION>

DIEGO, full of wonder and oblivious to his family, looks back at PARNASSUS and gives the old man the thumbs-up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PARNASSUS smiles and raises his thumb in response.
</DIRECTION>

INT BACK STAGE DRESSING ROOM A MOMENT LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valentina, half-undressed, is struggling out of her 'Wisdom' costume while at the same time looking at pictures of beautiful homes and gardens in a very battered copy of 'Homes and Gardens'. Without make-up and costume she appears much younger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A movement of something reflected in the dressing-room mirror catches her eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the mirror we see MR NICK, not a CUT-OUT, but the real thing.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINA>
<DIRECTION>
(startled, guiltily hiding 'Homes and Gardens')
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh!

ANTON and PERCY are packing-up and closing the wagon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DR. PARNASSUS, out of his make-up and costume, is smiling and humming to himself as he removes the feed bag from one of the horses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The horse lifts its head and DR PARNASSUS recoils in shock and horror. Standing directly behind the horse is MR. NICK... a huge grin splitting his face.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello Parnassus... It's been a while hasn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_NICK>
<DIRECTION>
PERCY, winding a rope onto a cleat, hears distant laughter and looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO PERCY'S P.O.V. where we see, some distance away and in a relatively secluded spot, MR NICK rocking with laughter while DOCTOR PARNASSUS looks stricken. He clutches at the back of a park bench to steady himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO PERCY who looks thoughtful and worried. He heads off to help DOCTOR PARNASSUS as the latter slumps onto the bench. MR NICK has vanished.
</DIRECTION>

PERCY is sitting on the roof driving. ANTON is lying on the roof looking up at the stars. VALENTINA is sitting next to him lost in thought.

DOCTOR PARNASSUS' cabin is tiny. It's packed with books and memorabilia; Egyptian/Assyrian/Greek/etc., magic trick paraphernalia, and much else.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hanging lantern suspended from the ceiling throws moving shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DR. PARNASSUS is slumped despondently on a cramped bed. A plate of untouched food sits on a table in front of him.

<DIRECTION>
He has laid out tarot cards. To the right - The Magus.. to the left - The Devil. The next card is The Maiden. He places it carefully beneath The Magus.

EXT INSIDE THE PAPERWEIGHT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HOODED RIDER moves slowly through the snowstorm, the horse picking its way carefully across a field of virgin snow.

(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I was visited... by someone I had hoped never to meet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PARNASSUS>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, rising like a dark mountain, is a strange monastery. Dim light comes from a couple of windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can hear, from far away, the indistinct droning voice of the story teller, a younger DR. PARNASSUS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA moves up over and way ahead of the HOODED RIDER, continuing through the snowstorm, over fields, forests, valleys, rocks, until it reaches the monastery, high on a rugged hill. Here it enters one of the dimly lit monastery windows, taking us into a dining hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT MONASTERY DINING HALL NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Entering via a window and looking down into the monastery dining hall, we see DOZENS OF MONKS sitting at a long refectory table. They are eating their supper and listening to a young DR. PARNASSUS who is sitting on a dais at the far end of the hall, his eyes closed, in a trance, telling a story.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A log fire burns in a big fireplace.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_PARNASSUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Having captured the wind and tamed the storm ... the Chief Steward, laying down to take his rest, had a disturbing dream... He dreamt that a hooded rider was approaching across the snow-swept plain. A rider who would challenge the very foundations of the world...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PARNASSUS>
<DIRECTION>
The door to the refectory swings open with a crash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MONKS look up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing on the thresh-hold is the hooded figure, covered with snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He throws off his hood. It's MR NICK.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_PARNASSUS>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DR. PARNASSUS and MR NICK are sitting at the fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them, in the hall, MONKS come and go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the dais, a MONK continues with the story. This monk is a younger PERCY.
</DIRECTION>
<PERCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... And as the waters rose... the people's need for stories grew. Stories that would feed a great hunger. A hunger for more than just understanding...

PERCY continues telling the story in the background.

MR NICK zaps DR. PARNASSUS and all the other MONKS. All still. None of them can speak.

Splat! A gob of bird shit lands on MR. NICK'S head. An eagle circles overhead. It swoops across the hall and exits through a window.

DR. PARNASSUS leaps up, laughing, amazed, revived.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIVER DAY

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO a much younger DR. PARNASSUS and the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN in a row boat, picnicking, as they float down a river. They are in love, very happy to be together.

</DR_PARNASSUS>
<DIRECTION>
The boat bumps into a submerged log. DR. PARNASSUS tries to push free. Several cigarette butts float past. Looking up, DR. PARNASSUS sees a man sitting on the riverbank, fishing, smoking a cigarette. It's MR NICK .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a loud and ominous clap of thunder.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Father!...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINA>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment the wagon lurches to a stop and we hear frantic banging on the roof.

<DIRECTION>
DR PARNASSUS is glad of the excuse not to go on.

	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PARNASSUS>
<DIRECTION>
VALENTINA turns and goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PARNASSUS looks miserable but, almost relieved. He turns over the next card.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's The Hanged Man. It depicts a body hanging from a gibbet surrounded by several arcane objects.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PARNASSUS studies the card, trying to wring some meaning from it - then lays The Hanged Man in the space between the others. He takes a swig from the bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT WAGON ON BLACK FRIARS' BRIDGE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wagon has stopped in the middle of Blackfriar's bridge. It's pouring with rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALENTINA, wearing some sort of covering against the rain, climbs out of the hatch and onto the roof of the wagon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Here she finds ANTON pointing excitedly down into the Thames.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Incredible! I saw somebody d- dancing in the air.. under the b- bridge..
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
VALENTINA looks doubtfully at PERCY who peers morosely out from under his sou-wester and shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's true! There was a sh-shadow on the water, when the lightning flashed...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTON>
<DIRECTION>
Lightning flashes again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see what ANTON and VALENTINA see. A shadow, on the water, of someone 'dancing', hung by his neck with a rope attached to the underside of the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (triumphant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see! The d-dancer!

	<DIALOGUE>
	A rope! Get a rope!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT SIDE OF BLACK FRIARS' BRIDGE MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANTON is 'absailing' over the side of the bridge. One end of a rope is tied around his waist, the other is attached to the bridge parapet. A lantern dangles from his waist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALENTINA and PERCY watch ANTON'S perilous descent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moments later there are two bodies hanging from the bridge, the mysterious HANGING MAN'S and ANTON'S.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MAN is hanging by a noose around his neck, still jerking in his dance of death. His hands are tied behind his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANTON can't reach the MAN.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTON>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I c-can't reach him.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Swing in!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PERCY>
<VALENTINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hurry up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINA>
<DIRECTION>
ANTON shoots PERCY and VALENTINA a jaundiced look and with VALENTINA'S help on her end of the rope begins to swing back and forth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eventually, with a big enough swing, he manages to hook his foot around the HANGING MAN who has gone limp. Dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With extreme difficulty and great discomfort, ANTON pulls the MAN close to him, takes a knife from his pocket and cuts the MAN'S rope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANTON and the MAN are now swinging back and forth together on ANTON'S rope which is threatening to cut ANTON in half.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arghhh!!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTON>
<VALENTINA>

<DIRECTION>
EXT PAVEMENT ON BLACK FRIARS' BRIDGE A LITTLE LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALENTINA, ANTON and PERCY manhandle the MAN over the parapet and onto the pavement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DR. PARNASSUS has just stepped out onto the top of the wagon. Soaked. He's drunk and is swaying.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_PARNASSUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you fishing dead people out of the river? He's dead. Leave him. Let's go. Before the police turn up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PARNASSUS>
<DIRECTION>
He goes, unsteadily, back inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALENTINA and ANTON drag the MAN under the wagon, out of the rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MAN is dressed in an expensive Saville Row suit. His jacket pockets are full of strange weights and arcane symbols have been scrawled on his forehead. He's about 30 years old and very handsome.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MAN appears to be dead but VALENTINA decides to try the kiss of life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANTON is made uncomfortable seeing VALENTINA administer the kiss of life and he pulls her away.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! That won't work. And anyway, you d-don't know where he's b-been. Let me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTON>
<DIRECTION>
He brings both fists down hard on the centre of the MAN'S chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Boing! The 'dead' MAN coughs, sits bolt upright, spits out a little metal tube and smashes his head on the underside of the wagon, knocking himself out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The little metal tube clatters over the asphalt.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's alive!

</VALENTINA>
<PERCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, he was.

ANTON picks up the little metal tube and examines it.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What on earth is this?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
EXT BLACK FRIARS' BRIDGE REAR OF WAGON MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALENTINA, ANTON and PERCY drag the MAN from under the wagon and carry him to the rear.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put him in the big trunk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINA>
<ANTON>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</PERCY>
<VALENTINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He thought he was dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINA>
<DIRECTION>
They start to bundle the MAN in one of the travelling trunks attached to the back of the wagon. With the body hanging half in half out, ANTON suddenly stops.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I d-don't like it. It's none of our b-business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTON>
<VALENTINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what do you suggest, we leave him on the side of the road?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINA>
<DIRECTION>
ANTON doesn't want to answer that one.
</DIRECTION>
<PERCY>
<DIRECTION>
(walking away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Definitely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PERCY>

VALENTINA, single-handedly, hefts the MAN into the trunk and carefully places a cushion under his head. An action not missed by ANTON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT DERELICT BUILDINGS DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wagon stands, hidden, among deserted derelict buildings. All is quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lid of the big travelling trunk slowly opens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MAN struggles out. His neck is sore, his wrists ache and his head is bruised. He hasn't a clue where he is. He tries to make sense of the wagon, the grazing horses, the derelict buildings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some distance away a bizarre, horned and tailed CREATURE is involved in a strange contorted dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hoping to avoid the CREATURE, the MAN starts to move away but is stopped by a squeaky voice behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<PERCY>
<DIRECTION>

VALENTINA sits at a mirror fussing with various hair styles - slyly trying to catch GEORGE's attention.

PARNASSUS, holding his aching head, sits a short distance away sadly watching her. PERCY is with him.

ANTON suddenly plops down on his arse in a puddle of mud. Then spins, flips the flower high into the air and, rolling face down onto his stomach, catches the stem with his clenched buttocks. VALENTINA bursts out laughing.

The effort seems to have tired PARNASSUS. He needs to sit down.

VALENTINA and ANTON begin to pay attention and gather around.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR_PARNASSUS>

VALENTINA looks at him thinking 'what a sympathetic person.'
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of a flutey whistle distracts him. ANTON is blowing a tune on the metal tube he found on the bridge.

	Sleep no more. Procrastinate no longer. Embrace this once in a life- time opportunity. Let the mind of Doctor Parnassus be the portal to the infinite world of your imagination.

Behind the curtain, PERCY is signalling VALENTINA to see if DOCTOR PARNASSUS has been drinking. She sniffs him.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR_PARNASSUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing? Please concentrate. We've got a tremendous amount of work to do tonight. A great deal depends on it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR_PARNASSUS>
<DIRECTION>
A roll on the drums from PERCY. The curtain rises. DOCTOR PARNASSUS 'floats' above the stage on his glass plinth.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As old as the universe itself, the great Doctor, versed in every mystic practice known to man, and many more besides, will guide you to your destiny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTON>
<DIRECTION>
However, the AUDIENCE - a few PASSERS-BY and DRINKERS who have drifted out of the pub for a smoke - aren't much interested in ANTON. Instead they pay more attention to the masked TONY who, decked out in a stylish costume, is working the sparse crowd with his smooth charm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANTON, irritated, glances back at DOCTOR PARNASSUS who is worried about the lack of customers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TONY is now surrounded by fascinated WOMEN. They laugh at one of his jokes. One pretty young woman, SALLY, in particular seems to be smitten by the handsome 'actor'. TONY smiles seductively at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sight provokes ANTON. He leaps off the stage, grabs SALLY by the wrist and begins to pull her to the stage.

PERCY keeps playing.

Staggering under the weight of the struggling SALLY, ANTON barges into DOCTOR PARNASSUS' on his glass plinth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The plinth rocks and teeters. VALENTINA tries to stop it falling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANTON, unaware of what he's done, disappears through the mirror as DOCTOR PARNASSUS crashes head first onto the stage. Crack!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From behind the mirror comes the sound of a woman's terrifying, terrified screams.
</DIRECTION>
<FEMALE_FRIEND>

Blood-red lightning bolts crackle and crash. Chaos.

PERCY, desperate, produces a pistol and fires a couple of shots into the air.

EVERYONE dives for cover.

PERCY, taking advantage of the temporary lull, begins to race around, untying, unhooking, and pulling on ropes.

A police siren howls as the wagon comes crashing around the corner of a great rubbish tip and clatters to a halt... the horses steaming, sections of the theatre hanging loose, broken..an utter mess. The siren fades into the distance.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Er... one more thing....Does 'first to five' mean anything to you?

ANTON looks at TONY with loathing.

He walks away into the darkness.

EXT RUBBISH TIP DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The morning light suffuses mountains of domestic refuse. Rubbish for as far as the eye can see. Plastic sacks of various colours, many spilling open. A few fires are burning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flocks of scavenging sea gulls hover and dive, screaming blue murder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On one of the many pinnacles of garbage sits a lonely figure. It's ANTON, depressed, angry, forlorn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA SWINGS ROUND to show, below ANTON, in a valley of waste material, the wagon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE WAGON DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PERCY has spread out the broken scenery assessing the damage. In the shadow of the wagon VALENTINA is changing TONY'S dressings.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God it's only cuts and bruises. I thought we'd lost you.

</VALENTINA>

	Valentina, your father seems in a terrible state. Is it the police? The show? Maybe I can help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<VALENTINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what's wrong with him, but if it's about the show...I don't care. I'm tired of it...let the police arrest us. I'm sick of living like this....
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINA>
<DIRECTION>
She looks miserable. TONY puts his arms around her. Holds her tightly to him.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't say that. What you're doing is important. Really important. It's just... maybe... it should be done in a different way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
He is about to kiss her.

DR. PARNASSUS, grim faced, head bandaged, steps from behind the wagon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TONY and VALENTINA quickly disengage.

	<DIALOGUE>
	"Different?"

</DOCTOR_PARNASSUS_O_S>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sir, I've been thinking... It's clear the show's not attracting many people. Forgive me but... I see two ways of tackling this problem. Either the style of the show is at fault... or the type of audience. I would suggest changing both.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
PERCY has appeared, dragging a damaged flat.
</DIRECTION>
<PERCY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry but.. you're not modern. People want modern. Look.

He holds open a tattered fashion magazine to a page of beautifully photographed models in a fabulously magical setting. He thumbs through more pages of dreamy images.

From behind the wagon ANTON watches forlornly. Alone and unnoticed by the others.

<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The trick is not to hide. Change your colours. Be bold. Go where they would least expect to find you. I think we have been brought together for a reason. I don't believe in coincidence. You saved my life. Now let me do something in return.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... First of all, I want you to give me your money. All of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
What?! PARNASSUS, PERCY, and VALENTINA look at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then PARNASSUS sees something beyond the wagon...ANTON, downcast, heading off through the swirling plastic bags and flying rubbish... a battered suitcase in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_PARNASSUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anton! Where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PARNASSUS>
<DIRECTION>
No answer from ANTON.

<DIRECTION>
VALENTINA runs after him but, he marches on silently.

<VALENTINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing? Didn't you do enough damage last night?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you trying to wreck my birthday, or what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINA>

Anton stops, still not looking at VALENTINA he slowly drops his suitcase.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINA>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. We need you.

EXT BOND STREET EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close up on Parnassus's glass plinth..now open-topped and sitting on the edge of the stage... full of the troupe's savings. A sign proclaims "Please Take Generously"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Directly behind the glass box is a half-globe with the continent of Africa featured. Sitting on top is Percy playing something ethnic but tasteful on a flute with one hand...his other is held out pathetically... a beggar. He's blacked up and dressed in rags. He doesn't look happy. He sneaks nervous glances at the glass box of money.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wagon, newly painted in sleek and stylish black and white, stands in Bond Street or some similarly fashionable street with expensive shops and art galleries. RICH WOMEN anxious to be conspicuous in their consumption of wealth glide past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
New signs proclaim 'The Choice Is Yours' 'The Imaginarium - More Exclusive than ever'.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stage, hung with soft,flowing, gauzy fabric, has been chromatically divided in half - one side black, the other white.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the dark side a bloated, sun-glassed woman consuming vast quantities of food reclines on an elaborate lounge. She is, in fact, a very uncomfortable ANTON in full and fulsome drag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Center stage stands DR. PARNASSUS dressed as a stylized doctor with head reflector. In his hand is a staff with an elaborate sun on the top. He is blindfolded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the white side of the stage stands the mirror and a stylized Tree of Knowledge with bright red apples. Under the tree, and reflected in the mirror, sits VALENTINA as Eve...naked except for a long wig that maintains her modesty. She gracefully combs her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above the mirror is a sign proclaiming "The Naked Truth".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DR. PARNASSUS, peeking under his blindfold, is distinctly uncomfortable by his daughter's lack of attire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TONY, in a beautifully cut white suit, and wearing his 'romantic' Venetian carnival mask sits in profile in a dreamy pose on the edge of the white side of the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nobody speaks. They pay no attention to the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few women stop, curious. One of them takes out some money and puts it in the glass plinth and turns to go.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
<DIRECTION>
(retrieving the money)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, madam. I'm afraid we can't accept this.

The woman stops, confused. Tony hands her back her money.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are here to give...not take. We are here to help those in need. If it's money you need, then here it is.

(referring to the glass plinth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it's the flowering of the soul you need, then here we are but, unfortunately we are booked solid at the moment. But thank you.. I can see you have a generous spirit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
TONY returns to his pensive pose. The women look at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me but, how does this work? What does it cost?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cost? Money is no good in the Imaginarium. This is a refuge for hearts in need of truth. A place for souls to be purified.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	How long does that take? I'm running late.

The women grow pensive.

<TONY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are hard choices to be made in life.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he indicates the tableaux)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the dreams of the less fortunate in the world. Do you have time for their dreams? Or are you like I once was...do you just despair? Despair at all that is wrong in the world..
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(getting to his feet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...despair at your inability to do anything to change it.. to make it better...I despaired so much at the powerlessness of my own existence that I took the easy way out...the coward's way...I committed suicide! Yes, that's right, I killed myself. Can you understand my despair? But I was saved...saved by a miracle...The Imaginarium...and Doctor Parnassus. He brought me back from the dead. He gave me a new life. A reason to live. He has given me power to dream again... to dream of a better world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
During his speech, more and more people have gathered. Some are actually weeping. They are press forward putting money in the plinth. Tony tries to stop them but, they insist. VALENTINA, ANTON, PERCY, and DR. PARNASSUS are astonished by TONY'S performance.

He ushers the uneasy LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN onto the stage and guides her upstage. PARNASSUS goes into his trance.

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Believe me Madam, you're the luckiest woman in the world.

The LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN steps into the mirror. TONY hesitates..a moment of uncertainty. VALENTINA encourages him with a smile. He steps through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the street a clock begins striking the hour.

<DIRECTION>

TONY and THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN are astonished to find themselves in the romantic, soft-focus, pastel-colour setting of a soothing, sophisticated, shampoo commercial.

TONY, disorientated, takes a moment to regain his composure. He smiles and, with an effort, puts his arm around THE LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN'S wide waist. He looks into her eyes. She's in love.

But as she hesitates a dark shadow rises over them. TONY, looking past the WOMAN"S shoulder, sees the dark waters of the stream rise up transforming into a GIGANTIC KING COBRA that towers menacingly over them. It's wearing a BOWLER HAT... and it's angry.

He turns back to see the GIGANTIC KING COBRA shrinking back below the bridge, transforming itself back into the waters of the stream. From under the arch of the bridge hangs a rope. At its end.. a hangman's noose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TONY stares at it darkly disconcerted.

EXT. STAGE EVENING

<DIRECTION>
TONY re-enters the stage through the mirror, looking at DR. PARNASSUS who has just come out of his trance with astonishment
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>

(gobsmacked)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was so... I had no idea... It's just... incredible.

<DIRECTION>
The LOUIS VUITTON woman reappears, sitting on a cut-out cloud descending from the ceiling of the stage. She looks radiant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is weeping, completely overcome by her experience. PARNASSUS steps forward and helps her to her feet. She kisses his hands in gratitude.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR_PARNASSUS>
<DIRECTION>
Born again, tearful but transcendent, the LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN produces her cheque book and begins to write a cheque.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TONY is frozen, confused. The crowd is still... stunned by the LOUIS VUITTON WOMAN's transformation as she deposits the cheque, her handbag, her expensive coat in the glass box and glides benignly through the crowd... which parts in awe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pause... and then the other WOMEN rush the stage. Mayhem is narrowly averted as TONY and PERCY manage to coral them into a more-or-less orderly queue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the street, standing in the doorway of a shop selling luxury goods, is MR NICK. He watches events, intrigued...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...as TONY escorts a second woman through the mirror, and a third, they descend, ecstatic, emptying the contents of their handbags, their pearls, earrings and diamond rings into the glass box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TONY pays off the cops who move on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TONY, getting more and more flamboyant, forgets to lower his mask each time he re-enters the stage. And now a fourth woman descends. Four successes for DOCTOR PARNASSUS.

DOCTOR PARNASSUS spots MR NICK across the street, smiles, holds up four fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR NICK gives a little 'I'm not impressed' smirk and turns away and pretends to be interested in the luxury goods in the shop window as four large dark heavy RUSSIAN MEN, all laden with luxury shopping walk past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the RUSSIANS stops..looking at the show..at TONY whose mask is sitting on top of his head. The leading RUSSIAN pulls him on.

TONY, reaching down to help an elderly lady up to the stage, looks up and sees the RUSSIANS heading through the crowd..
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Panic!! He pulls the mask down and begins to back up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But it's too late, they've definitely seen him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He spins around and rockets upstage, past DR. PARNASSUS who is deep into his trance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TONY dives through the mirror much to the amazement of VALENTINA, ANTON, PERCY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The RUSSIANS chase after him, shoving the queuing WOMEN aside, smashing the scenery and knocking ANTON into the wings.
</DIRECTION>

INT/EXT SHAMPOO COMMERCIAL LANDSCAPE

The RUSSIANS charge through the shampoo-commercial landscape. No TONY.. Just slo-mo fashion models and soft wafting fabrics and aromatic breezes.

	<DIALOGUE>
	There he is!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGOR>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, TONY is hiding behind some billowing fabric. On being spotted, he takes off up a hill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The RUSSIANS race toward the hill only to crash into a solid wall - painted as a landscape with TONY frozen in mid stride. Looking off to their right they see Tony heading up another hill. But as they rush in that direction another wall rises up blocking them. Again it is painted with a hill and TONY frozen in midstride. A third and fourth wall rise up.. surrounding and trapping the RUSSIANS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a cell door in one wall. Like crazy animals they start throwing themselves against the door trying to break it down. It won't budge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While the others batter the door, GREGOR, who has been somewhat affected by the soft shampoo commercial world, sits quietly in a corner picking pretty flowers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Exhausted, the other RUSSIANS collapse on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GREGOR gently breathes in the aroma of the flowers and exhales. As he does the door swings open. The other RUSSIANS gape at him... then barrel out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside is a new, beautiful, landscape - the sky dotted with white fluffy clouds. Extending from the ground to each cloud is an incredibly long ladder. On each ladder is a person climbing upwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The RUSSIANS spot Tony. He is already a hundred feet up a ladder and climbing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unfortunately, their way is blocked by an over-bright, hyper- active, wide-eyed sales girl.
</DIRECTION>
<SALES_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi! Hello! Today's special! Reach for the clouds! Discover your true potential! Gift certificates are available at...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALES_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
The RUSSIANS roughly shove her aside. As they rush past, GREGOR pauses, hands her his flowers.
</DIRECTION>
<GREGOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax...smell the flowers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGOR>
<DIRECTION>
Reaching the base of TONY'S ladder, the RUSSIANS start climbing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing the threat, TONY kicks hard and breaks the rungs below him.. setting off a domino effect with more rungs breaking downward towards the RUSSIANS. Snap! Crack! Rungs break in their grasp.. they fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The RUSSIANS land in a tangled heap as the domino effect continues down to the base of the ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laughing down at them, TONY turns to continue climbing - only to see the domino effect heading down from the top of the ladder... towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LADDER COMPLETELY SEPARATES IN TWO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tony struggles to maintain his balance - and somehow manages to get his feet on the two halves of a broken rung. Then, as if he were on giant stilts, starts to stride away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The RUSSIANS chase after him but, his giant strides leave them far behind. Smugly, TONY looks back just as one of the legs of his ladder snags on a fallen log. He loses his balance... and plunges hundreds of feet earthward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From nowhere, ANTON (still dressed as a fat woman) appears.. running to catch the plummeting TONY. He does and Whomp!!.. is flattened. Knocked out cold. TONY is unscathed.. his fall broken by ANTON'S padding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But, the RUSSIANS arrive, grab TONY, start to beat him up.
</DIRECTION>
<SERGE>
	<DIALOGUE>

<ANTON>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stand b-back! I'm warning you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTON>
<DIRECTION>
Foolishly, he whips off his wig and assumes a manly martial arts pose. The RUSSIANS look at each other. Then, utterly ignoring ANTON, turn their attention back to beating TONY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GREGOR walks calmly over to ANTON who is in attack mode.
</DIRECTION>
<GREGOR>

	Relax. Smell the flowers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGOR>
<DIRECTION>
Confused, ANTON takes the flower, sniffs and then... GREGOR floors him with a powerful punch on the nose
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, the RUSSIANS have a noose around TONY's neck and have looped the rope over a tree branch. TONY struggles to pull out the metal pipe he keeps on a string around his neck. He gets it to his mouth as if to swallow it when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... the ground erupts and a giant London policeman's helmet rises up (we are talking 20 feet tall)and revolves - revealing DR. PARNASSUS' carved and painted face beneath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mouth drops open and a great red tongue rolls out like a welcoming red carpet. From inside the giant mouth a smiling policeman beckons the RUSSIANS to come on in..
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The terrified RUSSIANS let go of the lynching rope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TONY drops to the ground and, with a whistle, the brass pipe flies out of his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the RUSSIANS a painted backdrop unfurls..it reads "JOIN THE FUZZ.. WE LOVE VIOLENCE".. and a chorus line of LONG-LEGGED GIRLS in mini-skirted police outfits appear - high-kicking a snappy song and dance number.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The astonished RUSSIANS don't know what the fuck is going on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a friendly OLD WOMAN'S VOICE is heard shouting something in Russian.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spinning around, the RUSSIANS see an old BABOUSHKA (Russian grandmother) outside a tumble-down cottage waving gaily to them. A stunned pause. Then, pell-mell, they rush to her.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSIANS>
<DIRECTION>
(IN RUSSIAN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mama! Mama! Help! Save us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSIANS>
<DIRECTION>
As they run toward her they get smaller and smaller. She lifts her skirts and all four disappear underneath. And then.. BOOM!.. a muffled explosion balloons the skirts outward. Smoke spews out from below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Straightening her skirt, the BABOUSHKA looks up, and pulls off her head - revealing MR.NICK's tiny head poking out of the collar. He smiles smugly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The giant POLICEMAN DR. PARNASSUS registers disappointment and, like a balloon rapidly deflating, spins off into the sky sending up a cloud of dust obscuring everything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dust clears and TONY and ANTON find themselves in a desolate, empty landscape. Nowhere. Nothing.

	Yes, I know, and you're right, but that's the way the grown-up..the real world works. You can't make omelettes without soiling your hands. Or should that be the other way round? Anyway, I - with hindsight very foolishly - accepted a loan from people who seemed to me, at the time, to be very decent and sincere. There was absolutely no way I could have known that they were part of a ruthless organised crime syndicate and that they wanted to use my charity to launder money. I made a mistake. And I have to live with that. I'm sorry. What more can I say?

	Stop saying that! I didn't steal it! I didn't have it. I'd had to invest in infrastructure. I needed more time. When you run a charity you have to give lots of money away. You wouldn't believe the red tape. The Charity Commission are a bunch of fascists. It's incredible.

<DOCTOR_PARNASSUS>

Looking at VALENTINA, DR. PARNASSUS sees her morph into the BEAUTIFUL WOMAN appearing. He almost swoons.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR_PARNASSUS>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)

DR. PARNASSUS looks haggard. He closes his eyes. He sways and loses his balance.

He starts to violently bang his head against the side of the wagon.
</DIRECTION>

Suddenly the stage begins to unfold. PARNASSUS looks up, unable to see what or who is doing this. He drunkenly stumbles around the side to see TONY pulling ropes.

TONY leaps back to steady DR. PARNASSUS who looked as though he were about to topple off his pillar.

PARNASSUS quiets down. Starts mumbling.

TONY rushes to the mirror. Steps through. He finds himself standing amongst the stage scenery. Nothing else.

TONY hesitates.. No time! He looks back to PARNASSUS who seems to still be in his trance. Hesitates. Then rushes to VALENTINA.

They turn to the mirror but, an off-stage clearing of the throat makes them look round to see ANTON watching them. He's holding a torn and dirty piece of newspaper.

INT/EXT DR. PARNASSUS' DRUNKEN IMAGINATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mist and rain descend as TONY and VALENTINA run through the darkened shapes of the shampoo-commercial landscape - now tattered, ragged, and wind blown. Darkness reigns.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't right. This is all wrong. Which way?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
Soaked and cold they spy a welcome sight. A uniformed valet with an open umbrella stands by the door of a sleek limo.
</DIRECTION>
<VALET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your car is here, Mr.Tony.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALET>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, Lester, just in time.
	</DIALOGUE>

TONY ducks under the umbrella and helps VALENTINA into the car ahead of himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she slides across the seat she notices the driver - bowler hatted and smoking a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Tony, don't get in! Get away!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINA>
<DIRECTION>
She pushes TONY back and scrambles out...dragging him back out into the dark rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driver turns around. It's MR.NICK.. looking vexed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALENTINA and TONY struggle through the rain. Suddenly, they find themselves in deep water up to their chests. They are sinking. Through the mist they see a boat. It is the gondola that transported the LOUIS VUITTON LADY.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help! Over here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>

The boatman turns the boat in their direction. TONY tries to pull himself on board. The boatman reaches down to help.

It's MR. NICK. VALENTINA recoils, drags TONY off the boat.

	No we won't. This is the way.

She points to jumbled rocks just visible in the darkness. They drag themselves onto them. The rocky monoliths appear to be the same as the landscape ANTON climbed over when he was searching for DIEGO, the son of THE FAMILY FROM HELL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And, like a repeat of that experience, from behind the ridge rises the Parnassus-faced Mongolfier balloon. But, now the eyes stream tears and rain pours down. In the basket is ANTON.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTON>

	Don't d-do it. Don't g-go on. Not with him! He's all lies.

He pulls her away..towards a little tumble-down cottage. Warm candlelight glows in the windows, smoke curls from the chimney. They run to the door. TONY bangs on it. Someone can be heard unlatching the locks inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A child's crying cuts through the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALENTINA turns and sees a little girl sitting on the path... among flapping laundry. She rushes to her, tries to pick her up but, the little girl resists..
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tony, help me, she's heavy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALENTINA>

The door has just opened and TONY is halfway through. He turns, irritated.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it now?! Can't we just go inside and get dry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him, in the warmth, stands the old BABOUSHKA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing that VALENTINA is really struggling with the little girl, TONY reluctantly goes to help. The little girl, on seeing TONY, tries to break away but, he holds on to her.

The litle girl goes quiet. VALENTINA looks at TONY with surprise. The BABOUSHKA looks angry. Suddenly a light begins to suffuse TONY and the little girl. A small orchestra can be heard playing garden party music.
</DIRECTION>
<VALENTINA>

	You did it! You made the right choice!

A small orchestra is playing. There is a marquee.

WAITERS and WAITRESSES move amongst the assembled notables bearing trays of drinks and food.

TONY is the focus of attention. A TV current-affairs/news JOURNALIST with CAMERA CREW is following him around.

TONY smiles and shakes the hand of someone in a wheelchair.

He moves on. The TV CREW stay with him.

Now we hear a distant buzzing. EVERYBODY looks up.

The little girl, OLGA, and a little boy are brought forward. They are dressed in ethnic clothes. TONY takes OLGA'S hand...offers the little boy's hand to VALENTINA. She takes it in her own. The four of them start to walk to the door leading to the ballroom.

TONY looks up and freezes. At the same time the walls of the ballroom begin to crack and disintegrate. TONY'S world starts to fall apart... literally.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The floor around TONY falls away into an abyss leaving only a narrow escape route. He hurls ANTON aside and dashes away as the GUESTS pursue him. ANTON avoids being trampled but, loses his footing and falls over the edge.

With siren wailing, an AMBULANCE arrives, screeching to a halt. PARAMEDICS pull VALENTINA away. They check PARNASSUS for signs of life and begin to lift him onto the gurney. VALENTINA can't control herself and tries to throw herself onto his body. The PARAMEDICS struggle with her.

A bottle falls from the DOCTOR'S hand and explodes in a million fragments as it hits the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shimmering fragments coalesce into a fractured mirror corridor down which a multi-reflected VALENTINA runs - sobbing like a madwoman - lashing out at her reflections, some of which are flashbacks of her flirting with TONY, irritated with ANTON, angry with PARNASSUS.

Reflected in the swirling mirror fragments, they tango until he spins her towards the right hand mirror. She sails through - and, with a mad smile, throws him a kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mirror closes with a burst of flame. The briefest flash of DR. PARNASSUS face is reflected in the mirror fragments.

No response from PARNASSUS. A Tarot cards drops from his hand. It is The Hanged Man.

TONY, sweating, panting for breath, is running up the mountain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below, the MOB is still in hot pursuit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TONY reaches the summit. In front of him, is his salvation - an empty gibbet. A noose hangs from the crossbeam.

<DIRECTION>
TONY relaxes a little.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can hear the mob now, struggling up the mountain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TONY digs into one of his pockets and pulls out the brass tube that he has always kept close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TONY opens his mouth and is about to slip the tube down his throat when he spots the Hanged Man Tarot card lying at his feet. A hand from behind him snatches the tube away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TONY, startled, turns to find himself looking up at DR. PARNASSUS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PARNASSUS is standing on a chair with the noose around his neck. He smiles and opens his hand. The metal tube has vanished.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TONY panics. The MOB is getting closer.
</DIRECTION>

With his other hand DR. PARNASSUS produces the tube from TONY'S ear.

He slides the tube down his throat and kicks the chair away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drops... dangles from the rope...the noose tight around his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the same moment, the MOB resumes normal speed and roars up the mountain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is PARNASSUS dead?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Working very fast, TONY hoists him over his shoulder and wrestles the noose loose. He drops PARNASSUS on the ground. He's stunned but still alive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MOB is closing in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TONY slaps DR. PARNASSUS hard between the shoulder blades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tube pops out of the DOCTOR'S gullet. TONY catches it.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>

	Gotcha!

<DIRECTION>
TONY swallows the tube as the MOB surge around the gibbet, grabbing him, beating him, and then lifting him onto the chair, tightening the noose around his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Although battered, TONY winks smugly at DR. PARNASSUS, but his mood changes when he sees DR. PARNASSUS spit out several more fake tubes, then, gagging, force the real one up and out of his gullet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a look of realization and horror, TONY drops to his death as the MOB kicks the chair away from under him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MOB cheers. Yes, he's dead.

DR. PARNASSUS tosses the metal tube to MR NICK who steps coolly out of the MOB, cigarette in his mouth.

There is no proper road, only endless sand, but nevertheless DR. PARNASSUS reaches a signpost which indicates two distinct paths.
