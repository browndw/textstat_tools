</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPER: AUTUMN, 1987
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A line of PASSENGERS about to board a Pan Am flight to London.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK CAMPBELL, 22, head full of long unkempt hair, Tom Selleck mustache, the hopeful look of youth in his eyes... sitting next to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KATE REYNOLDS, 21, pretty, Dorothy Hamill haircut... rubbing the tears from her swollen red eyes...
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got you a few necessities...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate hands Jack a new copy of Vonnegut's "Cat's Cradle."
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your copy was a mess...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack accepts the book but he's unable to take his eyes off Kate. She hands him a cassette.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All in one tape?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I also put side two of London Calling on there...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate leans over and kisses him passionately on the lips.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was not officially the goodbye kiss. It was just an interim kiss...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her, his eyes welling up. He pulls her close, kissing her deeply. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This will be the final boarding call for Pan Am flight 4 to London, Heathrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
Jack takes Kate's hand, getting up, turning sadly to the gate.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have your ticket?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack pulls out a BLUE PAN AM TICKET ENVELOPE. Kate nods. They embrace and kiss again. As they separate.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not even gonna say it, Kate. Maybe it'll be like I never left...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack takes one lastlook at her, then heads for the gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate stands there, watching him go. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...a moment of intuition. Something isn't right. She looks at Jack, about to disappear into the jetway, trying to decide...
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack turns. Kate approaches him.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a bad feeling about this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About the plane? What do you think it's gonna crash? Don't say that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking her head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know we've talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do. But in my heart... this feels wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at the gate...the last few passengers are boarding, then back into Jack's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't go, Jack...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean don't go at all? What about my internship?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For us, Kate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right, for us. But...I'm afraid that if you get on that plane...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Kate looks at him, pleading with her eyes, but she can't say...
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(torn)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go. I'm sorry, you should just go...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(thinking, then...)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you're right. What are we doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're being responsible. Go. Get on the plane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes narrow as he measures her determination...
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (a smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the hell outta my sight. You bother me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
A laugh from Jack. Kate gives him a calm smile and a nod - it's not entirely convincing but it's enough for Jack.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(resolute)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I'm going...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
He takes her in his arms one last time and hugs her tight. Jack looks toward the gate, the line disappearing...Kate grasps his shirt tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't seem to let go of you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hear me complaining about that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
A sober look in Jack's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, we're at the airport and no one ever thinks clearly at the airport so we should just trust the decision we already made. You've been accepted to one of the best law schools in the country, I've got this internship at Barclay's Bank. We have a great plan, honey...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Kate nods, then, with resolve...
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to do something great, Jack? Let's flush the plan...start our lives right now, today...I don't know what that life's gonna look like but I do know it has both of us in it. And I choose us...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack is jolted by her words.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The plan doesn't make us great, Jack. What we have together, that's what makes us great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Her words sink in...A long moment of decision...He looks toward the gate, only one person left in line...back to Kate...imploring him with her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally...He kisses her deeply on the lips...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you, Kate...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
...a smile from Kate...relief...then...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (taking her face in his hands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and a year in London's not gonna change that. A hundred years couldn't change that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack gives her one final kiss then walks pensively to the gate, handing the attendant his ticket, not able to look back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate watches him go, tears streaming down her face, as the gate door closes behind him. She waits, almost willing it to open again...waiting...waiting...but it doesn't...

Close in on the bed where JACK CAMPBELL, now 35, sans mustache and long hair, opens his eyes. A FLASH of bright morning light from the window. Jack shields his eyes, turning his head toward the bathroom where he sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WOMAN'S BACK...draped in a towel...an incredible back, neither flabby nor overly toned, beautifully curved...Jack focuses on it a moment. As the woman turns to him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAULA. Beautiful, late 20s, a toothbrush in her mouth...
</DIRECTION>
<PAULA>

A playful smile from Paula.

Jack grabs his Frank Mueller watch from the night stand, puts it on his wrist. He looks at Paula as she slips the dress on.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>

Another LAUGH. Even Jack lets out a good-natured chuckle.

	No...

Jack looks up as PETER LASSITER, 60s, founder and chairman of P.K. Lassiter and Associates, saunters into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<LASSITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eight forty-five on Christmas Eve and Jack Campbell is still at his desk. There's a Hallmark moment for you...

Lassiter heads to the bar like he's done it a million times.

Jack glances at Adelle, then looks back at Lassiter.

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question. An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<LASSITER>

	You suddenly having trouble getting dates?

</LASSITER>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not by a long shot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<LASSITER>

Jack is alone in the office working on his computer, checking spreadsheets on a large flat screen monitor.

Jack leans back in his chair rubbing his eyes. He checks his watch. It's past eleven. He gets up, goes to the window, sees the city in all its Christmas glory, then he see it...

SAM WONG, 20s, is with his 80-year-old GRANDFATHER behind the counter. There's a NERDY COLLEGE KID at the salad bar, a drunken DEPARTMENT STORE SANTA at the liquor display, a WOMAN with a BABY in an aisle and...

	Hey, c'mon...

In a flash, Cash whips a .38 from the back of his pants, aiming it at Jack's face. The woman SCREAMS, covers her baby.

Jack casually takes the egg nog out of the bag, opens the carton...

<DIRECTION>
INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack walks in and throws his keys on a table. He takes off his gloves and overcoat, glances at the mail, then heads into the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the large windows we see snow falling...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack, flat on his back in bed, fast asleep...

<DIRECTION>
:SC: CHAPTER FOUR - A DIFFERENT LIFE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE, MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close in on Jack's face, bathed in morning light...he opens his eyes...feels something strange...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks down...there's a woman's head resting on his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A look of confusion crosses his face...trying to remember... did he meet a woman last night...?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns his head to find a large MUTT sitting faithfully beside the bed, wagging his tail...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...did she have a dog?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down at the woman again, craning his neck to get a look at her face. And then he sees her...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...KATE REYNOLDS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...now 34 and even more beautiful, a look of utter contentment on her radiant face, sleeping soundly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His head darts around the room - it's cramped and lived in, clothes and toys are strewn about, family photos on the dresser, Laura Ashley curtains, a tiny poster bed and a charming little bay window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He instinctively reaches for his Franck Mueller watch on the night stand, but it's not there. It's a Timex Indiglo and it reads, "7:57 A.M..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks back at Kate...he rubs his eyes...maybe it's a dream...but nothing changes. Then, Kate stirs...
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmmm...ten more minutes, Jack... it's Christmas...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack jumps as he hears Kate talk for the first time...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the door bursts open...A SIX YEAR OLD GIRL, ANNIE, in a little nightgown, walks into the room carrying an 18 MONTH OLD BOY, JOSH, SINGING at the top of her lungs...
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jingle bells, Santa s mells, Rudolph laid an egg...la la la, la-la la la, la la la la la...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Annie places Josh on the bed and then jumps up herself. She gestures to the dog, patting the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You too, Luce...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
The dog faithfully jumps on the tiny bed, joining everybody else and leaving very little room. Annie starts jumping.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rise...and...shine...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(stirring)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're jumping, sweetheart...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks at this activity like a man at his own funeral.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom, don't you think we need to open the presents?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(groggy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Josh crawls directly up to Jack's stomach, climbing on.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Dad. Get up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
She said "Dad."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That's it. Jack moves the baby gingerly over, then gets out of bed, stumbling over a baseball bat lying next to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up the bat...the same Willie Mays autograph bat that was encased in glass in his N.Y. apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frightened, Jack drops the bad, looking down at himself for the first time...he's naked...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...a mortified look on his face as he sees the kids on the bed...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...he quickly grabs a pair of sweat pants and a yellow cardigan off the chair and throws them on...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate, still half asleep, reaches out her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack turns by instinct. Kate grabs him, drawing him near. A look of fear on his face as Kate opens her eyes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eye contact...Jack's certain he's about to hear her scream...
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (still groggy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strong coffee, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
She lets him go as Jack backs out the door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE LIVING ROOM - SECONDS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A garishly decorated Christmas tree sits in the middle of this messy and disorganized living room, a bevy of gifts underneath and four red stockings over the fireplace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack darts to the top of the steps...
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (calling from the bedroom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Use an entire can if you have to!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks back at the bedroom, then at the stairs...quickly heading down the CREAKY steps, still in shock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs an overcoat from a hook by the front door...about to step out when he looks down and realizes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...he's barefoot. He glances at a pair of rubber over- boots sitting by the door, slips them on, just about to leave when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hears the sound of a KEY TURNING in the door lock...Jack looks at the door, not quite sure what to do...
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He races to a blue Dodge mini-van sitting in the driveway, a "My Ferrari Is In The Shop" sticker on the rear bumper. He climbs into the mini-van and peels out of the driveway...

</JACK>
<MRS_PETERSON>
	<DIALOGUE>

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A shelter?! I'm the richest guy in the building...I've got twice the square footage you have!

Cash gets a laugh out of Jack's overreaction...

</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
A look from Cash.
</DIRECTION>
<CASH>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CASH>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much time?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<CASH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As long as it takes to figure it out. Which, in your case, could be considerable.

</CASH>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I just want my life back. Now what's it gonna take? You wanna talk turkey? Let's talk turkey! How much money...?

Cash looks at Jack, relishing the moment. He flashes Jack a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<CASH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I look like I need your money. It doesn't work like that and I can't tell you why.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASH>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>

	That's it? That's all I get?! A glare?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<CASH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASH>
<DIRECTION>
Jack faces Cash, simmering...with frustration.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I don't have time for this right now. I'm in the middle of a deal...

SCREECH...Cash slams on the brakes...practically sending Jack through the windshield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack recovers, looks up...the car is parked right next to the mini-van.

<DIRECTION>
Cash pulls out a small plastic bag, holding it out to Jack...
</DIRECTION>
<CASH>
	<DIALOGUE>

Jack looks inside the bag, pulls out a BARBIE BICYCLE BELL. He looks at it curiously.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<CASH>
	<DIALOGUE>

</JACK>
<CASH>

<DIRECTION>
(gesturing to the mini-van)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy trails.

Jack looks out to the lonely street outside, then back to Cash.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you did this to me, you can't just leave me like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Cash looks at Jack, the desperation on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<CASH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. You want to know everything, I'll tell you everything. But not here. Let's get some air...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASH>

Jack's still a little unsure...he sees Cash open the driver side door...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(relieved)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, man...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack gets out of the car...and before he can even turn around, Cash's door SLAMS shut and the car takes off in a blast of horsepower...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack stands there gazing down the street, listening to the sound of the Ferrari shifting gears, disappearing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wind whips up...shivering, Jack looks toward the Lassiter Building, then to the plastic bag in his hand, and finally to the mini-van.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - LATE MORNING

<DIRECTION>
The blue mini-van snakes through the curved streets of the neighborhood, almost all the houses decorated for Christmas.

INT. MINI-VAN - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack's trying to find the house, a map unfolded on the steering wheel and the car's registration in his hand...

</DIRECTION>
<ARNIE>

<ARNIE>

A satisfied smile from Arnie, Jack's approval means something to him.
</DIRECTION>
<ARNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You and me, buddy. We know how to live...

	</DIALOGUE>
</ARNIE>

Jack doesn't respond, his eyes drawn to a softball team photo on the bar...Jack and Arnie kissing a huge trophy with the caption, "Plainfield, N.J. Softball League Champs, 1994."
</DIRECTION>
<ARNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	What am I saying? You don't need to hear that...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(back to Jack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, that's all. Is that you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARNIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ARNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Arnie walks Jack through his backyard...
</DIRECTION>
<ARNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, you fit the profile exactly. Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities. You start thinking...this isn't the life I dreamt about. Where's the romance, where's the joie de vivre? Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you can't have...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARNIE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(thinking, then...)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
A chuckle from Arnie.
</DIRECTION>
<ARNIE>

They arrive at...the backyard of the Campbell house... cluttered with a swing set, a dog run with chewed up lawn, and a wooden sun deck in the process of being built...

A blank stare from Jack as they arrive at the sliding glass door...Arnie faces Jack squarely, grabbing his shoulders and looking him in the eye.
</DIRECTION>
<ARNIE>

Arnie gives Jack a comforting smie...

<KATE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on a second...

<KATE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have any idea what you put us through today?! You walk out of here at 7:30 in the morning, don't tell me where you're going, or even that you're going, and I don't see you ‘til hours later. I had state troopers looking for you! I called hospitals...

(pointing at the phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</KATE>
<JACK>

</JACK>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack...don't even start...

</KATE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, you don't understand. I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...

A raised eyebrow from Kate. Jack moves around the room...

</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what, Jack? It's not funny this time. I'm really angry.

Annie rides excitedly out of the room on her bike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leaving Jack and Kate alone again...
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>

Jack sees the disappointment on her face...

</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm...I'm sorry.

</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Kate looks at him. He seems sincere enough...

	Look, we don't have time for this right now, we'll talk about it later. Now get dressed...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to his outfit)

</KATE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Party? Oh no, I can't go to a party...

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trust me on this Kate. I really don't think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.

Kate looks at him a moment, then shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>

The light comes on...

He glances around...the bathroom is small and it's cluttered with Kate's razors, loofah, skin creams...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...none of this stuff is his...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...he looks in the mirror again, his face revealing a forlorn sense of displacement...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack, wearing a down jacket, is being dragged down the street by Lucy, his breath condensing in the cold winter air. The dog sniffs at a hydrant and a couple of garbage cans, but isn't doing her business.

	Triage. It's your signature. You survey the damage, find out everything you can, you probe, leave nothing to chance. I'm just gonna have to go detective. How did you get Mentadent? You learned everything there was to know about toothpaste and then you pounced...

Kate is in bed, fast asleep.

Jack walks into the room, his face still red from the cold outside. He looks over at Kate, sleeping happily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes off his shirt and khakis, laying them neatly on the chair. He looks over at the pair of flannel pajamas folded on the dresser. He shakes his head, resigned, then dons the pajamas and climbs into bed...

INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE BEDROOM - MORNING

Morning light streams into the room. The clock reads, "7:14."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack opens his eyes – a burst of light hitting them from the window...like the morning light in his Manhattan loft...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches across the bed...it's empty...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A smile of hope from Jack as he puts his head back on the pillow...maybe it was only a day...Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of a baby CRYING from the next room...A pained look on Jack's face as he realizes he's still in Jersey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the baby is WAILING...Jack lies still a moment, hoping it'll stop...it doesn't. Then, he hears the sound of the SHOWER TURN ON in the bathroom.

He gets out of bed and walks to the bathroom...

Jack, in a robe, stands in front of a changing table, Josh laying happily on his back, playing with a set of plastic keys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack takes a fresh Huggies diaper and puts it next to the baby. He surveys Josh, scratching his chin and rubbing his hands like Indiana Jones. Josh playfully grabs at Jack's nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks over to Annie. She's still staring at him like he's a Martian. He looks at the instructions on the box of Huggies.

	You're not really our dad, are you?

Jack's driving, Annie buckled in the front seat...

It's like a Pep Boys with a Texas theme. A big retail store for tires and auto parts, and a repair bay for everything from alignments to brake jobs...

Jack walks to the tire bay where HECTOR, 40s, a Guatemalan mechanic in grease-stained coveralls, stands with TOMMY the salesman.

	Hell, you'll never guess. One Sydney Potter. That's Sydney Potter, Chief Executive Officer of BuyRite Transport. Only the third largest trucking company in the state. I even let the sonuvabitch win, which wasn't easy because the guy's been bashed in the head by Teamsters so many times his brain's like porridge.

There's no Stairmaster here, no leather sofa or bar...it's small, cramped and cluttered, the walls littered with tire inventory and price lists...

Jack takes a slow, sad lap around the office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He makes it to the small wooden desk at the far end of the room and sits down behind it...

On the desk are photos of Jack, Kate and the kids, a plastic Michelin Man model, a tire-themed day calendar and a small plastic figurine of a BOWLER, the word, "Bowlers Do It In An Alley" embossed on its base...

He surveys the desktop briefly, then opens the top drawer, finding a personal checkbook and looking inside...

He misses...

A KNOCK at the door...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, just send us what you sent us last month, okay...? And keep doing that until further notice...

He hangs up the phone as the door opens. Big Ed sticks his head in...

	Got a minute, Jack?

<JACK>

Big Ed walks in, followed by SYDNEY POTTER, 60s, a tough looking man...

<BIG_ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack, meet Sydney Potter, BuyRite Transport, one of Jersey's top businessmen...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIG_ED>
<DIRECTION>
Potter extends a hand, Jack rises from his chair, trying to place the name. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and a helluva bridge player. Ed's told me a lot about you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
They shake hands. Potter nods his head at Jack, immediately impressed. Big Ed is beaming.

<POTTER>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BIG_ED>
<DIRECTION>
A smile from Potter, then a serious look.
</DIRECTION>
<POTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's cut to the chase, Jack. Big Ed tells me you're the grease that makes the wheels turn around here. I need a new parts supplier for my fleet. You seem to have the parts. That we know. What we don't know is why the hell I should buy them from you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POTTER>
<DIRECTION>
Potter stares Jack down. But Jack's not about to be intimidated by him. He pauses, matching Potter's stare. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no idea...

</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
A surprised look from Potter. An anxious laugh from Big Ed.

	C'mon Jack...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIG_ED>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(to Potter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean it. From what I can tell, we're a mom and pop operation, we're already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack continues to stare down Potter.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So like I said, I don't have any idea why you should buy your parts from us...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
The staring match continues. Big Ed's getting more nervous. Potter's the first to blink.
</DIRECTION>
<POTTER>

Jack smiles.

<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The customer is always right. A cliché? Sure. The difference is, we mean it. We're small, we need our customers. We can't afford to disappoint them, ever. Yeah, you could go to some leviathan supplier, probably save a few pennies on the price of oil filters, but with us you get more than a supplier, you get a bridge partner...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
A smile from Potter. Jack gives Ed a wink. Ed watches, thrilled...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to bid hearts, we're right there with you. You feel the need to redouble, you're not going to get any argument from us...

<DIRECTION>
Potter nods at Jack. Jack moves in for the kill.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The big guys may have the high cards, but you know as well as I do, Sydney, high cards don't always take the trick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Potter pauses a minute, then...
</DIRECTION>
<POTTER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Big Ed, re: Jack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</POTTER>
<DIRECTION>
Big Ed smiles, letting out a relieved sigh.
</DIRECTION>
<BIG_ED>

	That's my boy...

Though neither side expressed significant regulatory concerns at the announcement press conference, it is believed that both the FDA and the FTC will be closely scrutinizing the marriage, the largest ever in the health care industry. When asked about possible anti- competitive implications, Global Chairman Bob Thomas referred reporters to P.K. Lassiter and Company President Alan Mintz, the original architect behind the deal...

</JACK>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is the general idea, yes...

Kate starts kissing him...but Jack's a little uncomfortable with the sudden intimacy...he pulls back, a little nervous.

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shouldn't we grab some dinner first? Maybe a bottle of wine...?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever you say...honey.

</JACK>

She starts kissing him again...but this time he just goes with it, and as her hands run through his hair he's brought back to a different time and place...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack momentarily pulls back and looks at her...it's like the first time he's really looked at her in eleven years...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>

	God...you're beautiful...

He turns onto his side and closes his eyes...

Kate emerges from the bathroom, she sees Jack on the bed, hears his breathing heavy with sleep...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At once charmed and disappointed, Kate sighs. She turns off the CD player and heads into bed.

She pulls the covers up over Jack, shutting off the light... She puts an arm around him, kissing him sweetly on the neck...

Jack glances at the Men's Dept., sighs and gives Kate a nod. She takes off with the kids...and then he sees it...

I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...I'm sick of it.

</JACK>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you're not. The Jack Campbell I married wouldn't need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if that's what it's gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids' college fund.

She glances again at the kids in the back seat, then at Jack.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A great success story...

INT. BOWLING ALLEY - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A crowded suburban New Jersey bowling alley...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack stands at a lane holding a bowling ball, the nickname "The Hammer" emblazoned over his bowling shirt pocket...He approaches the line and throws the ball down the lane...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's ugly...The ball caroms off the hardwood into the gutter.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ARNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S., from behind)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for god's sake!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack turns. Arnie and the BOWLING TEAM are in the scorekeeping area watching Jack make a mockery of the sport. Jack scowls.

	I'd like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...

</JACK>
<ARNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. Why am I so competitive!? Compensation, I guess. Look, just focus, Jack. You can still pick up the spare...

</ARNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack retrieves his ball, sets up, genuinely concentrating...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly, to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are Jack Campbell. You're better than this sport. You shot the rapids at Kenai. You ran with the bulls at Pamplona. You jumped out of a plane over the Mojave Desert, for Christ's sake. You can do this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack puts everything he has into the throw, heaving the ball down the lane with as much grace and power as he can muster...hitting the six pin and taking out four others.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (screaming, excited)

INT. BOWLING ALLEY - LATE

Jack walks out of the men's room, heading toward the lounge. He sees a familiar face walking toward him...a woman in a sexy little bowling outfit, carrying a bowling ball to a far lane.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi Jack...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
A moment of confusion as he tries to place the face. Then...

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Evelyn, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very funny. I saw you out there on lane five. What do you have the flu or something?

</EVELYN>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there something going on between us?

</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn's surprised at Jack's directness. She stands there a beat, then walks back toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are we finally being honest?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>

A look of surprise from Jack.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>

Jack considers this for a moment.

INT. BOWLING ALLEY, LOUNGE - SECONDS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack walks into the lounge, a little dazed. He heads over to Arnie who's having a beer at the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<ARNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at Jack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Jack, you're all flush. I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She wants to have an affair with me.

</JACK>
<ARNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She said that?

</ARNIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty much.

<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(pushing over a napkin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So could you write down her exact address?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ARNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack. You're not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARNIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wouldn't really be cheating...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Arnie's doubtful look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's complicated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ARNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, maybe I'm not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one. A little flirtation's harmless but you're playing with fire here. The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor. You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.

</ARNIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm telling you, those rules don't apply to me, Arn.

Jack looks at him curiously.

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, is that really necessary?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ARNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I'm saying it there isn't a guy in Union County who wouldn't give his left nut to be married to Kate...

Arnie takes one last swig of his beer and gets up...

<ARNIE>

INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack walks into the house carrying his bowling bag. He dumps the bag in the coat closet and walks into the kitchen where...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate is at the counter, her back to him, poring over some legal documents.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(not looking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How was the game, honey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(opening the fridge)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Long, boring, and generally pretty sad. Arnie seemed to enjoy it...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(peering inside)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, where's that chocolate cake...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Kate turns around, revealing a huge hunk of chocolate cake on a plate in front of her, a bite ready to go into her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(with a smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean this chocolate cake?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my piece. I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Kate takes the bite, a little piece of icing sticks to the side of her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's good...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack approaches the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gimme that cake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
She takes another bite.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
He makes a grab for the plate but she holds it out where he can't reach it.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, Jack. It's too important to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
They stare each other down a moment. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to swipe the plate. Kate jumps out of her chair, running out of the kitchen with the cake, laughing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack takes off after her...chasing her through the house... just about the catch up to her when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She darts up the stairs, still laughing...he follows her...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want that cake!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
...reaches up...grabs her shirt...pulls her down playfully on top of him...
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want the cake!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(out of breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him, then takes the whole piece in her hand and smooshes it right in his mouth...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Then, Jack starts laughing...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's good, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a big clump of it and smooshes it in her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stay there a moment, lying on the stairs, feeding each other cake, laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack leans back on the stairs. He looks at Kate's face, practically covered in cake, smiling, and realizes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...he hasn't laughed like this in thirteen years. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are the kids asleep?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
A sexy smile from Kate...they start kissing passionately right there on the steps...it's heating up...
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(caught up in the moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say it, Jack...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, you know what I like to hear...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(in the throes of passion)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(kissing him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then say it...just say it to me...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(swept up in the moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah, you're a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...I'm gonna take you to that special place...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Kate pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks up at her, he can practically see the passion drain from her face...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not it...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice, Jack. You're sweeping me off my feet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? You make me hot...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
She gets up and heads up the steps, disappearing into the bedroom...Jack shakes his head, frustrated. Then, he feels something licking at his hand...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down and sees Lucy standing next to him, wagging her tail, looking up at Jack with an "I've gotta go" look on her face. Jack heaves a sigh, then...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Lucy, maybe one of us can get a little relief tonight...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
He leads the dog toward the front door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack is walking Lucy. He passes a house that looks familiar to him. Then he sees it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...the name "THOMPSON" etched on the mailbox...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's the Thompson house, now sans the garish Christmas decorations, a drying Christmas tree tied up on the curb, ready to be picked up as garbage...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack stops, pulling the dog back, looking up at the house...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees a light on in the upstairs bedroom...the faint outline of a woman reading by the window...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EVELYN THOMPSON...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks around, sees the street is empty, then nudges the dog, leading her up the path to the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets to the front door...moves his hand up to the doorbell...but it's a tentative move...he keeps it there a moment, perched at the button...but for some reason he can't bring himself to push it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down the street, toward his own house, then to the window upstairs. Finally, he turns...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(pulling the leash)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, girl, let's go home...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE FOYER - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front door opens and Jack walks in with Lucy on a leash, his face red from the cold outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gives the dog a pat on the rump, then takes off his coat, hanging it and the leash on a hook by the door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks through the quiet house, into the living room, rubbing his hands together to warm them up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: CHAPTER ELEVEN – HOME MOVIES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes over to a glass bar stand and pours himself a scotch, taking a sip, letting the alcohol warm him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He strolls through the room, looking at some of the family photos framed and hanging on the wall, focusing on his own face in the pictures, studying the expressions...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves to a pile of video tapes sitting on a shelf, marked with titles like, "Trip to Yosemite, ‘96" and "Josh's 1st Birthday." He runs his fingers along the tapes, stopping at one marked, "Jack Singing." His eyes linger there a moment...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his drink down and pops the tape in the VCR...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a party for Kate's birthday thrown at the Kramers' house...same crowd of people as the Christmas party, cheesy "Happy Birthday" decorations.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The image jerks up and down, surveying the crowd...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bill Kramer at the piano, playing some light cocktail music ...Kate talking with a group of friends...
</DIRECTION>
<ARNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, Bill, this thing is an antique. Don't you even have image stabilization?

Bill stops playing and looks up at Arnie.

<BILL_KRAMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four hundred bucks at Best Buy, Arn.

</BILL_KRAMER>
<DIRECTION>
Then...Jack comes into frame, a confident smile on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And everyone knows image stabilization is for the weak...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack is jarred by the image of himself on the video...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack on TV...he smiles as Kate walks into frame, easily putting an arm around Jack...
</DIRECTION>
<ARNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So Jack, it's your wife's birthday, got anything to say to her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARNIE>

She slaps him playfully on the arm...

<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do have one thing I wanna say...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Kate looks at him expectantly. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT"D) (singing to her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh those fingers in my hair, that sly come hither stare, strips my conscience bare, it's witchcraft...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack doesn't have the greatest voice in the world but he's not the least bit self-conscious...and Kate seems to like it, there's a twinkle in her eye...some of the guests focus their attention on Jack and Kate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack winces, embarrassed, as he watches himself sing...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and I've got no defense for it, that heat is too intense for it, what good would common sense for it do...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Bill Kramer still at the piano, chimes in with the basic chords for "Witchcract," sounding it out as he goes along...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...‘Cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft...and although I know it's strictly taboo...when you rouse the need in me, my heart says yes indeed in me, proceed with what you're leadin' me to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
The camera catches the reactions of guests in the crowd... the women, smiles on their faces, wrapped up in the romance of the moment. Envy on the men's faces as they watch Jack serenade his wife...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A musical interlude from Bill as Jack takes off his jacket...some HOOTS and HOLLERS from the crowd...Arnie captures the image of Kate whistling at her husband...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Arnie follows with the camera as Jack strolls in front of the gathered guests...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's such an ancient pitch, but one that I'd never switch, there ain't no nicer witch than you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack watches himself move gracefully. But it's no longer embarrassment on his face, it's fascination...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back in the video, the camera catches Evelyn Thompson watching longingly as Jack moves back toward Kate...Evelyn can't take it anymore, she abruptly turns and walks toward the kitchen...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack raises an eyebrow...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the video...Jack approaches Kate, she couldn't have a more delighted look on her face. He picks up the verse...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	‘Cause it's witchcraft, that koo koo witchcraft...and although I know it's strictly taboo...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
The camera pans across the crowd, even the men are getting into it, focused on Jack as he sings lovingly, unashamed, to his wife...Nick Careli mouths the words along with Jack, almost as if he's studying him, revering him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack watches the TV, seeing Nick do this...maybe he underestimated his alter ego...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the video...Jack staring into Kate's eyes...

Jack kisses her on the lips...HOOTS and HOLLERS from the crowd.

	<DIALOGUE>
	‘Cause there's no nicer witch than you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Kate brushes a hand across Jack's face...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smash cut to Jack watching this...seeing the connection, the heat between them...coveting it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back to the video...the music building...the crowd completely in the palm of Jack's hand...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)

<JACK>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...than you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
A little musical flourish from Bill as the crowd breaks out into huge CHEERS and APPLAUSE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack, watching this other version of himself in the video, the center of attention, larger than life, focused on Kate...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back on video...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (speaking quietly to Kate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy Birthday sweetheart...I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Kate leans over, giving Jack a deep kiss...OOHS and AHHS from the crowd...but Jack and Kate are in their own little world...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack continues to watch himself on the video, his smile fading, becoming a look of realization...then loss...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tear at the corner of his eye...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SOUND fades in Jack's head as the action in the video continues...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's left standing there...silent, still...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAMPBELL MASTER BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lucy licking Jack's face. Jack pushes the dog away...as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ALARM RINGS. Kate pushes the button to stop it.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(groggy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time to get up, honey...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack obliges without question, getting out of bed, putting on a robe and slippers and exiting, still practically half-asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - SECONDS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack walks into the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns on the Mr. Coffee, gets a bottle from the fridge, throws it in the microwave, removes it, and heads upstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JOSH'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...into Josh's room. Josh is wide awake, standing up in his crib, like a prisoner in a cell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack gives him the bottle, pats his head perfunctorily, and then walks out of the room...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: CHAPTER TWELVE - HAPPY ANNIVERSARY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and back into the bedroom to find Kate, sitting on the bed, a wrapped present in front of her and a wide smile on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack stops, raising an eyebrow at the gift. He looks behind, as if to ask whether it's for him, then back to Kate.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy Anniversary, honey...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Terror on Jack's face.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (pushing the gift forward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before you do whatever crazy stunt you've got planned I want you to open mine...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack musters up a smile, then approaches the gift.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I should wait...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, open it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
He hesitates, then begins unwrapping the package, revealing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...a suit, similar in color and style to the Zegna suit...
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I found it at an outlet store. I know it's a knock-off, but I think it'll look great on you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(examining the label)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zeena...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack is overcome with emotion...Yes, it's a ZEENA, but this is probably the nicest thing anyone's ever done for him...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (tearing up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really are incredible...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enjoy it, sweetheart...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks at Kate's expectant face, suddenly remembering how truly screwed he is.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're probably expecting something from me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
He's sweating bullets...watching as Kate gets a quizzical look on her face...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's the thing. I really hadn't planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(an uncomfortable smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, anniversary's good all day...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about? You never wait all day. You can barely wait until it's light out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know that, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Kate looks at him like she's looking into his soul.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You forgot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack stands there, silent.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You actually forgot our anniversary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll fix it. I'll go out right now and get you something. I'll make it right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
That didn't help.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(holding back the tears)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, Jack...Is this where we are now? Is this our marriage? Suddenly I'm the wife who has to drop hints two weeks before her anniversary so her husband doesn't fuck it up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack sees a tear run down her face...a pang of guilt on his...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't cry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Kate wipes the tear away but they just keep coming.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking her head, crying)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to be that, Jack...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack approaches her, holding out a hand but Kate pushes it away, gets up and walks toward the bathroom...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack is left standing alone, holding Kate's gift...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRONT PORCH - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack emerges from the house, steps out onto the porch for some air...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes his head, a mixture of frustration and self- pity on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He notices Annie's bike leaning against the side of the porch, and the bell that Cash gave him sitting on its handle bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a step toward it, and gives the bell a gentle RING ...he looks around, as if he's expecting someone to appear ...but there's no one. He RINGS the bell again, louder this time, really trying to attract someone's attention.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon...c'mon...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing. Finally, he lifts the bike up in the air, RINGING the bell with everything he's got...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (shouting to the sky)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, goddamnit, how was I supposed to know the date of their anniversary!? I never married her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Pull back...Annie in the doorway...looking at him.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(slowly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put the bicycle back on the ground...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack turns and sees her, gently lowering the bicycle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAMPBELL HOUSE KITCHEN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack is mixing a glass of chocolate milk. Annie, arms folded, is waiting expectantly. He finishes, sliding the glass to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a long sip, puts the glass down, a chocolate milk mustache on her lip.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not bad...I shoulda warned you. Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One year he had a solar system named after her...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you think that's a little gimmicky?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom liked it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack raises an eyebrow.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe there's a jewelry store back at the mall. I could get her a pair of earrings or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good but...you did forget the anniversary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. That's a major oversight...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(thinking aloud)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So if I'm Kate...I can't really afford the finer things, my husband's career is a crushing disappointment to me, I'm trapped in suburbia...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Then...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he ever take her to the City?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Annie smiles, impressed.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're really gettin' the hang of this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a look of confidence comes over Jack's face. For the first time, he seems like a man in control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Annie is sitting on the bed watching her mother get dressed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate, wearing a silky slip, walks out of her closet carrying two dresses on hangers, a red one and a sexy little black one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate holds out the two dresses to Annie.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Annie thinks about it for a moment, taking it very seriously...
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The black one...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate nods. She's about to put it on when she looks at Annie...
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fighting's a part of it, Annie. You know that, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not worried, Mom. He's still learning our ways...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate looks at her with a raised eyebrow, then nods. It's true. She puts down the dress and holds out a hand to Annie.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate leads her to the makeup table, then opens a lipstick...
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(excited)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate nods then applies some red lipstick to Annie's lips.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now go like this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate rubs her lips together, showing Annie how to do it. Annie mimics her Mom, then Kate looks at her – Annie's beaming.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're gonna break a lot of hearts, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
A smile from Annie...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pull back to reveal...Jack standing at the door, watching ...appreciating the kind of mother Kate is...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOIRE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small, elegant French restaurant hidden on a tree- lined lower Manhattan street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOIRE - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack is wearing the suit Kate gave him. It's not a Zegna, but he looks pretty damn good.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leads Kate toward the cloak room at this intimate restaurant...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He helps her off with her coat. Kate's wearing the sexy little black dress and we can immediately see its effectiveness...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look beautiful...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
A charmed smile from Kate as she hands Jack her coat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack hands the coats over to the COAT CHECK GIRL...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (instinctively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Catherine...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack fakes a SNEEZE, trying to cover up...Kate gives him a pat on the back...
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
He takes Kate by the arm...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
He leads her to the main room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks out at the room, elegant tables, French country decor, a PIANIST playing Cole Porter...
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly to Jack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack...can we afford all this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the difference? I'm taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you even know about this place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack's caught for a moment. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arnie...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(insistent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arnie. He'll throw you a curve ball once in a while, that's for sure...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack puts his arm around her and kisses her on the cheek...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOIRE - A LITTLE LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack and Kate sit at a secluded table, a WAITER standing next to them. Jack's not even looking at the menu.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll have the tureen of quail breast with shiitake mushrooms to start, then the veal medallions in raspberry truffle sauce and the sea scallops with pureed artichoke hearts...sea scallops, North of the Caspian...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Kate looks at Jack, a mixture of confusion and awe on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very good, sir. And may I say those are all excellent selections.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITER>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(perusing the wine list)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Also, we'll have a bottle of Lafite, 1982.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Kate reaches over and pulls down the wine list, reading it upside down.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's five hundred and fifty dollars, Jack!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
A wince from Jack...for a moment there it was almost perfect.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a glass of red wine for each of us...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
The waiter nods, then walks toward the kitchen...
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are so not off the hook yet, slick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm gettin' close, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
A noncommittal nod from Kate. Then Jack notices her look over at the pianist, drawn in by the music.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to dance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
A puzzled look from Kate. There's nobody else dancing. There isn't even much room to dance...
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think there's dancing here, Jack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack gets up and holds out a hand.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure there is...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Kate looks around again, then she smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate rises, taking his hand. Jack takes her in his arms, swaying slowly in the limited amount of space, confident and self-assured.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pianist looks up, smiling, appreciating their role in this romantic moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate moves with Jack, following his lead comfortably. They look good together...in sync with each other...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People are watching them...some of the men are impressed, others are scoffing, but the women are clearly charmed...
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering to Jack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty good for a tire salesman from Jersey...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack flashes her his most charming smile.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have my moments...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
They continue to dance, in a world of their own...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOIRE - LATE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack and Kate at the table enjoying a gourmet meal. Jack holds out a fork with a piece of veal for Kate. She takes a bite.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmmm...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(spearing a scallop)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...here, try one of these...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack takes a scallop from Kate's fork.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(savoring the scallop)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God I missed that taste...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Kate laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you laughing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Kate shoots him a look of curiosity. Jack looks back at her, sees the trust in her face...He puts down his fork.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to tell you something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it may help us but there's a slight chance it could make things worse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
She hears the seriousness in his voice.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I'm worried...just say it. Whatever it is we'll deal with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
She nods. Jack searches his mind for the right words. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel like I'm living someone else's life...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks to her, expecting the worst. But she just nods reassuringly. He continues...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used to be so sure about everything, you know? I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Worse, you mean...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Well, maybe a few things. But mostly just different...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack lets out a small smile. Now he's the one who's reassuring Kate.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never used to be like this, Kate. I had it all figured out. No doubts, no regrets.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now...I don't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her, staring into her eyes, almost desperate for understanding.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me neither.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
A raised eyebrow from Jack.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's good to be a little unsure about who you are. It's very human.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you always seem so certain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Jack, you think there aren't mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I'm doing in New Jersey...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a big one for me, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and you've seen my pay check.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean yes, I help people that need it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess...some of them are probably faking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(a laugh, then...)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a CD player...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles, right there with her.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's wonderful...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Kate laughs, nodding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pause, then...
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think about it, too, Jack. I do. I think about the kind of person I'd be if I hadn't married you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
It's as if she's inside his head. They stay like this for a moment, looking into each other.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
She stops a moment, considering. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I realize I've just erased the things in my life I'm most sure about. You, the kids...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack nods.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good things...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<KATE>

The door opens and Jack, carrying Kate in his arms, enters...

Kate kisses him...when their lips separate, we can see the powerful effect it has on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks deep into her eyes, stroking her hair, lost in her.

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're so...beautiful...

<DIRECTION>
Jack's eyes open...adjust to the light. He looks over at Kate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's something different in his eyes...something deeper. Jack smiles...a broad, "I'm in love" kind of smile.

Kate stirs, gently stroking Jack's chest.

Annie walking through the downstairs of the house, practicing her violin...it's a noise bordering on MUSIC, but not quite...

<DIRECTION>
She walks into the kitchen where...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack stands at the counter in his robe, reading the Newark Star Ledger and drinking a cup of coffee.

He lowers the paper, watches Annie with a smile as she strolls through the room playing her violin badly...he goes back to his paper.

The front door of the Campbell House...

Jack emerges in his work clothes, putting his coat on, a bagel in his mouth...

<DIRECTION>
He disappears from frame, the screen door closing slowly behind him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a moment...Kate appears at the door, a cup of coffee in her hand...she follows Jack with her eyes as he heads to the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then...a smile from Kate...

In a moment...Jack returns to frame and heads straight into Kate's arms...

He gets to the phone...sees the light for line two blinking ...he looks back outside, sees Kenny approach Lassiter...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...back to the blinking phone light...he picks up the phone...

But can't bring himself to hit the blinking light. Then...

Jack leaning back in his chair, behind the desk of his cluttered, cramped office.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...truth is, Mintz was so busy timing his wife's breathing he didn't see that MedTech needed Global more than the other way around. Ten days, two weeks tops, they would've approached you with an offer, and I'd bet anything it would've been thirty billion, not twenty nine...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a knowing smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Problem was, Peter, you had a pussycat running the show. What you needed was a rottweiler.

Lassiter, sitting on the little chair across from Jack, an intrigued look on his face...

He's jarred back to reality, a little crestfallen...

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. We're going to have to special order that tire. It'll be ready in about two days.

Lassiter nods, then takes a business card out of his wallet.

INT. ALAN MINTZ'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

It's Jack's old office but you wouldn't know it from the decor...lots of country pine, a fabric sofa, and a play pen where the bar used to be. Jack enters, immediately struck by the difference...

	So, Peter mentioned that you were an avid CNBC watcher but didn't say whether you had any actual Wall Street experience?

Jack's a little taken aback by the question, not realizing he was walking into an interview...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses his legs, trying to get comfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A broker? Really. And now you're in the tire business?

	That's right. And auto supply...

	Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.

</ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
Jack nods...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.

</JACK>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We did one point seven million in total revenue...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>

Jack pauses, analyzing the situation...the patronizing questions, the smirk on Mintz's face...
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)

	Any thoughts at all on that?

</ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
He stops, takes a moment, looking at Mintz and Lassiter then ...a confident smile.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Alan, I think we're gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really. So you're projecting what, a tad over two million?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
A gleam in Jack's eye.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. And that would make us number one in our market...

	You mind if I stand?

</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
A raised eyebrow from Mintz.

Mintz and Lassiter follow Jack with their eyes as he crosses the room to the desk, pours himself a glass of water...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year. And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(a confident chuckle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay, Alan. I get it. I'm in your shoes, I'm thinking exactly the same thing...but here's the thing. Business is business. Wall Street, Main Street, it's all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell they're gonna send their kids to college. It's just people...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack's confidence is throwing Mintz off, but Lassiter appears intrigued...

	<DIALOGUE>
	What about me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day. You're an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch...

Jack looks around the office then back to Mintz.

<JACK>

	Okay...you smoke Hoyo de Monterreys. You're a scotch man, single malt, not because it's trendy but because you've been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. You have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. You wept openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand...

Lassiter returns Jack's gaze with equal intensity. In a moment, he turns to Mintz.

They turn a corner, coming into a deserted section of the corridor.

Mintz stops, turning to Jack. Jack returns Mintz's gaze with a quizzical look.

<ALAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's cut the shit, huh Campbell? What, did you go through his wallet or something?

</ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
Jack's a little taken aback.
</DIRECTION>
<ALAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No matter. That circus act back there may have dazzled Lassiter momentarily but it doesn't do shit forme. Even if you get this job, which I highly doubt, let me warn you, Lassiter loses interest in his pet projects very quickly. I'm in the big office because I've proved myself to him year after year and nobody is going to come in here and start turning the old man's head. Especially not some tire salesman from New Jersey. So you watch yourself and stay away from Lassiter, and maybe, just maybe, I'll keep you on after he gets tired of you. Do we understand each other?
	</DIALOGUE>

Jack stands there, staring at Mintz, silent, expressionless.

	I don't think you're hearing me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALAN>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm hearing you, Alan. That's not the problem. The problem is that what you think is yours, is really mine. And I don't care how low on the totem pole I start, I will get it back...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(poking him in the chest)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So do yourself a favor and don't get too attached to that view because sometime soon, maybe very soon, you and your French country antiques, your chintz sofa, and your little play pen are gonna be moving out of that office.

	No, this is the center of the universe. If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else? Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.

	Kate. You're not understanding me. I'm talking about a great life. A perfect life. Everything we pictured when we were young. The whole package. You said it yourself, life has thrown us surprises, and so we made sacrifices. But now I can finally get us back on track...

A nod from Jack...
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you what, Jack, if you're ever in Paris, look me up. Maybe we'll go for that cup of coffee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
One of the movers passes by Jack carrying a box...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks at Kate, flush with the realization that this isn't the same woman he knew thirteen years ago, or left yesterday.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. Goodbye, Kate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
He leaves...

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A scratchy Zeppelin album, the song "All Of My Love," fills the room. Jack, a fifth of Bushmill's by his side, goes through the box Kate gave him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He removes a worn leather jacket, feeling the soft material, then a "Mondale for President" button, which Jack smiles upon seeing, a couple Neil Young concert ticket stubs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He puts the leather jacket on, then sticks the Mondale button on the lapel. He digs back into the box, finding...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A messy, dog-eared copy of "Cat's Cradle"...not the one Kate gave him at the airport, the one she replaced...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks at it for a moment...lost in his sadness... then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks over at the clock, it reads, "8:29."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
EXT. VAN WYCK EXPRESSWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack in his Ferrari, racing down the highway at 120 MPH...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at the clock, it reads, "8:46." He opens up the throttle...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KENNEDY AIRPORT, UNITED TERMINAL - MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Snow is falling as Jack's car races up to the terminal then stops. He jumps out. An AIRPORT SECURITY GUARD sees him...
</DIRECTION>
<AIRPORT_SECURITY_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you can't leave that there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIRPORT_SECURITY_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
Jack runs into the terminal, ignoring the guard...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNITED TERMINAL - SECONDS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looking at the board. The nine o'clock to Paris - Gate 8A. Jack sprints toward the gate...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNITED TERMINAL, GATE AREA - SECONDS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and gets there just as the flight is boarding. Jack looks through the crowd, spotting Kate near the front of the line, about to hand her ticket to the gate attendant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes through the throng of people, drawing some annoyed stares, finally making his way over to Kate.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(calling out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kate!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Kate turns and sees Jack, a look of puzzlement on her face.

	Jack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. Let's just go have a cup of coffee. That's all I'm asking for. I'm sure there's another flight to Paris tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack just stands there, unsure...
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well it is. Yes, I was heartbroken ...But I got over it. I moved on. People change, Jack. I changed. I don't know why you suddenly feel the need to revisit that time in our lives but I assure you, it's over...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate turns her back to Jack, leaving him standing there...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He watches her walk to the podium, realizing she's right...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees Kate reach the podium...hand her ticket to the attendant...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, a look of determination crosses his face...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(at Kate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have a house in Jersey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Kate turns to him with a look that could kill.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do this, Jack... But he continues...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
...Kate looks at him, half-mortified, half- interested...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Annie's not much of a violin player but she tries really hard. She's a little precocious but that's only because she says what's on her mind. And when she smiles...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack shakes his head, remembering, fighting back the tears...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Josh...he has your eyes. He doesn't say much but we know he's smart...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(lost in the memory)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...he's always got his eyes open, always watching us... sometimes you can look at him and just know that he's learning something new... it's like witnessing a miracle...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Kate's expression has sifted from annoyance to curiosity.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...well, after a hundred twenty two more payments it will be...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack begins walking slowly toward Kate...the world of the airport going on around him, Jack not caring...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you...you're a non- profit lawyer. That's right, completely non-profit. But that doesn't seem to bother you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Kate raises an eyebrow. It's something she's thought about.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And we're in love. After thirteen years of marriage we're still unbelievably in love...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with a chuckle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You won't even let me touch you until I've said it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack gets closer and closer...Kate's spellbound now... imagining the picture Jack's painting...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I sing to you...not all the time but definitely on special occasions...
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Jack walks into a piece of carry-on luggage sitting by a row of passengers...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We made a lot of sacrifices, dealt with our share of surprises, but we stayed together...

<DIRECTION>
Jack's nearly there...

<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see, you're a better person than I am...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Not in this life, and Kate knows it...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and it made me a better person to be around you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Kate is perfectly still, Jack's words echoing in her ears.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it was all a dream. Maybe I went to bed one lonely night in December and imagined it all. But I swear, nothing's ever felt more real to me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
He's right in front of her. She can't take her eyes off him.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if you get on that plane right now, it'll disappear forever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Jack and Kate in their own little world...airport business going on around them...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know we can both go on with our lives. And we'd both be fine. But I've seen what we can be like together...And I choose us...

</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack's words resonate in her ears. He gently touches a hand to her arm...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Kate, one cup of coffee. You can always go to Paris. Just please, not tonight...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
She stands there, frozen, staring into Jack's eyes, searching for the answer.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Jack...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:

<DIRECTION>
INT. AIRPORT - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack and Kate, framed in the window of a nearly empty airport coffee shop...through the window, we see snow falling outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From a distance we see them...TALKING and LAUGHING over a cup of coffee...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
