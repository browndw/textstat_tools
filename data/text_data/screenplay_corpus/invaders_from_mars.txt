A large, forbidding military installation. Set back off the road with chainlink fences around it. Sign in front, illuminated by spotlights, reads:

GROVE AIR FORCE BASE, AIR DEFENSE COMMAND, COLORADO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In front is a GUARD STATION with two SENTRIES. An occasional jet test FIRING in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A car -- a small white FORD -- comes CAREENING up to the sentry box, doing a good 65 mph. The M.P.s snap to, made nervous by the car's approach. They flag it down.

In the car are a CRAZED WOMAN and a FRIGHTENED BOY.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLONEL WILSON -- a handsome, sturdy looking man of middle age -- is standing in his office with an AIDE (SERGEANT RINALDI) -- both of them looking out the window at something we can't see. The PHONE RINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sgt. Rinaldi picks it up.

INTERIOR - AIR FORCE JEEP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WOMAN and the BOY with two M.P.s, being driven across the Air Base. The BOY is 11 years old, and scared-looking. The WOMAN is attractive, in her late 20's, wearing a white nurse's uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights are on all over the base. Jeeps coming and going.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the Boy -- looking around as they drive -- SEES something, and tugs at the Woman's arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks where he is pointing. He points out TWO AIR FORCE MEN in Air Force blue, loading some equipment into an Air Force PICKUP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Woman and the Boy's faces show grave concern as they stare at the TWO AIRMEN by the pickup. They say nothing.
</DIRECTION>

The Woman and the Boy are escorted in by an AIDE (CAPTAIN CURTIS). Colonel Wilson shakes their hands.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First I have to look at the back of your neck.

The Colonel looks baffled. Exchanges glances with Sgt. Rinaldi.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's serious, Colonel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
Rinaldi watches suspiciously as the Colonel turns and lets Jimmy look at the back of his neck. The boy studies his neck closely, pulling down his collar.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. I had to be sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<COL_WILSON>

Jimmy and Linda look at each other again.

JIMMY is escorted in and set down on a bench by MRS. McKELTCH. She's 60, heavy, odd-looking. Her hair up in a bun. A "mother hen" type but a bit malignant.

She interrupts the two women who are in the waiting room, chatting.

	She'll be out in just a second.

Just Jimmy and her. She looks at him closely. Waiting for him to speak. He just looks at her -- then away. Linda smiles.

	You look like you're feeling better. I'm here to help you. Is there anything you want to talk about?

	It's okay. I'm here to help.

	First ... can I see the back of your neck?

Surprised, Linda hesitates a second. Odd request. Then turns in her chair -- and lifts her hair up off the back of her neck. Jimmy looks -- sees perfect, unblemished, white skin.

<JIMMY>

	<DIALOGUE>

Jimmy looks at the DOOR. Mrs. McKeltch's SHADOW is on the glass.

Linda gets up and opens the door.

Mrs. McKeltch's back straightens like a ramrod -- she looks daggers at Linda -- but moves back several paces from the door.

A red and purple wisp of stars and gas hanging deep in space ...

<DIRECTION>
TILT DOWN: to a small planetarium device, glowing in a dark room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIMMY is looking at the constellations, projected on his bedroom ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns the planetarium device off. Gets out of bed in his pajamas and goes to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He can see the city -- from 10 stories up. All the lights and distant buildings from his apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small telescope stands by the window, on a tripod. He uses it to look at the Moon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the b.g. we can HEAR CONVERSATION going on in another room in the apartment.

<DIRECTION>
Jimmy climbs back under the blankets and looks out -- through the crack in the door -- at his MOM and DAD in the next room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIMMY'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The slightly ajar door offers him a sliver of a view and MUFFLED CONVERSATION. He can SEE his parents having dinner with a MAN. Late-night talk, cigar smoke, the CLINK of GLASSES, dishes on the table. Their conversation is strange to an 11-year-old ear -- available only in snatches and bits -- and then not completely understandable at that.
</DIRECTION>
<DAD>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night ... night ... George. Talk to me from there.

The apartment door opens and closes. Quiet. The SOUNDS of his parents coming toward his room ... passing in the hall outside. They stop.

Jimmy and his Dad make their way up a twisting path. Through a dense pine forest, to the crest of the ridge. An old wooden handrail marks the path and disappears in the bushes in the valley.

<DIRECTION>
From the crest they can see the town in the distance. A lonely, lovely spot. Breathtaking. Jimmy and his Dad take it all in in the dying light.

Jimmy and his Dad sitting out.

The door to his room closes. Dark. Moonlit. Jimmy pushes the covers back and goes to the window. His small TELESCOPE waiting for him. Sitting on the sill, lit by the moon. Jimmy tries looking through it at the meteorites. They're hard to find. He goes back to watching with his unaided eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tired, eyes sleepy ... he crawls back to bed. Gets under the covers. Settles in. His eyes close -- and he goes to sleep.

EXTERIOR - SKY - NIGHT

Heavy CLOUDS begin to move across the moon. A storm coming in. THUNDER and lightning ... heavy rain.

Jimmy's tossing and turning. Dreaming.

DREAM IMAGES

of leaving the city, whirls of color, the trees along the ridge -- blowing RAIN -- the hostile faces of the kids at school -- Mrs. McKeltch's face --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CRASH of THUNDER and HOWLING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy WAKES UP with a start. Bolt awake. A terrible storm is raging outside. His window open. Rain blowing in. He looks at the alarm clock on the night table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
4:40 A.M.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He runs to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trees are lashed with wind and rain. Water running down the panes of his window. Blowing through the open screen. Jimmy tries to close the window -- pull it down. It's stuck. He puts his weight into it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the rain comes to a dead STOP. Like the eye of a hurricane. It's eerie. Not a sound outside. Just the wet lawn and the water dripping from trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment passes -- a heartbeat -- and then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HORRIBLE SOUND comes from the sky. A throbbing ululation. Massive. Terrifying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HUGE LIGHT drops down through the clouds. It breaks through the cloud layer and descends toward the Earth. An OBJECT -- ENORMOUS, METALLIC, GLOWING. CHANGING SHAPE as it falls. First a sphere. Then flattening out into a disc. Expanding to a bottle-shape. Elongating to a spear and dropping down behind the HILL. The hill with the sand pit. The light dies and the SOUND ceases.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Jimmy stands in the window, open-mouthed, still clutching the sill, the RAIN and LIGHTNING start up again. With a howl of wind and rain blowing in his face.

Shaken, wild-eyed, Jimmy runs for his parents' room.

They -- all three -- look out the window. The rain is abating again, but more naturally, gradually. Water running off the roof of the house.

Nothing is visible beyond the hill. It looks normal. Dark, but for the occasional flicker of sheet lightning.

He walks over to get some coffee, in his bathrobe. Jimmy follows him with a look. His father rubs the back of his neck. Picks up a cup of coffee -- and sits down at the table.
</DIRECTION>

Jimmy SEES a SCRATCH MARK -- BLOODY -- ON THE BACK OF DAD'S NECK. But he doesn't get a good look at it. It's a half-glimpse. Jimmy tries to get another look.

He does, as the Father sits down.

Looking directly at it. A strange, bloody SPOT above his Dad's collar.

	You don't have to. The school bus stops right outside here, at 7:30. I've got to run.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM>
<DIRECTION>
Mom leaves them and goes upstairs to get her keys. Dad finishes his coffee. It's 7:00.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mom comes down, kisses Jimmy and goes out to the car. Jimmy looks at the clock. 7:03.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy goes to the window and watches his Mom go to the used STATION WAGON they've just bought as a second car. She gets in and turns the ignition key. The car GRINDS -- and doesn't start. She tries again -- nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<MOM>
<DIRECTION>
(calls in to Dad)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	George ... the car won't start.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM>

Dad takes another sip of his sugared coffee and gets up.

EXTERIOR - THE DRIVEWAY - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dad and Jimmy come out.
</DIRECTION>
<MOM>
<DIRECTION>
(to Dad)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's strange. I had a dream last night, where the car wouldn't start. Isn't that funny ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM>
<DIRECTION>
Dad pops open the hood. Fiddles.
</DIRECTION>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try it again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<DIRECTION>
Mom, in the car, turns the key. It starts. Mom looks relieved.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy looks on. Dad wipes off his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DAD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's probably the solenoid. Take it back to Gleason's, they said they'd fix it if we found anything wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will. But isn't that odd -- about my dream ... ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM>
<DIRECTION>
He slams the hood and starts back inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<DIRECTION>
She waves to both of them and drives down the driveway. They watch her drive away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - KITCHEN - STILL MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy and his Dad alone. They sit across the table from each other. Looking at each other. Dad says nothing. Expressionless. Unblinking. A CLOCK TICKS loudly. Jimmy's starting to get scared.
</DIRECTION>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me walk you to the bus stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR - THE ROAD - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two walk down the driveway to the road. Jimmy's upset. Something's wrong with his Dad and he doesn't know what.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dad looks down at him. An odd smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know something, son? You were right. There is something over the hill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy looks shocked.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
His Dad looks back -- at the hill behind the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. I'll show you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy suddenly doesn't want to see it. Dad reaches out -- still smiling -- to take him by the hand. Jimmy's suddenly frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(shrinking back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Dad grabs Jimmy's hand and starts dragging him toward the hill.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (struggling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's crying. He tears free from his old man's grasp. Dad steps toward him. Jimmy takes a step back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment, they HEAR a loud HONKING. Jimmy looks, and sees the SCHOOL BUS rounding the bend. Books in hand, he runs for the bus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - BUS - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy sits alone. At the back. Near tears. He looks out the rear window as the bus pulls away. The last image -- his Dad standing at the side of the road -- waving goodbye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - SCHOOL - HALL - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy walking down the hall toward room 101.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A KID -- JUMPS out at him -- "BOO" -- from around the corner. Jimmy nearly goes through the ceiling. The two KID jokesters run off laughing.
</DIRECTION>

EXTERIOR - NUCLEAR POWER PLANT/GRID CONTROL STATION - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dad (George Gardner) is being shown around his new job location. Dad is a striking figure in his dark suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SUPERVISOR points to two large, domed buildings as they walk.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERVISOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those are twin reactors. Sodium cooled cores. Best damn design in the whole country. Never worry a minute about them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERVISOR>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles and continues on showing the facility to George. They go into a low building adjacent to the reactors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - POWER SWITCHING AND CONTROL GRID - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Supervisor takes George into a large room with an immense GRAPHICS BOARD showing the electrical GRID networks for the Western United States.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In front of the displays are control consoles with men at them -- much like Houston Control.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERVISOR>
<DIRECTION>
(to George)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There it is. We know exactly how much extra juice we can throw into the network just by checking the reactors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERVISOR>
<DIRECTION>
George scopes it out carefully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They walk over to desk #1. The man at the desk, LARRY, stands up and shakes hands with George.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERVISOR>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Larry -- George Gardner. I was just showing George around. He's our new whiz kid -- trouble shooter. He's gonna be your new supervisor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERVISOR>
<DIRECTION>
(NOTE ** This scene is shot from a series of ANGLES which convey the impression of it being seen through the eyes of a child. Adults are tall -- and seen at tilted angles -- conversations are somewhat cryptic -- equipment looks foreign and unfamiliar ** )
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERVISOR>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (to Larry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	George tells me he's programmed a crisis into our simulation tape. He wants to see how we do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERVISOR>
<LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(to George)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Flick that switch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's Dad does. Looks at the board.
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (to George)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've just taken control of all the electric power in the western sector of the United States. You've run one of these before. Go ahead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's Dad (George) welcomes the opportunity. His eyes race up and down the control panels. On the Graphic Board we can SEE a power CRISIS unfold. The flow of current (colored representation) starts to surge in Colorado. George punches some buttons and diverts some power.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Larry and the other Man stand by and watch. A bigger crisis rolls over the board. ALARMS SOUNDING. Power draining from the system. A BLACKOUT beginning. George starts taking counter-measures.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's the transient I programmed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(punching buttons; the crisis worsens)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Okay? -- we're losing Colorado ... Nevada ... Utah ... It's going to crash ... the whole system ... There it goes --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
The other two men stand by smiling. Suddenly the situation starts to reverse itself -- without George's efforts. The collapse -- and rolling blackout -- starts to limit itself -- small pockets browning out -- the main system intact.
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See? The system's self-limiting the problem. It's cutting off power in cells to preserve the entire network.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
George's eyes race across the board -- studying just how it's doing that. Eagerly taking it all in.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... And how does it do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's designed to. We just put it in. As long as the ADP's are functioning they'll always save the total network. Faster than any human response.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if the ADP's fail?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
The Supervisor smiles. So does Larry.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERVISOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's highly unlikely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERVISOR>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unit #2 over there --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he means the nuclear power plant next door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- isn't counted on the grid. If it's needed it kicks in and gives us a 12% safety margin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
George is impressed. He didn't know that. But he's a pessimist.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if that doesn't do it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<SUPERVISOR>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh -- well -- in that case you'd have a catastrophic failure. We'd lose the whole thing -- "vapor lock" it so to speak, and not be able to start it up again for hours.

INTERIOR - CLASSROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's sitting in the back, next to a window. Scrunched down in his seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. McKeltch is at the blackboard. She looks at Jimmy frequently, it seems. She's busy pointing out The Parts of a frog. A fold-down anatomical chart and a chalk sketch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy looks at the wall clock. 1:45. Time seems to be going so slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks out the window at the countryside. An Air Force fighter JET is making low passes in the distance. Back and forth over the hills.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_McKELTCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This, class, is a bullfrog.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_McKELTCH>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls out a large, green, mottled frog. It's DISSECTED. Spread out on a board as if crucified. Its chest cavity splayed open. Little red lungs like strawberries. Class SQUEALS, goes ugghhh.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_McKELTCH>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Who can tell me what these two red sacs are?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_McKELTCH>
<DIRECTION>
She narrows her eyes. Jimmy is not paying attention at all. He's distracted, staring out the window, fidgeting.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_McKELTCH>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jimmy Gardner.

Jimmy stares at her pencil, pointing at the frog.

	Frogs?

The class starts to LAUGH.

<MRS_McKELTCH>
<DIRECTION>
(chilly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were not paying attention.

Everybody's laughing crazily now. Jimmy's humiliated. He starts to cry.

<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(screams)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up! Shut up!

	Young man! That may be the way you behave where you come from but it is not the way we behave here!

Mrs. McKeltch takes Jimmy out of the classroom.

INTERIOR - WAITING ROOM - SCHOOL NURSE'S OFFICE - DAY

Mrs. McKeltch sits Jimmy down on the bench outside the Nurse's office. Two women in the waiting room, chatting.

<DIRECTION>
(announces to the

	<DIALOGUE>
	He's here to see the school nurse.

That's an order.

The SECRETARY and PHONE OPERATOR, both town women in their 50's, look at Mrs. McKeltch, at Jimmy.
</DIRECTION>
<SECRETARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She'll be out in just a second.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(returning to her conversation)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I've had things like that happen. I had a dream, last night, where my little sister showed up at my front door. Skinny little thing, we don't get along ... anyway I open my front door this morning ... and there she is! We haven't spoken in years. Now, you tell me how that happens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECRETARY>
<DIRECTION>
The other woman starts to -- when the office door opens and LINDA MAGNUSON comes out, wearing a white nurse's uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lays eyes on Jimmy for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - LINDA MAGNUSON'S OFFICE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just Jimmy and her. The same scene, but viewed through his eyes. She looks at him closely. Waiting for him to speak. He just looks at her -- then away. She seems friendly. Linda smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look like you're feeling better. I'm here to help you. Is there anything you want to talk about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>

EXTERIOR - ROAD IN FRONT OF JIMMY'S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

Jimmy gets off the schoolbus and heads for his house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No cars in the driveway. No key. Apparently no one home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks around to the back of the house. Looks in the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy tries the back door. It's open. He's about to go in when he sees his Mom driving up. He waits for her.
</DIRECTION>
<MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. Sorry I'm late.
	</DIALOGUE>

After 6 P.M. Still no sign of Dad. Mom looks out into the driveway.

</MOM>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe he went back over the hill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
The Cops look at Jimmy.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What hill?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF>
<MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My husband was looking behind that hill this morning. We thought we might have seen an aircraft crash there.

<CHIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh? When was that?

	Oh, it was early -- just before dawn. But it was nothing, he already looked.

</MOM>
<CHIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll have a look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF>
<DIRECTION>
The two Cops go back along the path through the woods. Clicking on flashlights. It's starting to get dark.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER_KENENY>

(to Chief, as they climb the path)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't hear anything about any air crash ...

</OFFICER_KENENY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy and his Mom stand watching as they climb the hill and disappear over the top of the ridge, flashlights bobbing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, behind them, DAD steps out of the shadows under the trees. Mom and Jimmy hear the CRUNCH of his footstep, and turn. Mom SHRIEKS.
</DIRECTION>
<MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my God, George, you scared the life out of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM>
<DIRECTION>
George has ANOTHER MAN with him. A man we haven't seen before.
</DIRECTION>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Ed. Ed, this is my wife. This is my son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. They stand in the gathering gloam, while WHIPPOORWILLS call.
</DIRECTION>
<MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Couldn't hardly do much better. And yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes ... I'm ... fine. George, where were you? You scared us to death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, guess I better be going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you later, Ed.

Ed walks away into the darkness. His neck cannot be seen.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to you? Who was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM>
<DAD>

Dad notices the parked POLICE CAR now.
</DIRECTION>
<DAD>
<DIRECTION>
(an edge)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I see.

There's something off-key about it. Mom senses it too -- for just a moment.

	I'm home now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- but ...

Just then Jimmy sees a flashlight coming toward them. The two COPS have come back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They seem -- to Jimmy -- slightly subdued.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at Dad)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see that you're back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEF>
<DIRECTION>
Dad nods at him. Almost as if he knows these two! The two Cops nod to Mom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy looks quickly in the dark. Just a flash as one goes by -- but it looks like a scratch mark -- a bloody SPOT on the back of the Chief's neck. He can't see the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they get into their car, Officer Keneny touches the back of his neck, gingerly. They drive away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dad goes into the house with Jimmy and Mom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - KITCHEN - AFTER DINNER

Dad seems to be in better spirits. Drapes his arm around Mom. Jimmy's watching.

	Mom, something happened up there to Dad -- He got a scratch on his neck -- Promise, Mom. Don't go.

</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's near tears. Terrified that something is going to happen to his mother. She stares at him, not knowing what to make of the outburst. Just then -- Dad -- comes out of the kitchen.

Looks at them both.

	How about tomorrow, we'll take a walk up there when it's light. Okay? Go to bed now, son.

Mom goes into the kitchen. Dad gives Jimmy a withering LOOK. As if he's got a perfect line on Jimmy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy turns away from Dad -- and goes upstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - JIMMY'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy lies in bed. The blankets pulled up to his chin. LISTENING intently to the SOUNDS of dishes CLATTERING, pots and pans in the kitchen -- downstairs. His parents finishing up ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Every fiber of his being -- straining. As long as he HEARS them, they're safe -- inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the sounds -- grow less. Then -- stop. Silence from the kitchen. Jimmy's heart skips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up -- goes to the bedroom door. Opens it -- looks downstairs. Listens. No one downstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He runs to the window. SEES his Mom and Dad walking up the path to the ridge. His heart sinks. Dad escorting Mom. Jimmy aches to cry out -- do something. There's nothing he can do -- but watch. They're getting smaller. He goes to his TELESCOPE on the window sill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIMMY'S POINT OF VIEW - THROUGH THE TELESCOPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His Mom and Dad talking at the top of the ridge. They disappear over it. Gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy looks back out at the hill with his naked eye. Jimmy waits -- watching. Eyes never leaving the crest of the hill. His heart pounding. Waiting. He rests his head on his arms on the sill. Crying. The bedside alarm clock says 10:10.
</DIRECTION>

A DOOR SLAMS. Jimmy awakes with a jerk. He's fallen asleep at the window sill. He looks at the clock. 12:20. His eyes fly to the ridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIMMY'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the top of the ridge -- nobody there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He runs to his door. Cracks it open. HEARS Mom and Dad's muffled VOICES in the living room -- moving around.
</DIRECTION>

They start upstairs. Jimmy ducks back into his room. Lies there under his blankets, terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He can HEAR Mom and Dad stop in the hall outside his room. Jimmy waits -- shivering. The door to his room -- cracks -- open. A band of hall light across the dark floor. He can hear BREATHING out in the hall. The door closes -- CLICK. They don't come in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - KITCHEN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy watches his mother closely. She seems cheerful, normal. Smiling. Making breakfast for him. Her back to him. Jimmy tries to see her neck. He can't. She has HIGH-NECKED COLLAR on her blouse. Jimmy sits at the breakfast table looking like the end of the world. He picks at his food.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dad comes in. Sits down. Mom is watching Jimmy eat. He doesn't. Plays with the food. Picking at it.
</DIRECTION>
<MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not hungry? Jimmy, are you all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy forgets to say anything. Just stares at his food -- afraid to look at Dad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mom goes to the refrigerator ... rummages through and finds some RAW HAMBURGER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Jimmy WATCHES:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She scoops out a small mound with her hand -- grabs a SALT shaker and pours enough SALT on the raw meat to cake it WHITE. Mom, without hesitating, puts it in her mouth -- chewing it casually -- absentmindedly. Jimmy STARES. Mom finishes swallowing and closes the refrigerator door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She washes her fingers off at the sink and comes over to them.
</DIRECTION>
<MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a wonderful idea. Why don't we all go on a picnic up in the hills.
	</DIALOGUE>

</MOM>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy doesn't know what to say. The world closing in. He just stares at his uneaten food -- then at his Mom and Dad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside a horn HONNNKS.

Mom looks out the window -- then at Jimmy.

Jimmy's getting off the bus with the rest of the kids. He's going through the gate, when he sees a COP CAR pulled up at the side of the road -- engine running. Two COPS in it -- one of them the CHIEF. MRS. McKELTCH is at the open window on the passenger's side -- talking to him. Jimmy leans forward -- trying to HEAR.

HIS P.O.V. - INSIDE MRS. McKELTCH'S OFFICE

She is standing with her back to him, doing something with the SPECIMENS on her desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy LOOKS, hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE: MRS. McKELTCH'S NECK -- There's a small BAND-AID just below the hairline.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE: JIMMY -- Time seems to SLOW DOWN for Jimmy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. McKeltch HEARS him standing there, and turns. A FROG is protruding from her mouth. SLURP -- the frog disappears -- sucked into her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy -- SPEECHLESS with horror -- turns and RUNS.

Mrs. McKeltch pursues him.

Jimmy drops down from the window -- behind some low bushes and a tree outside the window. Free -- he takes in some breaths of clean, fresh air. Looks both ways to see no one's around ... and starts across the school grounds ... toward the gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sneaking out to the gate now, Jimmy hugs the building. The grounds deserted -- all the other kids back in class.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Jimmy SEES his PARENTS' CAR coming down the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy presses close to the wall -- and watches as his parents' car parks in the visitor's parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he starts to run -- through the teacher's parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's almost around a van -- when he sees Mr. Cross, the Principal, coming toward him headed for his car. Nowhere to go -- Mr. Cross is going to see him any second.

The door on the van he's hiding behind stands open. Jimmy hops in -- just before Mr. Cross turns the corner.

Jimmy freezes -- Just as he leans forward to climb out of the van -- someone outside touches the sliding van door and SLAMS it shut. Jimmy's trapped. He scrunches down behind the jump seats. The front door opens and someone gets in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MRS. McKELTCH! His heart stops. She doesn't see Jimmy. She starts the van and pulls out of the lot.

They start driving -- Jimmy stowed away, unseen.

Mrs. McKeltch drives along the highway -- then a country road.

Jimmy sneaking peeks at her from in back -- can SEE the Band-Aid hanging loose -- revealing the MARK at the back of her neck as she drives.

Mrs. McKeltch drives on further. Then slows the van -- and pulls off the country road. Driving into the woods.

The SOUND of Mrs. McKeltch's FOOTSTEPS in the tunnel. Jimmy looks at the tunnel walls. They're frozen BUBBLES of some kind -- as if the tunnel was formed by melting. Following, Jimmy notices that it's not getting any darker. There's a light -- red colored -- up ahead. Hugging the wall ... hiding behind rocks ... Jimmy follows. Ahead, he hears Mrs. McKeltch's footsteps come to a HALT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He PEEKS around the corner ... and SEES ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. McKeltch standing in the half-red light -- met by TWO 7 FOOT HIGH CREATURES. Part MACHINE, part FLESH -- Their arm and leg appendages -- metal. Their mid-section -- electro-mechanical. Their HEADS -- large box-like things -- with something inside -- floating in liquid and visible through a window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The thing inside is BRAIN-LIKE. A small STRUCTURE, constantly changing -- forming and re-forming itself. Delicate TENDRILS grow out from the edges, and an EYE, of sorts, floats over the surface of the brain-flesh.
</DIRECTION>

They escort Mrs. McKeltch through a rectangular door in the tunnel. Jimmy waits till they clear -- then sneaks up.

Jimmy sneaks up to the door he saw Mrs. McKeltch disappear through. It's machined, reddish metal and plastic -- set flush with the tunnel. The door itself is a door set in the side of some larger object -- a ship?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy listens at the door. From inside he hears a heavy RUMBLING. Jimmy hesitates a moment -- steeling himself -- then goes in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - SHIP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bronze/green light on the machined walls. Cold, austere, and no one around. The ship appears to be built -- inside -- in the form of a SPIRAL -- like a sea shell -- long, curving ramps and translucent bronze walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The only corridor leads -- down -- to a small ROOM. Through the semi-transparent WALL, Jimmy can SEE into the ROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. McKeltch is standing before a CONSOLE -- or ALTAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The 7' Cyborgs stand on either side of her, like two escorts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOW, LOOMING ANGLES of Mrs. McKeltch -- waiting in front of the altar. As Jimmy watches, two heavy metal SHUTTERS slide open to reveal --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SUPREME INTELLIGENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same sort of brain tissue as in the Cyborgs -- but LARGER and more active. Swimming in a perfect, glass sphere -- the brain has the IMPRESSION of a FACE on it. Slitted eyes with heavy lids, no mouth -- the brain-face is capable of registering RAGE, cool ALARM, irritation, and lightning THOUGHT, that is transmitted to its agents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. McKeltch appears drugged -- mechanically responsive to this controlling thing. As Jimmy watches -- it TESTS her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like checking out a circuit board -- Mrs. McKeltch responds to slight movements of the eye in the box. She raises one arm -- then another. Looks left -- looks right. Opens her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_McKELTCH>
<DIRECTION>
(speaks vowels)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aa. Oh. Ee. Oo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_McKELTCH>
<DIRECTION>
A pause -- a SILENCE settles over the ship. Jimmy feels it -- and interruption in the exchange between Mrs. McKeltch and the INTELLIGENCE. The eye in the thing on the altar starts to move about -- RAPIDLY -- as if searching the area for something. Jimmy ducks down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy freezes. Looks back at the open door in the ship. Two CYBORGS begin moving toward the open door. Mrs. McKeltch starts RUNNING in Jimmy's direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy runs -- underneath the grasp of a Cyborg -- out of the ship -- and down the tunnel. Running faster than he's ever run in his life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - TUNNEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy running -- can SEE the light ahead at the end of the tunnel --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR - FOREST - HILLSIDE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy comes bursting out of the tunnel opening. He marks its location in his mind with reference points. Two nearby trees -- a large rock outcropping -- and then continues RUNNING. Down the hillside -- through the forest -- Trying to orient himself as he runs. He stops and sees his house a quarter of a mile to the left. The tunnel opening is in the same ridge that runs in back of his house! To the right should be the road leading to Linda Magnuson's house. He stops and hides behind a bush, taking a breather, and checks the map Linda drew for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda's house is just a half mile down the road from his. He reaches the road and starts running for Linda's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR - ROAD - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy can see Linda's house up ahead. Her car in the driveway. Jimmy runs around to the side of her house. Looks in the window. Sees Linda -- alone -- in the house. He runs to the back door and pounds on it. Linda opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms. Magnuson! Ms. Magnuson! I found them -- they're down in the tunnels!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>

Linda tries to calm him down.

</LINDA>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got trapped in Mrs. McKeltch's van -- and she went to the tunnel and went down there with them -- behind my house. I saw them.

</JIMMY>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where, Jimmy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<JIMMY>

	If we go and look and there's nothing there, you'll have to admit to me that this is all in your mind.

	Yes.

<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR - ROAD - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda parks her car out of sight -- off the road at a spot Jimmy shows her. They get out and start toward the top of the ridge. Jimmy leading the way, cautiously. Jimmy sees the two large trees, the rock outcropping.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the spot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Linda looks around for something -- anything. There's nothing. No tunnel opening. No sign of anything wrong. Jimmy looks too. Disturbed.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>

	No, but it was here.

He goes over, as she watches, and feels the side of the hill. Solid and undisturbed. Grass growing out of where the tunnel opening has to be.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It isn't here. It's gone.

<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>

The mention of the place produces a feeling of dread in Jimmy.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll get us.

</JIMMY>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll be very careful. But we have to see.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If something landed there, there would be a big scar in the ground. Wouldn't there?

Jimmy nods.

Jimmy and Nurse Magnuson are climbing toward the crest -- along a different path than the one leading from Jimmy's back yard.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be careful. Please be careful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Linda nods. Her face serious and alert, glancing around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR - CREST OF HILL - NEAR SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's heart is in his mouth. Down below, they can see his house. Looking the other way -- THE PIT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It lies before them -- undisturbed. The sand smooth and white.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
(holds his hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does it look to you like anything landed here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(looking around)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe -- it landed in the bushes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Two figures against the orange sky. A wind blowing. Big fleecy clouds in the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
(kindly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jimmy -- we're already in trouble, both of us, because of me helping you run away. Now, I can make up a story that will smooth things over. Your house is right down there. Why don't you let me take you home, and tell your parents something that will make them not be mad at us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up at her. Holding her hand. She's still in her white nurse's uniform -- beautiful. Every young boy's vision of a protector.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy looks down at his house. At that moment, a blue AIR FORCE PICKUP pulls up in front of Jimmy's house. He gasps and jerks his head down. He and Linda peek through the bushes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they watch, TWO AIR FORCE MEN go and knock at the front door of the house. The door is opened by Dad. He talks with them awhile -- then POINTS up the hill -- seemingly directed at Jimmy and Linda, which makes them duck back down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The AIR FORCE MEN start up the hill. They have some sort of detector with them that Jimmy can see. They sweep the ground as they walk. Closer now to the crest of the hill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Jimmy and Linda watch, the two Air Force MEN reach the crest of the hill -- and go down to the sand PIT. 50 yards across.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their instrument-counters perhaps registering something. They fan out -- walking out onto the sand. Their backs to each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy -- watching -- is almost afraid to breathe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly -- as Jimmy and Linda look on -- the GROUND OPENS UP beneath one of the men. A VORTEX OF SAND under his feet -- PULLING him -- swiftly and wordlessly -- DOWN. GONE under the sand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The OTHER MAN -- hears the gasp. Turns swiftly -- gets the same surprised look on his face. He is SUCKED DOWN. Both gone now. The sand SMOOTHS OVER as though it had never been disturbed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda and Jimmy look at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy and Linda -- RUN for the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - LINDA'S CAR - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda tries to start the engine. It has trouble catching. She grinds the engine -- it falters. Panicked now -- she pumps the gas pedal. Cranks the car -- it won't go. Nearly hysterical -- she pounds the steering wheel. Jimmy watches. Still the car won't go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly they see the Air Force PICKUP coming down the road. Jimmy and Linda freeze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR - ROAD - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The AIR FORCE PICKUP -- with the TWO MEN in the front seat -- looking as if nothing's happened -- drives by.
</DIRECTION>

No sign from the men that anything's wrong.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pickup goes around the curve in the road.

Linda's silent -- thinking. She turns down several roads -- arriving at some streets in a residential neighborhood outside town.

Panicked, Jimmy slides across the front seat -- and jumps out of the car from the driver's side. Runs away. Mrs. McKeltch trying to follow him.

<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR - MAIN STREET - JUST DARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy slinks along the sidewalk like a criminal. Looking for a place to duck into. Nothing's open in this part of the block.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, up ahead, he sees a COP. Walking in his direction. Jimmy freezes -- looks back. MRS. McKELTCH coming up on him from behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a car pulls up next to him -- a white Ford. The passenger door pops open.
</DIRECTION>

Linda looks bothered by that. She's driving out of town, while trying to think where to go.

Up ahead, parked under the lights of a filling station, is a POLICE ROADBLOCK. A cop talking to a motorist.

Linda takes the slip of paper from her purse and gives it to him.

The phone is a dial-type rather than pushbutton. Jimmy positions his index finger carefully over the cradle button -- and begins TAPPING out the number. TAP TAP TAP - pause - TAP TAP TAP TAP TAP TAP TAP TAP TAP TAP - pause - TAP TAP TAP - tapping out each number in the exact rhythm the dial would make.
</DIRECTION>

Linda watches, amazed.

INTERIOR - SCHOOL FURNACE ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Huddled in the furnace room. A ruddy glow coming from behind the large furnace doors. A slight RUMBLING from the boilers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving through the floor above they can hear FOOTSTEPS. Doors OPENING and CLOSING. A quick search going on. Then the feet leave. The outside door SLAMS SHUT. The COPS are gone. Linda and Jimmy breathe easier.

Linda looks at the FLOOR of the furnace room. Concrete.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It begins to CRACK ... then HEAVE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They both fall back against the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The floor ERUPTS. -- CRACK. A GLEAMING bronze-red METAL POD rears its head. Alien technology no human has ever seen -- rising up on a shiny, metal telescoped neck -- flexible, capable of rotating a full circle -- it confronts them. A ruby red eye in the tip. It all but HISSES, cobra-like. Thrashing around. Grabbing for light and air. Jimmy SCREAMS. The thing takes note -- and like a finger withdrawn reflexively from a hot stove, it RETRACTS. Slithering back down into the floor -- like a giant roach. As suddenly as it appeared -- it's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shaking like a leaf -- Jimmy goes over to the torn up section of the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gaping hole -- going down 10 feet -- the entrance to an underground tunnel.

CURTIS, the Colonel's aide, comes in. With him -- more of the Colonel's men.

The Colonel walks to his windows and opens the levelor blinds. He looks out at something. In the distance -- bathed in SPOTLIGHTS -- is a ROCKET of some kind.

The Colonel stares at it -- joined by Rinaldi. Both of them thinking now. Jimmy goes over -- looks also.

Slowly -- painstakingly -- a surgeon removes a long needle from the back of Hollis' NECK. Everyone stares hard as he holds it up.

The surgeon wipes blood from it. The NEEDLE is extremely narrow -- the color of gleaming BRONZE -- with a tiny, radiant CRYSTAL glowing on the tip of it.

<DIRECTION>
The surgeon carries it over to a work bench. As he passes an electric pump, the needle gives a slight RINGING SOUND and the crystal GLOWS.

Startled, the surgeon passes the needle around the electrical pump. The needle fluoresces brighter and softer as he moves it. EVERYONE gathers round.

The surgeon WAVES the needle around. It reacts when it's near a TELEPHONE ... a LIGHT SOCKET ... near people's HEADS ...

He puts it next to an FM RADIO. Turns on the radio and tunes the dial. The NEEDLE REACTS to every setting on the dial ... until, at one setting, the needle gives a tiny BANG! and a FLASH -- and the surgeon drops it, grimacing.

The surgeon flaps his hand. His teeth clenched with pain. His GLOVE is burned through, and his FINGERTIPS are blackened, with wisps of smoke rising from them.

<DIRECTION>
They run over to the table. Two of the Colonel's men gently lift Linda off the table. As soon as they do she starts to come to.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
She's able to stand and look around the ship. Jimmy gives her a giant hug around the legs and waist -- so happy she's all right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SOUNDS of the ship starting up -- grow LOUDER. HUMMMS ... and electrical WHIRRS ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Supreme Intelligence -- tendrils in full motion -- the brain-face forming and re-forming. Eyes darting ... as it brings activity to a peak.
</DIRECTION>
<COL_WILSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody out ... !
	</DIALOGUE>
</COL_WILSON>
<DIRECTION>
They beat a retreat. Linda and Jimmy running along with the troops -- up the spiral ramps -- heading toward the open door out of the ship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - SHIP - NEAR DOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The demolition team has finished placing their EXPLOSIVES.
</DIRECTION>
<DEMOLITION_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Col. Wilson as he arrives)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've placed the charges. Give me a time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEMOLITION_MAN>
<COL_WILSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give us five minutes to get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COL_WILSON>
<DIRECTION>
The demolition men SET their TIMERS for 5 MINUTES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The automatic timers start COUNTING DOWN and the men run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's watching it all. RUNNING with Linda and the Colonel -- RUNNING for the door that leads out of the ship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - TUNNEL - SYSTEM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone running back toward the spot where they blasted down into the tunnel from above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They've marked the way out with cord laid down. Colonel Wilson and the lead men following the trail out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TIMERS counting down. 4 MINUTES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They reach the point where the cord started. They look up. The way out is sealed.
</DIRECTION>
<CURTIS>
<DIRECTION>
(to Col. Wilson)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They've sealed off the entrance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURTIS>
<DIRECTION>
Colonel Wilson surveys the scene -- desperately.
</DIRECTION>
<COL_WILSON>
<DIRECTION>
(shouts orders)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Start digging.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COL_WILSON>
<DIRECTION>
The men start grabbing rocks, boulders, dirt -- shoveling, clawing at the collapsed part of the tunnel and ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DEMOLITION_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(shouts to Col. Wilson)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three minutes thirty left ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEMOLITION_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
They dig harder. It's impossible -- the dirt slides back in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy SEES an abandoned Martian WEAPON. One of the blasters.
</DIRECTION>
<CURTIS>
<DIRECTION>
(sees it too)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They use these to tunnel. Maybe we can --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURTIS>
<DIRECTION>
He picks it up. Totally unfamiliar with its operation.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know how to use it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Colonel Wilson looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw them do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Colonel Wilson nods for Curtis to give Jimmy the weapon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They all stand back as Jimmy takes the blaster -- and points it at the ceiling. Fiddles with the controls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It FIRES -- a continuous soft-red beam that turns the ceiling red -- The walls and ceiling start to BUBBLE. Then it EXPLODES -- There's a HOLE punched through to above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colonel Wilson and Jimmy look UP. They can SEE stars and a night sky. Breathe fresh air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ladders go up -- and they start scrambling up as fast as they can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
50 SECONDS left on the sweeping clocks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DOOR to the ship -- closes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WHINE and SCREAM of its power plant becomes DEAFENING in the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SUPREME INTELLIGENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
giving its final orders -- telepathically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIMMY AND LINDA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and the Colonel and Curtis and the other men scrambling up out of the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR - AREA NEAR SAND PIT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Colonel -- up top now --
</DIRECTION>
<COL_WILSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone get back -- get back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COL_WILSON>
<DIRECTION>
Equipment and positions abandoned --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
20 SECONDS left on the timer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EVERYONE RUNNING ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WHINE of the ship below ground -- increasing in pitch and LOUDNESS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the running people we can SEE the ground starting to BREAK -- THRUST UP -- as it's giving birth to something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The top of the ship begins to EMERGE from the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rising ... MORE of the ship ... Bursting the earth as it lifts straight UP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The people RUNNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Go to a MOVING CAMERA: Move with everyone running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their faces -- terrified -- running for their lives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy and Linda ... and the Colonel ... and Curtis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE WITH JIMMY -- his face -- as he runs -- running ---
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The timers read ... ZERO ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a terrible EXPLOSION -- much TOO CLOSE, in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wave of RED starts to overtake all the running people -- a FIREBALL -- rushing to ENGULF them --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy looking more terrified than he's ever looked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
About to DIE ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as he SCREAMS ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUNDER AND LIGHTNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy sits bolt upright in bed -- and SCREAMS. His face covered with perspiration. His breath coming in ragged gasps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His PARENTS rush into his room.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(ecstatic to see them)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom ... Dad!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
They rush to his bed and comfort him.
</DIRECTION>
<MOM_DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right ... It's all right ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM_DAD>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy can't believe his eyes. They're all right. He hugs them.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had an awful dream.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, Jim, what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First lemme look at your necks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Dad and Mom look at each other as Jimmy examines the backs of their necks. It's okay. No marks.
</DIRECTION>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That must have been some dream.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy cries, hugging them. Mom strokes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dreamed a UFO landed behind the hill and put a thing in your neck. First you went out to look at it by yourself, and then the cops came ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - JIMMY'S BEDROOM - ½ HOUR LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's tucked into bed with his parents sitting on either side of him, finishing a cup of hot cocoa. Outside, it's raining. But everything is okay. He's starting to feel better.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(finishing his story)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... And then everything blew up. And then I woke up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a doozy of a dream, son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was so real, Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was all made of stuff that's happened to you in the last few days. The sand pit in back of the house, and the meteor shower, and meeting your teacher and the colonel at school, and being afraid of the new kids because you don't know them ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all this moving from place to place. We're never settled. I'm having nightmares myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind, Mom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I can't remember. But people do have bad dreams when their routine is disturbed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, Ellen. We'll settle down soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(hugs her again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was so scared.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better now, son?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy nods yes. His Dad pats him on the head. Mom takes the empty cup from him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mom and Dad start out of his room.
</DIRECTION>
<DAD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better get some sleep, son, or you'll be pretty tired at school tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAD>
<MOM>
<DIRECTION>
(looking back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(sleepy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
They turn off the light and close the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy closes his eyes, and snuggles down to sleep. His eyes open one last time, and he looks at the clock on his bedside table -- 4:40.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rain hits the panes of his window outside. Jimmy looks out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he SEES it -- a HORRIBLE GLOWING SHAPE coming down, through the rain. The SOUND exactly the same as in the dream. Coming down behind the hill in back of his house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE IN ON JIMMY'S FACE, WATCHING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now he knows exactly what's going to happen ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END.
</DIRECTION>
