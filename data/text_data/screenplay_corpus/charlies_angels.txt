EXT. THE BIG BLUE SKY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A VIRGIN AIR 747 bursts through the clouds and levels off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VIRGIN AIR 747 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move through the FIRST CLASS CABIN. It's the regular mix of first class people: OLD MONEY in Gucci enjoying freshly baked cookies, a MILLIONAIRE in jeans and a T- shirt, BUSINESS PEOPLE relaxing after a tough day, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...a very nervous MAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shifty-eyed. Alone in an aisle seat, the emergency row. We hold on him for a moment, but not for too long. Then we continue moving into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE COACH SECTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stopping at the lavatory, the "OCCUPIED" sign switches to "VACANT" and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAMES EARL JONES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(or actually, a James Earl Jones type, who for ease of description, we'll simply refer to as James Earl Jones) steps out of the restroom, in full African regalia: multi-colored dashiki, mufti (it's a kind of hat), the works. He heads up the aisle towards --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FIRST CLASS CABIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where he is stopped by a --
</DIRECTION>
<FLIGHT_ATTENDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, sir. This cabin is restricted to first cl...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLIGHT_ATTENDANT>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Jones now removes a FIRST CLASS TICKET.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_EARL_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this what you're looking for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_EARL_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at it -- a little confused as to why he's just handing it to her now -- but then she nods. As he passes:
</DIRECTION>
<FLIGHT_ATTENDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm sorry. Please. Is there anything I can get you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLIGHT_ATTENDANT>
<JAMES_EARL_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scotch, blended. Straight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_EARL_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
He continues into the first class cabin and toward --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FIRST CLASS EMERGENCY ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where he slides in past the nervous, shifty-eyed man (his name is PASQUAL) and sits by the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, Pasqual quietly clears his throat and leans, slightly, towards Jones.
</DIRECTION>
<PASQUAL>
<DIRECTION>
(tentatively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They say birds can't fly this high.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PASQUAL>
<JAMES_EARL_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They say only angels can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_EARL_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
Now Pasqual nods. Nervously begins to remove something from his pocket when they are interrupted by --
</DIRECTION>
<FLIGHT_ATTENDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall I pour your scotch?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLIGHT_ATTENDANT>
<JAMES_EARL_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- I'll take the bottle. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_EARL_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
She hands him the airplane-sized bottle -- he waves off the glass. She shrugs, leaving...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pasqual to resume what he was doing. Slowly, he removes a roll of Certs. He looks to Jones -- "Well? What about your end of the bargain?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From within his dashiki, Jones pulls out a black velvet pouch. He hands it to Pasqual, who opens it to find diamonds. A helluva lot of diamonds. Pasqual smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hands the roll of Certs to Jones. It's not breath candy at all, but a tiny roll of explosives, with a tiny, high-tech triggering mechanism.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_EARL_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, c-5. The most dangerous explosive material ever invented. Hard to believe that this little contraption could blow up ten city blocks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_EARL_JONES>
<PASQUAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be careful with it, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PASQUAL>
<DIRECTION>
Both men smile. Pasqual's very relieved that the deal is done.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then suddenly, the lights blink out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pasqual looks around, nervous. But it's just the in- flight movie beginning. Clouds, and a woman holding a torch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Columbia Pictures presents... David Spade and Adam Sandler in "BOSOM BUDDIES: THE MOVIE."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
James Earl Jones shakes his head, rolls his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_EARL_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Another movie from an old TV show?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_EARL_JONES>
<PASQUAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what're you gonna do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PASQUAL>
<JAMES_EARL_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walk out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_EARL_JONES>
<PASQUAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's very funny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PASQUAL>
<DIRECTION>
But James Earl Jones is dead serious.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_EARL_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It isn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_EARL_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
Jones grabs Pascal in a headlock and turns toward the back of the plane, shouting:
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_EARL_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	EVERYONE! FASTEN YOUR SEAT BELTS!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_EARL_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
Now Jones does the unthinkable. Holding Pasqual tight, he yanks open the emergency door release.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a RUSH, the cabin decompresses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Panic erupts as air, paper and everything not belted in screams out of the open door, including --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE BIG BLUE SKY - FALLING AWAY FROM THE 747 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- James Earl Jones, still holding Pasqual in a bear hug. They plummet, wind violently tearing at them. Pasqual's frantic SCREAMS doppler quite nicely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DROPPING WITH THEM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They continue to fall, gaining speed. Pasqual is terrified, but Jones doesn't seem worried. In fact, casually, he glances at his watch, and then looks --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FAR BELOW THEM - ACROSS THE SKY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the tiny black speck gradually grows larger in the distance...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER - ON THAT BLACK SPECK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a jet helicopter. Its door opens, and now a SKYDIVER leaps out, helmet down, arms back, streaking across the sky in aerodynamic perfection, heading directly towards
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JONES AND PASQUAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who are still plummeting toward the earth at terminal velocity. Jones begins to let go of Pasqual, who SCREAMS and tries to clutch onto him, desperate.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_EARL_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
(over the rushing wind)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER. WE HAVE COMPANY.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PASQUAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHAT?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_EARL_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly -- WHOMMPPPH!! -- the skydiver spread-eagles, stopping the wild dive directly behind Pasqual, and immediately binds his arms and straps a parachute on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All three are still free-falling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
James Earl Jones nods at the Skydiver who, even under the helmet and goggles, is clearly a beautiful woman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meet ALEXANDRA "ALEX" MUNDAY, one of Charlie's Angels. She's a sultry bombshell -- a classic femme fatale -- only she's playing for the good guys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gives James Earl Jones a wink, then jerks Pasqual's rip cord and -- WHOOMPH. Pasqual's chute deploys. He flies upward, leaving --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alex and James Earl Jones, both still falling. Below the ocean screams up at them. Not much time left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
James Earl Jones pulls his belt -- and his mufti flies up. It's actually a tiny drogue chute, deploying his entire dashiki. His outfit hides a parachute rig.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alex pulls her own rip cord and -- WHOOMPH -- her chute unfurls, and now...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alex and James Earl Jones gently float towards --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE BIG BLUE SEA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cigarette boat floats through the choppy water, a gorgeous young woman expertly throttling up the growling V-8.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Say hello to NATALIE THOMPSON, Charlie's second angel. At a glance, she's the brainy-shy girl next door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But put her behind the wheel of any vehicle, and she's unstoppable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Natalie glances ahead, maneuvering the boat perfectly under Alex, who drops on deck. Alex gathers her chute, then whips off her helmet to give her cascading mane a wild shake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Here comes James Earl Jones. Natalie guns the boat underneath...a perfect catch. Alex helps him with his dashiki-chute, and then all three look up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Here comes Pasqual. Natalie whips the boat around, catching him as he helplessly drops into the seats, still bound, still scared out of his wits. He gapes wild-eyed at the two Angels, then whirls on James Earl Jones.
</DIRECTION>
<PASQUAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You crazy bastard!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PASQUAL>
<JAMES_EARL_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you mean crazy bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_EARL_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
With that, James Earl Jones reaches up and pulls his face off. Latex rips free, and standing there (without his dashiki, James Earl Jones has a great figure) is...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... stunningly beautiful DYLAN SANDERS, angel number three. She's the wild one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pasqual's jaw drops as Dylan shakes her hair free, then reaches in her mouth --
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
(still with James Earl Jones' voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't need this anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
-- and extracts a voice-modifying chip.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (now in her real voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I sure could use this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
And she pulls from her pocket the airplane-size bottle of Johnnie Walker Black. She twists it open and downs it.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn I hate to fly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH DOCK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, MEN IN "FBI" WINDBREAKERS haul Pasqual away, two of them carefully handling the certs-explosive. A harmless fellow pushes his way past them and onto the dock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's JOHN BOSLEY, Charlie's lieutenant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches the boat, which Natalie ties off while Alex and Dylan neatly fold their parachutes.
</DIRECTION>
<BOSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Angels, the experimental explosives are back in the hands of the government, and the free world can breathe just a lit-tle bit easier tonight, thanks to you three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOSLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Alex, Natalie and Dylan stroll from the dock onto the sand, each starting to unzip/unbutton/unsnap their action gear and hand it to Bosley as they continue walking.
</DIRECTION>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And thanks to you, too, Bos.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATALIE>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We couldn't have redirected the flight path without your help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
Bosley puffs, proud. He speaks over the ever-growing pile of chutes, body suits, goggles, the dashiki...
</DIRECTION>
<BOSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing a little teamwork can't do. At least, that's what Charlie's always telling us, right ladies?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOSLEY>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie will be joining us, won't he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<BOSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He sends his regrets. But he wanted you to know that dinner is on him, so feel free to celebrate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOSLEY>
<DIRECTION>
By now, the Angels have stripped off all of their equipment, revealing eye-popping evening gowns.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it's on Charlie, we will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
The Angels share a laugh as they arrive in their sassy duds at a private beach club, where a WAITER greets them with a tray of champagne flutes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They each take a glass, turn to each other and raise them. Another Angels Mystery... Case Closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREEZE FRAME. And the TITLE SEQUENCE BEGINS...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Once upon a time...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
THREE FOURTH GRADE SCHOOL PHOTOS FILL THE FRAME, side by side by side. These are three very different girls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATALIE, with a page-boy cut and wearing a Catholic schoolgirl's uniform, sports glasses and braces; a bit awkward and gangly, even shy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALEX, formally dressed with perfect pig-tails, is sophisticated and self-possessed; a class act, even at ten.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DYLAN, wild blond hair and faded T-shirt, has a jaded, street-wise smirk; even at this young age, her isolation and disillusionment are masked by seeming confidence.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
VIDEO TAPE - THE THREE GIRLS (STILL IN TRIPTYCH)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now TEENAGERS, on HOME VIDEO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATALIE, working the A-V equipment at school, hides her face in embarrassment, uncomfortable with the camera. FREEZE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALEX, in riding gear, accepting her steeple-chase trophy. She knows where to look for the camera. FREEZE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DYLAN, smoking with her tough-girl friends in the girls' room of her reform school, is caught on camera. She flips it off. FREEZE.
</DIRECTION>

TRIPTYCH CONTINUES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're all WOMEN now, in their early twenties.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATALIE, a research fellow at MIT (and beautiful, but not flaunting it) demonstrates a chess-playing computer program to a room of impressed advisors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALEX, valedictorian at Oxford, passionately delivers her address to a crowd of rapt students, faculty and parents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DYLAN, in leather and a helmet, steps off a Harley. She sees a punk with a mohawk slapping around his girlfriend. She decks him, then enters the back door of a seedy punk bar.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>

</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE_S_ANGELS>
<DIRECTION>
...And a new title sequence takes over:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS SHOTS: MONTAGE (OVER MUSIC)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Credits continue as we watch the Angels in action (from, presumably, previous adventures...)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- A microscope-peering Natalie cuts a ruby, drops it in a laser housing, shoots a red beam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Dylan, wielding kendo sticks, spars with two Yakzuza.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Alex side-kicks two baddies, spins, drops a third. ZOOM BACK: she is at the Parthenon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- A motocross race. Natalie digs in for the finish, attacking the last jump with gusto.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Dylan, in traditional Islamic robes, finds a secret switch. She pushes back a bookcase to reveal secret stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- At a ballroom dance competition, Alex wows the crowd while keeping her eye on a nefarious couple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Bosley, as "Luka, the Bad Ass Pimp," bitch-slaps a couple of "ho's" -- actually Dylan and Alex -- then winks at them as unsuspecting drug dealers back off, scared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Natalie bites into a messy hot-dog, has to just laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- The three angels elbow their way through a roller- derby match.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- In orange prison jumpsuits, Alex and Dylan work in female chain-gang.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Window-washer Natalie peers into a skyscraper office, surreptitiously photographing the meeting inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- On an Italian street, the three Angels buy a paper, grin at the headline, "Mystery Women Save European Union." As they high-five, Dylan's cone of gelato drops to the sidewalk. The Angels look at it, look at each other...and just have to laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLE SEQUENCE ENDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVER BLACK we hear a DIGITAL RING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TINY HOUSEBOAT BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON Dylan as she wakes up in a tangle of ugly sheets, disoriented and a bit hungover. She hears the RINGING -- where is it coming from? Why is it drilling into her head?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Checking the floor, she finds her jeans. Digs in the pocket to find her cell phone. Answering...
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DYLAN>

She clicks the phone off, then starts looking around. Where the fuck is she?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the next room, we hear a male VOICE singing "My Sharona." She checks under the sheets. Oh God. She's naked. She pulls her shirt from the floor, puts it on. Closing her eyes, she prays...

ALEX and JASON are in a fully macked out Airstream, sitting on a bed, leaning over an open screenplay. We can tell from our surroundings that Jason is a big deal Hollywood action star, and this trailer is his home away from home.

She licks the bridge of his nose, then kisses him again.

Built into the Palm Springs Hills, this very exclusive spa has a fantastic view of the desert.

Dressed in a crisp spa uniform, Alex has a sidebar with a white-robed Bosley. She shows him a tiny electronic device shaped like a bullet.

INT. MEN'S STEAM ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A burst of steam clears, revealing Bosley. He waddles forward in his shower clogs, which SQUISH with every step. He's wearing two towels: one around his waist, and a second around his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As more steam dissipates, we see there are SEVEN MEN sitting on the risers. Six are gorgeous, ranging from Calvin Klein models to Marlboro Men. Bosley looks around, taking a keen interest. Maybe he's checking them out, maybe he isn't. We just don't know.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The seventh man is ROGER CORWIN, who we recognize from the videotape. He's leaning forward, a gold chain dangling. It's beside him that Bosley takes a seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sets the ice cup -- and the transmitter -- in a strategic location.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Noticing that none of the other men have towels around their bosoms, Bosley nervously undoes his, revealing skin the color of cooked salmon. He fluffs up his sparse chest hair, then decides to smush it back down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to make eye contact with Corwin, working way too hard. Annoyed, Corwin finally looks over.

Yes, he said "pubic." He's about to correct himself when a very hot guy across from him moves his towel to wipe off
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
some sweat. We don't see the promised land, but Bosley does. It flusters him.

He sees another guy eating ice chips. Good idea. Bosley does the same. He eats another. And another.

The door opens, a rush of steam. ADONIS HIMSELF enters. Picking a seat behind Bosley, he pulls off his towel as he passes. We just see a bit of ass, but Bosley is face- to-face with the babymaker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One ice chip is not going to do it. He chugs the rest of his cup, including
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TRANSMITTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
which BLEEPS. Corwin and others look over. What the hell was that?

The device still in his mouth, Bosley has no choice but to smile and swallow. His eyes go wide as he chokes it down.

Putting the Palm Pilot away, she shuts the locker.

As we move in VERY CLOSE ON her tray, we see that there's a tiny Digital display. A metal detector is built into the rim.

INT. SERVICE HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Thin Man comes around the corner. We stay TIGHT on him, until he suddenly stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATALIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
has come around from the other side. His bad guy instincts tell him these women are working together. He's boxed in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then, a DING!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elevator doors open beside him. He looks in to see the clue- less BELLBOY, who had a funky groove going on his headphones. In a single motion, the Thin Man yanks the guy out into the hallway and takes his place. Hits the button.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From opposite directions, Natalie and Dylan run to the elevator, but the doors have already shut. Checking the panel.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's going down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>

They take the stairs.

INT. BASEMENT SERVICE HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Natalie and Dylan emerge from the staircase to find the elevator empty. To the left, exit doors swing tellingly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nat and Dylan smash through the exit doors and out into the sun-drenched streets of beautiful, downtown Los Angeles. Natalie immediately spots the Thin Man, booking down the alley.
</DIRECTION>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATALIE>
<DIRECTION>
And they take off after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What ensues is the fastest, wildest, two chicks and one guy foot chase you've ever seen. Here are some highlights:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Thin Man pulls himself, clumsily, over a chain link fence. Dylan and Natalie pull an old Jackie Chan trick and run up the side wall and hop over easily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Thin Man, still on foot, waits for traffic to slow, then darts across the Harbor Freeway. By the time Dylan and Natalie get there, traffic is roaring again. Undeterred, they make their way through, tucking and rolling under the wheels of a moving semi.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Dylan is racing down an alley, when a car comes barrelling at her. She leaps up onto the hood of the car as it drives underneath her, a la one of those That's Incredible! stunts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- They chase the Thin Man into an industrial laundromat. The scene goes something like this:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INDUSTRIAL LAUNDRY ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thunderously LOUD, with industrial washers and dryers operating at full tilt. Natalie and Dylan are just entering when
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREE SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ring out. They dive for cover behind a massive washer assembly.
</DIRECTION>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are times I wish we carried guns.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATALIE>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's the challenge in that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON the Thin Man, planning his next move. With no good shot at the angels, he aims high, both guns BLAZING. He shots out the pipes over their heads, sending down a cascade of hot water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan and Natalie scramble back to avoid getting scalded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Other pipes SHATTER from the change in pressure, leading to an interior thunderstorm. Steam fills the room as an inch of water grows on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Natalie and Dylan push rolling laundry carts in the Thin Man's direction. He shoots at them, but quickly realizes they're just trying to waste his bullets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holstering one of his guns, he dials his cell phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the far wall, Natalie switches on the overhead hooks, which circle on a wire like a ski lift. The Thin Man looks up, distracted, not noticing --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DYLAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she creeps up behind the cover of the rolling laundry carts. She's succeeded in circling behind the Thin Man as he talks on the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She clears her throat. The Thin Man turns. She kicks him in the jaw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Knocked back, he drops the phone, which CRACKS and slips under a washing machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crab-walks back, then suddenly springs back to his feet. We weren't expecting that kind of ninja move out of this guy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HE TURNS TO SEE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATALIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
right behind him. With a coiled towel, she grabs his gun arm and expertly flips him. But he reacts smoothly, rolling over to charge at Natalie, picking her up like a sack of potatoes. As he does, he grabs her right in the tit.
</DIRECTION>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Hands off, assh....
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATALIE>
<DIRECTION>
Before she can finish her sentence, the Thin Man throws Natalie at Dylan, knocking them both down. He jumps up, and with a single motion grabs an overhead pipe and kicks another, releasing a wall of steam -- we can't see a thing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By the time the fog clears, the Thin Man is long gone.
</DIRECTION>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, to summarize? Damn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATALIE>
<DIRECTION>
Lying down in the water, Dylan reaches under the washer to fish out the Thin Man's busted cell phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOWNSEND AGENCY BACK ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Natalie sits at a glowing computer monitor, the Thin Man's cell phone connected by a data cable to the Townsend Agency computers. Rapidly touching the screen, she calls up a list of the last thirty-five phone calls he received. They're all from the same location.

EXT. COWBOY BAR -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A rowdy establishment just outside of town.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COWBOY BAR -- CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kind of place that rich weekend skiers don't come. Lots of over-aggressive, cowboy-biker types, drinking more than they should. There are only a few women in the place, and they are either waitresses or biker chicks. Suddenly, everyone stops what they're doing and turns to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE'S ANGELS have entered the room. Dressed in their stylish ensembles, they couldn't possibly look more out of place.

Dylan downs a shot, slams it on the table. Countless other glasses surround her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVEAL that two of the rednecks are down for the count, one falling out of his chair, the other passed out on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The third redneck is slurring badly, trying to keep up with Dylan.

<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I've got an idea. Now let's have a chair throwing contest.

The redneck nods, lifts up his chair and heaves it across the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OKAY, HERE'S AN OUTLINE OF WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE REST OF THIS SCENE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan and Natalie create a distraction, while Alex sneaks into the back office with Bosley to get the phone number of the chalet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGH MOUNTAIN ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A VW van climbs the winding road. As we get closer, we see the side reads, "Chalet Grams."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DING-DONG DING-DING-DONG doorbell rings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOUNTAIN HOUSE / GREAT ROOM - NIGHT

TWO THUGS with shoulder holsters look up, hearing the bell. One was tending to the fire.

The girls lean in and hug each other, butts sticking out. To the left, Bosley starts playing oommpa OOMMPA oommpa OOMMPA on a wrap-around tuba. He's wearing lederhosen, with a feather in his hat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Natalie begins to YODEL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan hands a fancy envelope to the bewildered thug. Thug Two is approaching from behind, curious what the hell is going on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan begins to TALK-SING a song in German about a too- curious goat and his worried mistress. Even with the pantomime, we have no idea what's happening. It seems wholesome, but occasionally one of the girls touches the other in a weirdly coquettish, oddly sexual way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thug Two looks at the address on the envelope.
</DIRECTION>

As the angels continue their routine, the CAMERA RISES, three quick cuts to take us to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ROOF - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... where a black cat-suited Alex stands at the chimney... A ribbon of smoke curls from the stack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulling the pin from a canister, she drops it down the chimney.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOUNTAIN HOUSE GREAT ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cheerful fire burns in the over-sized fireplace. The canister drops into the flames from above, suddenly venting a HISSING cloud of halon gas. The fire dies immediately, the logs covered with a violent frost.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CHIMNEY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alex doesn't even need a rope. Her feet pressed to the sooty walls, she expertly slides to the bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GREAT ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alex backs out of the fireplace to find a WAITING BAD GUY swinging
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FIREPLACE POKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
at her head. She ducks just in time. The poker CHINGS against the stone, making a spark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rolling, jumping and diving, Alex scurries as Pokerman slashes and stabs. She ducks behind a chair, which Pokerman catches with the hook, winging it across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Backed against the wall, Alex yanks on the heavy curtains, pulling them down, along with the wooden curtain rod. A spin, a flourish of velvet and the curtain rings drop off to leave her with a trusty quarterstaff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She goes on the offensive. Thrust, parry, spin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he's a worthy adversary. One good karate kick breaks her staff in two. She uses both pieces to club him in the knees, then rolls back to the fireplace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs the remaining tool: the fireplace tongs. Pokerman swings. Alex catches his weapon in the tong scissors, yanking it free with such force the point sticks in the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A quick kick knocks Pokerman to the floor, where Alex rolls on top of him. She catches his head in the tongs, squeezing his temples. His eyes bulge.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Knox?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
INT. WINDOWLESS ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Young billionaire ERIC KNOX paces. He's grungy, with two days of stubble, but still a darn attractive guy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hearing a KICK at the door, he turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A second KICK blows the door open. It's Alex.
</DIRECTION>
<KNOX>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bosley is about to hyper-ventilate on the tuba, sweaty and a little blue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan and Natalie's new song has them sharing the saddle of an imaginary horse. When Dylan reaches back to slap the "horse," she hits Natalie in the rump. Both women tee-hee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The thugs think it's pretty hot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan whispers a secret to Natalie. Natalie WHISPERS back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Turning to the thugs, they each lean in to WHISPER into a different thug's ear. As the men smile, the angels suddenly BONK the two men's heads together. Both men fall, knocked out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stepping over the bodies, Dylan heads inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOUNTAIN HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking for the way out, Alex leads Knox to a closed door. She opens it to find...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TV ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... TWO MORE THUGS sitting in front the big-screen TV, watching a college basketball game (Duke vs. Maryland, in case you care.) The guards look back, spotting Alex with Knox.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That wouldn't be so bad, if it weren't for the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIFTEEN OTHER THUGS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watching the game with them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON Alex. It's an oh-shit moment.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. Wrong room.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Knox)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back! Run!

</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
The thugs are out of their seats a moment later, each of them pulling out a firearm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT PORCH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holding down three keys on the tuba, Bosley talks into the mouthpiece. It has a secret radio.
</DIRECTION>
<BOSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alex, what's your status?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOSLEY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Running, Alex pushes Knox ahead of her, checking their backs. She talks into a wrist-mic.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good news: I found Knox.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
Another THUG steps out in front of her. She kicks him down the steps.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bad news: I found company.

Reaching the bottom of the steps, Knox is surprised to be grabbed by Dylan.

<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This way.

</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
At this point, he'll do whatever they say.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT OF MOUNTAIN HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan rushes Knox across the driveway to the waiting van -- Natalie is pulling it around. Overhead, bright security lights switch on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back at the front door, Alex pulls it shut. She attaches a carabiner clip to the handle, running a thin steel cord from it around the porch column.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FOYER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first of the thugs reaches the door, tries to pull it open but can't. The next few guards try to help him, while the rest start smashing through the windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT OF MOUNTAIN HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Running with the tuba, Bosley stops for a moment to catch his breath, hands on his knees. Okay, ready to run again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's the last to be pulled into the van. A spray of gravel and they're off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE VAN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone is piled on top of each other. Dylan and Knox have a few awkward moments as they get untangled. Bosley keeps making inappropriate TUBA NOISES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the wheel, Natalie is fierce and focused, in total control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking out the back windows, Alex sees the kidnappers piling into jeeps to give chase. From the side of the house, more thugs appear on motorbikes.
</DIRECTION>

Everyone's attention WHIPS FORWARD to see the headlights of
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GIANT LOGGING TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
coming up the high mountain road. It straddles the center line, blocking both directions. There's no way around it.

	There!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
She points to a faded "CLOSED" sign that hangs from a chain. In the darkness, who knows what it's blocking. But as we hear the THUNDEROUS HORN from the oncoming truck, we know there's no choice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Natalie cuts a hard right, SMASHING through the sign.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The van THUMPS AND BUMPS its way across the low grass, its headlights only showing ten feet ahead. At any moment, the ground could stop in a cliff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The van leaps into empty space. Tires spin, helpless. The van falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone SCREAMS. Bosley is the loudest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then, touchdown. The van hits the ground, hard but not catastrophically. Natalie hits the brakes, cuts the wheel hard to avoid hitting
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CONCRETE WALL

in front of them. Everyone takes a beat to acknowledge they're alive.

Suddenly, a BRIGHT LIGHT goes on overhead.

EXT. THE MOUNTAIN - NIGHT

One by one, a series of arc lights switches on, forming a snake all the way to the bottom of the mountain.

Looking out the back windows...
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a bobsled run.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
They're facing backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead, the kidnappers are charging down the access roads. The first of two jeeps makes the jump into the bobsled chute.
</DIRECTION>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it goes down the mountain, that's all I need.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Throwing it into reverse, Natalie peels out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The jeeps follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOBSLED RUN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The VW Van leads the way down the mountain, tail-first. As it builds speed, it starts to climb the wall, each turn getting steeper and steeper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two jeeps are following. Facing the right direction, they have a much easier time of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VAN - NIGHT

Everything is shaking so violently, it looks like a NASA launch.

<ALEX>

</DIRECTION>

Natalie makes the turn. The van rises up, nearly tilting over. But they make it through the turn.
</DIRECTION>
<KNOX>

(to Dylan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this part of the plan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KNOX>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Except for the bobsled run, and the backwards part, it's going exactly according to plan.

A beat. He smiles at her. He has a nice smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOBSLED RUN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the jeeps makes a move, closing the distance to the van. A RIFLEMAN leans out the passenger window, lining up a shot. He FIRES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE VAN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shot blasts cleanly through the top of the windshield, through the horn of Bosley's tuba, then out the back window. It missed hitting somebody by millimeters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Natalie is still focused, making each turn as Alex calls it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOBSLED RUN - NIGHT`
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front jeep gets even more aggressive, building speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It hits the next turn too fast, rising up too high along the wall. It tips further, and further, finally rolling over onto its back. It SCRAPES across the concrete, a shower of sparks as it slows down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With nowhere to go, the second jeep brakes hard, but can't stop. It SMASHES into the first jeep, a tangle of steel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The combined mass continues sliding down the run, like a jagged pinball in the chute.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE VAN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan looks out through the windshield as the jeep combo recedes farther and farther away.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>

Just then, two MOTORBIKES race up along the chute walls, passing the crippled jeeps. Two more MOTORBIKES jump in from above.

One motorcycle charges, coming up just feet from the windshield. Natalie taps on the brakes. The freaked out guy can't slow down in time. He SMACKS into the windshield, then goes flying.

	We're at the bottom!

CORWIN'S PIT CREW --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corwin is seething mad as he pulls into his pit.
</DIRECTION>
<CORWIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	LET'S GO! WE'RE LOSING TIME HERE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORWIN>
<DIRECTION>
The pit repairs his car as Corwin is approached by another racer, also wearing a Red Star racing suit. He leans into Corwin's car and now we see that's it's... THE THIN MAN.

<CORWIN>

The Thin Man peers over at Natalie, but she's got her back to him.

</CORWIN>
<DIRECTION>
Corwin peels out onto the track again, almost crushing the Thin Man in the process.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AS CORWIN PULLS OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan sneaks in. In all the cacophony, no one notices as she grabs CORWIN'S SUITCASE out of the back seat of his regular car, a bitching Mercedes. She checks both ways to see if she's being watched.

<DIRECTION>
BACK IN THE PIT --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan pulls a briefcase out of her jumpsuit, and swaps it with one in Corwin's car. She carefully switches all his files from the old briefcase to the new one, then gives Alex a thumbs up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEANWHILE BACK IN THE RACE --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATALIE roars back onto the track, keeping Corwin in her sights. Then she spots another Red Star car, coming up right next to her. She locks eyes with the Thin Man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two of them recognize each other at the exact same instant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Thin Man, realizing he's been made, jams on the brakes and skids off to the right, which leads to a ramp that heads out of the stadium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Natalie, not wanting to lose him, does something crazy. Even though she's at the front of the pack, she brakes hard, swerves into a full 180 degree U-turn, and starts heading the WRONG WAY on the race track.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Startled drivers pull off to the left and right as she follows the Thin Man out of the racetrack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SPEEDWAY ACCESS ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To a chorus of CAR HORNS, the Thin Man's blue racer weaves through the spectator traffic entering the speedway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking back, we see Natalie is gaining on him.

Finally clear of the traffic, both cars let it rip.

A beat-up gray Chrysler leads a phalanx of police cars down the empty freeway. It's oddly calm and hypnotizing.
</DIRECTION>
<FEMALE_ANCHOR_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chuck, time and again we hear the question, "Why don't the police just ram the other car, or shoot out the tires?" The LAPD has a policy of hanging back and following unless...

Suddenly, the blue Formula One car comes screeching past the cops and the suspect, over 200 miles per hour.

INT. NATALIE'S RED CAR / ON THE FREEWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still hot on the Thin Man's tail, Natalie has the engine ROARING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she passes the police cars, we see several OFFICERS look over -- what the hell?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Natalie catches up to the gray Chrysler. Looks over to see the WILD-EYED SUSPECT, hunched over the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks back at her. A beat later, she's passed him, just taillights on the freeway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FREEWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the lanes cleared for the other chase, there is nothing preventing the Formula One cars from hitting top speed -- which they do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Natalie is catching up to the Thin Man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they head under an overpass, we see KIDS CHEERING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BLUE CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Thin Man checks his gauges. The gas dial is perilously close to empty -- these cars are meant to be refilled often.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead, he sees an exit. He starts to slow down...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FREEWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... but when you're going 200 miles per hour, that can take a while. He misses the exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Natalie is trying to match his speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Thin Man pulls over to the side, stops fully. Braking as hard as she can, Natalie still passes him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Thin Man throws a U-turn, heading up the freeway on-ramp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Natalie follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAN DIEGO SHIPYARD - DAY

<DIRECTION>
We catch glimpses behind fences and between train cars -- the two racers gliding slowly down the narrow roads, like lions pacing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NATALIE'S RED CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulling off her helmet, Natalie scans right and left for the blue car -- she's lost sight of him. The narrow windshields of these racers doesn't make it any easier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHIPYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We LOOK DOWN on Natalie's car as she rounds a corner, still searching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PIER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Natalie spots the blue racer reaching the end of the long pier. It pulls a U-turn to face her, then stops, engine idling. There's only way off the pier, and it's past Natalie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Thin Man REVS his engine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Natalie REVS hers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON a white seagull, pecking at something on the pier, halfway between the two racers. The bird looks up, hearing the engines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON the Thin Man. He pulls his harness tighter. REVS his engine higher.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON Natalie. If it's a game of chicken he wants, she'll give it to him. She REVS her engine higher still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The noise scares the bird, who suddenly flies off. Like a flag being dropped, that's the signal for both racers to peel out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cloud of SMOKE. Rubber on asphalt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Already reaching a tremendous speed, the racers are on a collision course. The Thin Man isn't going to turn away. Neither is Natalie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Racing faster, and faster still, there's only one way this can turn out. But then, at the very last moment, the Thin Man wusses out. He cuts the wheel right, missing Natalie and careening off the edge of the pier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In SLOW MOTION, we watch as his racer hangs in mid-air, wheels still spinning. Back-heavy, the tail hits the water first.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Natalie brakes hard, cuts the wheel to avoid going off the far end of the pier. She finally stops, the rear tire just 1/4 inch from the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRANING UP along the side of the pier, we find Natalie looking into the water where the blue racer went in. There's just a slick of oil and a steady stream of bubbles.

We see lots of hallways, doorways and security locks, all from the POV of a man's hip.

The footage is from the camera in the switched briefcase that Corwin is now carrying with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We PULL BACK from the video to see we are actually watching it...

Knox is impressed. The other angels nod. It's a good idea.

<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Red Star has a lot of Government contracts, so security is tight. Key- card badges throughout. Redundant security at all red-line areas with biometric scanners and weekly keycodes. Pervasive video surveillance, lasers, air-displacement sensors. Plus a hard- wired fail-safe at the relay to prevent exactly this kind of tapping.

	Me too.

</ALEX>
<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I mean, it's weird. It's weirding me out how happy I am when you're around. Am I sick or something?

<ALEX>

(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<JASON>

<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll get you some sedatives. You'll be fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
He stops, takes her in his arms. With the moonlight shining down, it's very romantic. They kiss. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. Wait a second. Come with me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JASON>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come with you?

</ALEX>
<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miami, on the Sony Jet. I've got two tickets to the Final Four.

</JASON>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jason, I don't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, before you say no, let me just say something, okay? I'm sick of how little we see each other. I'm sick of stealing a day here, or a week there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JASON>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my job, Jason. I can't explain it, but I have to be on call, all the time, and...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if I changed all that? What if I told you to quit your job, and come live with me. What I'm saying, Alex, is that I want you to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JASON>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM! BLAM! Gunshots ring out!
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gunfire! Get down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
Alex, in Angels mode, immediately throws him to the ground and covers him. She feels something wet, looks down to see Jason's chest, covered in blood.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>

	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	They're squibs, it's fake. See?

<DIRECTION>
He wipes off a little, puts it on her tongue. Finally convinced, she almost lets herself laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVEAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
that we are in a soundstage, the cobblestones street is just a set. The gunfire was coming from some effects guys, who are test firing guns for the upcoming action scene just outside the soundstage, visible through the open loading door.
</DIRECTION>
<JASON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fake guns, too. They're just setting up for the next scene.

	Sorry about that, I...

</ALEX>
<JASON>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, I loved that. The way you yelled and everything? Baby, you been watching too many movies.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he kisses her on the nose)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, I gotta go reset these. DON'T GO ANYWHERE. I want to finish this conversation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JASON>
<DIRECTION>
As he walks out of the soundstage, Alex is left behind, alone. She cleans herself off, shaking her head at her own paranoia.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice, Alex. Real nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
THIPP!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wall next to her sprays a cloud of plaster. Alex looks at the hole. That's strange.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THIP, THIP!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two more little explosions, these barely missing her face.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, is someone firing more squibs or...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, without warning, the wall is plastered with SILENCED GUNFIRE. It's only Alex's instincts that let her duck in time to avoid being turned into Swiss cheese.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tucks and rolls behind a Styrofoam set as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO GUNMEN with silenced SNIPER rifles fan out on the fake city street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ALEX --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
crouched behind a wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks both ways. If she tries to break for the open loading door, she'll lead the gunmen right back to Jason. Only way out of here is to head for the far wall, all the way across the building, where there's a fire exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taking a deep breath, she darts across the fake street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GUNMEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
fire at her, one of them pulling off his silencer and going to machine gun mode. The sound of the gunshots are covered by the sound of the effects guy, test firing guns outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALEX --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sees that the sets are held up by wooden support beams. She lifts her leg and delivers a solid blow, cracking the two-by-fours in half.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GUNMEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
move slowly through the fake street set. Suddenly, they hear a creaking sound. They look up to see the whole, fake building set collapsing!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They dive out of the way, just in time to see Alex race through the fire doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BACKLOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alex races out of the soundstage and jumps into her car, parked nearby. The Gunmen emerge from the stage and spot her, just as she gets the car started. She peels out as a hail of gunfire just misses her windshield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE SOUNDSTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason has just gotten his squibs refitted. He's facing the opposite direction, so he doesn't see Alex's car whizz away in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SOUNDSTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason walks into the Soundstage, followed by the effects crew.
</DIRECTION>
<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alex? ALEX?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JASON>
<DIRECTION>
Of course, she's nowhere to be found. While he looks around, one of the effects guys fingers a bullet hole in the set wall. He presses against it and a FLATTENED BULLET FALLS OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He thinks for a moment, then shakes his head. Couldn't be.

A passing FILMGOER reveals Natalie and Pete. Seated near the aisle, they share a giant tub of popcorn. The movie hasn't started yet, but there's a slide show of various anime heroes and villains.
</DIRECTION>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for the second chance. I swear, I'm really not a flake.

</NATALIE>

He shrugs it off.

	How can I deny any woman who's seen all 23 "Lords of Wind and Power"?

<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen this close up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DIRECTION>
How can she not be flattered by that? She would say something back, but the moment has gotten so electrified that each little glance just brings on more goofy-in- loveness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The only solution is to leave...
</DIRECTION>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies room. I'll be back in two minutes.

INT. LADIES ROOM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
A wee bit smitten, Natalie enters as the last WOMAN leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear just the DRIP DRIP DRIP of a faucet and the Muzak version of Power Station's "Some Like It Hot."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATALIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN A STALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Natalie shuts the door behind herself, then sets to work putting down a tissue-paper seat cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SWEEPING ACROSS THE FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We look under stall doors to find a pair of black men's boots stepping down from inside. Natalie is not alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN HER STALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Natalie is about to hoist her skirt when she stops. Her Spider Sense is tingling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DOOR LATCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLICKS open. We TILT UP to see a WELL-DRESSED MAN. He's at least 6'3".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops at Natalie's stall door, drawing his gun. A beat, then he KICKS the door open, revealing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN EMPTY STALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The automatic toilet FLUSHES itself. The Man takes a half-step in, confused. Suddenly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door swings back, SMASHING into his right hand. He drops the gun, looking up to see
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATALIE,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Who is perched atop the stall walls. She pushed the door with her foot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grabbing an overhead pipe, she performs an acrobatic swing, landing both feet on the guy's head. He falls into the next row of stalls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Natalie reaches for the gun, but the Man grabs her ankles. He pulls her back across the tile floor, flipping her over. That just makes it easier for her to kick him where it counts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a scissors lock around his neck, Natalie is pulled up while the Man falls. She lands a knee on his windpipe.
</DIRECTION>
<NATALIE>

DYLAN'S POV --

Knox is sitting at the coffee table, signing papers. Vivian, sitting across from him, has her cell phone open. They are both surprised to see Dylan walk into the room.

	All the same, I'm concerned about Mr. Knox's safety.

Although Knox is clueless, it's clear the message Vivian is sending to Dylan. She's in control here.

Vivian sets the gun on the table, in easy reach.

With a knowing glance at Dylan, she goes back to her phone call.
</DIRECTION>

No alternative, Dylan takes a seat beside Knox. Both face Vivian, whose hand is very near the gun.

Dylan looks at Knox as he reads through his papers. He has no idea there's anything wrong.

As Knox flips pages in the report, Dylan casually begins pushing Scrabble letters around, nothing serious. But she's managed to spell...

She gets Knox's attention, looks to the word, up to Vivian. Knox follows her intention, but doesn't seem to believe it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While Vivian continues to talk on the phone, Knox sets his report down. Pushes around some letters of his own. The words finally come out as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
I KNOW

CLOSE ON Dylan. What does that mean?

Vivian snaps her phone shut.

	Oh, well, in that case I feel a lot better about you being a lying pole smoker.

How right he is, because as soon as Vivian squeezes the trigger...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan drops to the floor, then rolls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the bullet misses Dylan and slams into the bulletproof window causing a spider-web crack to spread. Dylan sees her opportunity and heads right for the window while Vivian pumps off shots.

As she comes to the window, Dylan jumps up in the air and does a flying kick, hitting right at the spot where the bullet impacted.

Bosley WHISTLES to a bright red songbird who has landed on the windowsill. The bird WHISTLES back. Bosley thinks they're having a conversation.

At the last moment, Natalie catches a moving reflection in a shiny trophy. Turns to find Vivian Wu swinging an antique chair at her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She ducks. The chair SHATTERS the display case.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scrambling to get away, Natalie drops the phone.

</VIVIAN_WU>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian upends the desk, nearly crushing Natalie. Vivian jumps on top, ready to kick the shit out of our angel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we probably suspected, Vivian Wu is one hell of a martial artist. Fortunately, so is Natalie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In their first series of blows, Vivian seems to have the upper hand, but Natalie rallies hard. Vivian surprises her with a floor-sweeping kick, knocking her down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian grabs the phone off the floor.

Vivian looks at the phone. Who the fuck cares? She throws the phone out the open window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Getting up, Natalie stares her down, incredulity building to rage.
</DIRECTION>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bitch! I like that guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATALIE>
<DIRECTION>
Mocking, Vivian wipes away a tear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Natalie lets forth a typhoon of fury, a full-out Mortal Kombat. Vivian is thrown back against the bookcase, where she knocks over a candlestick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That's the trigger for the bookcases to begin sinking into the floor. Circling around the room, each set of shelves drops to a different level, forming steps that lead to the upstairs room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Natalie and Vivian continue to fight, Bosley sticks his head down from above, watching the brawl. Natalie is kicking ass.
</DIRECTION>
<NATALIE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have any idea how difficult it is to find a quality man in Los Angeles?

She slams Vivian into the wall. Grabs her again, hands around her head.
</DIRECTION>
<VIVIAN_WU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To be honest?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIVIAN_WU>
<DIRECTION>
Vivian suddenly leans forward and KISSES her, right on the lips.

<VIVIAN_WU>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care.

Natalie is surprised for a moment, which gives Vivian the chance to swing at her. She misses.

<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can handle villainy. I can even handle super-villainy.

<DIRECTION>
(Vivian swings and misses again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what you did is just wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATALIE>
<DIRECTION>
She head-butts Vivian, knocking her out cold. She throws the limp body on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat, then Natalie looks up to see Bosley.

EXT. VERANDAH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From below, we hear SECURITY WHISTLES. The compound has been breached. Dylan looks at the six armed guards surrounding her.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here we go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
And now she does exactly what she told the Thin Man she'd do:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pitches forward, ducking her head so the chair's back crashes into the railing, tearing it off. She stands.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, that part worked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Guards FIRE -- but Dylan has already launched herself from the railing into that backflip, which lands her on the head of --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fat Boy, flattening him bad, and smashing the rest of the chair into kindling. She grabs the wooden seat and whips it up, catching bullets from Guard #3 before flinging it like a Frisbee at Guard #2, nailing him right on the chin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quickly she stands again, between Guards #3 and 4.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, guys, I warned you. This is where you shoot each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
The two men scoff, disbelieving. Then Dylan does a head fake, both Guards panic, and fire, but Dylan drops, leaving each man a clear shot at the other. Both gape. Both fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just Guards #5 and 6 left. Dylan's chair arms are still taped to her forearms.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, here's where we improvise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
In a whirl, she overhead-chops Guard #5. Drives her right arm into his shoulder while swinging her left arm into the back of the Guard #6's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few more blows, then both men fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Dylan drops into a second chair, half-exhausted, half-amused with herself. Has one brief beat to take it all in, then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bosley steps onto the veranda, sees Dylan sitting in the chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW: It looks like Dylan -- whose arms are still strapped to the arms of the first chair -- is taped to the chair she now sits in.
</DIRECTION>
<BOSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God, let me help you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOSLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Bosley hurries over, "freeing her." Amused, Dylan lets him. Natalie steps out from inside, pausing to KICK one guard who was starting to revive.

Racing across the water, we find thong-clad BEACH BABES moving to a Latin beat. Art Deco buildings flank sun-kissed streets. The people are sexy, the daiquiris strong, and every night's a fiesta -- Welcome to MIAMI.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Running down the street, towards Miami Arena, the three angels pass THREE OTHER WOMEN rollerblading by: JILL MONROE, SABRINA DUNCAN and KELLY GARRETT.

Nothing is said, but a cool moment just happened.

We reverse angle to reveal the inside of Miami Arena. The first thing that hits us is the WALL OF SOUND, the noise made by twenty thousand people in a basketball induced frenzy.
</DIRECTION>

The next thing that hits us is the sheer magnitude of the job facing the Angels. Hard to spot? The crowd is one, enormous, teeming mass of brightly colored humanity.

<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw, shit.
	</DIALOGUE>

The game is in progress, Duke vs. North Carolina, and it's a barn burner. A one point game with six minutes to go. BALL PLAYER pulls up and swishes a three pointer, Duke by two. The crowd goes apeshit.

JASON GIBBONS, famous movie star and North Carolina alumnus, pumps his fists in the air. His luxury box is loaded with fellow Tar Heels and nameless studio executives. He repeatedly high fives a Hollywood type in sunglasses and Armani.

Alex walks out into the hallway, frustrated. Then, miraculously, she spots him...

KNOX.

He walks out of one of the luxury boxes, holding a large, metal briefcase. He heads for the elevator.

Knox glances back at the Thin Man, nods to him. Then he gets in the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Thin Man starts edging Alex towards some emergency exit doors, gun still in her back. Alex is trying to think of an escape, quickly. She knows that the second he gets her out of this public space, he's gonna shoot her. The door gets closer and closer...

</JASON>
<DIRECTION>
And then, with no warning, he hauls off and punches the Thin Man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, Jason's just an actor, not an ass-kicking super detective, so his punch isn't all that great. In fact, it leaves Jason shaking his hand in pain.

<DIRECTION>
The Thin Man, a trickle of blood running from his lip, smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<THIN_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was stupid.

First, he pops Jason right in the jaw. Jason stumbles backward, dazed. Then he reaches for his gun, in the process, loosening his grip on Alex...
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jason, get down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
Alex spins out of the Thin Man's grasp and does a full roundhouse kick, knocking the gun out of the Thin Man's hands. The Thin Man immediately responds, throwing two quick punches, which Alex expertly blocks and then follows with a hitch-kick to the chin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason, dazed and confused, thinks he must be hallucinating.
</DIRECTION>
<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell is going on?

<DIRECTION>
What's going on is a world class ass-kicking, courtesy of his girlfriend. While the action star watches in amazement, Alex unloads an arsenal of bad ass kung fu moves that would make Jet Li green with envy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Thin Man doesn't stand a chance. A flying side kick sends him stumbling backwards into the stairwell. We follow the fight...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRWELL -- CONTINUOUS

... to the first landing. The Thin Man, battered and bruised, reaches down to his ankle holster to get his spare gun, but Alex is too fast for him. She stamps on his hand, then drops a knee to his throat.

	Right now, just by leaning forward, I could crush your windpipe. You'd die a slow and painful death. You don't want that, do you?

She prepares to snip them with her wire cutters, when...
</DIRECTION>
<KNOX>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't do that, if I were you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KNOX>
<DIRECTION>
She spins to see Knox, standing behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<KNOX>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, if you snip ANY of those wires, the bomb WILL blow up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KNOX>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's gonna blow anyway, once the clock gets to zero.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<KNOX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who told you that, my idiotic henchman? Do you think I tell him ANYTHING that's confidential?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KNOX>
<DIRECTION>
He holds up a small TRIGGERING DEVICE. It's the same one we saw Pascal try to sell in the opening scene.
</DIRECTION>
<KNOX>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	THIS is what triggers that bomb. So if you'll kindly step away, I'll refrain from killing both of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KNOX>
<DIRECTION>
Realizing she has no choice, Dylan stands up and backs away.
</DIRECTION>
<KNOX>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In different circumstances, Dylan, I think you and I could have worked out. We have a lot in common.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KNOX>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I fall for assholes, and you ARE one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
Knox laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<KNOX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good one.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat, as he backs up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I must be going. If you like your body parts attached to your torso, I suggest you do the same.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KNOX>
<DIRECTION>
Knox turns to go, but the other Angels are blocking his way.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give it up, Knox. You're surrounded.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give us the detonator.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATALIE>
<KNOX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NO!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KNOX>
<DIRECTION>
Stumbling backwards, Knox holds it up high.
</DIRECTION>
<KNOX>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll blow this building sky high, I swear!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KNOX>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do it, Eric. It's me you want, not all these innocent people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone turns, as one, to a figure emerging from the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<KNOX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KNOX>
<DIRECTION>
That's right, it's Charlie. Finally, after all these years, we get a look at him, and boy is it... disappointing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's not what we expected. Short, portly, dressed in a "We're #1" t-shirt; the Angels are absolutely floored by Charlie's appearance.
</DIRECTION>
<ANGELS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELS>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie ignores their stares and addresses Knox directly.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your father was a double agent, Eric. Yes, I revealed him, but he was killed by his own people before we could throw him in jail.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was my friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KNOX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's still your fault, you arrogant prick! You still killed my father!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KNOX>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe. Maybe I did. But why should YOU kill all these people? If you hate me so much, just shoot ME. Just shoot me, Eric.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie spreads his arms, leaving Knox a plenty wide target.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a horribly tense moment. The Angels are frozen, watching Knox decide Charlie's fate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Knox is sweating, debating his choices. Can he really do this? Charlie's not the glamorous, smug asshole he imagined. He starts lowering his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<KNOX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. You're right.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll just kill you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KNOX>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It all happens in the blink of an eye. Knox fires, hitting Charlie in the chest. Natalie leaps out and tackles Knox. Alex dives and grabs the detonator, before it has a chance to go off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan runs to Charlie's side.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie, no. NO!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
She hold shim in her arms as the other Angels gather round their fallen leader. He gasps for air.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's trying to say something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
Then Dylan notices something weird. He's not gasping for air, there's something stuck in his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a great, hacking cough, he spits it out. It's a voice chip, like the one Dylan used in the opening scene.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ucch, that tasted terrible!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The voice isn't Charlie's. Dylan reaches down and rips off Charlie's mask, revealing...
</DIRECTION>
<NATALIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bosley! Are you okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATALIE>
<BOSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOSLEY>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls back the padding from the suit, revealing a small wound where the bullet grazed his side.
</DIRECTION>
<BOSLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hurts, but it looks like it'll heel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOSLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan laughs, Alex ruffles his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, wait a second. If Bosley's here... then where's Charlie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Angels all look at each other. No one knows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CENTER PASSAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In gorgeous SLOW MOTION, the three angels walk side-by-side with a calm assurance, fireballs exploding behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They won.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As MUSIC rises, the ANGELS TRIPTYCH descends, then peels away to reveal...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GORGEOUS BEACH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The angels kick back on the white sands, tropical drinks in- hand. Bosley is there as well, with a grass hat and zinc on his sniffer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie is on the cellular speakerphone.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great work, angels. You'll be happy to know you received another presidential commendation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The Angels, and Bosley, clink glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enjoy your vacation, angels.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE_S_VOICE>
<THE_ANGELS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you Charlie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_ANGELS>
<DIRECTION>
They toast the speakerphone.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alex, Natalie -- I know you've been putting in some long hours on this case, so I thought you might enjoy a chance to catch up with some old friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
NATALIE AND ALEX TURN TO SEE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PETER AND JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
walking across the beach towards them. Each is carrying a drink of his own. They wave. Damn those men look good.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alex and Natalie share a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any chance you'll be joining us, Charlie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SUNNY DECK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're in Charlie's point-of-view. We can see part of his reflection in the window -- not enough to see his face, but we get some sense of the man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns away, begins walking. Steps down onto the sand.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(to cell phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd love to, Angels. But I have some precious treasures to watch over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
With that, he hangs up. We stay in his P.O.V., walking across the beach. And it's not just any beach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TO THE LEFT, WE NOTICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PETE AND JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
approaching. We're on the same beach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking right, we see the backs of the Angels and Bosley. They have no idea that Charlie is walking right behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat, then Dylan looks back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks directly as us -- at Charlie -- tracking as we move past. Does she somehow recognize it's Charlie? From her reaction, it's not clear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat, then we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE/NOT P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan looks back forward again. Did she just see Charlie? Her smile tells us she thinks she did.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She raises a toast.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To Charlie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<THE_ANGELS_AND_BOSLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To Charlie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_ANGELS_AND_BOSLEY>
<DIRECTION>
They knock glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Right at the moment we should probably fade out, Bosley spills his icy drink in his lap. His eyes go wide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Angels just have to laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We FREEZE FRAME, then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
