EXT. VINCI COUNTRYSIDE - RENAISSANCE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beneath a jawdroppingly storybook castle, a small Renaissance Fair with florid awnings, demented ACROBATS and roaring puppets is unfolding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUSTIC FARMERS and their families rumble with enjoyment at the Sabbath afternoon entertainment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Encircled by children, A JUGGLER WITH AN UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE elegantly plucks the red balls from a pouch on his mule. As he begins to juggle, a LOUD EXPLOSION is heard, causing him to ungracefully drop his balls and collapse in a heap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone at the fair, including the puppets, looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<UNFORGETTABLE_JUGGLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leonardo, che pazzo.

</UNFORGETTABLE_JUGGLER>
<DIRECTION>
The juggler shakes his fist up to a swish pan that swings up toward a smoking window of the awesome castle...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROOM OF THE GOLD MACHINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where the charismatic LEONARDO DA VINCI laughs down at him. Da Vinci wears a pair of very early, very cool sun- glasses with his trademark beard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and loses his smile, something extraordinary reflecting off his glasses. Removing his shades, Da Vinci moves to the Something, a gloriously incredible machine. The opening CREDITS REVEAL its dazzling idio- syncrasies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO COUGHING APPRENTICES haplessly try to disperse smoke from the still billowing, mysteriously spectacular Machine. Mirrors attached to parts of it reflect beams of light which cut through the smoke like a Renaissance laser show.

<DA_VINCI>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Basta vapore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DA_VINCI>
<DIRECTION>
The apprentice throws a lever. A shunt near the furnace turns. Steam escapes upwards. The machine immediately slows down. Da Vinci oh-so-gently coughs and moves for- ward with tongs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LITTLE TROUGH - IN THE MACHINE'S INNARDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
comes to a trembling, mystical halt. Right behind this trough is a CONPLEX POLYHEDRON CRYSTAL as intricately modulated as any Rubik stocking stuffer, but much more dazzling in beauty. It gleams like a jewel in the yellow glow which pours from a PLEASANTLY GRINNING DEMONHEAD into a trough--a glow of heat--and something more than heat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tongs enter the frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Da Vinci brings the object closer to his face. A murmur goes up from the awestruck apprentices as the Master peers at the smoking yellow bar.
</DIRECTION>

Da Vinci's pride goes dead as the implications hit.
</DIRECTION>
<DA_VINCI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lasciatemi, solo. Solo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DA_VINCI>
<DIRECTION>
The apprentices scurry out. Mind reeling, Da Vinci turns his back to the viewer, before a wall of frescoes.
</DIRECTION>
<DA_VINCI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	L'ho fatto.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DA_VINCI>
<DIRECTION>
Spinning back around, using the edge of his cloak, Da Vinci pulls out the large gleaming crystal with a pop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DA VINCI'S WORKSHOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With an accompanying blast of smoke, Da Vinci bursts through some double doors into his workshop, sadly reflecting upon the crystal in one hand and the tonged bar in the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His workshop is a spendiferously enigmatic blend of laboratory and studio; On a table in the foreground is a fresh clay equestrian statue; a large VOLUME of sketches, the inkwell nearby; a MODEL of what looks like a HELICOPTER; Da Vinci flings the tonged bar on the table among these goodies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pocketing the crystal, Da Vinci meanders through his work- shop casually tinkering with various experiments. He snaps his fingers at a BATHING SUITED APPRENTICE, wearing a diving helmet prototype. The Apprentice jumps into a pool of water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonardo next stops at an easel displaying a finished- except-for-the-mouth portrait of Mona Lisa, who happens to be seated in a stool before the easel. She broadly smiles, revealing the worst dental work of her epoch. Da Vinci shakes his head and moves out onto a

<DIRECTION>
EXT. CASTLE TERRACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FLYING APPRENTICE sails past Leonardo in a bat winged glider, enthusiastically shouting. Da Vinci grins back until he touches his pocket. He pulls out the crystal and, after a beat, angrily twists it apart into two separate, geometric pieces revealing a small intricate mirror. He quickly folds the surprisingly shapable geometric pieces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Calming down, Da Vinci looks from the three components of the crystal to each of the three unfinished works on the table in his workshop. He ponders then looks back out to the Vinci vista.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bat winged glider DISSOLVES into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HAWK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who is revealed to be flying over Sing Sing prison.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. A SING SING PRISON CELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shadow of the hawk passes through a cell window, over the face of EDDIE HUDSON HAWKINS causing him to break out of an eye-closed trance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before the viewer can get a good look at him, Hudson Hawk turns to an oddball version of the "Mona Lisa" that has his face and tears it off the cell back-wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRISON BLOCK WALKWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO PRISON GUARDS, One WISE and BLACK, the other YOUNG and GREEN march down a cell block. The Former is smoking a pipe which the Young Guard lights with a lighter.
</DIRECTION>
<WISE_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're losing our biggest celebrity today.

INT. PRISON CELL WALL

A hand tears down a picture of a happy Hudson Hawk and a LITTLE MONKEY, identically dressed in black cat burglar gear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BLOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Wise Guard and the Young Guard rumble forward.
</DIRECTION>
<WISE_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As a thief, Hawk was a poem. Iambic fucking pentameter. You know, Crime used to have a little class. A hundred reporters were here when he came in, now they're probably out covering some tired crack gang war...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WISE_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
The Guards approach Hawk's cell. Hawk, with his back turned, hefts on a nifty blazer.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remind me to fire my publicist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
The Wise Guard chuckles as the Young Guard fumbles with his key-ring.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darn, these are for L-block...
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk's hand reaches through the bars and grabs a pipe cleaner from the Wise Guard's pocket. Then the lighter from the Young Guard's pocket--BURNS OFF the fabric fuzz with the lighter beside it--bends the now blackened wire--and with a quick turn of the wrist uses it to UNLOCK the door.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_GUARD>

</YOUNG_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
He stops, dumbfounded, as the door clunks open. The Guards double-take as Hawk, finally in full view, struts past them, down the hall. The Guards hustle to catch up. The wise guard puts his finger in the air and sarcastically pretends to be stung by the heat emanating from Hawk.
</DIRECTION>
<WISE_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess this means, Hawk, you'll be able to let yourself back in...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WISE_GUARD>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never happen. Bet. Ten bucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk and the Wise Guard hit fists, half-smiling. Hawk unfolds the painting.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, give this back to Petey in A block. Tell him it was a sweet gift, but I think he got some wrong ideas about our friendship.
	</DIALOGUE>

<YOUNG_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Paint Thinner Killer did this? I think you picked a good day to get out...
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
The trio comes to the final checkpoint. Hawk takes a deep breath.
</DIRECTION>
<WISE_GUARD>

	Hope I lose the bet. Have that cappuccino on me.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. OUTSIDE THE PRISON--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk strides to the Massive Sliding Concrete Door/Wall between him and freedom. As music crescendos and Hawk glows his first smile, the door opens to reveal two Mafioso brothers, CESAR and ANTONY MARIO, the latter sitting upon the hood of a tinted window Lincoln Continental. Cesar is of cool, hair-slicked-back attitude, his scumbag brother is not.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome back, buddy ol' pal. We've got a proposition...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONY>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Answer's no, not even if you bathe. Cesar Mario, Antony Mario, how's the "Family?" Kill any monkeys lately?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<CESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many times do I have to say it? I didn't put the hit on Little Eddie... Never had anything against that kooky chimp. I actually found him, "endearing."
	</DIALOGUE>
</CESAR>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. Face down. Two endearing shots to the back of the head. That's your mark, man. What did Little Eddie ever do to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Smouldering, Hawk struts off. Cesar takes a black canvas bag from a SCARFACED DRIVER and hustles up to Hawk. The Lincoln rumbles behind them, Antony riding on the hood.
</DIRECTION>
<CESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're hitting Rutherford's Auction House. Easy as my brother's wife. Directions are in the bag. Just open the seventh floor safe and take out the thingie...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CESAR>
<HAWK>

	Or you cut off my thingie. Directions even your brother would understand.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, directions even I could understand.

<DIRECTION>
The car squeals to a stop. Antony bounds off. Cesar shove-throws the canvas bag into Hawk's unwilling hands.
</DIRECTION>
<CESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hawk, you're a great thief. Got set up, did some time, nothing to be ashamed of. Don't give me a sonata about you always just really wanted to settle down, open a hardware Store and sell spatulas...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CESAR>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If the Mario brothers weren't Jersey's third largest family, I'd say kiss my ass. But considering your status, I'll say slurp my butt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk fiercely push-shoves the canvas bag back into Cesar's hands.
</DIRECTION>
<CESAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your favorite sport, Hawk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CESAR>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baseball, why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Antony opens the back door of the Lincoln and says "Baseball." He is handed a baseball bat. Hawk backs up as Antony moves threateningly toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I meant, ping pong. Listen, I'd rather go back in than whore for you...
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I need to borrow ten dollars.

A PRISON GUARD from above turns as not to be a witness. Hawk feebly calls up to him.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help? Police?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Antony swings at Hawk, who pretends not to notice until the last second. Hawk ducks and slam-kicks his calf. Antony crumples, using the bat as a crutch. Hawk boots up the bat for a two-handed catch then savagely pivots it across Antony's face, knocking him into the backseat of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<CESAR>

(unfazed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need some time to think. That's cool, but next time, I'm not going to say "Please."
	</DIALOGUE>
</CESAR>
<DIRECTION>
Cesar floats into the backseat. The Lincoln takes off. Hawk seethes...
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe this. I've been out forty seconds...

A BACKFIRE rings out. Hawk hits the ground, thinking it is a gunshot.

<DIRECTION>
HAWK'S ON THE GROUND P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gasping 1960 Caddy comes to a stop and a pair of a too- fancy-to-be-tasteful shoes comes out. Hawk looks up to see ALEX MESSINA, his older, maybe-maybe-not-wiser best friend.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the first thing I did. Smooch the ground and taste the freedom. Sorry I was late. Miss anything?

	Your timing, and your shoes, are impeccable... Good to see you, Alex, been having a lousy day.

<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lousy day? The man's getting out of prison and he's having a lousy day. What, you missing out on the Cell Block Water Ballet pageant? Believe me, it's overrated.

Hawk pauses to say something, then just hugs Alex.

	Where's the kiss? No tongue this time, I promise.

A laughing Hawk gives Alex's stomach a slap before getting in the car....

EXT. THE ROAD INTO HOBOKEN--DAY

The Caddy thunders past a sweet Manhattan view. "Come Fly With Me" is playing on the radio. Hawk casually com- pletes an intimidating hand puzzle.

	That's your definition of "Hard?"

<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that you're born again,what do you wanna do? Statue of Liberty? Entertain some ladies? Miss Saigon tix? Seduce some women? Play Nintendo? Bone some chicks?

</ALEX>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Alex, let's just get to Alex's. Your bar's the only place that's going to cheer me. God, I'd kill for a damn cappuccino. What the hell's a Nintendo?

	Oh, not much. Mario Brothers want me to do a job.

Alex brakes and cappuccino flies. Hawk half-heartedly tries to lick up with his fingers.

The Guys move through the personably Jersey face of the bar. The Empire State Building beams in the background. Sinatra cuts off.

INT. ALEX'S BAR--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's changed. Hawk and Alex enter into what has become the ultimate pseudo-art deco-fern littered-nightmare, packed with noisy, INSUFFERABLY SELF-ABSORBED YUPS. A violently erotic and pretentious video plays upon elevated T.V. sets set up all around the place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk's mouth gapes as he drifts by a sickening COUPLE toasting wine coolers, and two very YOUNG BROKERS high- fiving each other after missing a dartboard.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't know how to tell you. A couple brokers stopped in for Stoley Spritzers one night. Next thing I know Fast Track Digest votes us "Watering Hole of the Month." Now, I'm shopping for Aqua Salmon wallpaper.

Alex lifts a piece of the bar and moves behind it. Snatching up a menu, Hawk calls out...

The Non-smoker fumbles out a pack of cigarettes and flees. A cappuccino in cup and saucer slides down the bar saloon-style. A smiling Hawk picks it up, turns away from the bar and closes his eyes, bringing the cup to his lips until a POLICE BADGE swirls into frame and splashes into the cup, splattering coffee over Hawk's blazer.

	The auction house, asshole. One night's work and you're free like no ex-con's ever been. No checking in with a shrink, no community service teaching retards how to play air hockey. It's a great deal, I can't lie.

Hawk is rummaging through stockpiled remnants of an old, "true" bar. Round lamps, tacky mirrors, pictures of Hawk and the Regs at the bar. Managing a weary smile, Hawk lifts a ship steering wheel, while Alex puts on a pair of granny classes and pulls out blueprints.

Hawk nervously picks up a Rubik's Cube and holds it behind his back. He brings it back around, completed. Sighing, Hawk drops the cube and rubs his scalp. Alex starts rubbing his stomach. They pace in pre-job syncopation and speak rapid-fire.

Out of annoyance, Hawk breaks out of the cuffs and violently throws them at Alex, who sits down a little wounded.

EXT. NICE, BUSINESS NEIGHBORHOOD--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO GRUBBY DERELICTS, one pushing a shopping cart, the other inside it, situated atop the usual two Glad bags. They are drunkenly warbling "Witchcraft." IMPECCABLY DRESSED NIGHT-LIFERS give them a wide berth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our derelicts pass beneath a MASSIVE RED CANOPY of a distinguished eight story edifice, upon which is written RUTHERFORD'S AUCTION HOUSE. A DOORMAN shoos them away...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A NEWSPAPER TRUCK pulls up in front of the Auction House. The Driver pops out with a bundle of papers and moves to a Dispenser on the corner. The Bums wheel around the truck. The Driver loads the papers and bounds back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Truck pulls away from the corner. The shopping cart rolls off--the bums nowhere to be seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Truck turns the corner, revealing the derelicts climbing up the back of it, with Glad bags around their necks. The Truck moves toward an enclosed Walkway Bridge that connects the Auction House with another Building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Launching low-tech grapples, the Vagrants latch them- selves onto the Walkway window as the Truck passes beneath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The viewer's viewpoint moves into a tighter view of the dangling derelicts, revealing them to, of course, be Hawk and Alex. Getting a footing, on the small window ledge, each man cuts a hole in the window while holding onto a plunger.

Alex points to an open doorway just down the hall where laughter and shadows emerge. Hawk tries to flee, but a grinning Alex pulls him toward it.

Hawk and Alex slide across the wall to a closed room marked POWER, which is right next to the open Guards' Station. The viewer's viewpoint moves past Hawk and Alex lock-picking into the Power room to...

Moving beneath a video camera and a dazzling Set of Hanging Horse Mobiles, a Heavyset guard, BIG STAN, moseys through the dimly lit main auction house auditorium. The auditorium chairs are strewn out in the middle beside a turbo Floor Washer.

Next to a painting of Happy Children Riding Horses at the back of the auditorium stage, Big Stan hefts himself upon a comparatively TINY BLUE CHAIR and begins to tip back and snooze.

AUCTION AREA

Big Stan is walking in back of the seated bidders: An oblivious Hawk in the foreground starts to scan VARIED BIDDER-TYPES, raising their paddles to babble out dollar figures; a GAUDY ROCK STAR and his GLOOMY-CHIC ENTOURAGE, A KING FAROUK-TYPE with a BORED TEENAGE AMERICAN HOOKER, and a scary NORDIC PRINCESS in a monocle and a tiara.

Commencing a slow motion sequence, Big Stan comes out of the nearby office, zipping up his fly. He immedi- ately scopes Hawk in the space before the stage.

Anna's leg pokes out of the aisle, tripping the guard.

Hawk brakes at the end of the Mayflower's row and smiles in relief, casually turning to Darwin and Minerva.

The gavel continues to come down in super slow-motion.

Both Darwin and Minerva Mayflower suddenly DUCK DOWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smile vanishing, Hawk spins toward the stage.

The Gavel hits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Breaking out of slow-motion into wide-angle, the entire podium explodes sending debris, equestrian pieces, and eccentric bald pieces searing into the screaming, battered crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Knocked off his feet, Hawk gropes into a standing position. He sees the Mayflowers make a smooth exit. He starts to give chase until he sees a battered Anna rising from the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hanging white Tri-Star Pegasus, cracks from the damaged ceiling and swooshes down towards Anna.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk bolts upon some auction chairs and makes a flying leap. He slams Anna out of the Pegasus's pulverizing Path. They weary up off the ground and move down the aisle, calm in a storm of packed art patrons.

The elevated gurney blasts out the back with a now unstrapped but terrified Hawk whoa-a-ing atop it.

Screeching cars are weirded out by the new vehicle on the road.

Hawk, with an unchanged expression of pure white knuckle fear, comes to a tranquil gurney-wheels-gently-squeaking stop.
</DIRECTION>

Lit by the flames of the ambulance crash, a sneering young man in wire rim glasses emerges from the darkness, carrying a steel suitcase. He kneels before Hawk and opens the suitcase revealing a complex computer appara- tus. He begins mumbling into a cellular phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A malevolent, SILENT DEADPAN WRAITH passes him and approaches Hawk. Both men are dressed in outfits that seem to be a melange of fascist uniform and haute couture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the fingers of one Wraith hand is carved the word HATE. On the other hand is the word FROG. The Frog Hand hands a befuddled Hawk a card. It reads: MY NAME IS KIT KAT AND THIS IS NOT A DREAM.

Hawk looks up with a "huh" expression as Kit Kat chops his neck, knocking him off the gurney.

</HAWK>
<DARWIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... Let's see. There are organizations that think we wanted the "Sforza" for reasons other than putting it in the Da Vinci museum we're building in Vinci. Hopefully, these organizations think our plan has been ruined with the explosion of our replica. If I seem vague, grand. We want a low profile on this, that's why I got Kaplan and the Candy bars involved. I helped George help the Mario Brothers and Gates help get you out....

INT. MASSIVE CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mind-blowingly pretentious painting of Darwin, Minerva, and Bunny hangs above a mammoth M-shaped conference table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lying atop the table in heels, shades, and a heart- stopping dark outfit is Minerva. NASTY Metal riffs semi- audibly spew from a headset she wears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Surrounding the table is a VARIED GROUP OF OLD MONEY AND NEW MONEY BOARD MEMBERS ranging from a nine year old INDIAN PRINCE to a SWEET ELDERLY AMERICAN WOMAN. They converse to the person at their side in businesslike tones, oblivious to Minerva.
</DIRECTION>
<DARWIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and gentlemen of the board...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARWIN>
<DIRECTION>
The board members go into tableau silence. Minerva con- tinues a brief sing-a-long before Darwin scolds...
</DIRECTION>
<DARWIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Min-er-va. Let's give it up for Hudson Hawk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARWIN>
<DIRECTION>
The board applauds as Alfred pushes Hawk inside.
</DIRECTION>
<MINERVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello......Bunny, Ball-Ball!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINERVA>
<DIRECTION>
Minerva lobs a ball in the air. Bunny, the annoying dog, scurries beside Hawk to catch it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving down toward the other end of the table, Hawk takes in the surreal surroundings with battle fatigue. He sees ONE BOARD MEMBER take a luxurious sip of cappuccino. Minerva paces up upon the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DARWIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.

</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alfred, you're a very polite psychopath, but if you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk kicks out at Alfred, who nimbly moves slightly and gives a pummel to Hawk's body somersaulting him over the edge of the table, into an empty seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Board Members politely applaud. Alfred pulls Hawk's hands around his back and cuffs him. Bunny intensely sniffs his crotch.
</DIRECTION>
<MINERVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We want Da Vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the Codex.

	Listen Hawk, this might be hard to believe, but I'm a regular joe. I just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals.

<DIRECTION>
Alfred plants a slide machine on the table and Darwin starts clicking gorgeous images of Hawk and Alex robbing the auction house, on a bare wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Board members gush. The Elderly Woman gives a thumbs-up.
</DIRECTION>
<DARWIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's veja du, Hawkhead. Something you wish never happened. We shot the entire operation with hidden cameras behind the hidden cameras. Hired the guy who did the last Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue. Excellent work... whoops, damn Fotomat assholes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARWIN>
<DIRECTION>
A slide hits the wall of himself and Minerva kneeling in Big Baby clothes with Alfred snarling over them, decked out in leather. He clicks ahead...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk looks away and sees that the Board members have an annual Report-type booklet in front of them that reads-- THE DA VINCI/ALCHEMY PROJECT.

CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
EXT. A MASSIVE WIDE SHOT OF ST. PETER'S--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Vatican stands in its glory, mobbed by HUNDREDS OF LOCALS AND SIGHTSEERS. The viewer's viewpoint zeroes in on the Mayflower limousine circling around it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LIMOUSINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk looks out from the back seat of the limousine in stylish Italian sunglasses.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm robbing the Vatican. The nuns at St. Agnes predicted that I'd end up doing this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Two identical Twin Flunkies sit across from him, grinning stupidly. Hawk pushes up his sunglasses with his middle finger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VATICANESQUE MAP ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mentally casing the joint, Hawk gets some distance between him and the flunkies as he enters into a room that has a glorious, ancient Map of the World Mural.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANOTHER VATICAN ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk makes a scribble in a notepad before coming to a Vatican guard, standing before a painting of a Pope performing a Coronation.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
(half-hearted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, I'm being blackmailed into robbing the Vatican by a psychotic American corporation along with a CIA...

A jaded Hawk laughs and pats the cop on the back.

	Forget it, man. Go tackle a jaywalker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. CIRCULAR OPEN AIR HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk comes out onto a circular open-air hallway. He scans up to some rooftops and makes a note...until he sees a line of International Phone Boothettes. Checking for Flunkies, he rips one up.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Operator, I want to make a collect call to Alex Messina, New York....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
The Flunkies drift into view. Hawk hangs up and seethes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY LEADING TO CODEX ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk saunters down a long resplendent hallway toward a room at the end bustling with excitement. Coming to the mouth of the room, he looks to two gold framed mirrors on either side of the opening, rubs his head, and scribbles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE CODEX ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk takes in the majestic beauty, and practical details, of the room--windows, statues, a Massive Ornate Lighting Fixture--as he moves down one of the twin winding stair- cases leading to a path of people behind velvet ropes and the object of their gaze...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DA VINCI CODEX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--an old book enclosed in a glass case, propped open to the familiar BEAUTIFUL DRAWING of a MAN inside a CIRCLE.
</DIRECTION>

The case is located between two informational tablets enclosed in glass columns. Enter Holy Da Vinci theme.

Hawk brightens to the return of Anna, carrying a portfolio bag, striding down the stairs with a group of INVESTORS AND FAMILIES. She brightens back, giving him a quick verbal breath and a hand squeeze.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>

</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
A LITTLE BRAT trailing the group, moves next to Hawk, bitching away to her STUFFED ELEPHANT, POKEY.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BRAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is so bor-ing! Do you hate Italy as much as I do, Pokey?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(bad ventriloquism)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Si, senor! Italy sucks the big one! why can't we go to the Epcot Center!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BRAT>
<DIRECTION>
The Little Brat stops and lets Pokey the elephant dangle from her side. Hawk eyes the elephant strangely.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These more dangerous designs inspired him to develop a secret code that ....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
The stuffed elephant suddenly goes flying over Anna's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ALARM goes off. The Massive Ornate Lighting Fixture swoops down from the ceiling, inverting in air, and slams down over the Codex, transformed into a makeshift cage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Strange green gas comes billowing out of the vents. Needless to say, everyone goes crazy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coughing gas, Hawk peeks to see that a line of light sensor alarms imbedded in the tablets are what set the alarm off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two GAS MASKS drop airlinesquely from the mouth of the entranceway and TWO RACING-IN GUARDS wrangle them on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Little Brat sees that Pokey the stuffed elephant has been beheaded by the cage/lamp. She is pulled away and spanked.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BRAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pokey, come back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BRAT>
<DIRECTION>
Anna yanks a notetaking Hawk away as the gas blusters in around him. The Two Flunkies, eyes on Hawk, are hap- lessly making their way up the opposite staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, this stuff will knock you out. Have you ever had the feeling you were being followed, Mr. Bond.

</ANNA>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never, why do you ask?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>

Reaching the top of the stairs, just outside the door, Anna briskly pulls Hawk into a PIECE OF WALL THAT IS REALLY A DOOR. The wall closes as the Flunkies come flying out, baffled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIRCULAR STAIRCASE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk, mucho impressed, and Anna move down a tight, dark circular staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa. Name's Hawkins, Eddie Hawkins. My nickname's Hudson Hawk, but don't call me Hudson, not even as a joke. The Nuns at St. Agnes called me that and they're the ones who helped make me what I am today. Not a compliment...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure Hudson. Are you going to tell me why you did that back there or are you going to blame it on Dumbo?

	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'll bring my entourage...

</HAWK>
<ANNA>

	Said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk and Anna peck each other with a smile. He crawls out an exit door. As he leaves, Anna's smile disappears. She pulls out a rosary and gives herself a self-scolding bang on the head. She then darts to a large crucifix and looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father, it's obvious. He's up to something.

A CARDINAL paces in an enigmatic Vatican area. Anna clacks up to him.

<CARDINAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he mention the Mayflowers?

</ANNA>
<CARDINAL>

Hawk grabs up the phone and dials....

	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>

The Mayflower limousine creeps to the edge of the piazza, behind an oblivious Hawk.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, operator, thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk turns, putting a finger in his ear. Seeing the limo, he FREAKS and balls himself into a corner.

	Come on, Alex, pick up, you Reindeer goat cheese-eating motherfucker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>

INT. ALEX'S RESTAURANT--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is late night in New York. A phone rings atop the bar of Alex's restaurant with no one in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PIAZZA--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk pokes his head to see a Darwin and Minerva (holding Bunny) emerge from the limousine. As he turns his con- centration back to the phone, ALEX HIMSELF flows out from a building to cheerfully speak with Darwin and Minerva and get licked by Bunny, before they all pile into the limo.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A-lex, A-lex, come on Alex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk slams down the phone and turns to see the limousine pull off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk angrily bursts from the door and is painfully CLOTHESLINED by agent Butterfinger, who is dressed as a mailman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crumpled on the ground, Hawk kicks out with his foot, into Butterfinger's stomach, doubling him. Hawk then grabs him by the head and rams into the glass of the booth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk rotates off for an escape...but the rest of the CIA crew cuts him off holding barely concealed guns; Snickers dressed as a maitre 'd, Almond Joy as a Bermuda tourist, and Kaplan in his usual emsemble. Kit Kat is dressed exactly like Hawk, right down to a bloody lip. Hawk gives him a double take.

Almond Joy smoothly extracts Hawk's notebook and reads...
</DIRECTION>
<ALMOND_JOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grapple, Biker's bottle, hairspray, black turtleneck, Pocket Fisherman, acid, collapsible yardstick, softball, and 72 stamps. Gee Stud, this is going to be some date. No Harvey's Bristol Cream?

Kaplan and the crew quickly disperse in different directions as Hawk howls in frustration. Kit Kat moves behind Hawk and perfectly mimics him.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>

</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Without looking, Hawk elbows the mimic Kit Kat in the face. Kit Kat gives Hawk a strange smile and hands him a card that reads: BEWARE THE ODD STEPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk looks up from the card. Kit Kat is gone, but Butterfinger scampers in his place.
</DIRECTION>
<BUTTERFINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Mr. Hawk, I got those 72 stamps!

Sighing, Hawk takes the huge sheath of stamps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INDOOR TRAIN TRACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the small Vatican mail trains bullets across an indoor track. The viewer's viewpoint whooshes to catch up, focusing on a very large package, addressed to the Pope, that has Hawk's sheath of stamps slapped onto it. The train zips into a tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE VATICAN UNDERGROUND SUBWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train rumbles into the Vatican mini-station. TWO HARRIED WORKERS heave up the strange cargo onto a sorting table.
</DIRECTION>

A bell rings as a clock hits 10. The workers do a sigh of relief. Shucking off their uniforms, they head out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hand rips out of the huge package.

<DIRECTION>
INT. OUTSIDE THE CODEX ROOM--NIGHT

Hawk pops out of the secret passageway door and moves to the mouth of the doorless Codex room. He pauses to hand-comb his hair in the two large, framed mirrors at the sides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CODEX ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrying the now frameless mirrors in each hand, Hawk hustles to the top of the steps and suddenly stops.

<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Beware the Odd Steps."

Hawk crouches down and notices the step below him has a clear magnetic tape running across it to a dime sized alarm button.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why Kit Kat, aren't you a gentleman...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk bounds down every other one of the steps down to where the Codex is bathed in a holy light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hefts up the two now frameless mirrors and puts them each in a groove of a collapsible yardstick running across the top. The parallel mirrors now face out from each other. Hawk sprays a blast of Clairol to reveal the light sensor beams, and then with a deep breath, he thrusts the mirrors into the beams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light bounces harmlessly off the mirrors and Hawk exhales. He balances the connected mirrors then crawls through his tent-like passageway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk squirts acid from a biker's bottle on the cracks of the rectangular glass case that holds the Codex. The acid sizzles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VATICAN LIBRARY HALLWAY--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BURLY GUARD thoughtfully stares at a painting, fingers propping his chin like an critic then continues ambling on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CODEX ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rubbing his head, Hawk gives an excited smile as the glass cracks of the rectangular case loosen. Hawk pulls out a pocket fisherman....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The viewer's viewpoint moves upward to reveal, through the mouth of the room, the Burly Guard is coming down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE THE CODEX ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burly Guard approaches the outskirts of the Codex room. He combs his hair into the piece of wall in the now empty mirror-frame then REALIZES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Muttering Italian into his walkie-talkie, Burly Guard rushes into the room and looks down to the sensor deflecting mirrors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He passes a statue, behind which, Hawk is revealed to be standing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burly Guard approaches the Codex and sees the dripping acid. He also notices a fishing hook attached to the binding of the Codex. The fishing wire leads out of the glass case. The Guard reaches to touch it when suddenly the wire is pulled tightly upward by a moving-out-from-behind-the-statue Hawk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Codex FLIES off its perch, setting off the ALARM and sending the bizarre cage/lamp CRASHING DOWN and AROUND the hapless Burly Guard. The green gas commences its noxious billowing as the Codex swooshes into Hawk's hands. He then hurls a softball, smashing a window on the other side of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The familiar Vatican Guard and a Guard Three barrel down into the mouth of the codex room. Only one Gas Mask drops from the doorway. The Vatican Guard pulls it on and gives a "That's Life" shrug of shoulders to the fainting Guard three.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk puts on the missing gas mask and launches a grapple around the ceiling cord of the dropped Ornate Lighting Fixture. Hawk then Tarzans from one staircase to another. He then ungrapples and heads toward the shattered window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Vatican Guard waits a stunned moment before giving chase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ROOF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk flings off his gas mask and begins a classical skipping-across-the-rooftop jaunt. Suddenly a brick on the slightly slanted roof gives way and Hawk FALLS. His canvas bag goes skipping down across the roof, landing against the antennae.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE POPE'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A T.V. showing Mr. Ed. speaking to Wilbur in Italian goes fuzzy. THE POPE, wearing his famous hat and a Notre Dame bathrobe angrily bangs on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ROOF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk harvests his grapple on the level part of the roof and slides down toward the dangling-off-the-antennae bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Vatican Guard pops out of the window and fires a warning shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk stretches to the bag. His fingers touch as the Guard continues to bound forward.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please God, Please God.......let the guard shoot me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk pulls up the bag and turns himself to see Vatican Guard hovering over him on the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<VATICAN_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The worm's on the other foot, yankee noodle candy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VATICAN_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk sees the Vatican Guard's foot move toward the grapple. Hawk ferociously tugs, ripping the Guard off-balance and knocking down a side of the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOP OF A NEARBY WALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk dashes atop a nearby wall and hurls his grapple across a road around a tree branch. Hawk ties the end of grapple line, tosses on a friction belt, takes a breath and JUMPS OFF THE WALL. The viewer follows him on his breathtaking ride.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The brused Vatican Guard flops back atop the roof. He gets off a wild shot before crumpling back down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAWK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is alnost to the other side when the Guard's bullet hits the friction belt. Hawk drops with a wild scream... and lands with a painful straddle atop a street lamppost. His eyes bug out with the thought of a life without children. He slowly spins off the lamppost and sails down upon...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A BUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and the comfortable luggage housed on top of it. Hawk tries to maintain his balance upon the wobbling baggage, but the bus makes a quick turn and Hawk goes flying off...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIGHT INTO A CAFE CHAIR--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Panting and discombobulated, Hawk looks across the table to the female hands holding open a menu. The menu comes down. It is Anna. Hawk unpretzels and laps his canvas bag.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Hudson, I was worried you weren't going to drop by....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>

Hawk does the honor sign with his black gloved hand then quickly rips it off as a WAITER comes to the table.

Anna hits her forehead with the palm of her hand while the waiter's entire body sinks in disappointment. Other TABLE OCCUPANTS sadly shake their heads.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANOTHER TABLE--NIGHT

At a comfortable distance curled behind a heat lamp, Snickers is being an Uglier American to an UNCOMPREHENDING WAITER, while Almond Joy chuckles and Butterfinger spreads butter over an entire baguette.

<SNICKERS>

	Italy, France, Moscow. They all just wanna be Nebraska. Old Man Kaplan thinks since Communism is dead, we got nothing to do. Man, Democracy isn't free elections.

HAWK AND ANNA'S TABLE

Physically sarcastic, the Waiter brings a tall wine basket with a bottle of ketchup in it. Hawk nabs it.

INT. ANNA'S HOUSE--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The viewer's viewpoint pulls back, past the black canvas bag on a table, to reveal a barefoot Anna is straddling a bare-backed Hawk, demurely and tentatively studying his bruises.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have you been doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh....old badminton injury.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>

Anna giggles and bends to kiss a bruise. She stops herself and opts for tickling.

</HAWK>
<ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(not stopping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm so sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Roaring with laughter, they capsize onto the floor. Hawk slithers around to devour her toes. Anna closes her eyes and arches her back.....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She opens her eyes and sees a large crucifix staring right at her. With a gasp, she rolls away from Hawk and stands up, trying to brush off her sins.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I can't. I....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<HAWK>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade. I don't make love every ten years, I get a little cranky.

</HAWK>
<ANNA>

	It's also been a long time for me. I--

</HAWK>
<ANNA>

</ANNA>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Anna slides on her shoes and makes a hasty retreat. She bumps into the canvas bag. The Codex slides out. They both catch it in mid-air. Anna's eyes pop. She wrenches the Codex away and kicks. Hawk pulls her into a compassionate back-against-his-stomach hug. The Codex falls to the floor unharmed.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not what you think. Okay, maybe it is....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really went and did it. With one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it. Nobody does it better, Hudson. You started the week stealing the Sforza and you ended it swiping the Codex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wha--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<ANNA>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. A CAR OUTSIDE OF ANNA'S PLACE--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crammed together in the front seat, Snickers, Almond Joy, and Butterfinger are watching the shadows of Hawk and Anna up in the window. Snickers snaps a cartridge into a gun while Butterfinger attacks a goo-ey pastry.
</DIRECTION>
<SNICKERS>
	<DIALOGUE>

Butterfinger pulls up the book on Da Vinci that Anna wrote and starts reading like a schoolboy.

INT. ANNA'S PLACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Foam shoots out over the coffee. Hawk smiles down at it as Anna works a cappuccino machine.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For two years, I've been tracking the Mayflowers' peculiar interest in three Da Vinci pieces. Their Sforza replica was as fake as the "gas leak" that supposedly destroyed it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does everyone in the world know more than me? Jesus, I'm just some guy who happens to be good at swiping stuff.....Lifted a piece of licorice when I was one and a half. Who knew it would lead... They even got the CIA involved!

ANNA'S HOUSE

Hawk sips the cappuccino. His face immediately contracts.

<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I must have put too much ethyl-chloride in it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Anna throws a pillow on the ground and holds out her hand. Hawk collapses. His coffee cup lands perfectly in Anna's outstretched hand and his head lands perfectly on the pillow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The candy bars bash the door open, guns raised.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't you tell me at the restaurant that he had hit the Vatican tonight. My people will not be happy. I want to see Kaplan.
	</DIALOGUE>

	That's not overly possible. He...

Anna pets the head of Hawk on her lap. She is pondering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. A MYSTERIOUS DARK ROOM--NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
A sparse circle of light houses a chair and a pacing Kaplan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Snickers and Butterfinger flop Hawk onto the lit chair.
</DIRECTION>

Kit Kat is dressed exactly like Anna. She reacts as she comes into the light. Kaplan takes the Codex from her.

Hawk stirs. The viewer gets his woozy P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually George, it's not it. What are we doing in this castle? I happen to know the Mayflowers bought this castle last year when they found out Da Vinci used to do...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
The lights in the room come on to the sound of holy Da Vinci theme, revealing an almost perfect refurbishing of the exact same workshop Da Vinci toiled in in the opening.
</DIRECTION>
<KAPLAN>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to be solemn)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the site of their new museum and we're taking it over. Operation Deflower Mayflower is going full speed ahead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAPLAN>
<ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(taking it in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Lord.... the only reason I ask is that Hudson, uh, Mr. Hawk, Hawkins, had some "neat" things to say about Darwin, Minerva, and you. Basically that you're part of the same car pool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<KAPLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anna. Anna. Anna. If that were true, Almond Joy would have handed you your heart right after you handed me the Codex. Now, get some sleep. Kit Kat...

Kit Kat in drag spookily moves inches away from Anna.

Kit Kat smiles, revealing the fact he has no tongue.

Hawk gives her a look of honesty and pain that causes Anna to guiltily gulp as she heads out with the mimicking Kit Kat.
</DIRECTION>
<SNICKERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think she has any idea that Operation Deflower Mayflower is as bogus as Kit Kat's tits?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNICKERS>
<KAPLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so, although bringing her to the castle gave her a big, juicy hint.

	<DIALOGUE>
	With all due respect to that great blouse, why didn't I cut out her heart?

EXT. OUTSIDE THE CASTLE--NIGHT

Moving into the chopper, Anna glimpses, Bunny, the obnoxious dog, in a Mayflower logo dog tag, taking a leak on some bushes. She fakes a yawn to the like dressed Kit Kat who fakes one back.

<DIRECTION>
INT. THE G. MACHINE ROOM--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kaplan, Hawk, and the other agents march into the mammoth room of the opening scene. In the place of where one remembers the gold machine are undulating sheets, beneath which are unassembled parts of the machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside, a ball goes whizzing out of a tennis ball machine. In tennis gear and goggles, Darwin Mayflower thwacks it against the wall of (now faded) frescos.

Also in tennis threads, Minerva is laying on a chaise lounge holding a gadget in her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DARWIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seven!

Minerva slits the bindings and tugs out another geometri- cally perverted crystal.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Another piece of the puzzle for the Da Vinci Alchemy project.

Kaplan, Darwin, and Minerva look up to Hawk, then to each other, all start to speak, then all stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This quandary is deferred by the entrance of the twin Flunkies.
</DIRECTION>
<DARWIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you. There's nothing more I hate than failure. All you had to do was follow the Hawk, it's not like I said "Teach our nation's children how to read."

</DARWIN>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk uses the distraction to amble toward the sheets.
</DIRECTION>
<DARWIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess we're just going to have to kill 'em...

</DARWIN>
<DIRECTION>
Shockingly swift, Minerva pulls a small gun from beneath her tennis dress and blasts a burning hole between each set of Flunky eyes, splattering them to the ground.

	God Minerva, I was kidding.

quickly turns from the blithe carnage and pulls up a sheet. He reveals the familiar Gold Machine Demonhead.
</DIRECTION>

THE MAYFLOWERS

The Cardinal emerges and stands by Anna's confessional curtains.

	So let me get this straight, sister, you're saying Hudson Hawk is not willingly working for the Mayflowers but Kaplan and the Candy Bars are?

</CARDINAL>
<DIRECTION>
Anna moves out of the confessional curtains, wearing a FULL NUN HABIT for she is a Nun. The gaspingly beautiful church unfolds as they walk.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got it. Operation Deflower Mayflower is a bad joke and I'm the punchline. I thought we were using the CIA to help us to get Mayflower, but really the CIA was using me to keep us away from Mayflower.

</ANNA>
<CARDINAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, why couldn't I be the Cardinal in charge of catering.... If the Mayflowers get the three sections of Da Vinci's crystal and his instructions for the gold machine-- Aie-yi--Do we got anything? What of Alex, Hawk's friend, where is his loyalty?

INT. ROME CONFERENCE ROOM--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beneath the wacky portrait, Darwin circles the board- member filled conference table as Minerva smooches Bunny. Everyone watches Alfred place a bar of Gold and of Lead in the hands of a blindfolded Hawk at the middle of the M.
</DIRECTION>
<DARWIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Captain Hawk, in one of your paws you got a gold bar worth about 8 thou. In the autre, you got lead that won't get you gelato.

	That's two down to Kitty Carlisle...

</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk "weighs" the two bars in his hands--digs with his fingernails. He rips off the blindfold in subdued frustration. As Minerva speaks, she unconsciously molests Alfred.
</DIRECTION>
<MINERVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cool, isn't it? Weight, feel, mal1eability, they're all but identical. On the periodic chart of elements, they're but one proton apart. Great minds worked for centuries to turn worthless into priceless.

</HAWK>
<DARWIN>
<DIRECTION>
(casually goosing Alfred)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alchemy! Is the business term of the 90's, my man! Minerva read about it in an airline magazine about four years ago. I dumped some lira into research... Shazam, we come across a diary by one of Da Vinci's apprentices detailing La Machine de Oro, the gold machine for those at home, and the rest is about to become history. Money isn't everything, gold is. Fuck blue chip stocks! Fuck T-bills! Fuck Junk Bonds! I got the real deal! Money will always be paper but gold will always be gold!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARWIN>
<MINERVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Market crashes. Bomb drops. Greenhouse effect affects. We'll still be the richest, most powerful people in the world. In 1992, Europe is coming together to become one business superpower. It's one party we'd love to poop.

	Well, that said, the last ingredient in the recipe is in, get this, you're gonna die, the Kremlin.

<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. The Kremlin. Makes sense. The Kremlin. Why not? Listen, this is all too Indiana Jones and the Lost City of King Tut for me, man. Throw me in jail and go ahead, just try and throw Alex...

Alfred quickly latches on the state-of-the-art handcuffs and the blindfold. The viewer's viewpoint stays on a writhing Hawk.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll kill all you. Even the old lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk kicks back on the table, "jump ropes" the cuffs, then picks the lock with his teeth. Hawk rips off the blindfold to see that the entire room is empty except for Alex, standing at the other end, in an incongruous Italian leather coat.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hated cigarettes until I saw my first No Smoking sign. Keep off the Grass? Let's play Soccer. Only law I cared about was friendship. Broke that one too, didn't I? This Gates-Mario Brothers-CIA-Mayflower-Da Vinci thing seemed like a sweet deal. Visit foreign lands, take their treasures. I don't know, I thought you'd get into it. It's better than playing darts with M.B.A.'s at the bar. I didn't know it was going to be like this. Them using me to use you... I'm sorry, there's only one way out of this and it's gonna hurt me more than it's gonna hurt you.

Alex pulls out a gun from his jacket and clicks it in.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. FAMILIAR PIAZZA--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The piazza from the fascist E.U.R. building are bustling with office workers laughing, smoking, and hustling. Darwin, Minerva and Kaplan are a solid troika in the center of the steps. The other agents stroll in the periphery....
</DIRECTION>
<KAPLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just don't think it was a smoking hot idea to leave them up there alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAPLAN>
<MINERVA>

</DIRECTION>
<KAPLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were saying...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAPLAN>
<DIRECTION>
Moving to the edge of the stairs, Hawk and Alex, latter holding his gun, sprout up from their own debris and continue savagely brawling. The wigging out passers- by give them space.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bastard! You fucked my freedom for a lousy job!

</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hawk... I'm so sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk roars forward like a bull and helmets Alex. They roll together down the massive staircase past Darwin, Minerva, and the CIA who react with "This can't be happening" catatonia.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two SHOTS go off as Hawk and Alex crash to the bottom of the staircase. Hawk rises up in a daze to see Alex on the ground with two bloody bullet holes.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.....Alex! Wake up, you can't go out like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk falls to his knees as Snickers hustles toward him. Suddenly, sirens are heard as a police van pulls up. Snickers stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Four policemen blast from the back of the van. One holds back the crowd. One strenuously pulls Hawk into the van. The other two drag in Alex.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The villains look to each other for non-existent guidance as the van pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<MINERVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Plan B, anyone...

Using initiative, Snickers hops on a Vespa and roars off after them. The van can be seen swerving off.....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AROUND A CORNER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where it bolts up into a much larger truck marked VATICAN SOUVENIRS. TWO SEEMINGLY-INNOCENT-BYSTANDER PRIESTS break demeanor to flop up the wheel ramps, slam close the back of the truck, lock it shut, and continue on their solemn way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TRUCK BELLOWS off as the Vespa spins around the corner. Snickers brakes and looks around for the police van. He hits his handle with frustration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEAUTIFUL ROME OVERVIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of her habit but still in her incredible sunglasses, Anna looks out to a lovely view of Italy. The Vatican Truck pulls up behind her. A giddy, blood-stained Alex and a not- so-giddy Hawk bound out of the back. Alex excitedly gives himself an insulin shot.

	You re not "some guy" anymore, Hudson. Right now, you're the only guy. Without your help, I....

<DIRECTION>
Anna looks to Hawk with a choked-up expression. The weight of the world on his shoulders, Hawk turns away to a lovely view, his mind painfully raging and swirling toward peaceful clarity.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The world is beautiful. Every day in prison I made sure to remember that. It's only when I actually got out that I forgot. If I was sane, I'd be on that plane to Rio. But being beaten and abused to fulfill some corporation's perverted vision does something to your mental health. The world is beautiful and I'm tired of being fucked.

Hawk takes in some views of Moscow that remind one of Budapest.

SOVIET GUARD ONE comes out on the roof to light a cig- arette. He looks in the distance to the motivating CIA team. Suddenly a card floats down into his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It reads: WILLIAM TELL. ADAM'S APPLE. GET IT?

The not-getting-it Guard looks up from the card as a grinning Kit Kat parachutes behind him. The Guard swerves around and Kit Kat savagely skewers him with a crossbow shot to his Adam's apple.

Hawk, Alex, and Anna pass through a set of windowed double doors into a very long hallway that leads into a pitch darkness. A MURAL OF A HAPPY, ARM-STRETCHED LENIN looms above the doors. They give it a a quick glance before pulling out screwdrivers and wire hangers.

Snickers and Butterfinger calmly blow away both guards with silenced mini-Uzis.

THE LONG HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk, Anna, and Alex retreat beneath the Lenin mural through the windowed double doors.

The Soviet V.I.P.'s open up presents of pink L.A. GEAR tennis shoes, silly T-shirts, and Nintendo joysticks as a standing Darwin hypnotizes them.

<DARWIN>

Butterfinger pulls from around his shoulder a strange rifle. He attaches to the front of it;, a glass encased, suctioning time-bomb from a waist satchel. He fires the bomb against the door and it starts ticking.

Anna meanders across the second level muttering to herself in Italian and amusingly imitating Hawk's condescension.

Kaplan point blank shoots Alex in the chest. Alex crumples backward, moaning. Butterfinger, casually, but with incredible strength, holds Hawk's arms behind his back.

As they battle, Darwin grabs Anna's hair, slams her into a pillar, and watches her crumple.

KIT KAT

A shower of cards reading "OUCH" "PAIN" and "THIS REALLY HURTS" rain from out of Kit Kat's coat.

Hawk and Darwin grapple on the floor of the limo. The Da Vinci helicopter model bobs on the backseat. Darwin's gun goes off..

right through Alfred's throat. He slumps over, pressing down on the accelerator.

A mist of blood coughs out of the shredder vent and makes a weird bloody line across the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BACKSEAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk yanks his hand from the shredder and grabs the meg- lomaniac by the hair and shoves his head down on the arm rest. Hawk turns on the piercing siren and Darwin's eyes try to escape his head with a high pitched scream. Darwin's entire body bucks wildly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darwin back-elbows Hawk and moves down for his gun. Hawk pulls him back by his hair, grabs him by the balls, and pushes him upward through the sunroof.
</DIRECTION>
<DARWIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God-damnit, I only wanted to destroy the world in my own image. I'm a regular Joe...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARWIN>
<DIRECTION>
Darwin pounds his fists on Hawk's head as Hawk hits the sunroof switch sliding it shut on Darwin, pinning his arms below the roof, but leaving his torso twisting in the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mural of a happy Lenin with his arms outstretched looms ahead waiting to greet Darwin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Putting two and two together, Darwin loses it....
</DIRECTION>
<DARWIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not Lenin, anybody but Lenin. God, let's talk abut this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARWIN>
<DIRECTION>
The limousine charges through the double doors and Darwin's body connects with the mural.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE LIMO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hearing the crunch, Hawk flips into the front seat and brakes the vehicle. Alfred's head bounces against the steering wheel. Hawk reaches over with a grin and picks up the Da Vinci model. He looks to Alfred, Kaplan crunched in the windshield, and Darwin's dangling legs.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow, this is really gonna hurt the resale value...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>

THE BALLROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk runs up to a woozy Anna and helps her up. She has a cross-shaped blood stain on her forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, honey....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk looks to Alex, sitting on the stairs, the same way he left him. Hawk rushes to him.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We did it man, we...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk grabs Alex's shoulder. Alex falls back. Written over his face in red lipstick is REALLY DEAD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Engaging a slow motion sequence, Minerva saunters behind Anna, putting on red lipstick. Minerva slams her back to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk howls then turns to see stiff-upper-lip Alfred, bleeding from the neck. Hawk tries to throw a punch, but Alfred blocks it and crunches him across the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Da Vinci helicopter model bounces down the stairs in slow motion and cracks open, revealing the intricate mirror of the opening scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DARK ROOM ATOP MAYFLOWER MUSEUM--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A damaged Hawk awakens in a dungeonish room and stumbles to some shutters. "O Solo Mio" returns on the sound- track as the shutters open to a postcard view of Vinci.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk closes the shutters and cuts off the music. A slightly more composed Anna touches his shoulder causing him to jump slightly. They melt into a kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Hudson...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you not to call me Hudson. The only people who called me that were the nuns at...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Hudson, I'm a sister of the Catholic church as well as an agent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
(cut-off laugh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is too bad to be false.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Alfred enters the room in his favorite outfit with a bandage around his neck. His voice is strange, but still polite.
</DIRECTION>
<ALFRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome back to Vinci.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALFRED>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last rites, sister?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, no nun jokes...They're a bad habit to get into....get it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk and Anna unconvincingly laugh then sadly pause.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She killed Alex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Alfred gives them a push.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE DA VINCI WORKSHOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alfred leads them through the Da Vinci workshop past the bat winged glider and incongruously crammed-in tennis ball machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE ROOM OF THE GOLD MACHINE--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alfred grandly opens double-doors to reveal that Da Vinci's gold machine has been majestically re-created piece by piece. In the periphery, the 90's rears its head in the form of THREE TECHNICIANS wearing headsets and gun holsters who consult computer terminals.
</DIRECTION>
<MINERVA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GOLD-FI-ING-ER!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINERVA>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk and Anna turn to see Minerva splashily enter in sexy funeral-wear.
</DIRECTION>
<MINERVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, I couldn't resist. You're probably wondering why you're still alive. Anna.....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINERVA>
<DIRECTION>
As Minerva speaks, TECHNICIAN ONE forcibly escorts Anna toward a stand near the gold machine and tightly handcuffs her to it.
</DIRECTION>
<MINERVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to monitor the Da Vinci's directions from the apprentice diary. And Hawk, I didn't want you to go to hell without knowing that Darwin and I's dream came true.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly sheepish)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beside that, none of us can seem to put that damn crystal together. Alfie and I were up all night with the thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINERVA>
<DIRECTION>
TECHNICIAN TWO commences a forcible escort of Hawk to the gold machine. Hawk cold-cocks him to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You killed a friend. Why should I help you go for the gold?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<MINERVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll take a couple of years of steady production, but I'll flood the market with so much gold that gold itself, the foundation of all finance, will lose its meaning. Brokers, economists, and fellow entrepreneurs will drown in the saliva of their own nervous breakdowns. Markets will crash- crash. Financial Empires will crumble-crumble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINERVA>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Except yours-yours. The goal of world domination. Well, if you put it that way, Minnie. How can I resist?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<MINERVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't, convict! You're just a shmoe! Every shmoe has the fantasy the planet revolves around them. It rains, car crash stops traffic, you say "How could this happen to me?" It's a natural inclination. But for I, this isn't a fantasy, it is reality! You are on my planet! You walk around the corner for coffee, out of my sight, you do not fucking exist! The lives of shmoes like you have meaning only in relation to the rich, to the powerful, to ME!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINERVA>
<DIRECTION>
Anna looks at the oil cloth diary before her. She pulls a compact from her pocket and holds the compact mirror over the scribblings. Reading off the reflection, her eyes widen.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do it. There's no reason to fight anymore. She's a force of nature.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Trying to get a grip on Anna's words, Hawk lets himself be escorted to another stand before the gold machine that has the two complex crystal parts and the weird mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<MINERVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you pull this off, I can't promise I won't kill you. I mean, who we trying to kid? But I will spare the Flying Nun here....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINERVA>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And to think I thought you were Evil Incarnate in pumps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<MINERVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I killed some lovable working class Italian-diabetic, but you killed the most significant male figure of the decade and a kind, gentle lover. So don't play with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINERVA>
<DIRECTION>
Minerva flicks a switch on the stand Anna's handcuffed to. Anna vibrates, being electrocuted.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, fine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Minerva switches it off. Giving himself a head rub, Hawk bears down on the three oddly malleable objects. He TANGLES and BENDS and with a loud SNAP, puts them together, forming the Crystal from the opening scene. Minerva snatches it from him and puts on a head-set.
</DIRECTION>
<MINERVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Hawk, don't ever change. Go, team, go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINERVA>
<DIRECTION>
Minerva giddily sets the crystal in the same place as Da Vinci had it in his machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Using a long steel pole, Technician One adjusts a myriad of mirrors so they are in a proper angle with a series of lenses culminating on the top of the machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Technicians Two (black-eyed) and Three pour various chemical powders and liquids into corresponding compart- ments on the machine, beautifully decorated by the chemical's zodiac sign.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alfred places a lead bar in its proper place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk glides to Anna and undoes her handcuff.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you know what....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trust Leonardo....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wha.....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Anna puts her fingers on his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Minerva throws a lever. Steam begins to percolate from the furnace towards the machine.
</DIRECTION>
<MINERVA>
<DIRECTION>
(into the headset)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're for real.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINERVA>
<DIRECTION>
THE MACHINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
begins to rotate, at first clunkily, then faster. The Crystal rotates comfortably in its compartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The machine throws out its folding arms, each with an element. The arms click higher.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The goggled technicians stand before a time-coded video monitor, taking notes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chemical housings open and the chemicals begin to spill and drop through brass tubes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANNA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
murmurs to Hawk.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Da Vinci made the real directions in a secret script that I decoded. The way the machine is running now, the gold will produce too quickly, clog, and the machine will shut itself down. Isn't it wonderful?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but what would happen if that little mirror came out of the crystal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wha -- you don't want to know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk pulls out the mirror from his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanna know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy sh-h--things are going to get very interesting, very fast. Da Vinci would be proud of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE MACHINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chemicals snake down their individual paths to the Lead Bar spinning its trough. There's a FLASH and a controlled but jarring explosion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EVERYONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
doubletakes. Hawk reaches down to the six foot steel pole and with one swing slams the faces of all three deep in concentration Technicians to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oblivious to the violence behind her, Minerva, pulling on goggles over her head-set, moves closer with a religious purr.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MACHINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
triggers a fresnel lens and laserlike beams bounce around the mirrors faster and faster, circling the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE THE MACHINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk and Anna squint, blinded. Flinging off her goggles, A literally beaming Minerva giggles forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MACHINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beams of light converge on the top mirror and bounce into the innards of the machine with a mighty roar!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MINERVA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sees that the center of the machine gleams yellowish and molten. She moves closer, shouting into her head-set.
</DIRECTION>
<MINERVA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eureka, motherfuckers!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINERVA>
<DIRECTION>
The machine thunders and spins at a more aggressive pace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk's voice suddenly comes on Minerva's head-set.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(head-set)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Minnie, hate to interrupt your orgasm, but....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
HAWK AND ANNA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stand above the unconscious Technicians. Hawk is on head-set.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me, Anna, and Leonardo just wanna say you got the Midas touch, baby...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
MACHINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Minerva turns toward the machine in anger and confusion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The center of the machine blows. The pool of molten gold rockets at the viewer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mirrors explode and the lasers slash at the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Minerva tumbles from the machine, screaming, that is to say, trying to scream, because molten gold covers her face. It bubbles and cascades, turning her into a bizarrely beautiful echo of Nefertiti.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAWK AND ANNA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
turn to retreat, and see, standing in the mouth of the open double doors, in an open shirt, wearing Indian war paint on his face and the words RULE BRITANNIA painted on his chest, ALFRED!
</DIRECTION>
<ALFRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALFRED>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're unemployed, Alfie. Boss is dead. Her plan is over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<ALFRED>
<DIRECTION>
(strange voiced)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My plan is just beginning. I'll forgive you for denying me the pleasure of slaughtering my boorish employers, but I'm afraid the birth of the new British Empire can have no witnesses!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALFRED>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ooh-kay...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Alfred rushes forward with a howl. Hawk meets him halfway. They trade savage punches and then lock onto each other's throats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna pulls a gun from a technician's holster and prays for forgiveness. She aims steadily, and fires...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
right into Hawk's arm. This allows Alfred to knock him back with a strong punch.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
She fires again. The bullet pings off Hawk's belt buckle.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop helping me! Thou shalt not kill!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk's turning to chastize Anna, allows Alfred to kick Hawk back against a wall. Alfred lunges out with his blade, hitting the wall off-angle. Hawk yanks the shaft. Alfred goes with the flow and presses the shaft on Hawk's throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gasping, Hawk looks to a rip in Alfred's shirt and sees a hinge and lever on the shaft. With an all or nothing jerk, Hawk flicks the lever. The shaft clicks on the hinge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alfred's greater strength and narrower grip makes it fold away from Hawk and suddenly it is Alfred's throat which is caught in the V-shaped trap! The momentum of the sudden change makes Alfred stumble towards the wall until the point of the "V" hits it--
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't lose your head over this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk takes the six foot steel pole and gives a Babe Ruth swing right onto the V. The blades slam together and POP ALFRED'S HEAD OFF, SENDING IT SCREAMING DISEMBODIED, HIGH IN THE AIR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALFRED'S SCREAMING HEAD P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk and Anna are seen waving up to the viewer (Alfie's head).
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse my crass American humor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
The machine thunders with another explosion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DA VINCI WORKSHOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk and Anna rush into the Da Vinci workshop. She guiltily touches the surface wound on his arm. He delicately takes the gun from her and laughs until he sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BUNNY THE DOG!! standing in the open mouth of the workshop. Anna turns to Hawk...
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Allow me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Anna confidently moves toward the dog until Bunny leaps up and savagely clamps his teeth into her throat sending her crashing to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk pauses in disbelief before raising the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bunny continues to viciously gnaw away on the convulsing Anna, blood gently starts to emerge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk can't get off a shot. He throws down the gun in exasperation. It lands next to The Gadget that is connected to the Tennis Ball Machine. Hawk rushes forward, picks up the gadget, turns the dial to Ten, and then smiles sweetly toward the dog.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Bunny, Ball-Ball.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Bunny stops his violent behavior and perkily looks up blood droplets drizzling from his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk slams down on the gadget.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tennis ball comes rocketing out of the machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bunny leaps and catches the rocketing ball but the force of it sends him FLYING AND CRASHING out a window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk pulls up Anna as the machine completely EXPLODES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge chunk of the roof THUDS before the workshop door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk suddenly looks off-camera and smiles. Anna shakes her head vigorously. He pulls her out of the frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A VINCI COUNTRYSIDE TREE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man awakens from a nap and pulls up his hat. It is THE TRAVELING JUGGLER WITH THE UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls his three red balls from a pouch on his mule. He begins a stoic juggle when another loud BOOM sends him to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OUTSIDE THE GRAND CASTLE--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An explosion of steam and gas blows out the windows! Debris frisbees toward the camera along with....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna, hanging on Hawk's waist, and Hawk, hanging from the bar on DA VINCI'S BAT WINGED GLIDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The glider gracefully swooshes down through the castle - through the glorious vista.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ROAD TO THE CASTLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The glider floats to a perfect landing before the Unforgettable Juggler.
</DIRECTION>
<JUGGLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Che pazzo....
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUGGLER>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk and Anna collect themselves and look up to the smoke billowing castle. They smile and gush in relief. They wrap arms around the confused but warming up Juggler and laugh again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SMALL PIAZZA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mule trots into a small storybook piazza in the hush of dawn. Hawk, Anna, and the unforgettable Juggler ride atop it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WOMAN WITH AN UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE moves to a cafe table with a luminous smile. She unfolds a table cloth atop it and then mystically sets down two cappuccinos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk and Anna dismount, thank the Juggler, then cozy into the table.

Hawk puts on a pair of sunglasses that look exactly like the ones Da Vinci wore in the opening and raises his cup.

<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The first one's for Alex. Cheers.

The viewer's viewpoint moves into Hawk's lips having a sip of that damn unmasculine European coffee.
