:SC: EFFECT SHOT: THE SHADOW OF THE THIN MAN!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shadow, grotesquely thin, is cast by one strong light which reflects itself against a white cement wall. When we first see the shad- ow, it is standing upright, examining some- thing which it holds in its hands. Now the shadow bends down and as it does so, CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL CLYDE WYNANT in his work- shop. He is a tall, thin man of about fifty- five, with white hair. He has a fine, sensi- tive face. He is a very successful inventor. A man who is capable of sudden fits of anger which he forgets almost immediately, but which are quite terrifying while they last. Just now he is utterly absorbed in what he is doing -- working on a delicately-wired part which has to do with a new form of combustion engine that he has invented. (Through the entire scene, from the first shadow effect, we hear the engine in operation as he is working over it.) Wynant is dressed in overalls, and possibly a long shade over his eyes. The shop itself is in the base- ment of a small warehouse building, in the thir- ties between First Avenue and the East River, in New York. It is a long and narrow machine shop, full of interest and character in its mechanical layout. Miniatures of engine-models of various kinds -- vats of molten lead -- car- bon racks -- welding instruments -- delicate light bulbs, and such other apparatus as com- poses a combination shop and laboratory of this machine type. WE HOLD A MOMENT on Wynant in the midst of an experiment over the combustion engine. Then from the background a workman named Tom, also dressed in overalls, a man of about thirty-five, comes in from an adjoining shop. He comes toward Wynant.

<Tom>
<DIRECTION>
(hesitant -- in a mild tone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your daughter's here, Mr. Wynant.

(then, as Wynant doesn't seem to hear him, he speaks louder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Wynant!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Tom>
<DIRECTION>
Wynant, startled out of his absorption, drops a delicate piece of metal (or whatever fragile wiring or part he would be holding), and turns furiously on Tom.
</DIRECTION>
<Wynant>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Haven't you any more sense than to shout at me like that!

The workman shrugs his shoulders and starts away. WE PAN Wynant to a bench on which there are several acetylene torches. He is examining the part as he goes, muttering and growling to himself.

Dorothy comes in, followed by ANDREW READE. She is a young girl of about twenty-one, spirited and high-tempered like her father. She has great natural beauty and distinction ... the crisp pro- duct of a strict finishing school. She is dressed in smart, simple street dress, with a fur coat over it.

Dorothy takes his watch while he starts to take off his overalls. There is an odd chain attached to the watch, with links of gold, copper, and silver. As he slips off the overalls, he speaks to Dorothy without looking at her, trying to keep a casual note in his voice. CAMERA IS PANNING DURING THE SCENE.

<DIRECTION>
Wynant reaches through the bar of the elevator door and pushes the button inside. The elevator starts going down during the following dialogue. Macaulay stands inside, bewildered and worried.

<Macaulay>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what if you need more money?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Macaulay>
<Wynant>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you. Goodbye.

Wynant strides out of the scene. The elevator is beginning to disappear, carrying Macaulay.

of sight -- he is calling up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't tell me a thing. I don't know where you're going. I don't know when you're coming back. I don't know how to reach you if any business turns up...!

And the elevator goes down out of sight, his voice trailing as it does so.

:SC: WYNANT'S OFFICE -- TRUCKING AND PANNING ON WYNANT --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we pick him up leaning down in front of a small safe, opening it. He is talking to his bookkeeper, Tanner, as he does so. Tanner is a little man with a quick eye and an eager manner. He has his hat and coat on prepara- tory to leaving for the day. He is closing and locking some cabinets as the scene ensues. (Wynant's office is of a solid rather old- fashioned type such as would be found in a building of this kind. It should, in fact, have windows through which a display room given to machinery can be seen)
</DIRECTION>
<Wynant>
<DIRECTION>
(as he opens the safe)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My daughter's going to be married, Tanner. Nice young man. She just brought him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Wynant>
<DIRECTION>
Tanner listens preoccupied. He seems a little nervous about Wynant looking in the safe.
</DIRECTION>
<Tanner>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, congratulations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Tanner>
<Wynant>
<DIRECTION>
(talking right on)

	I'm going to give her a wedding present. Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it. I can drop them on my way to...

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's funny....

<DIRECTION>
(he leans down and hunts through the

	<DIALOGUE>
	different papers in the safe. He doesn't

find what he wants. He turns to Tanner)
</DIRECTION>

</Wynant>
<Tanner>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bonds, sir?

<Wynant>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know I left them there.

:SC: A RADIO IN A NEW YORK APARTMENT -- CLOSEUP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is Julia Wolf's apartment, a fashionable penthouse furnished in very new modernistic style, but we do not reveal it as we dissolve in. We are merely HOLDING ON THE RADIO AND A MAN -- JOE MORELLI -- who sits in front of it, in his shirt sleeves. Morelli is a tough looking gangster. He has the radio on. He is looking at a copy of Vogue. A woman's voice comes over the scene from off stage.
</DIRECTION>
<Julia_s_Voice>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you want it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Julia_s_Voice>
<Morelli>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do women really wear them things?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Morelli>

Suddenly there is the sound of a key in the door. Morelli looks up quickly, his hand going to what we know is his gun, in his hip pocket -- AS CAMERA PULLS BACK RAPIDLY TO REVEAL:

<DIRECTION>
:SC: FULL SHOT OF THE APARTMENT -- A PENTHOUSE -- PROCESS GLASS.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: DOOR -- CLOSE SHOT ON WYNANT.

As he enters, having used his own key. He still seems occupied, and doesn't see Morelli as he comes through. CAMERA SWINGS RAPIDLY BACK TO:

:SC: MEDIUM SHOT -- THE APARTMENT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Julia comes into the room, with two drinks in her hand. She is a woman of about thirty. She is in very elaborate lounging pajamas, her hair is too well waved, her nails too red, her eyebrows too delicately arched. But she has the look of a hard businesswoman under- neath it all. She looks disturbed as she sees it is Wynant.
</DIRECTION>
<Julia>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're just having a little drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Julia>
<Wynant>
<DIRECTION>
(drily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Wynant>
<DIRECTION>
Morelli looks from one to the other. In Wynant's attitude of displeased propietorship, he gets his hint of who he is. he reaches for his coat over the chair and starts to put it on.
</DIRECTION>
<Julia>
<DIRECTION>
(her eyes still on Wynant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you later, Joe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Julia>
<DIRECTION>
Morelli looks from one to the other, and then slowly gets his hat and starts out.
</DIRECTION>
<Morelli>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. I didn't know I was talking to the boy friend. S'long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Morelli>
<DIRECTION>
He walks carelessly and arrogantly out of the door, slamming it after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA MOVES IN FOR A CLOSE SHOT OF JULIA AND WYNANT. She puts the drinks down. She tries to ignore Wynant's very evident displeasure.
</DIRECTION>
<Wynant>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's that man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Wynant>
<Julia>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not anybody. Just a fellow I used to know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Julia>
<Wynant>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Wynant>
<Julia>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the first time I've seen him in years. I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Julia>
<Wynant>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Wynant>
<Julia>

(moving over to him, trying to conciliate him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. You won't see him again.

<DIRECTION>
(she tries to take Wynant's coat and hat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Julia>
<Wynant>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Wynant>
<Julia>
<DIRECTION>
(she controls her fear under an air of ignorance)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What bonds?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Julia>
<Wynant>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The government bonds. The ones you took from the office safe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Wynant>
<Julia>
<DIRECTION>
(smoothly lying)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes. Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Julia>
<Wynant>
<DIRECTION>
(in a level tone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.

</Wynant>
<Julia>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you remember....
	</DIALOGUE>
</Julia>
<Wynant>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now see here, Julia. You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded. You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it. But this is fifty thousand dollars!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Wynant>
<Julia>
<DIRECTION>
(flying into a temper to try to hide her guilt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
	</DIALOGUE>
</Julia>
<Wynant>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one else had the combination of that safe. You took them. What did you do with them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Wynant>
<Julia>
<DIRECTION>
(in a fury)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
	</DIALOGUE>
</Julia>
<Wynant>
<DIRECTION>
(cutting in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Wynant>
<Julia>
<DIRECTION>
(going on without listening to him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you. A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped. They wouldn't raise a hand to help you. And I've given my whole life for you. If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then defiantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure I took those bonds. Who has a better right -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Julia>
<DIRECTION>
WE HOLD A MOMENT. There is a slight pause, then Wynant quietly, and unheeding all that she has said, starts for the phone. WE PAN HIM OVER AND HOLD as he picks up the phone (but not the receiver as yet) and speaks off to Julia:
</DIRECTION>
<Wynant>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Wynant>
<Julia>

(o.s. -- not believing that he will do it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Julia>
<Wynant>
<DIRECTION>
(lifts phone from receiver now -- still quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll be pretty rough with you....with your record.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Wynant>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PULLS BACK, and Julia hurries into the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<Julia>
<DIRECTION>
(contemptuous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thats a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....

(in phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello .... give me ....

(Julia grabs the telephone from him, in
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	a fury. She puts it down. Puts the re- ceiver in place. They stand facing each

other)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well .... ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Wynant>
<Julia>
<DIRECTION>
(in a surly tone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll give it back to you .... all I've got .... twenty-five thousand ....

</Julia>
<Wynant>
<DIRECTION>
(he takes her by the wrists, gripping her hard, trying to force the truth from her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to return every cent of it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Wynant>
<Julia>
<DIRECTION>
(flashing again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't! I haven't got it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Julia>
<Wynant>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you do with the rest?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Wynant>
<Julia>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never had it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Julia>
<DIRECTION>
The telephone rings.
</DIRECTION>
<Wynant>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then someone was in with you. Who was it? -- Who was it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Julia makes a move to answer the phone which rings again insistently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll answer that --

:SC: TELEPHONE BOOTH -- PUBLIC PAY STATION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A weasel-faced little man, Nunheim, is in the booth at the phone, but as he hears Wynant's voice say "hello", he very quietly pulls down the hook for the receiver and places the re- ceiver gently on it. He turns away.

CUT BACK TO:

Wynant is clicking the receiver up and down, as he repeats several times, sharply:

<Wynant>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello ... hello ... hello ... HELLO ....
	</DIALOGUE>
</Wynant>
<DIRECTION>
Then, evidently hearing the sound of the re- ceiver being replaced, he impatiently puts the telephone down and turns back to Julia.
</DIRECTION>
<Wynant>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't need to tell me. I have a pretty good idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Wynant>
<DIRECTION>
And with this WE PAN HIM as he puts on his hat and starts to walk out of the apartment -- with determination and a menacing purpose in his face.
</DIRECTION>
<Julia>
<DIRECTION>
(o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you going to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Julia>
<DIRECTION>
Wynant turns at the door and smiles - a terrify- ing smile - and walks out. The CAMERA SWINGS QUICKLY BACK TO JULIA. She looks after him terrified as we

:SC: A STREET AT NIGHT -- LIGHTING EFFECT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wynant strides down the street, his long, lean, narrow form casting a long shadow on the snowy pavement. THE CAMERA HOLDS IN A RUNNING SHOT ON THE SHADOW as it elongates still further, and finally disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(NOTE: We should get the above shadow effect through heavy snow, (via reflection of street lamps). The idea and mood here of the shadow of the "thin man" as it strides rapidly through the night is purposely intended for a necessary effect.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: FADE IN: CLOSEUP OF A CHRISTMAS WREATH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wreath is enormous, and under the conven- al greeting: "A MERRY CHRISTMAS", which is in silver across it, there is a current uncon- ventional greeting also in silver, which reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(This slogan to come)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On sound track behind the shot an orchestra is playing gaily. Possibly an arrangement that Lombardo would make on "JINGLE BELLS, JINGLE BELLS". There is also the sound of gay chat- ter and jingles of many cocktail shakers. NOW CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL THE BAR OF A SPEAKEASY, or, to be more up to date, the bar of a Biltmore or a Waldorf Astoria Hotel. It was against the glass of the bar that the Christmas wreath was first shown. It is about three o'clock in the afternoon. Almost all of the people sitting on the high stools in front of the bar are women. Several bartenders are shaking cocktails. The music, which, by the way, comes from an adjoining tea dansant room, continues. There is a holiday air about the whole place. A sophistication and a gaiety belonging to thirsty New York of the present moment. CAMERA RUNS DOWN THE LINE OF THE BAR AND HOLDS AT THE END, where a bartender is placing two cocktails on a tray held by a waiter. WE TRUCK ON THE WAITER as he takes the tray into the adjoining room. The room is quite filled with the afternoon tango crowd, and several couples are danicng on the floor. WE HOLD as the waiter stops at a small table along the wall. Dorothy and Andrew are seated there. Dorothy is looking very glum.

<Andrew>

(putting his hand on hers)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Cheer up, darling.

</Andrew>
<Dorothy>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.

Dorothy tries to smile, but it's a dreary attempt. The waiter puts down the cock- tails and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<Andrew>
<DIRECTION>
(holds up his glass)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's to us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Andrew>
<DIRECTION>
He drinks his cocktail. Dorothy takes a sip of hers. Andrew goes on talking, trying to get her out of the doldrums.
</DIRECTION>
<Andrew>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By this time next year, we'll be two old married people ... trimming the tree ... hanging up the stock- ings for the children ...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then as she looks up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... well, the child, then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Andrew>
<DIRECTION>
Dorothy tries to smile, but she is worried, and cannot enter into his fun. She puts her drink down.
</DIRECTION>
<Andrew>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter, darling ... not sweet enough?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Andrew>
<Dorothy>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right.

</Dorothy>
<DIRECTION>
(NOTE TO VAN: If you want them to get up and join the dancers, it can be done at this point. After Dorothy says, "It's all right", Andrew says, "Come on, let's dance. I've got to get you out of the dumps somehow" -- and pulls her to her feet. The following scene continues now, as follows, in a PANNING SHOT OF THEM DANCING.)

(turns to him -- suddenly distraught)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But tonight is Christmas Eve!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Dorothy>
<Andrew>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's just forgotten. You know he forgets everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Andrew>
<Dorothy>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's never forgotten a promise to me. I'm worried about him. I know something's happened to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Dorothy>
<DIRECTION>
She looks off scene toward the bar. Suddenly her attention is riveted on someone.
</DIRECTION>
<Andrew>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What could happen to him, darling? You mustn't worry....
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then as he half rises, he continues)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Andrew>
<Dorothy>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a minute...
	</DIALOGUE>
</Dorothy>
<DIRECTION>
She leaves the table -- her eyes still fixed eagerly on the man she has seen. WE TRUCK AND PAN WITH HER as she goes forward to the bar. And as she comes in, we see her re- act eagerly as she confronts a good-looking man of about thirty-five, tall, casual, and worldly wise, who is standing in front of the bar, his face reflected in the mirror. This is NICK CHARLES.

Dorothy realizes that he hasn't any remem- brance of her.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: ENTRANCE OF THE BAR -- FROM THE CLOAK ROOM OR CORRIDOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NORA CHARLES, Nick's wife, is coming through. She is a woman of about twenty-six... a tre- mendously vital person, interested in every- body and everything, in contrast to Nick's apparent indifference to anything except when he is going to get his next drink. There is a warm understanding relationship between them. They are really crazy about each other, but undemonstrative and humorous in their compan- ionship. They are tolerant, easy-going, taking drink for drink, and battling their way to- gether with a dry humor. Just now Nora has been shopping. Her arms are full of small packages. Her hat is askew. She is pulled along bodily by a small white Sealingham on a leash. A doorman and a hat-check clerk are following her, protesting at her bringing the dog into this fashionable hotel. The dog is exitedly barking.
</DIRECTION>
<Doorman>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madame, you can't bring that dog in here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Doorman>
<Nora>

<DIRECTION>
(then to the dog)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Asta! Asta!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nora>
<DIRECTION>
But the dog pays no attention. He pulls her like a streak out of the scene toward the bar. Nora's packages are left in a trail behind her as she stumbles after him. The attendants follow after her, picking up the parcels and protesting vehemently.
</DIRECTION>
<Attendants>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Madame... dogs aren't allowed.... It isn't only your dog... but if we started.... Madame, you dropped your package.... etc.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
:SC: BAR -- CLOSE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Asta, the dog, rushes in, still with Nora on the other end of the leash. The dog makes a bee-line for Nick, pulls away and -- ker- plunk! -- he leaps clear up into Nick's arms. He is barking with delight. He seems to have a particular desire to lick Nick's nose. Nora, more dishevelled than ever and breathless, enters, panting. She realizes that this was Asta's objective.
</DIRECTION>
<Nora>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

One of the attendants who followed Nora comes up. He hands Nora several of her packages.

<DIRECTION>
(He puts Asta down on the floor. He speaks to the dog)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now lie down.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Asta looks up at him, wagging his tail,
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	but making no move to obey him. Nick speaks
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
with more authority)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lie down!

<DIRECTION>
(still Asta looks fondly up at him, with- out obeying)

The attendant laughs and moves off.

Nick realizes that Dorothy and his wife have not met. He makes the introduction very casually, waving his hand to indicate Nora.
</DIRECTION>
<Nick>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my wife -- Dorothy Wynant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nick>
<DIRECTION>
The two women smile in acknowledgment. nora looks at Dorothy with warm interest.

He is evidently terrified by something that he has seen.

She makes up her mind to take the object, which we do not see. Look- ing around quickly to see if no one has come in, she reaches down, takes it from the girl's hand, and stuffs it in her hand bag.

It is eight o'clock the same night... about two hours later.

There is a party in full swing. It is an odd assortment of people. There is a police cap- tain there, a reminder of Nick's old life. A little prizefight manager with a big fighter in tow. Quinn, a dissipated looking man of about thirty-five, and his wife, a rather faded woman of about thirty-two, very jealous of Friend Husband. Quinn is a broker, and the only one in evening clothes. Then there is Foster, a big fat man, who sits near the radio, a glass in his hand. With every sip, he grows more sentimental, as he lis- tens to the program of Christmas carols that are coming over the radio. There is an improvised bar with everything in the way

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I hated her for coming between my mother and father. She kept me from seeing my father. I went down there to ask her where he was. She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.

	Oh, yeah? People fall toward a shot, you know... not back from it. I knew you were lying.

Dorothy breaks down, realizing that her attempt to take the blame is futile. Nick goes and holds her comfortingly in his arms.

The two reporters, without a word, grab their hats and coats and rush out. Quinn, too, brazenly starts to breeze past his wife and follow them. Mrs. Quinn steps in front of him, slaps his face. Foster, again at the phone, whines out: "Hello, Ma!" And simultaneously, during this confusion, the radio starts to play "Silent Night, Peaceful Night" -- as the police captain, the pug, Face Peppler, and all others immediately join in with the song. They are all pretty tight by this time and sing at the top of their lungs. The effect desired is a screwy climax to what has been quite a hectic, screwy situation.

Asta jumps on the bed, goes and curls himself up at their feet.

</Nora>

	Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.

	You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.

Nora looks over at him, disgusted. She puts down the drink and pulls out the light. After a second, there is a knock heard from the next room. Nora pulls on the light. She turns to Nick.
</DIRECTION>
<Nora>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you hear a knock?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nora>
<DIRECTION>
Nick looks up. The knock comes again. Nora gets up, takes a robe from the foot of the bed, pulls it on and goes out. As she does so, Nick reaches over, takes her drink and finishes it, then turns over again to go to sleep.

Nora has put on the lights as she came through the room. She opens the door. Joe Morelli is

which he doesn't remove and he has his hands in the pockets of his close fitting black over- coat. Nora looks at him with lively curiosity. She is too fond of adventure as well as too brave to scream when she sees his menacing figure.

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's great. I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nick>

But as Nora moves away to get back into bed, we see Morelli has followed her into the bedroom and is standing pointing a gun directly at Nick, with a menacing intentness in his whole body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: WIDE ANGLE - THE GROUP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nora, entirely unconscious of Morelli's presence and the gun in his hand, swings into bed beside Nick. Nick is looking fixedly at the gun. Nora looks at him, amused by his expression, not knowing the cause.
</DIRECTION>
<Nora>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got the funniest look on your face.

She follows the line of Nick's gaze, and her eyes pop with amazement as she sees Morelli with the gun.

<Nick>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why tell me?

</Nick>
<Morelli>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her. She was always on the up and up with me. But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.

	<DIALOGUE>
	He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen... What's the law doing to me? Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?

</Nick>
<Morelli>

(sarcastically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That'd be very smart. That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument. The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions. They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.

Over the SOUND TRACK there is a sound of knuckles rapping sharply on the door. Morelli's gun is in his hand before the rapping stops. His eyes seem to move in all directions at once.

Nick shoves Nora's face, knocking her out of bed and across the room with his left hand, and throws a pillow at Morelli with his right just as Morelli fires. Nick sprawls out of bed, making a dive for Morelli and catching his ankle. The two men fall to the floor. Morelli clubs Nick with his revolver, and Nick fights him with his one free hand.

Guild, two policemen, and the hotel manager rush into the room. They pitch in and drag Nick and Morelli apart.

As he is just ready to shoot, the CAMERA PANS over to his target. It is a large balloon that Asta is chasing around the room. We hear the "pop" of the rifle and the balloon ex- plodes, to Asta's astonishment and chagrin. Asta starts looking for the lost balloon.

</Nora>
<Nick>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Macaulay.

Nora reads the telegrams and hands them to Nick at the other end of the sofa as she finishes. He takes them as she gives them to him, and throws them on the floor without looking at them.

<Nora>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Season's Greetings. The Mallorys.

(she hands it to Nick. She is distressed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I forgot all about them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nora>
<DIRECTION>
She opens another telegram. Nick throws the first to the floor. He looks at Nora in her fur coat.
</DIRECTION>
<Nick>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you hot in that?

</Nick>
<Nora>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</Nora>
<Nick>

	Did I give it to you?

</Nick>
<Nora>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</Nora>

Again this is news to Nick, but he takes it philosophically.

<Nick>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm spoiling you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nick>

She tickles him with her foot. Then she hands him another telegram, which suffers the same fate. Nick cocks his gun again, prepar-

<Nora>

	</DIALOGUE>
</Nora>

By this time she is at the door. She opens the door to Macaulay.

<Nora>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hello. Come on in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nora>
<Macaulay>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning. I'm afraid this isn't a very "Merry Christmas" for you.

</Macaulay>
<Nora>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, he's sitting up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nora>
<Macaulay>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Macaulay>
<DIRECTION>
Macaulay comes in and goes to Nick.
</DIRECTION>
<Nick>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nick>
<Macaulay>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate to bother you when you're laid up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Macaulay>
<Nick>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nick>
<DIRECTION>
Asta, delighted to see a visitor, jumps all over Macaulay. Macauley is a little discon- certed by all this attention.
</DIRECTION>
<Nora>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Asta! Asta! Come here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nora>
<DIRECTION>
She throws a ball and the dog chases it out of the scene. Macaulay sits down near Nick. Asta comes back into the scene. He deposits the ball near Macaulay's chair and stands looking eagerly up at him.
</DIRECTION>
<Nora>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nora>
<Macaulay>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Macaulay>
<DIRECTION>
He leans down and throws the ball for Asta. Beside him on the floor is a miniature fire hydrant He looks down at it.
</DIRECTION>
<Macaulay>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a delightful toy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Macaulay>
<DIRECTION>
Nick looks down and sees it for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<Nick>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, it's a fire hydrant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nick>
<Nora>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. It's Asta's Christmas present.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nora>
<DIRECTION>
Macaulay, a little troubled, looks down at it, and then unostentatiously moves his leg and his chair out of the danger zone. Asta returns, playfully and affectionately, with the ball again. Macaulay, with a forced smile, throws it for him again. Then Macaulay turns to Nick, reaching in his pocket for a telegram.
</DIRECTION>
<Macaulay>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got word from Wynant this morning...
	</DIALOGUE>
</Macaulay>
<Nora>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So did we.

(correcting herself - indicating Nick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, Sherlock here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nora>
<DIRECTION>
Nick hands Macaulay his telegram from Wynant. Macaulay reads it and looks at Nick.
</DIRECTION>
<Macaulay>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are the chances of getting you to do what he wants?

</Macaulay>
<Nick>

<Nora>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, please, Nick.

</Nora>
<Macaulay>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would it help any if I could persuade him to meet you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Macaulay>
<Nick>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It might.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nick>
<Macaulay>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He gave me a code message to insert in the Times, in case I wanted to get in touch with him.

</Macaulay>
<Nick>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wouldn't hurt to put it in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nick>
<DIRECTION>
Nora beams. The telephone rings. Nick picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<Macaulay>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've done that already. He should appear, you know. It doesn't look well... his staying away at a time like this.

(his face changes... he is startled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where? In Allentown.

<DIRECTION>
(he consults his watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes... When is the next train? Right - I'll get that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he slowly puts up the phone and turns to Nick and Nora)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wynant's tried to commit suicide. They want me to come down and identify him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(slowly he picks up his hat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess this changes the whole story, doesn't it? That looks like an admission of guilt. And I had such hopes. I thought if you got on the case, you'd be able to clear him. I thought that Mimi.... the way she acted... I was sure that....
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, well, well... it's no use thinking of it now. I'm sorry to have wasted so much of your time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Macaulay>
<DIRECTION>
He goes quickly out. Nora looks after him, and then turns to Nick. She is evidently depressed.
</DIRECTION>
<Nora>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Nick starts to get up off the sofa)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay there, Nick!

</Nick>
<Nora>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, hard guy. Get up and bleed on the rugs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nora>
<DIRECTION>
Nick walks over to pour a drink. Nora sits down and Asta comes and puts his head on her knees looking sadly up at her.
</DIRECTION>
<Nora>

	What's the trouble, Asta? Your balloon busted? So's mine.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter with you?

</Nick>
<Nora>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nora>
<Nick>

(over his drink, casually, as is characteristic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I will.

</Nick>
<Nora>

(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Wynant --- ?

</Nora>
<Nick>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe he did it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nick>
<Nora>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nora>
<Nick>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No reason. Just a hunch. But I'm going to find out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he starts to untie his robe)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm tired of being pushed around.

	So am I.

Nick and Nora come through the door. They have Asta on a leash. Guild steps up to them.

	Good morning --

	Good morning, Lieutenant -

<DIRECTION>
(Asta pulls her violently toward the curb.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She goes after him, out of the scene,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
calling back apologetically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nora>
<DIRECTION>
Guild and Nick follow Nora more slowly to the curb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guild (to Nick) You oughtn't to play this trick on me. Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
</DIRECTION>
<Nick>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean about that gun?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nick>
<Guild>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That ain't a gun any more. The firing pin's busted - the -

<DIRECTION>
(he breaks off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't waste time talking about that.

They join Nora. She listens eagerly, not
</DIRECTION>
<taking_her_eyes_from_Nick_and_Guild_Through>
<DIRECTION>
the whole scene, as they walk down the block, when Asta pulls on the leash Nora stops with him, and the two men, as a matter of course, stop and wait for Nora, none of them ever looking at Asta. (IT IS A TRUCKING SHOT ALL THE WAY)
</DIRECTION>
<Guild>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Guild>
<Nick>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man to man, I'm not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nick>
<Nora>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he's interested!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nora>
<Guild>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Guild>
<Nick>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So would I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nick>
<Guild>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a bargain then. Anything you want to know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Guild>
<DIRECTION>
The leash tightens up and starts to pull Nora ahead. The two men quicken their steps to keep pace with her. (They are walking along a quiet street in the East Fifties, so that there is not much traffic, and not many people.)
</DIRECTION>
<Nick>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the suicide?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nick>
<Guild>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that's a phoney. The men didn't even have to go down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Guild>
<Nick>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought it might be. From now on, they're going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is Wynant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nick>
<DIRECTION>
Again the leash pulls Nora over to the curb. The three, without interrupting their conversation, stand still, waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<Nora>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think that Wynant did it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nora>
<Guild>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Guild>
<Nick>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nick>
<Guild>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it. Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two-timing him. They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal. So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know any- thing has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Guild>
<DIRECTION>
Asta completes his investigation and starts off down the street again the three follow.
</DIRECTION>
<Nick>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No proof?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nick>
<Guild>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing yet to cinch it.

</Guild>
<Nick>

	Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nick>
<Guild>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Guild>
<Nick>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For one thing, he was too absent-minded to hold a grudge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nick>
<Guild>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's your candidate?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Guild>
<Nick>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't got that far yet. But I don't think that everything points to Wynant. What about the alibis?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nick>
<Guild>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're all O.K. Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Guild>
<Nick>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Jorgensen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nick>
<Guild>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll check on that.

	Dull... I'm sitting on the edge of my chair!

</Nora>

Asta sees another hydrant and makes for it. But Nora is too interested to stop. She drags him on.

<Nick>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about this Nunheim?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nick>
<Guild>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, he's all right. We know all about him. He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Guild>
<Nick>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nick>
<Guild>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Taxi!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Guild>
<DIRECTION>
A taxi drives up. Nora starts to get in.
</DIRECTION>
<Nick>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nick>
<Nora>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Catch me letting you go alone!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Nora>
<DIRECTION>
She climbs determinedly in, pulling Asta after her. Guild starts to follow, but Nick pulls him away. He closes the door of the taxi and speaks to the driver:
</DIRECTION>
<Nick>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grant's Tomb.

The cab starts off. Nora shakes her fist back at Nick. Nick charmingly lifts his hat and throws her a kiss, as Guild hails another passing cab.

:SC: OUTSIDE DOOR OF NUNHEIM'S APARTMENT.

It is the fourth floor of a dark, damp building. The noise of the Sixth Avenue El can be heard even in the hallway. Guild and Nick come to the door. Guild knocks. There are sounds of hurried movement inside the room, then a voice calls, in an irritated tone.

Nunheim hastily unlocks and opens the door. He has no coat on - he is evidently frighten- ed.

Guild touches Nick's elbow with his hand, and they go in.

The room is shabby and dirty, with clothing, newspapers and dirty dishes sitting around. Through an open door, the bedroom, with an

is a sink and a stove. Marian is standing

<there_with_a_sizzling_skillet_in_her_hand>
<DIRECTION>
She is wearing a rumpled pink kimono and frayed pink mules with lop-sided bows on them. She stares sullenly at Guild and Nick as they come in. Guild does not introduce Nick to Nunheim, or even look at Marian. He keeps his hat on, and Nick, seeing him, follows his example. Guild pushes some clothing out of the way to make a place for himself at the end of the sofa.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down.

Nick removes some newspaper from a rocking chair and sits down. Nunheim goes over to a table where there is about two inches of whiskey in a pint bottle.

</Nunheim>
<Guild>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Guild>
<Nunheim>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all I did, Lieutenent. That's the God's truth. Maybe I said hello to her or how are you or something like that when I saw her, but that's all I knew her. That's the truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Marian laughs once, derisively. But
</DIRECTION>
<there_is_no_mirth_in_her_face_Nunheim>

twists around to face her) All right. Put your mouth in and I'll pop a tooth out of it.
</DIRECTION>
<Marian>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that so!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Marian>
<DIRECTION>
She swings her arm around and lets the skillet fly at his head. It misses, crashing into the wall. Nunheim starts after her. Marian picks up a paring knife. Nick puts his foot out, without rising, and trips him. Nunheim falls to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<Guild>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut it out. We didn't come here to watch you two rough-house.

Nunheim slowly gets up. Marian starts for the bedroom without looking at any of them.

<Nunheim>

	She drives me nuts. She's been ragging me all day.

Just as he steps in, there is the crack of a pistol shot and the flash of fire from the gun. Nunheim throws up his hands, staggers forward to the street, his hand clutching his heart.

Over the place where Asta was whining, the cement gives out a hollow sound. Nick takes the bar in both hands, throws his whole strength into it, trying to force it through the floor. It finally goes through. Nick leans down, and

	Oh. Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed. The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.

	He planned the whole thing beautifully. After he killed Wynant he wired Macaulay, using Wynant's name and told him to shut up the shop. He destroyed all of Wynant's clothes, with the ex- ception of his watch chain. He figured that some day that might come in handy. Then he took Wynant's body and buried it in the shop with another man's clothes to throw us off the track. He even put a belt buckle with an "R" on it, hop- ing that we'd think it was Rosebreen -- an old enemy of Wynant's who dropped out of sight years ago.

	<DIALOGUE>
	After our hero had killed Wynant, he got a brilliant idea. He realized that he and Julia could still collect money. Wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to Macaulay, signing Wynant's name, so that Macaulay would continue to send the money to Julia. He even telephoned Macaulay --

	<DIALOGUE>

But it must have been Wynant. I should have known if it weren't his voice.
</DIRECTION>
<Nick>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh he as clever about that. He called when you were out. That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.

	You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain. The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case. Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is.

Remember the other two who were in with him on this... Julia and Nunheim. When he thought they might spill something he bumped them off.
