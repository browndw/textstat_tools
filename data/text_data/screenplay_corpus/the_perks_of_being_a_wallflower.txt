The titles begin over black. We hear the sound of an old typewriter. Someone reaching out to us. The bell dings, announcing the end of a line, and we see our title...

THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Music begins, picture fades up, and we are in the city. Downtown Pittsburgh. Looking out of the back window like a child in the back of a station wagon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see lights on buildings and everything that makes us wonder. We see the bridge. And the river below. And then we enter...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We keep moving backwards, watching the lights. Golden, alive, and hypnotic. The music carries us as we float out of the tunnel. Onto another bridge. And over the highway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move into the night sky, back through the trees, through a window, and into...

INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

It is a neat and tidy little room. Few posters or books. CHARLIE is 15. He is innocent, hopeful, awkward, and likable to everyone but his classmates. He sits at his desk, writing a letter in pencil as he tapes the title song through the radio on his cassette boom box.

	Dear Friend, I am writing to you because she said you listen and understand and didn't try to sleep with that person at that party even though you could have. Please don't try to figure out who she is because then you might figure out who I am, and I don't want you to do that. I just need to know that people like you exist. Like if you met me, you wouldn't think I was the weird kid who spent time in the hospital. And I wouldn't make you nervous.

</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shhh. I'm Mr. Anderson. And thanks to Teach for America, I'm going to be your teacher for freshman English. This semester, we're going to be learning Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. Genius book. Now, who wants to get out of the first pop quiz?

As kids think, Bill confiscates contraband, removes hats.

<BILL>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's British. He also invented the serial. In fact, at the end of chapter 3 of his first novel, he had a man hanging off a cliff by his fingernails. Hence, the term cliffhanger. Anybody?

<FRESHMAN_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shakespeare.

Bill is about to give the answer when he notices Charlie has already written... Charles Dickens.

	<DIALOGUE>
	... Charles Dickens. However, if you and I had gone to a play in Shakespeare's time, it would have cost 4 pennies. Can you imagine that? We would have put those pennies in a metal box, which the ushers would lock in the office. And that's where we get the term... anyone?

Sam sits down, sandwiching Charlie between her and Patrick. Charlie tries to remain casual. Hang in there, buddy.

<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I finally got hold of Bob.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's never tossing that salad.
	</DIALOGUE>

Brad Hays marches the Devils offense down the field. The kids clap. Sam looks at Charlie, then turns back to Patrick.

	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that what they call him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<SAM>

	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's nice to meet you, Charlie. I'm Sam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Sam extends her hand to Charlie. Every nail a different color. They shake. Then, Sam grabs a nacho. Zoinks!
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what's the plan, Sam? You want to go to Mary Elizabeth's house?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't. She got caught watering down her parent's brandy with iced tea. Let's just go to Kings.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey... we're going to Kings after the game if you want to come.

INT. KINGS FAMILY RESTAURANT - NIGHT

The Devils' faithful cheer as Brad Hays and his guys enter! The place is packed. Patrick and Sam drink coffee while Charlie eats his brownie. They're all excited.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have a favorite band?

</SAM>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think The Smiths are my favorite.

	Are you kidding!? I love The Smiths! The best breakup band ever. What's your favorite song?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Asleep. It's from Louder Than Bombs. I heard it on Pony Tail Derek's mix tape.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That works on so many levels.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>

<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Charlie... what are you going to do when you get out of here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<CHARLIE>

	My Aunt Helen said I should be a writer, but I don't know what I'd write about.

</SAM>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Sam's not bitter. Make no mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely. I'm not a bulimic. I'm a bulim-ist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
They laugh at their inside joke. Charlie has no idea what's so funny.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I don't know what that means.

</PATRICK>
<CHARLIE>

Charlie waves as the truck leaves. The look on his face. The happiness from one night of company.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie enters the house, excited to tell someone his news. He runs up the stairs to find the living room empty. He hears the TV playing downstairs in the basement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DOORWAY TO BASEMENT - NIGHT

As Charlie approaches, he hears muffled sounds of fighting.

</DEREK>
<CANDACE>

Charlie enters, wanting to stop the fight. Derek's neck is red. Dangerous angry. Candace keeps digging.
</DIRECTION>
<CANDACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you just stand there like a little bitch dog.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANDACE>
<DIRECTION>
SNAP! Out of nowhere, Derek slaps her across the face. It's not a movie slap. It's a real slap. Dead sound. And after it, silence. Candace turns and sees Charlie. It sobers her up. Charlie moves at Derek. Candace stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<CANDACE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie, just go. I can handle it. Just don't wake up mom and dad.

She pushes him out of the room and closes the door.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Charlie sits at his desk. So disturbed. He hears a car start outside. He moves to his window and looks down at Derek and Candace near Derek's mother's Mercedes. Derek is crying. Candace comforts. After a beat... they kiss.

Charlie stands frozen, a look creeping across his face.

INT. ENTRY HALL - NIGHT (FLASHBACK)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens to reveal Charlie's mom and AUNT HELEN entering the house. Aunt Helen carries a suitcase. The children don't know where she's been or why she looks sad. They just know they love her. Little Charlie stands at the top of the stairs with his brother and sister in their Sunday clothes. There are balloons. And streamers.
</DIRECTION>

	Welcome home, Aunt Helen!

Charlie stands at the top of the stairs as Candace enters the house. She is startled when she sees Charlie. They whisper.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<CANDACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I egged him on. You saw it. He's never hit me before. I promise he'll never hit me again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANDACE>
<DIRECTION>
She's about to go back downstairs when...
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like Aunt Helen's boyfriends?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
A silence passes between them. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<CANDACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie... this is Pony Tail Derek. I can handle him. Will you trust me? Please, don't tell mom and dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANDACE>
<DIRECTION>
With a desperately confident nod, Candace goes downstairs. Charlie stands in the entry hall, troubled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Homecoming Dance is in full swing. God bless everyone. Especially Charlie. He's alone at the wall, dressed in his Sunday suit. To us, adorable. To himself, in living hell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie watches his sister, slow dancing with Derek. As happy as she looks, Charlie still isn't sure if he did the right thing by keeping quiet. The song ends to applause.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a beat, Charlie turns away. That's when he sees Sam and Patrick at the punch bowl. We hear the first notes of "Come On, Eileen" by Dexy's Midnight Runners.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my God. They're playing good music.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>

<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Living room routine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie watches Sam and Patrick run to the center of the floor and show this stiff crowd what dancing is. It starts slow. "So over it" hand moves. A little shoulder. And then, the best of swing. 30 seconds of genius.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie takes a breath. Then, he tries desperately not to look like he's dancing toward them as he dances toward them. He bobs his head like a dork. And once he gets close, Patrick and Sam turn and find him.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM_PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM_PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Without a pause, they grab his hands, and move together in a circle. Their own island. After a moment, Sam moves around Charlie like a maypole as the whole gym explodes into dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOB'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The party rages inside this mansion in the rich part of town. Patrick and Sam walk up the steps with Charlie tailing.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, it's freezing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>

	"He's sensitive."

Sam knocks. The door opens, revealing BOB (20). Bob was the cool high school kid, who never quite left. He's stoned so often that people can't tell the difference anymore.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam... that waitress from the Olive Garden is a tease. Will you marry me?

</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
The music blasts. Charlie's eyes are our guide. As they walk through the crowd, you can smell it. Stale beer and cigarette smoke. High school parties. The room is packed
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
with kids playing quarters. Others pouring vodka into a watermelon.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>

MARY ELIZABETH and ALICE (both 17) sit on the sofa together. Mary Elizabeth is smart, a little overweight, and extremely bossy. Alice will figure out that she's a lesbian in college. Right now, she just likes movies and is Mary Elizabeth's "beta female."

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Look who's here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>

The party turns, and Charlie sees Brad Hays, the quarterback, enter with Sam and Bob. Patrick approaches them. Charlie sits on the beat up couch next to the girls. He's shocked.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that Brad Hays?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<ALICE>

Charlie tries to think of something, but he can't. The girls turn, ignoring him. Bob approaches with a tray.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie, you look like you could use a brownie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. I was so hungry at the dance. I was going to go to King's, but I didn't really have any time. Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Bob smiles. Mary Elizabeth gives Alice a knowing glance. Charlie bites into the brownie. The icing gushing between his teeth. The image goes up into the smoke like an inhale as he chews and chews and chews.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOB'S BASEMENT - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a beat, the music changes, and the image exhales back down to Charlie, who is now... baked out of his mind. The

<DIRECTION>
whole party surrounds him now, pissing themselves with laughter as this shy kid talks and talks and talks.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie, what do you think about high school?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_ELIZABETH>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	High school? Bullshit. The cafeteria is called the Nutrition Center. And people wear their letter jackets even when it's 98 degrees out. And why do they give out letters for marching band? That's not a sport, and we all know it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<MARY_ELIZABETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This kid is crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_ELIZABETH>

Charlie looks at Mary Elizabeth with her new wave haircut.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>

	And Mary Elizabeth, I think you're really going to regret that haircut when you look back at old photographs.

<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Charlie. Let me make the milkshake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<CHARLIE>

<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm guessing you've never been high before?

<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Charlie, listen. I need you to promise that you're not going to say anything to anyone about me and Brad. This has to be our little secret.

The party has thinned. Sam watches Charlie drink his milkshake obsessively with Alice and Mary Elizabeth.

Patrick walks downstairs. Sam motions him over.

Patrick turns to look at Charlie. He feels so bad for the kid. Patrick raises his plastic cup to the remaining crowd.

Charlie looks up. A little paranoid. Everyone is staring.

EXT./INT. SAM'S TRUCK - NIGHT

The truck speeds on Highway 376 toward the Fort Pitt Tunnel. Patrick drives. Sam cranks the radio, blaring "The Tunnel Song." The Star's anthem, "Your Ex-Lover is Dead" is our prototype for tone.

Patrick turns up the volume and drums on the steering wheel, just as the truck flies into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We go behind the truck. Rising as Sam puts her arms in the air. The image moves to Charlie's point of view, rising from Sam's feet up her shivering legs. Past the band-aid on her right knee. To Sam's face as she looks down. Into the camera. Right at us. For we are now...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie, looking up at Sam, so in love with this free-spirit. So happy to have friends. Happy to be alive. Charlie gets this look on his face. Patrick notices and smiles.

	Dear Friend, I'm sorry I haven't written for awhile, but I've been trying hard not to be a loser.

As the lyrics begin, Charlie unabashedly lip-synchs...

<AIR_SUPPLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm lying alone with my head on the phone, thinking of you 'til it hurts.
	</DIALOGUE>

Charlie sits at his desk, writing and lip-synching.

INT. BILL'S CLASSROOM - MORNING

As the students file out, Charlie hands his paper to Bill in exchange for a beat up copy of The Great Gatsby.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am also studying extra books outside of class. As it turns out, Mr. Anderson is a writer. He even had a play put up in New York once, which I think is very impressive. He and his wife might go back there after this year. I know this is selfish, but I really hope he doesn't.
	</DIALOGUE>

Charlie pauses in the doorway and turns back to look at Bill.

INT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie turns from the lunch line with The Great Gatsby on his tray. He looks at the gang at their table. He sits with them as they debate the design of this month's fanzine.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My favorite time, though, is lunch because I get to see Sam and Patrick. We spend the time working on Mary Elizabeth's fanzine about music and The Rocky Horror Picture Show. It's called Punk Rocky. Mary Elizabeth is really interesting because she is a Buddhist and a punk, but somehow she always acts like my father at the end of a "long day."
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIBRARY - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The xerox spits out copies of PUNK ROCKY! Halloween Issue! Alice staples while Mary Elizabeth works her like a sled dog.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her best friend Alice loves vampires and wants to go to film school. She also steals jeans from the mall. I don't know why because her family is rich, but I'm trying not to be judgemental. Especially since I know how they were all there for Patrick last year. Patrick never likes to be serious, so it took me awhile to get what happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Sam and Alice laugh when Patrick begins stapling Mary Elizabeth's fanzines to within an inch of their life.

EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Brad Hays leads the football team through the banner onto the field as Charlie, Patrick, and Sam cheer. Moments later, Brad pulls his helmet on and rushes onto the field.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When he was a junior, Patrick started seeing Brad on the weekends in secret. I guess it was hard, too, because Brad had to get drunk every time they fooled around.

</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Patrick was eventually able to help Brad get sober. I asked Patrick if he felt sad that he had to keep it a secret, and he said no because at least now, Brad doesn't have to get drunk to love him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Brad sits down with his football pals. Patrick joins Charlie and Sam at their table. Charlie looks over at Sam, studying hard for her SAT's.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think that I understand because I really like Sam. I asked my sister about her, and she said that when Sam was a freshman, the upper classmen used to get her drunk at parties. I guess she had a reputation. But I don't care. I'd hate for her to judge me based on what I used to be like.

The crowd cheers! Charlie claps from the front row.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DORMONT HOLLYWOOD MOVIE THEATER - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The movie is in full swing. Charlie watches Sam as Janet in the Floor Show. Sam mimics Susan Sarandon perfectly. Especially the body. She winks at Charlie as "Fanfare/Don't Dream It" begins and arriving regally as Frank 'n Furter in full drag is... Patrick.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever happened to Fae Wray? That delicate, satin draped frame? As it clung to her thigh, how I started to cry 'cause I wanted to be dressed just the same.
	</DIALOGUE>

Patrick is a rock star. He approaches Charlie. Putting his ass in his face. Charlie is freaked out and laughing! Especially when he sees Brad, alone in the back, smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>

	Give yourself over to absolute pleasure. Swim the warm waters of sins of the flesh. Erotic nightmares beyond any measure. And sensual daydreams to treasure forever. Can't you just see it? Woah oh oh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie stops laughing when the orgy begins between Patrick, Mary Elizabeth (as Columbia), CRAIG (21), an art student with a model's body (as Rocky)... and of course... Sam. Charlie watches Sam until he can't take his lust (or guilt).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CRAIG'S LOFT APARTMENT - KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the chorus of "Don't Dream It, Be It" as Charlie watches all of the exciting cast members at the after-show party. Charlie sees a photo of Sam's naked back on the wall of Craig's loft. Very arty. Very black & white. Charlie's lust (and guilt) are now at 11. Alice looks at the photo.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's gorgeous, Craig. What did you use?

Craig is impressive to high school kids. He's a little pretentious. But his art school life. His red wine. His loft. Wow. Right now, he holds court in the wine line.

	Color film, but black and white paper for the printing. My professor gave me an "A," but for the wrong reasons. Most of them are idiots. You'll see what I mean when you get to college. How were your SAT's by the way?

<SAM>

The tape revolves in the stereo, playing a beautiful ballad. Charlie watches Sam sway to his music like a serenade. Like she is dancing with him. But she isn't. A wider angle reveals that she is slow dancing with... Craig.

Charlie is 15 year old CRUSHED. No filter. Just feeling. Patrick, Alice, and Mary Elizabeth watch Sam across the room.

Craig dips a smiling Sam as the song ends. Sam goes into the kitchen. Craig approaches Charlie. Turns off his mix tape.

And the boyfriend says, "Stop. You're killing him." And the son just yells "Get out." And eventually the boyfriend just did.

	</DIALOGUE>
</CANDACE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Candace, I killed Aunt Helen, didn't I? She died getting my birthday present, so I guess I killed her, right? I've tried to stop thinking that, but I can't. She keeps driving away and dying over and over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Candace looks like she got hit with ice water. She knows her brother. She knows this voice. Candace covers the phone.

<CANDACE>

INT. CHARLIE'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We begin in the house. It's silent. The hallway. The entry hall. The empty bedroom. Charlie's typewriter on his desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's all so quiet. And then, we see Charlie walking down the hallway. He turns the corner and enters the...

INT. CHARLIE'S KITCHEN - DAY (PAST AND PRESENT)
</DIRECTION>

Kitchen. One room. Charlie doesn't know where he is anymore. The past and present have bled together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK FLASH. We see Little Charlie turn the corner into the kitchen. BACK TO PRESENT as 16 year old Charlie stands in the same kitchen, breathing shallow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK FLASH. 7 year old Charlie walks up to Aunt Helen sitting at the kitchen table. BACK TO PRESENT as 16 year old Charlie begins to have a full blown anxiety attack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK FLASH. 7 year old Charlie takes Aunt Helen's hand and turns it over... to reveal her wrist scars.
</DIRECTION>

BACK TO PRESENT as Charlie looks from the table to the counter with the bread and the KNIVES. He stares at the knives for a moment. Just as...

The Policemen break down the door.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Charlie's reflection in the window. The door opens slowly, and his psychiatrist, Dr. Burton, enters. She finds him sitting in the corner. He has been crying.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie? I'm Dr. Burton.

	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_BURTON>

This news hits Charlie hard. He begins to panic.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>

</CHARLIE>
<DR_BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_BURTON>
<CHARLIE>

</CHARLIE>
<DR_BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_BURTON>
<CHARLIE>

<DR_BURTON>

	What's hurting you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_BURTON>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Not me. It's them. It's everyone. It never stops. Do you understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Burton smiles, sympathetic. Charlie nods, relieved that someone finally understands. Until...
</DIRECTION>
<DR_BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about your Aunt Helen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_BURTON>
<DIRECTION>
Like cold water. What was tears is now confusion and soon to be shame. Dr. Burton is gentle to him.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DR_BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you see her?

</DR_BURTON>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, she had a terrible life. But... I mean, what am I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DR_BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said some things about her in your sleep.

Charlie looks at her, nodding her encouragement.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was... insane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
The minute he says one word of truth, he feels ashamed. He stops talking. Dr. Burton does not press him. Not today.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie, are you going to let me help you here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_BURTON>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie cries and nods.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DR_BURTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you remember anything before you blacked out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_BURTON>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I, uh... I remember leaving Sam's house, and walking home...

We move away from them as Charlie's voice trails off.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>

The sun creeps through the windows. We can hear birds outside. The intercom is quiet. Charlie is alone. He looks at Sam's typewriter. "Dear Friend" is already typed.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was in the hospital for awhile. I won't go into detail about all of it. But I will say there were some very bad days. And some unexpected beautiful days.

Charlie nods and leaves the hospital with his mother.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My doctor said we can't choose where we can come from, but we can choose where we go from there. I know it's not all the answers, but it was enough to start putting these pieces together.

Dr. Burton smiles, then turns back into the hospital.

	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER>

After they say "Amen," the room falls silent. The family is on pins and needles. No one touches their food. Until...

Ding dong. The door opens to reveal Patrick, smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can Charlie come out and play?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>

Charlie's mother smiles. Charlie smiles, too. Especially when he sees... Sam. Standing next to Patrick. Her hair a little different. Her eyes alive and happy.

The gang of three sit at their booth. Sam and Patrick have their coffee. Charlie has his brownie. Like always.

	I don't know if I will have the time to write any more letters because I might be too busy trying to participate. So, if this does end up being the last letter, I just want you to know that I was in a bad place before I started high school. And you helped me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAM'S TRUCK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three friends are flying down the highway in Sam's truck. The music blaring. The wind making their hair dance.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even if you didn't know what I was talking about. Or know someone who's gone through it. It made me not feel alone.

With Sam's help, Charlie climbs through the little window
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>

	Because I know there are people who say all of these things don't happen. And there are people who forget what it's like to be 16 when they turn 17.

We see Charlie in profile. The night sky behind him until...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FORT PITT TUNNEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... they enter the tunnel, and we realize just how fast they're driving. The white tiles of the tunnel whiz by at blinding speed. A perfect night. A perfect drive. Flying.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know these will all be stories someday. And our pictures will become old photographs. And we'll all become somebody's mom or dad. But right now, these moments are not stories.

Charlie turns to face forward. To the moment. To Sam, smiling at him from the front seat.

<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can see it. This one moment when you know you're not a sad story. You are alive. And as you stand up and see the lights on buildings and everything that makes you wonder. And you are listening to that song on that drive with the people you love most in this world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>

Charlie stands in the back of the truck. The wind on his face. He is free.

	And in this moment, I swear...

<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... we are infinite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
The tunnel song blasts over the speakers as the truck flies out of the tunnel. Sam and Patrick scream with excitement. Charlie holds his arms in the air. The weight of the world gone. If only for a moment. This one moment. We see the city. A million lights like white stars in a glass dome. We crane to the sky. We are in Heaven.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
