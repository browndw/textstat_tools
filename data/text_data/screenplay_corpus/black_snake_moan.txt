EXT. RONNIE'S TRAILER - EARLY DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAE is naked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wrapped around her shoulders is a loose-knit spread that conceals her slender form. She is in her 20's: a strawberry blond, with cinnamon freckles spotted across her pale skin. She is beautiful without trying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at the distant trees. This is the South; the small town of FISHERVILLE, TENNESSEE.

RONNIE is 25 years old. His hair is cropped in a military issue buzz.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RONNIE is dressed in his National Guard fatigues, packing up his gear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rae is now wearing a short jeans skirt and a T-shirt with a gray wolf print ironed on the front. There is a knock at the door. Rae flinches. Ronnie opens the door revealing GILL MORTON, Ronnie's buddy from high school.

INT. RONNIE'S TRAILER - BATHROOM - MORNING

<DIRECTION>
Rae doesn't answer.
</DIRECTION>

Gill backs away, allowing Ronnie and Rae some privacy. The two lovers stare into each others eyes and then embrace.

Rae peeks over Ronnie's shoulder at Gill with an expression of dread. Anger seizes her.

Ronnie holds out his own wrist to show her his identical watch.

	And wherever I'm at, my watch'll beep, too. We'll be thinkin' bout each other at the same time. Wherever we are.

<DIRECTION>
Rae is shaking. He grips her by the back of her neck and pushes their faces inches away. Eye to eye.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta believe we can do this or I ain't gonna make it, Rae.
	</DIALOGUE>

They kiss passionately.

Afraid of his swelling emotion, Ronnie quickly breaks away from her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rae watches as her love leaves in Gill's pick-up. Compelled to follow, she absently walks after the truck, down the gravel drive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stops. Silence. She is alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An intense wave of sorrow hits, like a kick to her gut. She gasps for breath as she struggles to hold back the flood of her tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rae drops to her knees, right there in the gravel drive. Her hair falls in front of her face, masking her grief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her shoulders shudder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her middle finger begins to scratch at her thigh repeatedly -- a nervous habit that has always accompanied this burning sensation that consumes her.
</DIRECTION>
<RAE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.

Tears come to her. She's not going to be able to stop it.

<DIRECTION>
Rae is gripping the watch around her wrist for comfort. Her breathing is already out of her control. The dizziness is already upon her. The familiar burning.
</DIRECTION>

She inhales in gasps, rocking back and forth on her knees. The late morning cicadas chirp in an undulating frenzy.

Tehronne is a muscular, dark-skinned, black male in his late twenties.

Rae's face is crammed up against the mirror in the small bathroom. Tehronne gets faster and pushes harder -- a stark contrast to her lovemaking with Ronnie.

Rae comes. A severe coughing fit hits her. She pushes him away with her ass.

ROSE WOODS, black, early forties, stands in the cafe. She looks confident and resolute in her new green skirt.

Rae lies on the side of the road.

Her T-shirt and panties are damp from the early morning mist, her face caked with dried blood. Her skin is deathly white, her mouth open, her eyes shut and swollen.

The door slams against the wall as it swings open. Laz is carrying Rae, unconscious and limp, in his arms.

He lays her down on the couch by the radiator. He pulls a quilt over her cold skin. With a twist of the valve the radiator moans to life.

Laz takes out his bandana and cleans her face. He tries to wake her.

Fear hits him. He slams the phone down again.

Laz crosses to the couch and gently touches her head.

Snot and spittle has run down the side of Rae's face -- her eyelids stick together as she tries to open them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a creak, followed by another. Rae has become aware that someone is slowly walking up the front porch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens. Silhouetted in the day's blinding light is a white man in his 40's. His face is indistinguishable to Rae's affected gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is this a dream?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands above her and lights a cigarette. The Zippo lighter clasps shut. The man lowers it to his side where Rae can see it clearly. A bald eagle is printed on the side, a sight that makes Rae's eyes open wide in horror.
</DIRECTION>

Her breath grows deeper -- a girlish plea. This is no dream -- it's a nightmare.

A massive hand slaps down over her mouth. Her crusted eyes peer above the hairy knuckles. He sucks on the cigarette. A red cherry blazes at the end. The man pushes the blanket off of her and grips her panties.

Rae's eyes close. She knows what is next. In his clenched fist, the panties are ripped off.

Rae flinches awake from the fever-induced nightmare and falls to the wooden floor, drenched in sweat. Weakened and shaking, she scampers away, finally collapsing in the kitchen. Her hand reaches out and lands on the strings of Laz's guitar on the floor. She grips the steel strings with her trembling fingers.

An explosion ignites the windows surrounding the cabin. Rae jolts awake, terror pervades her as she gasps at the fire ball outside the window.

She struggles to her feet and listens. A faint sound can be heard through the roar of the flames. beep beep... beep beep... beep beep... beep beep...

BEEP BEEP... BEEP BEEP... BEEP BEEP... BEEP BEEP...

At the center of the blaze is an upside down Humvee. To the left of the vehicle, a few soldier's bodies lay scattered. Rae's legs lose all strength, she collapses and crawls across the squash plants.
</DIRECTION>

A far away voice is heard over the roaring flames.
</DIRECTION>
<LAZARUS>

<DIRECTION>
Rae crawls across a fallen soldier, following the sound of Ronnie's alarm. She struggles to breathe, she almost faints.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She finds a soldier face down. With all her strength she turns him over. It is Ronnie, wide-eyed and lifeless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An awful groan comes out of Rae -- crippling sorrow. She pulls on his vest trying to wake him.

She turns and runs away as best she can. Laz chases after her. He's much older than her and a bit slower, but her balance betrays her.

Laz wraps his arms around her. Rae screams to the sky.

And then, stillness. Rae lies limp in Laz's arms, unconscious.

He reaches down and lifts her wrist to his face. The green screen of the digital watch pulsates with the alarm.

He pushes the side button. The beeping stops. Silence.

Struggling with exhaustion, Rae moves Laz's hand to her bare stomach. She rubs it slowly up and down her form, suggestively.

Laz slips his hand away and claps it tight over her eyes. Rae holds her breath, waiting to be molested, her lip quivering.

Laz pulls his lips away and holds her head in his hands. They are so close, they are breathing into each other's mouths.

It is clear from Sandy's reserved anguish that Rae is telling the truth.

Sandy firmly grips her by the arm and walks her out. Rae winces in pain like a toddler being led off to a car for a good whipping.

Sandy walks back up the aisle returning to her canned tuna.

And then the rage hits Rae.
</DIRECTION>

With each breath Rae grits her teeth tighter. She grabs a mop off the side aisle and turns around. Sandy is pricing cans, down on her knees. She doesn't see Rae coming.

<RAE>

Rae clocks her over the head, sending Sandy into the display of cans. Rae hits her again with the mop. She is screaming in short anguished breaths.

Rae grabs everything she can and dumps them onto Sandy: Bags of flour, cans, entire shelves of ketchup.

Laz rushes past the gawking customers at the end of the aisle. A few male workers, including Mark, stand at a distance watching Rae weep on the floor.

Sandy is being helped up by a co-worker -- her head is bleeding.
</DIRECTION>

Rae rocks back and forth, her face spotted with flour dust, the mop held tightly in her grip.

Mark tries to step closer but Rae cries out, thrashing with the mop handle. They retreat.

Ronnie has parked Gill's truck on the square. He starts walking up to the grocery store.

Another old guitar case comes out, followed by another, then another. Finally, Laz stands, an old maroon case in his grip.

They begin walking inside. Rae's watch goes off. She quickly turns it off. But a faint echo of the alarm can be heard behind her. She stops and turns toward the truck. The sound is gone.

Laz and Rae stand like strangers by the door. The place is wall to wall -- people at the bar, people playing pool.

Rae allows Laz's voice and guitar to take hold of her. Her face gets wet with sweat as she moves, making love to the current in the air.

Men are dancing all around her, but now she is in control. She turns to a young man and shakes, then an old man.

EXT. RONNIE'S TRAILER - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie turns toward the trailer. He is in his suit, standing in his front yard -- Lincoln at his side. R.L. stands to the side with a Bible in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<R_L>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</R_L>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie is amazed with what he sees. Laz leads beautiful Rae down the steps as Angela tends to her side.
</DIRECTION>
<R_L>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now we see but a poor reflection as in the mirror; then we shall see face to face. I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I am fully known.
	</DIALOGUE>
</R_L>
<DIRECTION>
Rae holds firm to Laz's arm as they come together on the green grass to witness and perform this union.
</DIRECTION>
<R_L>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Looks to Laz)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who gives this girl in marriage?
	</DIALOGUE>
</R_L>
<LAZARUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAZARUS>
<DIRECTION>
Lazarus takes a few steps with Rae, offering her arm to Ronnie. Ronnie and Laz stay locked in each other's gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<LAZARUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got her now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAZARUS>
<DIRECTION>
Laz stands next to Angela as Ronnie and Rae face R.L. together.
</DIRECTION>
<R_L>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ronnie. Rae. I want you to look at each other and listen to me carefully. Do you understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</R_L>
<RAE_RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Yes, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAE_RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
They both obey -- each with a serious expression.
</DIRECTION>
<R_L>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I require and charge you both as you stand in the presence of God to remember that love and loyalty alone will avail as a foundation of a happy and enduring home.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Lincoln)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on, hand it to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</R_L>
<DIRECTION>
Lincoln steps toward Ronnie and holds up the black velvet. Ronnie takes the gold chain and carefully wraps it around Rae's waist.
</DIRECTION>
<R_L>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No human ties are more tender. No vows more sacred than those you now assume.
	</DIALOGUE>
</R_L>
<DIRECTION>
Laz looks on -- a conflicted emotion of joy and loss.
</DIRECTION>
<R_L>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If these solemn vows be kept inviolate, the home which you are establishing will abide in peace and your life will be filled with joy.
	</DIALOGUE>

Angela reaches over and takes Laz's hand in hers.

EXT. FREEWAY / INT. RONNIE & RAE'S NEW CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie is at the wheel of the Chevy Caprice. Rae sits silently next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rae looks out the window as a huge 18 wheeler rolls up on her side. She tries to ignore it and the tension it brings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to see that Ronnie is sweating. Another truck is on his side sandwiching them in. An attack is coming over Ronnie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His breath is short. His chest tightens. Rae reaches over and gently strokes the back of his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta pull over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
He breaks. The two trucks zoom ahead as Ronnie breaks to the side. Dust flies as the Chevy skids to a stop on the side of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trucks zip by shaking the car, as Ronnie tries to get control of his breathing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rae tries to stay calm, stroking the back of his neck as he struggles for breath. He puts his forehead against the wheel to stave off the building nausea.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(through clenched teeth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	FUCK!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Fear comes to Rae's face as she notices her middle finger scratching at the back of Ronnie's neck. She pulls it away and shoves her hand between her thighs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes close as the burning builds. She grips the gold chain around her waist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH TO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK CUTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chain, tight around Rae as she struggles. Rae panting and sweating on Laz's floor. She reaches out. Her hand lands on the strings of his guitar. A single string is plucked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH BACK TO:

<DIRECTION>
EXT. FREEWAY/ INT. RONNIE & RAE'S NEW CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rae opens her eyes -- the low note still sounding in her head. She places her hand back on his neck. And then, soft as a prayer:
</DIRECTION>
<RAE>
<DIRECTION>
(singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are my sunshine. My only sunshine. You make me happy, when times are gray.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAE>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie slowly turns and looks at Rae, his head still resting on the steering wheel. The panting has slowed. Color starts returning to his cheeks.
</DIRECTION>
<RAE>
<DIRECTION>
(singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll never know dear, how much I love you. Please don't take, my sunshine away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAE>
<DIRECTION>
The anxiety is gone. Ronnie takes a breath and looks at Rae, humbled and thankful of her power to soothe him.
</DIRECTION>
<RAE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See. We're okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAE>
<DIRECTION>
Rae is smiling.

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO BLACK:

THE END
