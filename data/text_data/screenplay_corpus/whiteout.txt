Antarctica. Six million square miles of ice. The coldest place on earth.

Forty-six countries have competing claims and maintain outposts. The Antarctic Treaty holds these claims in check.

There is no regular law enforcement. A single U.S. Marshal is assigned to the territory.

<DIRECTION>
Snow-covered hills thrust up out of a barren, white wasteland. No buildings, no animals... nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER: The hills are more defined. Rows of jagged peaks and a crazed pattern of crevasses. A fine `mist' of wind-blown snow whips about this jumble of glinting ice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STILL CLOSER: We track down through valleys, skirt crevasses, climb peaks and finally pause on a flat stretch of ice. HOLD on this scene of timeless, savage beauty, then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUD!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FACE, hooded and goggled in ECW (extreme cold weather gear) drops into frame, smashing down on the icy surface with such brutal impact, the shattered goggle shield pops out --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- EYES STARE BLANKLY into camera -- locked in death. It's a man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera slowly starts to PULL BACK to see his limbs have snapped at unnatural angles, the head grotesquely twisted -- bright red arterial blood seeps from the corpse and spreads out down tiny cracks in the ice until, with startling speed, it turns dark and freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We PULL BACK further and look down on the body, a bizarre shape in a spider's web of frozen blood. And SLOWLY WE PULL BACK... further and further...until all is dazzling white.

The sounds of lapping surf and distant seagulls serenades us like a rhythmic lullaby.

<DIRECTION>
-- CU on WOMAN'S TOES digging up soft, white sand. The shadow of a palm tree cascading over top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Widen slightly -- a pair of feminine hands, donning an ANTIQUE SILVER ring on the left middle finger, are slowly applying coconut tanning lotion onto firm, athletic calves. Deep. Soothing. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
O.C. KNOCK KNOCK on a door.
</DIRECTION>

The hands stop.

</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Widen to meet CARRIE STETKO, late 20's. Cargo pants -- rolled up, and an exercise top. She's kicking back, but she's not at the beach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In fact, she's in an office, sitting on a chair. A NEWLY OPEN BAG OF KITTY LITTER sits next to a plastic tub she's got her feet in. Two FLOOR LAMPS stand like sentinels above her, blasting her with warm wattage. A fake palm tree casts the shadow across her body. She's pulled the earplugs out of her iPod -- back to the real world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens. Leaning into the room is JAMIE CLARK (20's), African-American. She's dressed in a flannel shirt, jeans. Carrie doesn't look entirely happy at the intrusion.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, a Professor Sapperstein needs to see you in biology. Said it's urgent.

Jamie leaves.

As Carrie gets to her feet, camera moves away from her, panning around the small office. Half-packed up boxes lay strewn about the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CALENDER hangs crookedly before a desk. Each day has been marked off with a large X. THREE DAYS REMAIN unmarked. Last space reads: WINTER-OVER, and in the space next to it, there's a cut out picture of a tropical beach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dart board is next to it with A PHOTOGRAPH pulverized with dart holes over the Bullseye. It's of a candy- striped pole topped with a silver ball, surrounded by international flags - the South Pole. Carrie is standing next to the pole, smiling at the camera, arm-in-arm with SAM MURPHY (30's). Looks like he's handsome, but his face is a little more obliterated than the rest of him.

We PICK UP CARRIE AND FOLLOW her as she strides down the icy, unmade street. Her hood is pulled up and she's not enjoying the cold.

LONG BENCHES are covered with ANTARCTIC FLORA - MOSSES, LICHENS and LIVERWORTS. They are being nurtured and studied by SCIENTISTS who look like homeless people - unkempt beards, bloodshot eyes and sun-damaged skin.

INT. MARSHAL'S OFFICE - MCMURDO - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Carrie enters. Walks by a mirror. Takes a glance. Is about to fix her hair, then stares at the reflection -- what's the point? We notice a slight scar on her right temple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She steps around the moving boxes to her desk, which is bare except for a thick BINDER labelled,`DAILY REPORTS'.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a seat, opens a binder and flips past dozens of empty pages reading "INCIDENT: None. ACTION TAKEN: None." On today's page she fills in the blanks with "Theft of botany sample." And "None."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pencil falls down onto the desk before her. Bounces. Then rolls off. She doesn't even flinch, or look up. Just stares unhappily at the binder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera tilts up -- several pencils are stuck into the cardboard tiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She closes the binder and puts it on the shelf beside a row of framed photos: Carrie in a Marshal's uniform graduation day; crisp, clean uniform. She and two other girlfriends, all smiles, at a bar -- she's got a birthday cake in front of her. Carrie on a beach somewhere, sitting in a chair, feet in the sand -- shaded by a palm.

Delfy slowly shakes his head, no.

People stop what they're doing, and focus on where the noise is coming from, which is --

The festive mood evaporates quickly as all eyes stay glued to the horrific state of Weiss' body.

<DIRECTION>
Carrie walks in. Rhonda has a phone to one ear, another in her hand. Looks stressed. She's hovering over one of the Techs who is sitting before a computer screen displaying Satellite Weather Imagery -- think Doppler. His focus is on a VAST STORM SYSTEM that is heading toward ASB, which is marked in RED NEON. Other stations are marked as well.

EXT. VOSTOK - DAY - ESTABLISHING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Squat Soviet-ugly buildings, some collapsing, others with boarded up windows, are barely visible through the driving ice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STORM LINES of different colors interconnect all the buildings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie and Delfy, wearing full ECW gear, lean hard into the wind, making their way towards the compound. She's carrying a duffle bag. Can barely see the Twin Otter behind them.

INT. VOSTOK - HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie leads the way up a decrepit, dimly-lit hall strung with exposed pipes and wiring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gaunt, malnourished faces look up from the rooms they pass. All stare. Silently. Looks more like death row.

INT. VOSTOK - OPERATIONS ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie enters a grungy operations room that never made it out of the 70's: ancient computers and steel-cased radios fill one wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One man welds equipment off to the side. Four more Russians sit at a table playing cards and drinking Vodka.

They all take their time looking her over.

<DIRECTION>
Carrie hoists her duffel bag on the table and unzips it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yuri pulls it open. It's packed with steaks. The Russians react with smiles and the mood lightens. Yuri's grin widens further. Takes out a porno -- there's a Cheerleader on the cover.
</DIRECTION>
<YURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister Mooney, yes. I remember now. He offers pay us to fly him off Antarctica on our transport. We give him very good price - because plane leaves a week ago!

INT. VOSTOK - COAT ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie is suiting up in her ECW gear, rope harness and crampons. Her jacket's open. Delfy has a steaming cup of coffee in his hand. He looks to her gear belt; cuffs, pepper spray, baton...
</DIRECTION>
<DELFY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</DELFY>
<DIRECTION>
Delfy leaves as Carrie cranks the submarine-type wheel- lock in the center of the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM! The door is suddenly yanked from her grasp, slamming open against the building. Wind knocks her back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The storm sings in an even DULL ROAR. A solid white wall of wind-driven ice blows past. The light is oddly dim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRACK! The coffee mug Delfy left on the shelf, breaks in half, exposing a cylinder of frozen coffee. It rolls across the shelf, falls, and shatters on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie struggles back to the door and clips a three-foot tether from her harnesses to a RED STORM LINE attached to the side of the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She steps into the storm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WHITEOUT - THE LINE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie leans into the door, pushing it closed and locking the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two steps into the storm, the building behind her is gone. Step after step, there's nothing but the guide line and the ROAR of the storm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gust of wind lifts her off the ground. She's caught by her tether and smacked down on the ice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly regaining her stance, she pushes onward. Finally Carrie runs into something. It takes her a moment to realize she's at a building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs the wheel-lock and turns, breaking ice, opening the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unclipping from the line, she closes the door on the HOWLING behind her. Pulls off her mask. Teeth are chattering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She spins the wheel-lock of the door going out of the ready room into the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - HALLWAY - RIGHT AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie hits the lights: nothing. No power. Just a sliver of light stabbing in through a window.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(calling out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mooney? Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Only silence responds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hallway is long and dark, leading away from her in both directions. She draws a flashlight from her pocket. Thumbs the switch, sending a beam out through the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something doesn't feel right. Slides her baton out from her belt. She decides to go left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walking the hall, she tries door after door. Finally one gives.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mooney?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
She cautiously pushes it open: four stripped bunks in an empty room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moves on down the corridor -- hears COUGHING, like someone trying to clear their throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looks ahead, and determines it's coming from behind a closed door at the end of the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's confirmed when she hears it again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stops at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She slowly opens it --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now she can hear HEAVY, LABORED BREATHING --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Sweeps the inside with her light. It's a large lounge type room: scattered chairs, tables, and an overturned sofa on the other side -- where the heavy breathing's coming from. Another cough.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She enters the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE LOUNGE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inching forward, she gets to the sofa. Looks over it to see A BODY -- it's Mooney, lying in a pool of blood. Struggling to breathe through a puncture wound to his esophagus.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...My God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to him. As she kneels, he grabs her, GASPING for air, trying to tell her something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie catches a REFLECTION OF MOMENT behind her in his eyes -- someone's coming at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- She instinctively rolls back over Mooney just as -- WHAM! An ICE AXE swings down at her. Just misses her head by an inch, but the shaft nails her arm holding the baton that goes clattering across the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The killer, wearing ECW gear with hood and goggles, takes another swing. She lunges to the side. Axe misses her, but sinks into Mooney. Game over for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie slices the floor with her light, looking for the baton, but can't see it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The killer yanks his axe free of Mooney as Carrie bolts around the sofa, heading back out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie blows back into the hallway at a full tilt run, retracing her steps. Her light zigzags. The killer emerges a few beats later on a run. It's going to be close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Halfway down the hall, she hangs a hard right toward the Ready Room. Throws a glance over her shoulder -- he's right behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She targets the ready room door -- the orb of her light getting smaller and smaller as she nears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gets there. Doesn't even want to look back -- it's all or nothing. She pulls open the door --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - READY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Leaping in, she spins the wheel-lock closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMACK! The killer HITS THE DOOR from the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She SPINS OPEN the outside door wheel-lock, as the lock on the INNER DOOR behind her starts SPINNING OPEN at the same time. It's a race.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARRIE'S door slams open first and the wind hits her hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls on her mask and goggles just as the door behind her bursts open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WHITEOUT - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie jumps into the whiteout, catching the red storm line and clipping in as she staggers forward. Glancing back, she sees the killer in the doorway, then loses sight of him as she's swallowed in the whiteout.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She struggles down the line, buffeted by the storm, but HER HAND ON THE LINE moves erratically -- He's on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She swivels a nervous whirl to see -- the Killer materializing out of the whiteout right behind her. He's clipped into Carrie's line. He raises the axe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He swings. She jumps back, losing her footing. Hits the ice hard -- face first. The killer towers over her, raising the axe again. Carrie drives her heel into his knee, knocking him off balance. He drops next to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches for Carrie, grabbing her mask, pulling it off. She cries out as the FREEZING WIND catches her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The killer gets to his feet and delivers a rib-cracking kick, flipping Carrie onto her back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND FADES from Carrie's world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is nothing but her strained BREATHING. The killer draws back the axe, shiny with frozen blood. He swings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie UNCLIPS her harness from the tether. THE WIND grabs her, and Carrie SLIDES AWAY -- the killer disappearing from view behind the swirling wall of white.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sliding across the ice, Carrie SLAMS into a pole. Grabs on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WHITEOUT - POLE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cinching her hood down, she searches the storm with no idea which way to go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie glances up the post. Barely visible through the blowing ice are signs pointing different directions: "Moscow 17,030 Tokyo 13,329 Fiji 7,877 Los Angeles 15,641"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls herself up and heads out, leaning into the wind. Carrie staggers blindly, trying to protect her face. Falling, she gets up, and struggles on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her drunken gait increases as she continues to lose heat. A rope catches her in the neck. It's another storm line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WHITEOUT - SECOND LINE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie lurches forward, holding the line with one arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, she bumps into something. It moves. It turns to face her. IT'S THE KILLER AGAIN. He swings. She deflects the blow with her free arm, and manages to grab the axe head. The killer tears the axe free, taking Carrie's glove with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He swings again, but Carrie pulls hard on the rope, throwing him off balance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The axe cuts through the line. The killer hits the ground, and is immediately ushered away in the wind, as Carrie, clinging to the rope, slides over the ice like a pendulum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The line goes tight; she's jerked to a stop. It takes everything she's got to get to her feet. She slowly struggles up the line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT/INT. STORAGE SHED - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More dead than alive, Carrie stumbles against the door and grabs the wheel-lock with both hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unable to bend the frozen fingers of her left hand around the wheel, she struggles to turn it. Finally it gives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door swings wide and she stumbles in. But she's caught; her bare hand frozen to the metal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ripping it free, her SCREAM is lost to the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie falls, collapsing against the door. Blackout
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH CUT TO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL 6 - BATHROOM - NIGHT (CARRIE'S MEMORY HIT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A single bulb above casts a cone of light down onto Carrie, who's leaning against a sink, staring at herself in a mirror. She looks stressed. Her Marshal's badge dangles around her neck. Wears a shoulder harness. The bathroom door behind her is open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She catches a REFLECTION of a shadow moving across the room behind her. Body tenses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she turns --
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
No answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She withdraws a 9mm from her harness -- eases toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gun ready, she rolls her back around the jam -- WHAM! Carrie's blindsided by a fist that drives her into the other door jam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before she can recover -- a guy, dark eyes, unshaven, grabs her by the hair and runs her head first into the bathroom mirror. SMASH. It's brutal. Shards fall into the sink, as Carrie's RIGHT TEMPLE goes bloody. She drops to the floor --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARRIE'S POV - A BLURRY FIGURE stands over top of her. She's still got some fight in her -- hands lash out in a frenzy, like a cat in water.

Carrie slowly settles, then she's out again.

TIME CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - VOSTOK - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's lying on a table, wrapped in blankets. An old, WRINKLED FACED RUSSIAN MAN slowly lowers her wounded hand -- pale white and missing some skin, back into a tray of water next to her. Her silver ring glistens under the florescent lights. A HUGE BRUISE runs across her arm.

As she starts to sit up, he protests, saying something in Russian. She ignores him. He walks away, mumbling something else.

She sits up. Lifts her hand out of the water -- fingers are slow moving.

Delfy and Carrie, with her hand bandaged, both slice the dark with flashlights. She's starting to get her bearings back.

He lets it go.

Same as before. Carrie goes to the over-turned sofa. Moves her light around -- searching. Passes over the blood on the floor.

<DELFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Until I met you, I hadn't seen any dead people. Now I'm at two.

Carrie gets on her knees -- looks under the sofa. Low angles her light. Something reflects. Reaches in. Retrieves her baton --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OUTLYING BUILDING - HALLWAY - RIGHT AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as Carrie and Delfy leave the lounge, her perifocal vision picks up a wisp of light from a flashlight, which bled out from a door's threshold halfway down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Delfy's eyes go wide -- Carrie's finger goes to her mouth - Shhhhh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She instinctively pulls her baton with her left hand, but it hurts. She shifts it to the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns off her light. Delphy does the same. Motions for him to stay put.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She heads to the source, keeping her baton ready and her back tight to the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gets to the edge of the door. It's open just slightly -- looks in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sees a man in an ECW jacket with his back to her, holding a flashlight in one hand and digging through a duffle bag with his other. Items are strewn. Another bag has been completely turned inside out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She enters. Baton cocked.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Delfy's Twin Otter has landed beside the camp. There are TWO BIG TENTS and some scattered equipment - a SNOWCAT, a CHEST of TOOLS, DRUMS of GASOLINE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sky is dark with clouds and the wind MOANS. A haze of wind-driven snow whips by.

Carrie, Pryce and Delfy climb out from the plane and make their way toward the tents. Place looks deserted.

EXT. FIRST TENT - DELTA ONE ONE - CONTINUOUS

Carrie peers in. It's too dark to see anything. She goes to pull out her flashlight with her left hand -- stops herself. Reaches in with her right, extracts it from her pocket. Turns it on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FIRST WORK TENT - DELTA ONE ONE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her FLASHLIGHT BEAM plays over a litter of personal effects, then picks up a TRAIL OF BLOOD leading to a cot between two others. Someone is huddled in a yellow sleeping bag on it. Her body tightens.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rubin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
She steps into the tent. Moves to the cot. There's a pool of blood underneath. Her heart pounds. She uses her flashlight, touches the sleeping bag. It doesn't move. She pulls at it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and discovers A PAIR OF ECW PANTS -- the LEFT LEG is soaked in blood. No corpse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She steadies her breathing. She pulls out a small baggie from her pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Uses the end of the flashlight to chip away a frozen blood sample from the pant leg. Puts it in the baggie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Takes out her camera next. Starts snapping. Flash goes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECOND WORK TENT - DELTA ONE ONE - RIGHT AFTER

Carrie enters with Delfy. Place is lit by a single dim bulb. This is a work space; two tables, instruments on top. Sample containers piled everywhere. Numerous photos of meteorites are stuck to a board.

She finds Pryce reading the crew's DAILY LOG.

Delfy's drawn to a BIZARRE LOOKING PIECE OF EQUIPMENT; it's a red box on wheels with a handle like a lawn mower. A circular antennae sprouts from the front of the box.

FLASHING POLICE REDS reflect off the glass of the front doors of a hotel. Several squad cars are nosed up to the entrance.

Patrons and bystanders are perched in various locations, watching as A HANDCUFFED Carrie is escorted outside by two uniformed officers. Her eyes are full of tears.

She's put into the backseat of one of the cars. As the door closes, she stares out the window where Coroners are loading a body under a sheet into the back of their truck.

Delfy pulls to a stop. They exit the cat.

EXT. ICE FIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All three get cold-cocked by an invisible wind. Carrie steps away from the Cat. Pryce does too.
</DIRECTION>

Her eyes scan the ice with cool appraisal. It's completely flat. Desert like.

Carrie ignores him. Walks further away from the cat. Ice CRUNCHES UNDER HER FEET as she keeps looking -- then, she stops. Something's not right. Looks DOWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kneels to the ice. Scoops some up. Checks it out. Perplexed. Pryce approaches from behind.

<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is shaved ice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
She gets to her feet. Walks further -- her eyes now paying close attention to the texture of the ice. After a dozen steps, texture changes. Ice is now smooth -- like it's supposed to be.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns around. Tries to get the bigger picture. Looks at the ground all around her. Realizes a large area has been blanketed with shaved pieces of ice a few inches thick --
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They were digging, Pryce. And they tries to spread the ice to hide it.

She heads back across the area. Scans the horizon. Takes another step forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOSH! In an instant, Carrie's gone! DISAPPEARS below the ice. Only a four foot wide hole remains, that was covered up with a white, iced-over tarp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pryce and Delfy move toward her -- each hesitating slightly, unsure of their own footing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pryce gets to the hole. Looks down. Carrie is precariously dangling in an ICE SHAFT that slopes at a slight angle. She's managed to grasp a protruding piece of ice, but she's fighting the pain in her left hand to hold on. It slips off. Below her -- nothing but darkness.

INT. ICE SHAFT - SAME

Darkness. A flashlight clicks on. Reflects off a wall of ice with a frozen blood trail leading up. Carrie gets to her feet. Sees that she's in a small dug out area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she slowly turns to get her bearings, her light falls on an ESCAPE HATCH of some kind, maybe three feet high.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie shines the light to her feet. The ground beneath her is metal.

INT. ICE SHAFT - RIGHT AFTER

<DIRECTION>
Pryce, with a flashlight in hand, lowers himself down a rope to the bottom of the shaft where Carrie waits. Delfy follows. Both take in the discovery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie moves over to the hatch. Pulls on it. Opens easily. She and Pryce hit the interior with their lights. Find themselves staring into...AN AIRPLANE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CARGO BAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Off their lights -- every surface scintillates with ice crystals from the frozen atmosphere, undisturbed except for recent tracks of footprints filing in and out -- they go forward and aft, disappearing into darkness. Place is tomb silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Twisted, and strewn with large containers scattered at odd angles -- victims of an intense IMPACT. The plane is pitched up at the nose, making their footing precarious.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cargo plane, but I don't recognize it.

<DIRECTION>
Carrie shuffles her way forward into the darkness, heading for the cockpit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something BRUSHES her leg. She spins. Shines her light - - which illuminates a HAND, fingers in a clawed position - - as if in excruciating pain. She whips her light past the hand, up the arm -- captures the FACE of a man staring at her! It takes a moment to realize -- he's dead, pinned between two large metal crates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Delfy stands still. Staring. Carrie throws a look back over her shoulder --
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess that makes three.

</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
She continues on with Delfy staying close. Her light targets the cockpit door. It's closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COCKPIT - RIGHT AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie pushes the door open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beam of her light reveals frozen blood SPLATTERED across a SHATTERED WINDSHIELD -- chunks of ice protruding through it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Continues over three dead men in flight suits still strapped into seats, their broken bodies and ghastly expressions perfectly preserved. Each have a sidearm holstered around their waist.
</DIRECTION>
<DELFY>

<DIRECTION>
INT. CARGO BAY - RIGHT AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trailing her beam of light, Carrie and Delfy climb through a thick wall of nylon webbing. Enter a cluttered cargo area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ransacked Antarctic gear is strewn everywhere in a tangle of ropes and crampons, old ECW gear, and boxes of supplies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dipping into a case of bottles, Delfy pulls one free, sniffs, and drinks.

Carrie continues through the hold. Her FLASHLIGHT BEAM flickers over more chaos of the crash. HUGE STEEL TANKS TAKE UP MOST OF THE MID-SECTION.

	And by the looks of that safe, must've been transporting something pretty important.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie moves in closer. Sees that the cage has been breached.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Part of it has been damaged by the crash and this weakness has been ruthlessly attacked by the previous intruders until they forced an opening. Discarded tools litter the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<PRYCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They put some serious work into this.

There's a pool of frozen blood near the opening -- where one of the torn, jagged bars of the steel cage is covered in blood --
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>

	Whoever got hurt, they dragged him out of here. There's blood all over the tunnel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
She uses her light to examine the interior of the safe more closely -- the frost on the shelves exposes SIX ROUND RUST RINGS where containers have been removed. Each one roughly measuring a foot tall, four inches wide.

The PLANE SUDDENLY TREMBLES.

CRASH! -- the unmistakable sound of FALLING ICE.

CRASHCRASHCRASH! More ICE.

They scramble back through the darkness, the flashlight beams swinging wildly about the hold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MORE ICE FALLS. It's getting louder as they're getting closer to the source.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie targets ahead with her light -- illuminates the hatch as A LOAD OF ICE DROPS IN covering it completely. Light fades.
</DIRECTION>
<DELFY>

The continual sound of falling ice grows MUFFLED and DISTANT.

INT. PLANE - AT THE HATCH - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHIPCHIPCHIP! Ice is flying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Things are desperate as a single flashlight beam propped up on a crate, illuminates Carrie, Delfy and Pryce hard at it -- frantically chopping away at the ice filled hatch with pieces of scrap metal from the plane. Efforts are big-- but the progress minimal.
</DIRECTION>
<PRYCE>

	This isn't going to work, it's like digging through concrete with a spoon.

<DELFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way. I'm not going out like this. No way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELFY>
<DIRECTION>
The light from the flashlight slowly begins to fade. Carrie goes over to the crate, slaps it against her leg, trying to get more juice going. Still fading. Light goes out --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Screen goes black. Can't see a thing. A second later, ANOTHER LIGHT KICKS ON -- Pryce is holding it. Hands it over to Carrie --
</DIRECTION>
<DELFY>
<DIRECTION>

Carries mind whirls with her lack of options, then --

<CARRIE>

	What about the Vodka -- we could make some torches, maybe melt the ice?

Pryce knows she's right.

Delfy looks to them both. Desperate.

<DELFY>

</DELFY>
<DIRECTION>
Pryce heads to the back, his body becoming barely visible in the dissipating range of light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie takes a six-inch, pearl handled Buck knife from a pocket, unfolds it-- starts cutting the liner of her coat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Delfy moves to a nearby wooden crate. Goes to lift it, but it's frozen to the floor. Stomps on it. It breaks. Pulls pieces from the siding for torch sticks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pryce comes back with a couple bottles. Stops dead in his tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie looks over to see him staring at two LIFE JACKETS attached to the wall near the hatch. He's thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves to Carrie --
</DIRECTION>
<PRYCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold these.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRYCE>
<DIRECTION>
He exchanges the bottles for her flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shines the light to the ceiling as he heads toward the back, leaving Carrie and Delfy getting swallowed in the dark.

</DIRECTION>
<PRYCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Found it!

Carrie and Delfy get to Pryce. They follow his beam straight up to expose an ESCAPE HATCH in the roof of the fuselage.
</DIRECTION>
<PRYCE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With the angle of the plane, I don't think we're that far from the surface. Give me a hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRYCE>
<DIRECTION>
Pryce moves to a large crate -- starts to push it over. They join, sliding it over below the hatch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He jumps up onto it -- examines the hatch area.
</DIRECTION>
<PRYCE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are explosive bolts. If we blow the hatch, maybe it'll smash a hole up through the ice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRYCE>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or, if the ice is too thick the blast will come right back at us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<PRYCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can be blown up, suffocate or freeze to death. Take your pick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRYCE>
<DIRECTION>
Pryce hands Carrie the flashlight. She targets the hatch area as he opens an electrical panel beside it; a crisscrossing maze of wires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he reaches up to examine the wiring, Carrie catches a GLIMPSE of a SHOULDER HARNESS under his liner.
</DIRECTION>
<PRYCE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This could work -- give me the battery from your phone.

As he looks down, Carrie masks her discovery. Hands over her phone. He extracts the BATTERY.
</DIRECTION>
<PRYCE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	When I connect these two wires, hopefully there's going to be a big bang. May want to take some cover.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRYCE>
<DIRECTION>
Pryce is nervous himself as he places one selected wire onto the battery, and prepares for another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks to Carrie and Pryce who have backed up against the fuselage.
</DIRECTION>
<PRYCE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRYCE>
<DIRECTION>
Delfy nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie is still running that shoulder holster through her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pryce touches the last wire to the battery. Nothing happens. Hope freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pryce tries again --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- KA-BOOM! The hatch EXPLODES INWARD, ricocheting around the inside of the cargo hold like a giant bullet coming in and out of their light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLAM, SLAM, SLAM, until...WHAM, it buries itself edge-on, halfway into the fuselage, missing Carrie by a hair's width.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stand there, deafened and stunned, then a shower of ice rains into the plane where the hatch used to be and a THIN SHAFT OF LIGHT DROPS into the cargo bay like a gift from God.
</DIRECTION>
<DELFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hallelujah --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELFY>
<DIRECTION>
Pryce drops down. Moves to another crate.
</DIRECTION>
<PRYCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Delfy, help me with this. We'll need to get up higher.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRYCE>
<DIRECTION>
Delfy moves forward to help. The two of them push it over. It's a strenuous lift to get it on top of the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as they finish, Pryce turns to find himself facing Carrie holding one of the RUSSIAN'S GUNS TO HIS FACE.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move.

	Listen to me -- Forty eight hours ago, we picked up chatter between someone down here and Tahir Soufian, a black market trader in New York. It was all about setting up a buy for cannisters found in an old Russian transport buried in the ice.

	Damn, I knew that government eavesdropping was true.

</DELFY>
<PRYCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's been rumors for years that the Russians had a second base -- a secret weapons research facility under the ice that supposedly blew up in the late sixties -- nothing was ever confirmed. The fact is, before the treaty in `72 they were strip mining all over the place down here -- we believe for uranium and other specialized minerals for weapon's use. It was the Cold War. No one knows half the things the Russian's were up to. This plane could be the link between rumor and truth. And if it is true, what's in those cannisters could be a prelude to another terrorist attack.

Delfy wriggles out from the hole. He reaches back. Helps Carrie to the surface. Pryce follows.

She's trying to put on a clean flannel over a T-shirt, but can't button it up with only one hand. Her frustration mounts as she fights back every bit of emotion that's trying to get out.

She finally gives up -- kicks over a nearby chair that sweeps the stuff off her bed. Bag and gun go flying.

Carrie slumps to the floor. Silent tears.

Next thing I knew my face was being rammed into a mirror. My own partner was trying to kill me. Turns out the whole bust was a set up from the start.

Rubin shoves her aside, throwing her against a chair. She topples backwards.

He whips open the door, driving an unexpected shoulder into Doc, who gets nailed so hard, he goes stumbling back up against the wall behind him. Takes the wind right out of him. Pills all over the floor.

INT. SCIENCE BUILDING - RIGHT AFTER

Carrie enters through the connecting tunnel's doorway. Not a lot of light. Slows her pace. It's quiet. Dormant. Vacant lab stations. Room's been shut down for the winter. Eyes scan. Fall upon --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- A DOOR ACROSS THE ROOM. A sign above reads: READY ROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes off again, slaloming her way around the lab stations to get to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OTHER SIDE OF ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie gets to the door. Pulls on the handle. Won't open. Rattles. Looks in through a viewing window -- sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- a panicked Rubin inside, grabbing ECW gear off a rack mounted to the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DIGITAL READOUT ABOVE THE EXIT DOOR READS: -60.

He and Carrie exchange glances.

He shakes his head.

She tugs harder on the doors. Stuck. Looks through the window to see he's tied them together with some climbing rope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In that same instant a shaft of brilliant daylight floods half the room as the outside door is whipped open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN in full ECW - stands in the doorway. He's wearing a FACE MASK and GOGGLES. Holds an ICE AXE poised, ready to strike -- it's the same guy who attacked her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rubin bolts back toward the door separating he and Carrie, but --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- SWOOOSH! THE ICE AXE is buried into his shoulder, gaffing him like a fish. The pain's excruciating for Rubin, who spins on his attacker like a wild man. BULLDOZES into him, driving him back out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both TUMBLE down a steep set of stairs -- the exposed end of the ice axe gets stuck in a step's steel meshing on the way down -- rips out of Rubin's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. READY ROOM - BASE OF STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

<DIRECTION>
Rubin eats the pain as he gets to his feet. Takes off. Runs blindly with panting intensity verging on hysteria. Disappears around the contour of ASB before the other guy can get to his feet.

His assailant rises. Goes back up a couple steps to retrieve his embedded ice axe, but finds it wedged so tight, it won't budge. Abandons it.

Rubin staggers as he follows a line of storage bins tucked against the base of the main building. The blood from his wound already frozen on his shirt.

He looks over his shoulder -- gets a BLURRED IMAGE of his attacker not far behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rubin trips. Hands go to the icy ground to protect his fall. Still hits hard. Starts to get up, but his palms are frozen to the surface. Doesn't have time to care -- pulls hard, tearing the skin right off. Stands. Spins around in a panicked whirl -- he's lost ground.

The guys -- oblivious.

EXT. READY ROOM - STAIRS - DAY

Carrie and Pryce, now bundled up in ECW, exit the room and head down the stairs. Split up -- go opposite directions around the complex.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UNDERNEATH ASB - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rubin's pace is slowing -- he's exerting himself to get to the people as they climb into snowmobile with the container. Frostbite is chewing up his lungs. He's too slow, they take off. He coughs up blood.
</DIRECTION>
<RUBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	W..wa..wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUBIN>
<DIRECTION>
He turns around to check on his pursuer. Twenty feet away and closing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rubin's eyes desperately search for some kind of weapon -- anything. Sees the insulated hose on the SNOW MELTER. Heads for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ASB - OTHER SIDE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie passes a gap between storage containers where several snow shovels are stuck into a mound of snow -- through their vertical slats, SHE CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF RUBIN at the Snow Melter across on the other side of the main building. Sees the ECW guy closing in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ASB - UNDERNEATH - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pryce is moving under ASB. Passes a hydraulic support leg. Spots Carrie on the other side moving toward Rubin. Also sees the ECW guy in pursuit. Heads toward them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ASB - SNOW MELTER - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rubin's frostbitten hand reaches for the hose. Grabs it, but he doesn't have the strength to turn it on. Throws a defeated glance over his shoulder to see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- THE VILLAIN in ECW gear right on him! Shoves Rubin against the tank. Grabs the hose from him. Turns it on - - SPRAYING him head to toe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rubin's clothes turn to ice. One eye freezes shut. Lips go cobalt blue. He tries to escape, but several stiff steps away, he slows and finally stops: a prisoner in his ice-locked clothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man moves to Rubin. Grabs his head, and - SNAP - breaks his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rubin's body topples stiffly to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OPERATIONS ROOM - ASB - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rhonda crosses the busy room. Reaches for a clipboard hanging next to the window. Something outside catches her attention.
</DIRECTION>
<RHONDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHONDA>
<DIRECTION>
She looks to Murphy, who is on the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Murphy and the others join her at the window. They see Rubin on the ground, but the Snow Melter blocks any view of the killer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
EXT. ASB - SNOW MELTER - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Killer turns to leave the crime scene and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- WHACK! He's blindsided by a SHOVEL to his head. Goggles shatter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie pulls his parka hood away from his head -- snaps the goggle from his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's KELLER!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blood trickles from the fresh wound to his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shovel's courtesy of Carrie, who stands over top of him. Holds the shovel to his neck like a guillotine blade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pryce approaches. Glances to Rubin's frozen body -- neck askew. Carrie is wound up. Keller's still recovering from the impact --

	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
She hands the shovel to Pryce, who puts it to Keller's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie pulls her Buck knife from her back pocket, then whips off Keller's gloves. Tosses them aside. The cold makes him more coherent. Sees Pryce at this throat.
</DIRECTION>
<PRYCE>

	Who's Tahir selling it to -- what's the intended target?

Keller shifts his attention to Carrie, who's using her knife to SLICE open his ECW jacket and pants, exposing bare arms and legs.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLER>

</KELLER>

Carrie grabs the hose from the Snow Melter.

She brutally stomps on Keller's exposed arm, douses him with water from the hose, welding his arm to the ground as it freezes instantly.

Keller begins to shiver violently.
</DIRECTION>
<PRYCE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Carrie releases more water, freezing more of the arm. He screams. Pain is too much. He caves.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The plane, they're in the fucking plane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLER>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie's suddenly grabbed from behind. It's Murphy. Furious. Two other guys at his side.

<MURPHY>

</MURPHY>
<CARRIE>

The two guys go to Keller, but his arm is stuck to the ground. Carrie kicks it free. It's painful. Keller screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guys lift him to his feet. Haul him away.

Murphy looks to Pryce --

</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Murphy looks to Carrie with an intense glare --
</DIRECTION>
<MURPHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't have time. We'll just search it in Christchurch when it lands.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURPHY>
<DIRECTION>
Pryce steps in --
</DIRECTION>
<PRYCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a twelve hour flight to Christchurch. Anything can happen in that time. Keller is here, so we know it's still on the ground. Once that plane is in the air, we've as good as lost it. Just give us 10 minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRYCE>

Murphy looks to Carrie, softens slightly --

<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam, do what is right here. Come on.

INT. LC-130 - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Carrie is near the cockpit, searching under a row of seats. Pryce approaches. A handful of ASB employees tear through every inch of the fuselage and cargo.
</DIRECTION>
<PRYCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's clean.

Carrie's suddenly chilled with the ominous reality that --
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's buying time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie races off the plane. Pryce tries to keep pace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR - RIGHT AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie is slaloming her way through the corridor, which is packed with ASB employees carrying their bags for the evac. Pryce is close behind.

</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
As the two of them take off for the door --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ASB - HANGAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Delfy walks across the floor. Hangar is minimally lit. Still. Silent. Void of personnel. The Otters are lined up. The Snowcats and snowmobiles on the other side. He heads toward an Otter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TWIN OTTER - HANGAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Delfy reaches in and gets his son's picture, which is still hanging on the console. Then, something catches his attention through the windshield of his plane. He sees a FUEL HOSE running to another plane -- and it's pumping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Curious, he gets out of the Otter. Eyes dart about the hangar. Doesn't see anyone. Heads to the other plane. Discovers that a door is open on the other side. Takes a another look around. Doesn't see anyone. Moves closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gets to the plane. Takes a look inside, and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUD! He's nailed with a giant Crescent wrench to the head. Stumbles back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keller leaps out, grabbing hold of a staggering Delfy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ruthlessly runs him head first into a standing tool chest. Delfy collapses to the ground in a heap. Unconscious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ASB - HEADING TOWARD THE HANGAR - RIGHT AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie and Pryce, dressed in ECW are making their way toward the hangar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LC-130 - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Employees are trudging up through the back entrance into the plane. Get checked off a list by the LOAD MASTER. Toss their gear into a netted cargo area. Find a seat. Plane is nearly full.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TWIN OTTER - HANGER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keller has the engine going. It's loud. Preps the console for flight, flipping switches -- suddenly sees Carrie and Pryce enter the hangar. Guns drawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARRIE AND PRYCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shift their attention to the plane. Blades turning. They stalk forward. Slowly. Carefully. Eyeing for any betrayal of movement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, with a nod from Carrie, they move in. Fast. Ready. Look into the plane. It's empty, except for a duffle bag in the back. Carrie nods to Pryce. Motions for him to go one way, she'll go another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT CARRIE AND PRYCE Carrie eyeballs a Snowcat. It's door is slightly open. She heads for it. Gun poised.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pryce moves to check the next plane. Eyes dart to every dark corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie gets to the Cat. Springs toward the door. Inside's empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pryce walks under THE WING of the next plane. Spots Delfy just ahead on the ground by the tool chest. Looks like he's stirring into consciousness. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SWOOSH!! An ICE AXE swings down from above, embedding in his Pryce's chest. Deep. It sticks. Gun goes flying. Keller drops down from the wing above. Pryce staggers. Keller kicks him hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pryce goes down. Keller grabs the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Points it right at Pryce -- before he can shoot --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG!BANG! Bullets zip by Keller, who rolls for cover behind SOME EQUIPMENT. Another rips into his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keller spots Carrie over by the Cat. She fires continually, forcing him to stay behind cover. The shots go wide -- she's not yet used to firing with the right hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keller blindly reaches his gun around the chest -- shoots back, which --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Gives Pryce enough time to painfully crawl for cover beneath the plane. He's losing blood quick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie keeps shooting. Bullets PING OFF THE TOOL CHEST. They stop. Carrie has to reload.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keller makes his move. Fires at Carrie and sprints for his plane. Runs right by pole with a large red button attached to it. Slams it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANGAR DOORS BEGIN TO RUMBLE OPEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TEMPERATURE immediately begins to PLUMMET as winter is let inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keller keeps shooting. Runs out of bullets. Leaps into the idling Otter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie makes her move. Dashes toward him, firing away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bullets PLANT in the WINDSHIELD, but can't penetrate -- glass is too thick -- protection from the cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keller throttles. Begins to move the Otter forward toward the opening doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie dashes to Pryce. Sees Delfy get to his feet. Face bloody. He moves to Pryce.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gets over to the guys quickly, giving Delfy a visual once over. He'll be fine, but things look bad for Pryce. He's bleeding profusely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She kneels beside him -- pulls the tip of the axe out of his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Delfy looks to the hangar doors, which are nearly open.
</DIRECTION>
<PRYCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I didn't see him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRYCE>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes flutter shut. Carrie slaps his face --
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! You stay awake!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Puts her hand directly on the wound. Applies pressure. Blood continues to ooze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks over to Keller just as his plane exits the hangar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looks back to Pryce's wound -- won't stop bleeding.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS

Carrie rips open Pryce's jacket and liner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scoops up an armful of wind-blown ice. Starts packing it around him. Keeps repeating the motion.
</DIRECTION>

She keeps shooting looks to Keller's departing plane moving toward the runway.

Carrie stands. Determined. Sprints back into the hangar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a full sprint, Carrie dashes over to the Snowmobiles. Coughs. Spits blood. Doesn't stop her. She jumps on one. Fires it up. Uses her left palm to steer -- blood starts to seep through the gauze. She quickly bundles up, then guns it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rubber treads grip. Smoke rises. She races it across the cement floor and out the hangar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HANGAR - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Off in the distance, Keller's heading for the front of the runway -- has to turn around to take off into the wind.

Carrie veers off, targeting the tunnel to ASB. Hits her light as she races in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

<DIRECTION>
INT. KELLER'S PLANE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Desperation clings to his face as he turns the plane onto the runway. His wound oozes blood -- eats the pain as he gives it full throttle. Starts to pick up speed. Heads down his strip of freedom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDE OF RUNWAY - OPPOSITE END - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A funnel of bumpy light spreads across the ice before Carrie on the snowmobile.

She holds tight as she burns a big U-TURN around one of the berms and onto the runway. Heads straight for the lights of Keller's plane.

<DIRECTION>
She targets him like a Japanese zero. Hundred yards and closing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's pushing to get airborne. Seventy-five yards between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gap narrows fast. Fifty yards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stay on Carrie. Looks like suicide. She suddenly swerves a hard left, disappearing behind a berm --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE WITH KELLER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He bears a momentary sense of triumph, starts to get airborne -- until -- LAUNCHING UP OFF THE BERM is Carrie's snowmobile! She bails, letting it continue right toward him like a heat seeking missile as she tumbles down the berm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keller's pov - a THOUSAND POUNDS of snowmobile comes at him fast -- obliterates the cockpit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH CUT TO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARRIE'S POV - AS THE IMPACT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cripples the plane, pitching it sideways. A wing catches the runway, CATAPULTING the entire plane into a cartwheel of disaster as it veers off the runway and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- EXPLODES INTO A FIERY ERUPTION OF FLAME AND DEBRIS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Resume -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie slowly gets to her feet. The flames reflecting off her goggles. She heads to the wreckage. The cold and blowing snow extinguishing the flames quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE WRECKAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie approaches. Only a sputtering of flame remains on the front of the twisted remnants of the Otter's cockpit. The aft seems relatively intact. Carrie looks in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sees the charred and already frozen remains of Keller. In the back -- the charred duffle bag. She moves closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reaches in through a broken window. Pulls it out to the runway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unzips it. Is confused. No cannisters. Only survival gear.

The guy heads for it.

Camera stays on the fast moving storm, the plane, nowhere in sight, until --

A SQUEAKY NOISE in the back of the room draws their attention. It's Doc coming through with the cart -- a bodybag on top.

She sees it's Weiss' name on the tag, but something disturbing catches Carrie's eye -- it's Weiss' LEFT LEG pressing against the bag. Although the plastic is clouded, she'd swear his LEFT CALF has a LONG LINE OF STITCHES running down the side.

She heads out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONNECTING TUNNEL TO SCIENCE BUILDING - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie slips in. We've been here before -- this is where she chased Rubin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darkness creeps in, phantom like, as the remaining daylight FADES OUT through the row of windows that run along the side. Carrie's plunged into inky black. WINTER HAS SET IN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She HEARS the Science Lab door open before her -- peers through the dark blanket to see Doc walking toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie slips in between two bookcases, trying to stay tight against the wall. Doc walks right by and out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She rises to her feet. Hurries down to the end. Disappears into the science building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie enters. Turns on the light. Illuminates the lab stations, and the busted open doors of the Ready Room. Heads for the freezer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WALK-IN FREEZER - SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie opens the door. Illuminates the interior with her light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storage racks of frozen science samples line the three walls. Lying on the floor are the bodies of Mooney, Rubin, Weiss and Keller.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carry goes to Weiss' body. Kneels next to him. Goes to unzip the bodybag, but sees that it's been locked with a plastic cinch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulls out her knife. Holds the light steady in her mouth as she cuts the cinch. Unzips the bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her light travels down his body to his left leg. She rolls it slightly for a better look. The truth hits her like a sledge hammer. There it is, like standing center stage in her light, the ROW OF STITCHES holding a deep gash tight together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's about to stand and walk out, but she stops herself. Thinks about that leg, those stitches. The fact that Doc lied to her. Pans her light over at the other bodies on the floor. Her light pans back, explores the rest of Weiss' upper body -- sees a dried river of blood that's run out from under his armpit.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someplace no one would ever think to look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
She raises Weiss' arm. More stitches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She cuts through them. Skin splits to reveal the BOTTOM OF A CANNISTER that's been stuffed inside his chest. She reaches in and pulls it out. Even has rust on the bottom. Carrie's confused -- IT'S NOT LIKE ANY OF THE CANNISTERS PRYCE SHOWED HER PHOTOS OF. It look more like THE ICE CORE CONTAINER SHE SAW AT MCMURDO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She contemplates opening it for a moment, then places her hand on the top. Begins to twist. It loosens easily. Pulls the lid off. Looks at it. Whatever it is, it's frozen. Tilts the can slightly, and out slides a FOOT LONG ICE CORE SAMPLE. Can't quite figure it out, until she shines her light on it --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The freezer DANCES WITH GLISTENING LIGHT. The core sample is PACKED FULL OF DIAMONDS. She looks to the other two bodies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She opens Mooney's bag. Sees his chest is uneven -- more cylinders inside. Repeats the action with Rubin. Same thing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie slowly stands -- the betrayal almost too much.

	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then Weiss got cold feet. It got ugly, didn't it -- and Keller killed him at Delta One One. Everything went to hell after that, didn't it, Doc.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keller thought he could kill his way out of this whole thing.

He turns and walks out of the freezer.

INT. SCIENCE LAB - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie carefully follows. Sees he's heading for KELLER'S ICE AXE in the ready room, that someone's removed from being wedged outside, onto the now uprighted LAB CART Pryce used to bust open the door.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doc -- stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
He does. Turns back to her. But there has been a subtle shift inside him -- something illogical.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll cut you in, Carrie. There's at least 5 million in diamonds in there. That can buy both of us a nice life back in the world. How many times have we both talked about having a fresh start. Well, this is it. Those beakers finding that plane was a sign. A sign telling me it was time to go back. Now I have something to go back for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
She has a realization.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no granddaughter, is there? This was about greed, plain and simple.

	No one will ever know. It's just me and you. We can take care of Pryce.

His callus disregard for human life rocks her.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, yes, now you're getting it.

<DIRECTION>
He turns back to the ice axe and starts walking towards it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls the gun out from inside her liner, her mind a whirl of limited options and grim solutions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He nears the ice axe on the cart --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie cocks back the trigger --
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't go through it again. Don't make me shoot you, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Her knuckle on her trigger finger goes white as she wrestles with her emotions.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's either ignore all of this or kill me -- and you and I, we're too good of friends for me to force you to make that choice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
With that...he walks right past the ICE AXE and into the READY ROOM. She's confused.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doc, your not thinking straight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
But he's not listening.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ya know, it's really warm. I'm gonna take a walk -- try and cool off.

<DIRECTION>
The TEMPERATURE GAUGE on the wall reads: -82.

He looks at her.

	Doc, please.

Carrie crosses the room as he grabs onto the outside door's latch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He musters a smile --
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember, Carrie -- freedom's just a sunrise away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
Using both hands on the latch, he pulls. THE DOOR BLASTS OPEN, filling the space between Carrie and Doc with violent winds and blowing snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doc's throws one last look to Carrie, then takes two steps out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Disappears into the blanket of white.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wind and cold storm into the room against Carrie, who remains standing still like a statue. Emotionally drained. Numb. Freezing to death -- tears frozen to her cheeks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shadow passes by her -- it's Pryce. He's hunkered over in pain, but forcing himself against the driving force of the wind into the Ready Room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Latches onto the door. It takes everything he's got, but he manages to get it closed. Instant silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cold to the bone, he grabs a jacket off the racket. Approaches Carrie, who remains staring at the closed door. The effects of the chill and Doc's decision apparent.
</DIRECTION>

Pryce wraps the coat around her shoulders. Gently leads her away.

Slowly widen -- to see Carrie and Pryce, kicking back on lawn chairs, side-by-side. Two heat lamps pouring out bright, warm light. A cut out piece of paper in the shape of a palm leaf is taped to one of the lamps -- throwing the shadow.
