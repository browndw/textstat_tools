EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING SHOT CLOSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a motorcycle coming fast -- straight for the camera. The rider -- wearing a black leather jacket -- is low over the machine, part of it, his face hidden behind large goggles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He roars in close, the cycle and the noise filling the screen for an instant, then overtakes the camera. Now we see twenty- five or thirty more cyclists following the first. They are all identically dressed -- leather jackets and goggles -- giving them the look of an anonymous, faceless, and frightening horde. They roar toward us, cutting recklessly in and out of traffic on the busy highway, singly or in groups of three or four. They overtake cars and each other, at great speed, gathering finally into a speeding, roaring mass. Over them, SUPERIMPOSED, appears the following title:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a story of shocking violence. It couldn't have happened in most American towns, but the fact that it happened in this one -- in this way -- is a stern warning that it must not happen again.

MOVING SHOT LOW ANGLE VERY CLOSE (PROCESS)

A motorcycle racing down the highway at great speed. The explosive roar of the motor segues into the opening music; SUPERIMPOSED over this FAST MOVING SHOT, appears the MAIN TITLE:

SERIES OF SHOTS UNDER CREDITS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cyclists, as they continue racing down the highway. When the road is clear of traffic for a moment, they move into tight formation. Then, suddenly, they break into small groups again to thread through traffic.

<DIRECTION>
Just as suddenly, they re-group again -- a solid, roaring mass.

EXT. ROAD APPROACH TO TOWN AND INTERSECTION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The troop of cyclists comes barrelling down the road, swerves into the main street of a small town, the CAMERA PANNING as they head straight for a crowded, busy intersection blocked to regular traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER SHOT TOWARD INTERSECTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An official A.M.A. race similar to the annual Catalina event is in progress. This intersection is the Control-Point and Finish Line, indicated by a banner. There are additional banners stretched across the street: "WELCOME AMERICAN MOTORCYCLE ASSOCIATION," "4TH ANNUAL CYCLE MEET," "WELCOME CYCLISTS -- SAFE WITH SAE OIL." A public address system is garbling constantly somewhere in the b.g., mostly drowned out by the noise of the machines. The timing officials and an Announcer are on a parallel, giving them a view over the heads of the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE INTERSECTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cyclists have headed directly into the middle of all this. As they are forced to slow down by the crowd, several white-uniformed officials and one or two cops step out quickly, shouting at them, waving them off. The rider in the lead hesitates momentarily, then veers off sharply into a side-street, the CAMERA PANNING as the rest of the group follows him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDE STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The newly arrived group of cyclists roars up the street -- past motorcycles backed into the curb in orderly rows. Finding an opening in front of a bar, the lead rider cuts in sharply, the rest following.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the cyclists park their machines quickly and start dismounting we are on the backs of their leather jackets. Each is lettered: "B.R.M.C.". Underneath these letters is painted a skull with goggles. Crossed under the skull -- in place of bones -- are piston rods. As a succession of these identical insignias stop in the f.g.,

EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAST CROWD SHOOTING UP THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some of the contestants come roaring down the straightaway, gearing down for the turn at the intersection. The crowd is pressing forward against the ropes. Eight or ten of the cyclists wearing the B.R.M.C. jackets move into the shot in the f.g., start shouldering their way to the front. They have taken off their goggles and helmets -- which are hanging around their necks or from their belts -- but we still do not see their faces. Several people in the crowd react with annoyance, but the boys crowd forward anyway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the front as the boys crowd up, some of them drinking from beer bottles. We see now that they are all fairly young -- eighteen to twenty-two. Each has his name lettered on the left breast of his jacket, big enough to be read in most scenes. They look rough and arrogant, ignoring the spectators they are displacing. Automatically, almost like a group of royal retainers, the group splits in two -- making a place for one of its members. This boy -- whose jacket says "JOHNNY" -- moves regally into the spot thus created for him -- and automatically into a fairly CLOSE SHOT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is just past twenty, handsome, rugged; the chip on his big shoulders is visible half a block away. Raising his bottle of beer, he looks off, almost bored.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHNNY'S ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cyclist comes into the turn too fast, spins off, unloads into a bale of hay. Efficient A.M.A. officials in white suits, wearing A.M.A. arm bands, step out quickly, keeping the crowd back, running out to give oncoming riders the caution flag. The rider and machine are untangled from the hay, the cycle dragged aside. The rider gets to his feet, dazed, walks around in circles. Spectators crowd around to stare. An official darts into the street to wipe up some spilled oil with a handful of hay.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(NOTE: Whatever dialogue we hear at this point is merely jargon, throw-away stuff -- for effect rather than sense. It is obscured and punctuated by the whine of the machines coming into the turn, gearing down, and the series of explosions as they come out of it and dig in.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FEATURING JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks toward all this with a kind of irritated condescension, nods, turns back into the crowd, the others following. A serious woman spectator gives them a look, moves into the spot just occupied by Johnny, making notations of some sort on a piece of paper. Meanwhile, something like the following can be understood over the P.A. system:
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rick Riley has developed trouble back in the hills! We'll know in a minute if it's serious. He is still two minutes, twenty seconds ahead of Art Wilson -- Two minutes thirty-two ahead of Freddie Orr. It's still anybody's race --

<DIRECTION>
The crowd edges a little closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FINISH LINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A racer tears around the turn and off. The Chief Referee steps into the street with his set of flags, unfurling the yellow and checkered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CROWD AT FINISH LINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny and his group re-appear, shouldering their way non- chalantly to the front again, through the densest part of the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (shouting over the noise)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- When the winner gets the checkered flag -- don't cross the street yet -- please! That doesn't mean the race is over! Some of these boys will still have a lap to go --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
As another racer grinds by, a girl beside Johnny leans out across the rope, yelling in a kind of crazy ecstasy:
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Al!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She yells something else, but it is drowned out. Johnny gives her a look, a tense superior sort of smirk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER SHOT ON JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He flicks his eyes as a series of racers pass -- each with the characteristic zarumpphf! zarumphf! zarumphf! The CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER as the sounds hit him, each one increasing his look of tense belligerence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT OF FINISH LINE

<DIRECTION>
As the first rider in gets the checkered flag, swerves off, and is enveloped by his retinue.

Johnny steps abruptly out of the shot, into the street. Somebody yells.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny has started sauntering casually across the track, his group trailing loosely after him. Several angry A.M.A. officials are running toward them, shouting at them, waving them back and then on across. The Announcer is screaming something incoherent over the P.A. System. We hear a cycle grinding down into the turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN OFFICIAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Swearing under his breath, he grabs up a flag and darts out to slow down the oncoming machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT FROM OFFICIAL'S PARALLEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a near-miss. The oncoming cyclist manages just in time to brake, swerve around Johnny's group. He almost crosses- up, but recovers and makes the turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The last of Johnny's group to get across is a wiry little toughie whose jacket says "MOUSE." He pulls himself quickly up on a telephone pole and shouts, mockingly:
</DIRECTION>
<MOUSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please! Don't cross the street! Don't get hurt! Blood makes the track slippery!

A couple of the racers step forward. They are serious, tired. The white patches around their eyes where their goggles protected them from the dust give them a weird, intense look.

Trying to ignore the baiting, they start to turn away.
</DIRECTION>
<CYCLIST_SPECTATOR>

	You want to see something, you want to see Johnny go. He really goes. He really screws it on. Arraaaaah!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DINKY>
<DIRECTION>
He makes the noise of screwing it on, banks away, his elbow cocked on an imaginary turn. Another of the boys, DEXTRO, approaches the official, continuing the needling.
</DIRECTION>
<DEXTRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, what do you get when you win one of these scrambles? Five thousand dollars? Hey, I'd like to win me five thousand dollars!

As the officials, fed up, are about to turn away. Mouse follows, fawning one of them, fingering the material of his white suit.

	Hey, wait a minute -- where can I get me one of these suits? I want to look like a street cleaner too --

A beat. Then, as the official turns, disgusted, to step past Johnny, he touches his shoulder. Johnny whirls with sudden violence, grabs him.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't push anybody.
	</DIALOGUE>

At the same moment, he hunches his shoulder, starting a blow. It never lands. A big arm is flung across Johnny's chest, blocking it. Furious, he snaps his head.

Another group of boys including PIGEON, Dextro and Gringo, merges into Johnny's contingent, the whole group flowing along the sidewalk. Pigeon moves close to Johnny, hands him one of the trophies we've seen in the shop window.

Johnny and his immediate group follow, rounding the corner. Just beyond, lined up at the curb outside the cheap bar, are their cycles -- big, beat-up Harleys and Indians. The remaining members of the club are here, tinkering with their machines, sleeping on them, fiddling with bed-rolls, etc. In the b.g. two boys are entertaining themselves with a rough slugging match.

This is at the far end of the line of cycles belonging to the B.R.M.C. Beyond are the cycles of an orthodox club.

<DIRECTION>
The other boys wait to see what Johnny is going to do. For the moment he just stands there. The cop crosses his arms to indicate he can wait all day. Then, suddenly, Johnny moves to his cycle, gets on, still holding the trophy under his coat, revs up his machine. The others in the group quickly follow suit. The cop wheels back to give them room. The whole line of cycles is now revved up, making a terrific din.

The group comes roaring down the highway, Johnny in the lead. The CAMERA PANS as he swerves off onto a side-road. The pack swerves off behind him.

FULL SHOT

<DIRECTION>
A mongrel dog ambles across in the f.g. In the b.g. one or two people stroll through. In this brief pause we get a feeling of quiet, peace, and dignity. Then we hear the cycles again -- a faint hum at first, growing quickly louder, until the troop of thirty riders pours into the street with a deafening roar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF REACTION SHOTS

Various local citizens pause in whatever they are doing, stop on the sidewalk, or step out of shops and stores, staring blankly at this sudden, noisy phenomenon.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

The driver of the old car loses control, skids around. In an attempt to avoid a collision, the cyclists swerve away, piling into each other, shooting off in all directions... There is a crash as the car ends up against a light pole. One cyclist comes bouncing up onto the sidewalk, still in the saddle, just avoids crashing through the window.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bleeker, Harry and the customers are already piling out into the street.

The window lettered "HANNEGAN & THOMAS". Thomas and Hannegan themselves emerge from the store, joining the crowd hurrying toward the scene of the accident.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM FULL SHOT OF THE CHAOS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One front fender of the car is crumpled into the pole, but it is still upright. Cyclists are trying to get out from under machines or scrambling around trying to cut them off. Others are just lying where they fell in the street, laughing like mad. Those who were left at the garage come tearing up on their cycles, everybody delighted.

<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathie emerges quickly from the crowd, her head down as if affected by what she has seen. As she steps up onto the sidewalk, heading for the cafe, JIMMY appears around the corner of the building. Jimmy is at least sixty-five, no taller than Kathie, pushed down rather than stooped; his expression is vague and constantly abstracted, a little foolish. He is wearing a cook's apron and is carrying a pair of pruning shears. His voice is a little high, but unexpectedly vigorous.

<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's all that, Kathie? What's all that?

	Over-stimulated. Jumping around --

LOW ANGLE JOHNNY AT CURB
</DIRECTION>

Johnny is squatting down, fiddling with the trophy on his front fender. Kathie's figure moves through the f.g. An instant later, Johnny looks up sharply, following her toward the door of the cafe with his eyes, intent, an aroused animal.

MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathie steps behind the counter, busies herself automatically with the coffee apparatus. A moment later the door opens and Johnny comes in, standing there, dangling the trophy carelessly at his side. Then he starts across -- a slow, swaggering, self-conscious saunter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he sits, deliberately, near Kathie, places the trophy down in front of him. Kathie hesitates, somehow disturbed by him.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
(finally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>

There is a beat -- as usual with Johnny -- before he answers. He scowls. Talking is painful for him.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure...

<DIRECTION>
(what else could he want?)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beer.

<KATHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beer's just in the bar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
She nods toward the bar. A flash of violent anger crosses Johnny's face, but he seems to control it with great effort, turns his head to look toward the bar, then back. He rises, starts for the bar, taking the trophy along. Kathie hesitates a moment before following him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT

<DIRECTION>
The bar is empty and unattended, of course. Johnny steps up, throws down some coins, places the trophy in front of him. Kathie comes around behind the bar, bringing up a bottle of beer, opening it for him, meeting his eyes for an instant, then turning away to return to the cafe. Johnny picks up the bottle and glass in one hand, the trophy in another, turns to follow her, the CAMERA PANNING.

As Kathie comes around behind the counter again. In the street beyond, cyclists and others are grouped around Harry and Bleeker, apparently arguing. Other cyclists have started racing off senselessly in all directions, or burning circles. Another small group is starting for the cafe. Johnny, having followed Kathie back, sits again, re-establishing the trophy in front of him, looks around.

<DIRECTION>
She nods, smiles a little wryly.

He thinks about that, glances around, frowns, wondering what to say next.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that what they give you -- in those races -- for killing yourself?

Johnny reacts sharply. His face works a moment, then:

<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want it, I give it you.

</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
She is pleased, but confused, picks it up and looks at it more closely, puts it down again.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, no... you can't do that. You won it... You have to get your name engraved on it -- or whatever you do...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(flustered)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's important to you. You wouldn't give something like that away, just like that... unless you knew a girl real well... and liked her...

A cyclist burning a tight circle in the middle of the street. The CAMERA PULLS BACK on a small crowd of local people watching the circus. In the b.g., Mildred and a customer, BETTY, come out of the shop. Mildred looks up. The two girls move into the f.g., stop, watching a moment. Mildred is visibly excited. She nods to Betty and they move on, the CAMERA PANNING to HOLD on two rather elderly men, who are both puzzled and fascinated:

<DIRECTION>
He has put his police cap between them on the bar; Johnny pushes it away from him. Harry reacts, but continues ineptly:
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got a job to do around here, but I'm not hard to get along with... It's usually just a misunderstanding -- I mean anything that develops into any kind of trouble...

Johnny tenses on "trouble," but refuses to look at Harry, jams a cigarette into his mouth.

<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It can be avoided most of the time -- if people sit down and talk it over...
	</DIALOGUE>

With this he has struck a match -- extending it to Johnny in his cupped hands. Johnny refuses it with an elaborate, don't crowd-me sort of gesture, pushing Harry's hands away, extracting the match and lighting his cigarette from it himself.

Johnny's flicker of reaction is cut short by the sudden roar of a motor, the sound exploding right on top of the scene. He pulls back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOWARD CAFE DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cycle -- driven by Gringo, with Crazy on the jump seat, one foot sticking out in a plaster cast -- jolts past the group onto the sidewalk. A cyclist coming out just barely has time to jump aside, holding the door, the cycle charging past him. Johnny and his group swarm in after it, laughing. There is, simultaneously, a concerted shout from inside.

A cheer goes up -- everybody talking at once, crowding around the cycle. Bleeker grins slowly, accepting the joke, starts filling the order. Harry glances at him, resumes his seat. A few intelligible phrases emerge from the bedlam as Johnny and his group come in from the cafe:

TOWARD STREET DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A flying wedge of cyclists, lead by Dextro, bursts through the door. They have rope and other props for a race. Several have improvised arm-bands with the word "Official" lettered on them. Dextro is waving a rag on a stick and shouting something. While he is climbing onto a stool in the b.g. the others crowd around Gringo and Crazy in the f.g.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. MAIN STREET

MEDIUM FULL SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is the same angle from which we saw the B.R.M.C. boys enter town. With a sudden roar, an entirely new group of cyclists swing into the street in single file.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rider in the lead comes abreast the camera, gearing down, slowing. The CAMERA HOLDS, PANS with him -- long enough to see that he is a fantastically-dressed character with a beard and dark glasses, some sort of big feather flowing from his hat. This is CHINO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The others come on by. They are each, in some way, outlandishly costumed. Some six or eight of the cyclists have girls on the jump seats, clinging to their backs. At this point, and from this angle, however, the girls -- in jeans and jacket and various screwy outfits -- are barely distinguishable from the boys.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT CHINO'S GROUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It has arranged itself in a rough semi-circle, the boys sitting their machines, enclosing the cycles of the Rebels' parked at the curb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT LOW ANGLE CHINO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the center of the semi-circle. His arms are folded. He is a very heavy men, almost fat, with big swollen hands. He is smiling a peculiar smile. The dark glasses, the feather sticking out of his hat -- make him look like a kind of frightening clown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the f.g., unmistakably attached to Chino's front fender, is Johnny's trophy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

She comes up, stops, then edges a little closer, curious, apprehensive.

	Hi-ya, sweetheart. What are you doing here in this miserable gully, Johnny, my love?

<DIRECTION>
Johnny steps toward him in his slow, insolent way, stops, looking off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny meets Kathie's eyes for a moment, seems to hesitate. A beat, then he continues to Chino; Kathie follows him with her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny moves to the front of Chino's machine, stops, looking from the trophy to Chino, who unfolds his arms, props his chin elaborately on one hand:
</DIRECTION>
<CHINO>
<DIRECTION>
(expansively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Johnny, I love you. I been looking in every ditch, Fresno to here, hoping you were dead --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with a wicked smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I looked for you in the race. I looked all over. I didn't see you race. I wanted to see my hot-shot boy scramble and win some gold... Wouldn't they let my boy scramble? Was my boy too tough?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHINO>
<DIRECTION>
KATHIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
interested, puzzled.

<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chino looks Johnny over carefully, solicitously.
</DIRECTION>
<CHINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Johnny, you look pale. You been taking care of yourself? You been staying out too late?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHINO>
<JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(hard; indicating trophy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's mine. Take it off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Without changing his expression, Chino leans forward a little, gives the trophy a pat.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Chino doesn't move. Johnny reaches out suddenly to grab the trophy. Chino gives him a vicious cut on the forearm with the side of his big hand. Johnny pulls back, furious, and swings on him. It's a solid blow. It knocks Chino backwards, half off his cycle. With no change in expression, Chino scrambles the rest of the way off, onto his feet, with surprising agility. He dives at Johnny, who is now trying to unfasten the trophy, envelopes him in a bear-hug, pinning down Johnny's arms. In a crazy rage, Johnny fights free, lets fly at Chino again. The blow lands on Chino's shoulder, sends him backwards. Chino -- still grinning, his dark glasses at a cockeyed angle -- spreads wide his arms in an expansive gesture of delight and admiration.
</DIRECTION>
<CHINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Johnny -- that's better -- I've missed you. Ever since the club split up, I missed you --

(with a wicked leer
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	and a wide gesture

	Everybody missed you. All the beetles missed you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHINO>
<DIRECTION>
SEVERAL CUTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
to members of Chino's group, looking toward the protagonists expectantly. We get a better look at the "beetles," the girls in their tight jeans, kerchiefs, black leather jackets. One of them, with a sad, sultry face, almost calls out; the word "Johnny" forms, but is not quite said.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chino moves slowly toward Johnny, cautious, grinning, his arms spread wide as if to embrace him.
</DIRECTION>
<CHINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Johnny, I love you. Let's have a beer -- then I'll beat the living Christmas out of you, Johnny --

</CHINO>
<DIRECTION>
As he steps forward, Johnny shoves him roughly back, starts to work the trophy loose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Recovering his balance, Chino suddenly assumes a ridiculous, wheedling, mendicant-like pose, comes sidling up with his hands clasped together.
</DIRECTION>
<CHINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Johnny, don't take that away from Chino. It's so beautiful. Chino needs it. It makes Chino feel good. It makes Chino feel like a big strong man --

For some reason, this hits Johnny hard; he pauses.
</DIRECTION>
<CHINO>

	Chino didn't win it, my boy. Chino just gleeped it. Chino gleeped it off a guy didn't win it either --

Johnny straightens up, furious, leaves the trophy dangling by a wire.

A suspended, thoughtful look on her face. Over her shoulder, Dextro waves the starter's flag, shouts:

trophy on her)

Dextro pushes importantly to the front of the group crowding around Chino:

She trails off, embarrassed. Johnny pulls his arm free, turns abruptly away. The CAMERA HOLDS AN INSTANT on Britches as she looks after him, confused and hurt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT JOHNNY

He reaches his cycle, jumps on, snaps down his goggles -- a look of maniacal intensity in his eyes -- kicks the starter. The machine roars and pops.

<DIRECTION>
This is a massed start, highly disorganized. Popping, revving up, cycles jockeying for position in the ragged line stretching across the street and up onto the curb... There are perhaps fifteen members of Johnny's group -- all helmeted and goggled -- and ten of Chino's -- identifiable by their weird costumes.

Dextro staggers out front, raises his starter's banner, whips it in the air, and almost falls down. There is a deafening concert of explosions.

A cyclist spins out on the turn. A couple of others pile into him. One of them rights his cycle, but can't get it started.

Johnny cuts in, takes Chino on the turn. There is a shout of "He got him!" The CAMERA HOLDS ON the turn as other cycles follow them around. One of them hares off at a tangent, up over the curb, right through a low picket fence.

<DIRECTION>
with Chino holding his lead -- Johnny a very poor second, tearing recklessly around the turns some two hundred yards behind. Members of Johnny's group look at each other. "What happened?" In the final shot, Chino enters the straightaway into the finish line. Johnny isn't in sight yet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAIN STREET (RANCH)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM FULL SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chino coasting into the stretch, heading for the "Finish" banner now stretched across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER SHOT ON CHINO (PROCESS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He glances back, slows down, and starts clowning. He stands up, tipping his feathered hat to the crowd on either side -- wobbles, loses control. He goes one way, the bike the other. The crowd parts, the machine bounding off, riderless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flat out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT CHINO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Picking himself up from the middle of the street -- still some yards from the finish. He starts after his cycles, stops suddenly, hearing a sound, looking back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHINO'S ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Here comes Johnny. Everybody is yelling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT CHINO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hesitates just an instant, calculates, decides to abandon the bike, takes off under his own power and starts hot-footing it ponderously for the finish line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM FINISH LINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chino scrambling for the finish -- Johnny bearing down on him. Chino makes it, just a few seconds before Johnny flashes past. Everybody starts shouting, closing in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cyclists and townspeople crowding around Chino, who clasps his hands over his head, fighter fashion, then starts looking around.
</DIRECTION>
<CHINO>
<DIRECTION>
(very winded, but delighted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's my gold? Where did that gorgeous little stake-holder go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHINO>
<DIRECTION>
He starts pushing his way through the crowd, the CAMERA PANNING. There are cries of "Here! Here!" He turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT KATHIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frightened, as Chino comes swooping down on her, arms outstretched.
</DIRECTION>
<CHINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come to Chino! Come to Chino, baby, you beautiful thing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHINO>
<DIRECTION>
All in one motion he lifts the trophy from Kathie's arm and kisses her on the forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
having overshot the finish and circled, he stops now, his group crowding around to congratulate him.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(abruptly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, let's blow this joint -- Wait'll I get back my gold --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
He heads his cycle into the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Johnny stops his machine, jumps off, rips off his goggles. Furious, he reaches for the trophy. Chino defends it, pushes Johnny away.
</DIRECTION>
<CHINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, Johnny, Chino won it -- Chino won the race --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHINO>
<GRINGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You won the flat-footed race -- you didn't win any sickle race --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRINGO>
<LOVER_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He crossed the finish first -- who says you got to cross the finish on a sickle?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOVER_BOY>
<DIRECTION>
During this, Johnny has come for Chino again, Chino has pushed him back once more. Now -- with sudden violence -- Johnny throws himself at Chino, knocking Chino backward and into the crowd near Kathie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chino shakes himself, a weird smile on his face, thrusts the trophy on Kathie again, and lunges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gringo, Lover Boy, and several others crowd forward, talking it up.
</DIRECTION>
<GRINGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right this way! Everybody right this way! We are not awarding the prizes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRINGO>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF FIGHT SHOTS JOHNNY AND CHINO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They both attack and retreat alternately, putting as much speed and weight behind their blows as possible -- so that it is a sort of ambulatory fight, rather than a stationary slugging match. Chino has more weight and is more durable perhaps, scrambling to the attack and then scrambling away -- like a stubborn, flat-footed bear. Johnny has more skill and more real savagery. He steps in quickly, delivers cutting blows, steps back. Chino reels after him, trying to tackle him, the silly pleased smile rarely leaving his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is INTERCUT WITH VARIOUS REACTION SHOTS of:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a. KATHIE, frightened, horribly fascinated, swept along with the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
b. CYCLISTS of both groups, watching in objective, stoical silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
c. TOWNSPEOPLE, children, and various characters already established.

</SIMMONDS>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't know. Don't know themselves probably. -- World situation --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Simmonds is pushed aside; Jimmy finishes the speech to nobody in particular. Nobody is listening.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>

</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</HANNEGAN>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>

</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
He turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT JOHNNY AND CHINO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny has knocked Chino backwards and is standing back waiting for him to get up. Chino sitting on the ground, trying to get his breath. Johnny just standing there, breathing hard, waiting. Lover Boy steps in, hands him a bottle of beer. He takes a swig, grins up at Johnny foolishly, his mouth bleeding.

</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make some room here, boys, I'm going out --
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
They just stare at him rudely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas comes around, gets in on the driver's side, starts the motor, honks, waves the cyclists aside. Inching forward, cramping his wheels, he manages to pull away from the curb. The cyclists refuse to give, just sit there as he barely scrapes by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulling out some ten or fifteen feet, Thomas is completely blocked by cyclists on their machines who have encircled the fighters.

<CHINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Johnny, I'll tell you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHINO>

<CHINO>

(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I'll tell you what we'll do --

</DIRECTION>
<CHINO>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; bellowing off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHINO>

<DIRECTION>
Harry reacts to a sudden burst of honking, shouting, starts off. The crowd around him surges forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHINO AND JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They react too. Chino gets to his feet. Johnny turns with him toward the center of the disturbance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT FRONT OF THOMAS' CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tremendous confusion, shoving, and angry shouting. Whatever happened -- there is now a cyclist (MEATBALL, Chino's group) on the ground in front of the car, his cycle knocked over and partly under one of the front wheels. Cyclists are diving in helping Meatball up, pushing Thomas' car back to free the crushed cycle, yelling; another group has descended angrily on Thomas himself, shouting at him, trying to open the door and pull him out -- Thomas yelling back, trying to defend himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KATHIE

HARRY

SHOT FEATURING CHINO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
diving into the center of the brawl, not asking any questions. He thrusts aside the boys trying to get at Thomas, grabs him himself, hauls him from the car -- gives him a couple of solid cuffs that send him reeling aside.
</DIRECTION>
<CHINO>
<DIRECTION>
(exhilarated; to Red)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd he do?

<DIRECTION>
OPPOSITE SIDE OF THOMAS' CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it comes up on two wheels, teeters an instant, then topples over onto its side -- the crowd scrambling back out of the way, a woman dragging a child back by the hand, just in time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry diving into the middle of the group of boys man-handling Thomas, shouting at them, pushing them aside.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right! All right!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>

Flailing about him, he manages to break it up. Cyclists and local men start pressing in from all sides -- everybody yelling at everybody else.
</DIRECTION>
<GRINGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Harry, hey Chief -- you seen him try to run Meatball over --?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRINGO>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas, dishevelled, apoplectic, gets into it, too.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
(whirling angrily on Gringo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody ran anybody over! He ran his motorcycle into the front of my car --
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<CHINO>
<DIRECTION>
(getting into it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then that sickle just crawled right in under your front wheel -- all by its little self --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHINO>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas whirls on him, his face close to Chino's distorted with rage.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harry, I want this man arrested!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<CHINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, is that your face? Or you wearing a mask?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHINO>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas sputters. Chino does a phony, delayed take, turns on Harry in meek alarm.
</DIRECTION>
<CHINO>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wants me arrested, Harry! You hear what he said?

</KLEINER>

Kathie glances off, from Harry toward Johnny.

GROUP SHOT FEATURING HARRY

</THOMAS>
<HARRY>

(with sudden decision)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Thomas' mouth drops.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whether I hold anybody depends on how bad this boy here is hurt --

He turns aside. Thomas is left there, unable immediately to believe this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	He don't feel a thing --

</LOVER_BOY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry turns back, the CAMERA PANNING. Hannegan takes his arm, pulling him aside.

Harry doesn't stop him this time.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's okay, you just don't get on his back. He don't like anybody on his back. We had the same club once. The beetles got on his back all the time. He didn't like that...

Harry is still looking steadily at Johnny, waiting for the answer.

<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT THE TROPHY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is on the shelf behind the counter with the dishes and cup
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny takes a stride toward the counter, as if to vault it, stops as Kathie appears from behind the shelves. Without looking at him, she walks to the shelves, takes down the trophy, and puts it in front of him. She turns away -- then turns back, as a sort of an after thought. Her manner toward him is entirely changed; she is tense, and a little sardonic.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHIE>

He glances up, surly.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you go someplace else and cause trouble?

He sits, stubbornly. We hear people returning to bar on the other side of the partition.

<JOHNNY>

	What a phony joint...

	Give me a break, I give you a break... Phony cop --

Kathie nods.

	He's the town joke. And I'm stuck with him...

ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny stares at her; this confuses him. She goes on, almost softly, but with repressed bitterness.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's got about as much business being a cop as...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating trophy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...as you have with that. He's a fake -- like you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
Furious, he reaches out and grabs her wrist. She flinches. It hurts, but she looks at him steadily.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on, break it. I don't need it. You want to break something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're too good for me, you're a cop's daughter or something.

	You're afraid of me...

</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
She nods slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid of everything...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
He lets her wrist go suddenly.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't let anybody get away with anything like that. I know Chino a long time. He puts Chino in the can, whyn't he put that Frog-Face ran into Meatball in the can?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
(simply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's afraid of making a mistake. He needs the job, even if he doesn't like it.

<DIRECTION>
She starts to turn away. He grabs her wrist again.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen --

Then whatever he was going to say fades into confusion; he loses his resolve, lets her go just as suddenly, grabs up the trophy and strides for the bar.

They are shadows, sitting their machines quietly at the curb. Two local girls come by on the sidewalk. They hesitate slightly, hurry on past, uneasy. The boys just look.

As if this were a signal of some sort, a concert of noises erupts on all sides: cycles starting up. exploding, roaring off; yelling, men running and calling.

Closing a key, plugging in, she looks up, struck dumb with terror. The cyclists are just crowding curiously around.

The cyclists have started pushing and scuffling among themselves. Dorothy watches, absolutely petrified, comes to suddenly, rises, yelps into the receiver:
</DIRECTION>

He starts down the steps.

MEDIUM SHOT THOMAS

<DIRECTION>
As he advances into the lights, blinded, we see two figures approach him from opposite sides. The rest is confused and obscured -- the headlights swinging away, leaving the center of the action dark, the accelerating motors drowning out anything that is said. Then suddenly, the whole group is gone off up the street, just enveloping Thomas.

	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNEGAN>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I've got a gun and I'm going to use it -- one end or the other. Anybody wants to talk some more can stay here and have an ice cream social with Tom -- anybody don't can come with me --
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
He starts out. There is a moment's hesitation, then about half the group follows him out the door. The other half hangs back with Hannegan.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You find him, bring him to the back of the store -- we'll meet back there --

HANNEGAN'S GROUP

They watch the others go, then:
</DIRECTION>
<HANNEGAN>
<DIRECTION>
(grim)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we'll do what we can... Let's try and get hold of this boy Johnny, before Charlie and the others do --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNEGAN>
<DIRECTION>
They exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHINO IN CELL

<DIRECTION>
Forgotten in all this, he opens one eye, rises cautiously, tries the cell door. It isn't locked.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MILDRED'S BEAUTY SALON - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILDRED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
crying hysterically and fighting off a boy trying to make her dance. Cyclists staggering around wearing hair-dryers, roaring at each other with laughter. Kathie in the b.g. being passed from boy to boy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mildred fights free, flings open a side door and careens out into an alley.
</DIRECTION>
<CYCLISTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, she got away! Hey, catch Mildred! Don't let her get away!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYCLISTS>
<DIRECTION>
They pile out the door after her, running into each other and into the door jamb, falling down, getting up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy dancing with Kathie lets her go suddenly -- literally dropping her -- to follow the others out the door. She sags.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KATHIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
huddled trembling on the floor, on one knee. The radio blaring. She raises her head. She's alone. She rises quickly, hurries past the partition to the front of the shop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRONT ROOM OF SHOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathie stops in the darkened f.g., hearing cycles start up outside.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, get her! Tallyho, the fox!

</AD_LIBS>
<DIRECTION>
At a sound behind her, she glances back over her shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KATHIE'S ANGLE TO REAR OF SHOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
past the partition, a glimpse of Mildred -- being led back in by two cyclists.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT KATHIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
horrified, trapped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAST KATHIE TO STREET

Hearing the last cycle leave, Kathie slips quickly out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KATHIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hurrying along the sidewalk. Suddenly there are shouts behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<AD_LIBS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, there she goes! Hey, this way! It's the other one -- get her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AD_LIBS>
<DIRECTION>
Terrified, uncertain which way to go, Kathie breaks into a run, cutting diagonally across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM FULL SHOT STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cyclist brings his machine to a sudden stop directly in Kathie's path. She stops, starts the opposite way, the CAMERA PANNING. Another cycle stops, blocking her escape in this direction. She whirls, finding herself completely surrounded as several more cycles are brought up in quick succession, forming a ring around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FEATURING KATHIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the cyclists start closing the ring. She is terrified. Suddenly there is the sound of still another cycle descending on her. She whirls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rides into the shot, stops, looking around the circle at the other cyclists, murderously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT KATHIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
just staring at him numbly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GROUP SHOT FEATURING JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<CYCLIST>
<DIRECTION>
(weakly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hiya, Johnny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYCLIST>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes still on Kathie, Johnny nods -- indicating the jumpseat behind him. Kathie hesitates just an instant, then stumbles forward and clambers on behind him. He guns the motor. She grabs him around the shoulders to keep from falling. The other cyclists scatter back out of the way, the CAMERA PANNING to FOLLOW Johnny's cycle off up the street.
</DIRECTION>

JOHNNY'S CYCLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It roars past on the open highway, Kathie on the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHNNY AND KATHIE (PROCESS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is wide-open, staring straight ahead with a glazed intensity. Kathie, torn and whipped by the wind, is holding on -- there's nothing else she can do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT (PROCESS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without warning, Johnny gears down, skids around off the pavement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KATHIE (PROCESS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Startled, confused, by this. Unable to call out as the cycle bounces back onto the pavement. She just hangs on, closes her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIGHWAY THE CAMERA HOLDS

Johnny roaring away toward town again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARK AND STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny rides through with Kathie (as in #315A but opposite direction and slower).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A secluded spot, large trees, shrubbery. For a moment the scene is empty and quiet, except for motorcycles in the distance. Then Johnny, with Kathie on behind, comes through the bushes, stops. He cuts the motor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT ON KATHIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment she sits there, still clinging to Johnny's shoulders, her hair torn by the wind. Then she looks up vacantly, lets her hands slip down, almost caressing the leather jacket, gets off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathie drifts off to one side. She leans for a moment against a tree, then melts down into the shadow at the base. Not until then does Johnny dismount, slowly, kicks down the foot. Something about the cycle annoys him. He gives it intense concentration, stares at it, pokes at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT TREE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathie is just a figure slumped down in the shadow. Johnny comes over slowly, stands there, his face a mask.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(abruptly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get up --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't move. He reaches down angrily and pulls her up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE TWO SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She leans back against the tree for support, looks at him emptily, without fear. As he makes a move to grab her:
</DIRECTION>
<KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have to be back at work someplace Monday morning?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
He stops, a look of surprise and confusion on his face for an instant. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(intensely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen -- nobody's too good for me -- anybody thinks they're too good for me makes sure I knock them over sometime -- I can cut you up, show you how good you are -- tomorrow I'm someplace I don't know anything --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
(simply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His face contorts with fury. He looks trapped. His eyes leave her; she reaches out, with a sort of instinctive gesture of tenderness, touches his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Johnny...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
He flinches sharply, jerks away. Kathie looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's crazy, isn't it? You're afraid of me... I don't know why, but I'm not afraid of you now... You're afraid of me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs her with sudden, compulsive violence, forcing her against him roughly, awkwardly, kisses her. There is no resistance. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He releases her just as suddenly, with the same violence. She leans back against the tree again.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry... I'm sorry I can't fight back... I'm too tired... That would be better, wouldn't it? Then you could hit me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
He stands there in an impotent rage as she continues.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you hate me because my father's a cop? Or do you hate everybody?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause; he doesn't answer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes I hate everybody, too, I guess... I hate this whole place. I hate my father... I even hate myself...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
She leans away from the tree and moves slowly past him, close, continues on a few steps. He stands there rigidly, his back to her. She sinks down to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
(out of nowhere)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never ridden on a motorcycle before... It's fast... It scared me. But I forgot everything. It felt good... Is that what you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
He whirls to face her, menacing, shouting:
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop asking me. I don't like them to ask me all the time! I don't like them getting on my back! I feel like it, I go! Okay? I feel like it, I stick around, you got ten fathers all phony cops -- they're going to work me over or something -- stick their big fat hands in my face! I been worked over! Nothing! They don't scare me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. Kathie sinks slowly to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOW ANGLE PAST KATHIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
resting her chin on her knee; Johnny still stands in the b.g. his head and shoulders out of the frame.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He just doesn't know how to be a cop... He wanted to raise dogs once. I don't know what he was going to do with them. Just raise them. He didn't like to hunt. He shot a rabbit once. It didn't die right away. He got sick...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
A slight pause. Johnny lowers himself slowly to the ground where he is, some four feet away, in deep shadow.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I used to think about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
No reply, of course.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
(continues)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used to think about it a lot after my mother died... That somebody would come here, stop at Uncle Frank's for a cup of coffee and he would like me right away. He'd take me with him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
She lifts her head, listens for a moment to the sound of motorcycles somewhere beyond the park.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Johnny, you were going to give it to me... Will you give me that statue now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
There is a pause; then Johnny's voice, strange from the dark:
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
(a vague shrug)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to look at it sometime... to remember...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<KATHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This. It's crazy... but I saw a movie once. I forget, anyway a couple of people. They sat at a place -- like on a hill. There was a town burning. And it was all over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
Another pause.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did you want this guy to take you? This guy had a cup of coffee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Kathie is thrown for an instant, then retrieves the thread, smiles wryly.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Wherever he was going...

<DIRECTION>
body)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm shaky... I wish I was going someplace... I wish you were going someplace. We could go together...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
Another tremor runs through her body. She raises her hands to her face. Then suddenly, she cracks, everything catching up with her at once. She rises slightly, throws herself at Johnny, grabbing him around the shoulders, sobbing hysterically.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Johnny! Johnny!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
Startled, angry, Johnny fights her off.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
(hanging on)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Johnny!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>
<JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(furious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut it out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
He tears her violently away, pushes her off, and rises, all in the same motion. She falls at his feet in a heap, sobbing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT JOHNNY AND KATHIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands over her, shouting at her in a crazy mixture of fury and self-torment -- very close to breaking.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter with you? I didn't do anything to you. I didn't touch you! Listen -- What am I supposed to do? What do you want? Cut it out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
She gets suddenly to her feet and plunges off through the bushes still sobbing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT ON JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
frozen there for a moment. Then he whirls back to his cycle, jumps on, starts the motor, goes crashing through the bushes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STREET AND PARK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathie comes running out of the park, stumbling and crying, heading diagonally across the street. Johnny rounds the corner in the b.g., after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathie running and stumbling down the street. Johnny overtakes her, skids to a stop, cutting her off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CORNER OF BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Art Kleiner, a short length of pipe in his hand, pulls up suddenly as he rounds the corner, looking off. Another man looks over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KLEINER'S ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathie tries to dodge around Johnny. He grabs one arm, almost loses his balance on the machine.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kathie -- listen -- what's the matter with you? I --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
She swings on him with crazy fury, strikes him solidly across the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ART KLEINER AND MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They react, duck quickly back around the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT KATHIE AND JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is staring up at Johnny -- appalled by what she has done. She almost speaks, but can't -- whirling suddenly and racing off. He just sits, his head slightly bowed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KATHIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hurrying along, close to the buildings, pulls up short at the sound of glass breaking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KATHIE'S ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chino and several other cyclists are careening toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KATHIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is about to cut diagonally across the street when she is stopped again by the sound of a cycle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Johnny. Overtaking Kathie -- not seeing her in the shadows, he cuts in at the curb just ahead of her, jumps off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHINO AND GROUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chino is very drunk. He has a stick in one hand, a beer bottle in the other. He is wearing -- over his other clothes -- a full dress suit. Johnny hurries to him -- grabs him.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Chino -- how'd you get out of the can?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Chino just leers at him.
</DIRECTION>
<CHINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Johnny, I love you! Let's you and me have a beer -- then I'll knock the living Christmas out of you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHINO>
<DIRECTION>
He swings ineffectually, almost falls. Johnny holds him.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Chino -- come on -- let's get everybody. Let's blow out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(almost pleading)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Chino.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Chino stares at him a moment, glazed, then raises his stick, shouts:
</DIRECTION>
<CHINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Storm the Bastille!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHINO>
<DIRECTION>
He almost falls. Johnny lets him go, just stands there as the group careens on. He looks lost.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KATHIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pressed back against the wall until Chino and the others are past. At the same moment she starts for Johnny we hear his motor start -- the machine roaring. She stops -- the cry dying in her throat -- then hurries after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny goes perhaps a hundred yards, stops near an intersection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks off down the side street. Someone shouts down there. We hear someone running. On all sides, the vague, muffled sounds of rioting. He looks confused, uncertain which way to turn. Suddenly -- so quickly that it is upon him before he realizes it -- a sedan comes to a stop, boxing him in at the curb. Thomas and several other men swarm out.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the one! Get him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
Taken by surprise, Johnny can neither start the cycle nor dismount fast enough to defend himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KATHIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She has stopped, some fifty yards down the street, reacting to this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT KATHIE'S ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny is quickly overwhelmed and dragged into the car, his cycle left where it fell over at the curb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KATHIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
frozen for a moment -- the sound of the car starting up and skidding around. She whirls and dashes off around the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET (TOWN HALL) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Kathie reappears, pulls up. A group of men, either locals or cyclists, is moving toward her. She veers aside, runs toward the jail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAIL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT TOWARD DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is dark, illuminated only by whatever light enters through the windows. We hear Kathie at the door. It opens and she comes in quickly. She bolts the door, stands there getting her breath, looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is empty. Kathie moves into the shot, slumps. Then she looks up to Harry's locker against the wall in shadow. She considers, decides, crosses quickly, starts searching in the locker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT AT LOCKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathie's hand comes out with a gun she has found on the top shelf. Harry's hand reaches in and closes on her wrist. She jumps, turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER ANGLE INCLUDING HARRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One hand clamped on Kathie's wrist -- in the other an almost empty glass. He is not drunk. He just looks at her -- his expression and his whole manner completely vacant. Kathie stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They've got Johnny, I --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
Harry puts the glass down on the desk, slips the gun from her fingers, turns with it and sits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathie follows, looking down at him.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you just been sitting here? Aren't you going to do anything?

<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(an odd smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, business before pleasure...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He sips his drink. Kathie leans down, trying hard to penetrate his detachment.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad -- listen -- they've gone crazy. Everybody -- They got Johnny. You've got to help him. They're going to -- I don't know -- beat him up or something --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her quickly, then away. Some of this is getting to him. He would like to ignore it.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tried to talk to him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He rises abruptly, turns his back, replacing the gun in the locker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE TWO SHOT KATHIE AND HARRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathie presses him.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you even care? Whatever he's done -- it's still wrong --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
When Harry turns back to face her, he has a pint bottle of whiskey in his hand. More important -- his poise has cracked. He is suddenly tense, fighting himself, and his voice rises slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all wrong! Everybody's wrong! I saw it coming! What could I do? In a way, they brought it on themselves! Charlie Thomas? He's a bully! He was a bully in the second grade... What am I supposed to do -- shoot somebody?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE KATHIE AND HARRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a pause. Kathie looks at her father bitterly, turns her back.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her back, uncomfortable, glances at the locker where the gun is, at the glass on the desk waiting for the whiskey. He makes his decision. As he quickly pours himself a drink:
</DIRECTION>
<KATHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Just nothing, I guess... You're worse than any of them...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>

FEATURING Ben, the garage man. He is installed comfortably on a nail bin, looking off as he sips from a half-pint bottle of whisky. On the wall behind him are farm tools and various other items of hardware; rope, pipe, lanterns, etc., hanging overhead, suspended from the low rafters, casting a pattern of shadows. A blow is struck o.s.

He has taken the blow with cynical arrogance.

<DIRECTION>
Thomas pushes Hannegan angrily aside.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bill, I warned you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
The two groups are poised for an instant. In that instant a shot explodes, loud in the low-ceilinged room. The men jump, whirling toward the rear of the stock room -- a lantern crashing down from above, not far from Johnny's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAST JOHNNY TO REAR DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny has half-risen in the chair. The men who were grouped around him have jumped back. Harry has burst through the alley door, brandishing his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody get back -- away from that boy --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is staring at Harry, incredulously -- poised to leave the chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hannegan moves toward Harry. Misunderstanding, Harry pushes him aside. Thomas plants himself between Harry and Johnny.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This has got nothing to do with you, Harry -- we've got a little job that has to be done --

</THOMAS>
<HARRY>

</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Poised, he looks past Harry, reacts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHNNY'S ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Past Harry to Kathie standing in the alley door. Ben moves in, insolent.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Harry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're doing something should have been done a long time ago -- pounding a little respect for law and authority into this guy's thick skull --

<HANNEGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You won't do it that way --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNEGAN>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry looks at Hannegan, surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got a better way -- either of you -- you had a long time to try it. This way, we make good and sure he don't try to pull anything like this right away soon --
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
Harry gives him a glassy look, starts crowding past, gesturing with the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, fellow --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It looks like an impasse. Sawyer moves to Harry.
</DIRECTION>
<SAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
(patronizing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, Harry... Let's take it easy. We're all old friends here, Harry... Let's keep calm -- talk this over --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
Harry turns his body slightly, about to reply; at the same moment, Kathie screams:
</DIRECTION>
<KATHIE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Before Harry can turn, one of the men who has gotten around behind, jumps him, grabbing his arm to get at the gun. It fires into the ceiling. Thomas tackles him low. Rushed from all directions he goes down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE FIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chair Johnny was sitting on is empty in the f. g. Stepping back out of the scramble for an instant, Thomas reacts.
</DIRECTION>
<THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting furiously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The boy got away -- get him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THOMAS>
<DIRECTION>
Several men look up, leave Harry to the others, starting after Johnny. Hannegan throws himself in their path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KATHIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pressed against the wall as Johnny comes by. She instinctively reaches out to him. He sees her, hesitates just a fraction of a second -- plunges on and out into the alley.
</DIRECTION>

Momentarily confused, tired, he stops, uncertain which way to go. Then he dives aside.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leans back against a tree. Very suddenly, he breaks completely -- just goes to pieces, trembling convulsively, tears streaming down his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a beat before Johnny pushes himself away from the tree with his shoulders, with great effort, crosses to the cycle. He opens one saddlebag, takes out his Trophy, puts it back. Then he rights the machine, kicks the starter. The second time it catches. He rides off, the CAMERA PANNING and HOLDING as he disappears around a corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT CORNER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two children on bicycles race around the corner, colliding with Jimmy. He stares at them, recovers, then:
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You children seen Kathie Bleeker?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
They shake their heads. Jimmy starts on, stops, realizing something is wrong here.

<DIRECTION>
Johnny rides into the center of the intersection, pauses. He turns one way, stops. A group of men are approaching quickly He reverses, starts the other way. Two figures appear suddenly in front of him. He stops again, looks back. The men jump back into the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO MEN AGAINST BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men are Art Kleiner and Bleeker.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks back. We hear the group of men running, closer. He has to go forward past Bleeker and Kleiner. He throws the cycle in gear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GROUP OF MEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of them emerges from the pack, stops, throwing a tire- iron like a boomerang.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM LONG SHOT LOW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny is about opposite Bleeker and Kleiner when it happen It is impossible to see whether the tire-iron hits Johnny or the cycle. But we see the result: the cycle goes out of control, veering crazily for an instant -- then Johnny goes off; the machine bucks, jumps forward, careens toward camera under its own power.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE RIDERLESS CYCLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It wobbles, continues on, straight for the camera.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. STREET AND TOWN HALL - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the scene of the accident, across the crowd to Town Hall. In the pale, half-light of very early morning, people are standing around in silent little groups.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In contrast to everything that has gone before, there is an absolute, expectant hush.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FACES OF THE CROWD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some of these are faces we have seen and known earlier. The expressions are weary, grim. These are the faces of people who have been through a shocking, sobering experience.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CYCLISTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are miserable looking lot now -- slumped on the ground, sprawled in various attitudes near the Town Hall steps. Their air of braggadocio has slumped completely. Under the eyes of the several deputies standing over them with riot guns, they look much younger, very un-dangerous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOWN HALL - COUNCIL ROOM - EARLY MORNING

in a chair, staring bleakly at nothing. He looks up, down again.

<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
(abruptly; hard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you've done it. Real good job. Got yourself some real big trouble. Shows what you can do if you work at it long enough --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny attempts a cynical smirk that doesn't quite come off; the fear shows through.
</DIRECTION>
<SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing sarcastically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, you're a big important fellow now. Everybody's listening. What do you want to say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
No answer.
</DIRECTION>
<SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what you're going to get for manslaughter -- forgetting the count on the girl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny flares suddenly, in desperate imitation of his previous arrogance.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somebody jumpy's yelling they got hurt, where is she? What's the beef?

	I got hold of my daughter, Stu... She's out here. She went home, and came back again...

<DIRECTION>
Singer turns toward him. The deputy with the notebook rises and follows him like a shadow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watching Singer go, his expression wavering from cynical contempt to fear. Another deputy appears from nowhere and stands near him.
</DIRECTION>

Kathie is standing forlornly in the middle of this smaller room. Harry has re-entered and moved to her side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Singer and his deputy follow Harry in, there is a sudden commotion at another door in the b.g. Bleeker appears, trying to bluster his way past a deputy there.
</DIRECTION>
<BLEEKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This girl's my niece! I have a right to be with her! There's no telling where her father --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLEEKER>
<DIRECTION>
He sees Harry and stops. Singer nods to the deputy barring his entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<SINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. But sit down and be quiet. I want to wind this up and get to bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
Bleeker slips under the deputy's arm and sinks into a chair near the door, avoiding Harry's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Singer indicates a chair for Kathie. As she sits apprehensively, not sure what is going to be expected of her, the Sheriff pulls up a chair for himself, takes a big breath.

<DIRECTION>
(gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, can you tell me about this now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINGER>

Kathie hesitates, appeals to Harry with her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just what you told me, Kathie...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
(seeing Kathie's confusion)

As Singer turns back to Kathie, she is suddenly on her feet, too, breaking under the strain.
</DIRECTION>

ANOTHER ANGLE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. A little confused, Singer turns to Kathie again. She has started to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<SINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right... Take your time. How did you happen to go for a ride with him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINGER>
<KATHIE>

	He brought me back. We stopped in the park awhile... and talked, that's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
Bleeker has risen again, despite himself, moved into the scene. Singer doesn't stop him this time.

<BLEEKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kathie, Art saw you struggling with him -- crying -- trying to get away from him -- weren't you?

	</DIALOGUE>
</SINGER>
<KATHIE>
<DIRECTION>
(erupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They beat him! I saw them beat him! And he wasn't doing anything! Not then! He was trying to stop the others! He was trying to do what I wanted him to do!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHIE>
<SINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>

	You saw this man, whoever he was, come out of the alley, and throw something?

Kleiner nods, frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<SINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was the boy doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
As Kleiner looks vague.
</DIRECTION>
<SINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, nothing... You don't know who this man was?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINGER>
<KLEINER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sir.

</KLEINER>
<SINGER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	We were after him.

</KLEINER>
<BLEEKER>

(a quick, guilty look at Kathie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We had the wrong idea about... what had happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLEEKER>
<DIRECTION>
A pause, Singer frowns.
</DIRECTION>
<SINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kathie...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his arm around her shoulder, starts leading her out. She goes, puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR - TOWN HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Singer brings Kathie out into the semi-dark corridor. In the b.g., vaguely, we are aware of a group of local citizens, held back by one of Singer's men. Slowly, his arm still around Kathie, Singer starts walking with her. Up the corridor, then back again, pausing now and then, their footsteps hollow on the marble floor.
</DIRECTION>
<SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly serious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kathie... I want your advice... This has been a pretty mixed up business here... You know a little, I guess, about what it means to be a policeman...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he pauses thoughtfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I think you were a little closer to this boy tonight than anybody else... Maybe a lot closer than anybody has ever gotten to him. You're a decent girl... what do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
She raises her eyes, looks at Singer. He goes on:
</DIRECTION>
<SINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, what happens to him now. He pulled a lot of rough stuff here -- anyway his gang did. And I can hold him. I will, too, if I decide he's too far gone -- just to see he doesn't pull it again, someplace else... But I've got a feeling he never met a girl like you before... and he may have learned something. If he has, there's a chance of saving him, if he's treated right... What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
Kathie looks up again, hesitates before answering -- moved and troubled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOWN HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CYCLISTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sudden, nervous restlessness sweeps through the group. Several of them rise from the ground. Alert, the deputies straighten up, ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COUNCIL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lost in his own miserable reverie, he is unaware that Singer has entered and doesn't react until the Sheriff is standing over him. Then he pulls back, half raises his arm as if to ward off a blow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Singer just stands there a moment looking at him. Then he turns back to the desk and picks up a driver's license from beside the trophy.
</DIRECTION>
<SINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Johnny Donato...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(after a pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ever had any friends, Johnny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny reacts cautiously; what gives here?
</DIRECTION>
<SINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you picked up a few around here tonight. Strange as it may sound. Not many, but a couple. They've got you off the hook a little.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny blinks. His face works. He picks a spot on the floor and stares at that. In the b.g. is the door to the adjoining room. Singer has left it open. And now Kathie appears there. Harry and Bleeker move up behind her. If Johnny hears them, he doesn't turn his head.
</DIRECTION>
<SINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, look, get this straight. I'm not soft. And I may be making a big mistake. Whatever your boys think of you, you're no hero to me. But you didn't kill anybody. You didn't actually hurt anybody. I'm going to take a big chance and put you on your way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His careful expression collapses and is replaced by a mixture of fear and confusion. His eyes stray ever so slightly toward Kathie, standing just inside the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Singer addresses one of the deputies.
</DIRECTION>
<SINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get that other bunch of goons loaded up --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
The deputy nods, exits, as Singer steps to Johnny, hands him his driver's license.
</DIRECTION>
<SINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There'll be some straightening out to do. You'll get a summons for an inquest.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(very hard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you'd better show up for it, or else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny stares at the license.
</DIRECTION>
<SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding to the trophy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny starts guiltily, glances at the trophy, then toward Kathie. He hesitates an instant, then quickly picks up the trophy and puts it carelessly under his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
(to deputies)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put him on the road.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny starts out between two deputies.
</DIRECTION>
<SINGER>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Haven't you got something to say to these people?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny stops, meets Kathie's eyes for a moment, then has to look away, just stands there stubbornly.
</DIRECTION>
<SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
(angrily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, tough boy. What's the matter with you? You been beat over the head so much you don't know when somebody gives you a break? Nobody ever taught you any way to say thank you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny looks as if he would like to say something, but nothing comes out. Singer waves him off, and he continues on out with the deputies, past Kathie, Harry and Bleeker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE

Singer turns wearily, scoops up his papers from the desk and follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOWN HALL - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several deputies come out, herding a bunch of cyclists down the steps. Most of them are from Chino's group, the extremists who have participated in the early scenes, caused actual damage, etc... There is a slight murmur from the crowd as they are hurried toward the Sheriff's cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the rest of the cyclists, mostly Johnny's group, look up, react. Sensing the end, some of them rise. One of them glances back toward the steps of the Town Hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny appears with the two deputies, who turn him loose at the head of the steps. He comes on down. Gringo steps out to meet him.
</DIRECTION>
<GRINGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Johnny, you sprung?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRINGO>

Johnny looks at him as if he had never seen him before, glances off.

JOHNNY'S ANGLE

<DIRECTION>
The other cyclists being herded into cars, their cycles being loaded onto a truck.

As he looks around vaguely.

	Where's Chino? What happened to Chino?

</JOHNNY>

ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Singer appears on the steps, addressing the cyclists who are left.
</DIRECTION>
<SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
(hard; forceful)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, the rest of you crumbs, let's get going. I want you out of here -- right away. And don't get the idea you're getting away with anything, because you aren't. I don't think you're funny, or cute, or anything like that. I think you're stupid. I'd lock the whole bunch of you up, except I don't want to get the jail dirty. Any of you stick your nose in this county again without a good reason -- and the right reason -- I'll take your sickles away from you for a year.

</SINGER>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reacting, standing there in a sort of a daze, glances at the trophy under his arm. One of the others nudges him and he moves with the group toward the cycles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOWARD STEPS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathie, Harry, Bleeker and Kleiner start down the steps. Kathie looks up at the sound of the cycles starting, exploding. Harry takes her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE FEATURING JOHNNY

<DIRECTION>
The deputies standing by with riot guns supervising the departure.

Johnny looks back once, guns his machine -- and looks off, the others roaring out behind him. The CAMERA PANS TO FRAME the troop until it disappears and the noise of the motors dies away.

MEDIUM SHOT BLEEKER, KATHIE, HARRY

They stand there a moment. It is suddenly quiet.

He starts off.

With a sudden, impulsive movement, she goes into her father's arms. He holds her tight. She is shaking.

Bleeker is behind the counter, staring abstractedly at the water burbling in the silex. The door opens o.s.

<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>

Kathie and Harry come in slowly, moving toward the counter. The place is a wreck.
</DIRECTION>
<BLEEKER>

<DIRECTION>
(a flash of irritation)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Jimmy --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLEEKER>
<DIRECTION>
He catches himself, frowns. The others sit at the counter, silently, waiting for the coffee. Harry takes a deep, audible breath. Kathie takes his hand. Bleeker puts four cups on the counter. From the street there is sudden popping and exploding. The whole group tenses, turns to look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Art Kleiner's car passing. It goes by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GROUP AT COUNTER

They turn back, relax. Bleeker starts pouring coffee. Harry takes his and cups it in his hands. Reaching for the sugar, Kathie looks up and sees that Bleeker is staring past her toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KATHIE'S ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny is standing framed in the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KATHIE

She catches her breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, with a suggestion of the insolent swagger of his first entrance, he comes on in, swinging the trophy limply at his side. He stops, midway, unwilling to meet their eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT AT COUNTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They exchange looks. Harry starts to get up. Kathie stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT

Johnny saunters over, still avoiding their eyes, takes a seat around the corner by himself, places the trophy carefully beside him.

<JOHNNY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Got any coffee?

	That's all right.

Moved, Kathie lowers her eyes, then looks up again quickly, instinctively alarmed at the sound of a car outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE PAST GROUP TO STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's one of the Sheriff's cars. Someone is starting to get out. With a quick look at Johnny, Harry rises and starts for the door.

ANGLE FEATURING JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is still just sitting there, obviously struggling with something. Bleeker moves to him, stands there awkwardly.
</DIRECTION>
<BLEEKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How you fixed? You got any change in your pocket. If...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLEEKER>
<DIRECTION>
He stalls. Johnny sits there a moment longer, downs one more swig of coffee and rises, all in the same motion, picking up - his trophy. He takes about three steps with it, stops, turns back. Never meeting Kathie's eyes, he returns and places it carefully on the counter where he was sitting. Then turns and stalks out. Bleeker looks from the trophy to Kathie. She is looking into space. The door slams.

Johnny stops, looks from Harry to the deputies to the other men, then back to Harry. He steps toward Harry, jamming a cigarette into his mouth.

Harry nods, fumbles out a box of matches, strikes one.

FEATURING HARRY AND JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>

Johnny reaches out, takes Harry's cupped hands, brings them close, lights his cigarette, brushes past the other men to the cycle, kicks the starter, and roars off up the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - EARLY MORNING ON JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dog dashes out into the street ahead of the cycle. Johnny swerves, brakes hard to avoid hitting it, stalls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT ON JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He swears under his breath, kicks the starter viciously; he kicks it again and it catches -- the machine leaping forward again. The CAMERA PANS, FRAMING him as he rides off up the street, disappears into the darkness beyond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the sound of the cycle dies away,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:

THE END
