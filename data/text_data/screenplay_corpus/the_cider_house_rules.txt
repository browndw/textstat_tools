</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pan the dispensary, which also serves as Larch's photo gallery and bedroom apartment. The ether-bed is separated from the room by a hospital curtain (the kind on casters). We see the recording revolving, the glass-encased cabinets of medical supplies, the old photographs of St. Cloud's.

They shriek as the boys suddenly surprise them. Buster throws two hard snowballs that hit Mary Agnes and CLARA (eight or nine) before Mary Agnes overwhelms him and repeatedly sticks his head in the snow. Copperfield, terrified of Mary Agnes, escapes. Curly misses, then tips over the sled of snowballs as Clara and the adorable HAZEL (five or six) throw him to the ground. Fuzzy drops his one snowball; he runs aimlessly in circles, coughing, as Nurse Edna explodes from a door of the orphanage.

Angela is singing along with the song on the phonograph, a more romantic song then before, which rouses Larch from his ether.

Homer makes no response. As the train approaches, Homer and Buster go sit on a loading cart. They see the distraught woman (no longer pregnant) from Homer's experience of a few nights ago; she is leaving St. Cloud's without her baby, waiting for the approaching train. Her face is a mask. The DISAPPROVING STATIONMASTER gives her a hard look.

A VERY FRIGHTENED GIRL---not one of the orphans--is lying next to the incinerator.

Edna kneels by the strange girl, who cringes with fear.

Edna is holding the head of the frightened young girl. The girl is feverishly hot and whimpering; she keeps looking at her feet in the stirrups as if she's an animal caught in a trap. Larch and Homer stand on either side of her.

Larch, his wild eye peering into the speculum, makes an audible gasp from the shock of what he sees inside the girl. Larch tells Homer to have a look. Larch then whispers something to Edna; she brings the ether bottle and cone quickly. Larch starts putting the cone in place, over the nose and mouth of the frightened girl. Homer bends to the speculum.

Homer, furious, leaves the operating room. Edna lifts the girl's eyelids for Larch so that he can see how well under the ether she is.

Nervously, Wally gives the children chocolates.

<WALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Homer nods, but he has no idea where Cape Kenneth is.
</DIRECTION>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cape Kenneth...

Wally nods.

INT. STAIRWAY/CORRIDOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Homer runs up the stairs, two steps at a time; he races into a corridor at full speed, exhilarated. Suddenly Dr. Larch appears in front of him. Homer stops abruptly, out of breath, unable to speak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Homer stands guiltily, Larch rifles through an X-ray file, holding various X rays up to the lit screen. He quickly finds the one he's looking for, attaching it briefly to the screen for a confirming look--a heart X ray, which Larch waves at Homer as he talks.
</DIRECTION>
<LARCH>
<DIRECTION>
(sarcastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least *useful* thing it is that you find to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARCH>
<HOMER>
<DIRECTION>
(restrained)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<LARCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARCH>
<HOMER>

(still restrained)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<LARCH>
<DIRECTION>
(blows up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you really so *stupid* that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of *anybody*-- not out there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARCH>
<HOMER>
<DIRECTION>
(feeling trapped)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...

</HOMER>
<LARCH>
<DIRECTION>
(calmly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't need your gratitude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARCH>
<DIRECTION>
Larch hands Homer the heart X ray.
</DIRECTION>
<HOMER>
<DIRECTION>
(exasperated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<LARCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARCH>

Camera closes on Homer with the X ray.

<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Buster and Mary Agnes are serving the evening meal while Larch rails at Angela and Edna, who are helping Buster and Mary Agnes. The sound of children in the dining hall is intermittent and chaotic.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Going where? Does he have a plan of some kind?

</EDNA>
<ANGELA>
	<DIALOGUE>

	He'll need clothes... some money...

	</DIALOGUE>
</LARCH>
<ANGELA>

<DIRECTION>
INT. BOYS' DIVISION - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Homer is packing his things--we see the heart X ray, and some photos of Larch and Edna and Angela.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Larch approaches Homer with a small bundle of clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<LARCH>
<DIRECTION>
(gently, almost reverently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think these will fit you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARCH>
<DIRECTION>
Homer is grateful and ashamed. Before he can speak, Edna is there--a wad of bills in her hand. She tries to put the money in his pocket; when he refuses it, she simply puts the money in his open suitcase, stuffing the bills under his clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll need some money--just a little something, until you find a job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
Larch and Edna retreat from him, humbly, as if they were his servants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DRIVEWAY - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Homer puts his stuff in the truck of Wally's car, Angela can't resist touching his face. She is too upset to speak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From a window, Larch is watching the departure. He sees Homer saying goodbye to the children, embracing them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From another window, Fuzzy just stares. (Of course he's coughing.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Wally carrying Candy to the car.
</DIRECTION>
<CANDY>
<DIRECTION>
(groggy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm okay--I can walk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANDY>
<WALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALLY>
<CANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No--keep it down. I want to feel the air.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANDY>
<DIRECTION>
She speaks to Homer, touching his sleeve, like a sleepy person, as Wally puts her gently in the backseat.
</DIRECTION>
<CANDY>
<DIRECTION>
(still groggy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coming with us? It's always a good idea to have a doctor along for the ride.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Homer gets in the passenger seat beside Wally, who starts the car; suddenly there is Curly. Homer can't look at Curly, who looks betrayed. Edna picks up Curly and carries him to the passenger-side window. Curly is sobbing.
</DIRECTION>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to go, Curly. I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Edna)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't find Buster. Will you tell him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<DIRECTION>
He can't finish what he has to say. Edna kisses him good- bye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the window, Larch watches the car leave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Buster, whittling a stick, isn't watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. WALLY'S CAR - ON THE ROAD - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is quiet as the journey gets underway. Wally keeps glancing at Candy in the rear-view mirror; she seems distant, lost in thought. Homer is taking everything in--the speed, the road, the wind in his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOYS' DIVISION - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
INT. GIRLS' DIVISION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the girls' washroom, in front of the mirror by the row of sinks, Mary Agnes is repeatedly slapping her face. Angela's benediction to the boys plays Over this scene of violent self-abuse. Except for the sound of the slaps. Mary Agnes doesn't make a sound.
</DIRECTION>

INT. WALLY'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The radio is playing. Candy is lying down, her knees drawn up, in the backseat; she appears to be asleep, oblivious to Homer and Wally's conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<WALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, the Army has given me leave twice. First when my father died, and now I'm on leave to help my mother-- I'm just trying to get her ready for the harvest. She's no farmer. Apples were my dad's business. And with the war on, she's short on pickers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Candy's eyes are open but her voice is groggy.

</HOMER>
<WALLY>

Candy's eyes snap open and she sits up a little.

<CANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There! You said it was boring.

</CANDY>
<WALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, *picking* them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!

Candy seems irritated with Wally. Homer tries to engage her.

<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is your family in the apple business, too?

</HOMER>
<CANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>

EXT./INT. ROADSIDE/CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car is parked at the side of the road. Wally is half- hidden behind a tree. Candy and Homer are left alone in the car; there's an awkward silence as Homer pretends not to hear Wally's excessive peeing. Suddenly Candy starts to sob.
</DIRECTION>
<CANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't have a baby with someone who's leaving me--I didn't know what else to do!

Candy pounds on his chest with her fists.

	</DIALOGUE>
</CANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Wally signals to Homer to get out of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Later, Wally and Homer stand outside the car, overhearing Candy's weeping. Homer is smoking nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<HOMER>
<DIRECTION>
(strictly medical)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time.

<WALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ought to cut that shit out--it's terrible for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Homer looks at Wally; he sees the authority in his eyes. Homer drops his cigarette and puts it out with his foot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They notice that Candy has stopped crying. Wally finds Candy asleep in the backseat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WALLY'S CAR - ON THE ROAD - LATE AT NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The lone car on the road. Snatches of war news from the radio are the only sound as the headlights illuminate the dark highway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COAST OF MAINE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car is parked, with Homer sleeping in it alone. The sounds of the ocean increase as Homer opens his eyes. Homer gets out of the car and walks toward the beach, enchanted. There it is: his first view ever of an ocean, the horizon, the sun glimmering on the water. Candy is lying on a blanket in the sand. Wally is throwing rocks in the water. Homer takes it all in. When Candy calls for him, Homer walks up to her.
</DIRECTION>
<CANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a little worried about the...
	</DIALOGUE>

(she gestures below her waist)

	<DIALOGUE>
	...about how much bleeding is okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANDY>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Candy nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.

</HOMER>
<WALLY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Catch!

A football comes flying through the air toward Homer; it bounces off his chest. Wally laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<WALLY>
<DIRECTION>
(meaning the football)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give it here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Homer throws the football; it's clear he's never thrown one before.
</DIRECTION>
<WALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was *that*?! Come over here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Homer runs over to Wally, who proceeds to show him how to pass the ball. Snatches of his instruction drift to Candy, who closes her eyes. "Put your fingers on the laces--no, it rests in your palm, like this! You want the laces up--yes, like that!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COAST OF MAINE - DAY (LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Homer and Wally sit on the beach a short distance from Candy's blanket. She appears to be asleep. Wally looks in her direction before he speaks to Homer.
</DIRECTION>
<WALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's called the Burma run. It's about a seven-hour round-trip flight between India and China.

Wally draws a crude map in the sand.

<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...

</HOMER>
<WALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	*And* over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.

On Candy's face: she's not asleep; she's listening.

	I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALLY>

Homer looks at Wally, thoughtfully.

<HOMER>

</HOMER>
<WALLY>
<DIRECTION>
(conspiratorially)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, I volunteered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Homer is shocked; he looks back at Candy, lowers his voice.
</DIRECTION>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the flying, right? You love to fly, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<DIRECTION>
Wally nods; he also gives a look in Candy's direction before he responds.
</DIRECTION>
<WALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love the bombing, too. But there's also the Himalayas--they have the most wicked air currents in the world. I wouldn't miss flying there for anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALLY>
<DIRECTION>
Homer's smile suggests that he's impressed, but that he wouldn't have Wally's enthusiasm for the task. Wally laughs and puts his hand on Homer's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<WALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.

<OLIVE>

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wally? I expected you earlier...
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>

She appears in the doorway of Wally's room. Mrs. Worthington (OLIVE) is an elegant, fiftyish New Englander, as handsome as Wally, but more reserved. She is surprised to see Homer.
</DIRECTION>
<WALLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Homer Wells--he's the most overqualified apple picker you'll ever meet, but he's dying to learn the apple business.

Wally is taking his uniform off as he speaks, just dropping it on the floor as he quickly puts on some farm clothes.

	Homer is everybody's friend, Mom... the bride's, the groom's, mine, Candy's, *everybody's*.

Homer is embarrassed, but Olive is obdurately well-mannered.

Homer and Wally get out of the jeep at the cider house, a barnlike building with adjacent sheds and, behind it, line after line of trees--the apple orchards.
</DIRECTION>

Homer sees an outdoor shower where THREE BLACK MEN are showering. It is a wooden stall that leaves the shower's occupants visible above and below their midsections. A FOURTH BLACK MAN is caught naked, running behind the cider house and out of sight as he wraps a towel around himself.

Homer wonders what that means as Wally reaches for the door of the cider house. Before Wally can knock, a pretty young black girl, ROSE ROSE, bumps open the screen door with her hip and throws a bucket of water in the grass--almost hitting Homer and Wally.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That sink's backed up again, Wally. I thought you was gonna get me a plumber.

The screen door swings open and shut again, startling them all, as MR. ROSE comes out of the cider house.

	That daughter of mine sure is Miss Hospitality, ain't she, Wally?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_ROSE>

Grinning, Mr. Rose shakes Wally's hand. Rose Rose goes back inside the cider house as Mr. Rose shakes Homer's hand. Homer introduces himself.

Mr. Rose looks briefly at the men, who wait for his reaction.

	So. What should I do now?

</HOMER>
<MR_ROSE>

Homer looks at Mr. Rose with an uncomprehending expression.

Homer thinks that over.

Later, Homer is cleaning out the shed.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. CIDER HOUSE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pickers all sit down to supper around a picnic table. Homer with Mr. Rose, Rose Rose, and the other black pickers. Mr. Rose takes an apple from a bowl on the table. Then he pulls out a knife and opens it in one fluid motion; he's so fast, the knife seems to come out of nowhere. He begins to peel the apple. Homer eyes Mr. Rose, but Mr. Rose's focus is riveted to his apple and the long, perfect strand of peel dangling from it.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_ROSE>

<DIRECTION>
There are some disrespectful suggestions from the pickers concerning what his heroism might have been.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Homer unpacks his suitcase. (His bed should be nearest Muddy's and Mr. Rose's.) Jack lies on his bed, smoking. Muddy, also smoking, is sitting on his bed, sharpening a knife. Hero and Peaches are playing cards on one of their beds. Mr. Rose is finishing shaving. Rose Rose watches Homer unpack.

</HOMER>
<ROSE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE_ROSE>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, really. Just a small defect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<MR_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?

Rose Rose picks up the book that Homer has put on the bed. She studies the cover; it's "Great Expectations" by Charles Dickens. She puts it down, restlessly.

Finished unpacking, Homer sits on his bed; he picks up "Great Expectations" and begins to read. Rose Rose sits down next to him, watching him read. Homer notices her interest.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What does it say there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE_ROSE>

Homer looks around at the pickers lying in their beds, smoking, listening. (Like bedtime stories at the orphanage, he thinks; however, the picker's attitude is suspicious, reserved.)

</HOMER>
<DIRECTION>
Some muttering, some giggling, mostly silence. Rose Rose wants more, but suddenly Jack jumps out of bed and stomps to the kitchen end of the cider house, where a piece of paper is tacked to the wall. Jack is talking to Homer all the way.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since you're the one who's smart enough to read... what's this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack points at the piece of paper. Homer gets up and looks at it.
</DIRECTION>
<HOMER>

	It's a list of rules, it seems.

All the men groan--Jack swears and Peaches laughs.

	Remember this! In the morning, when the tall grass is wet, you can make the Jeep slide on the grass. Can you feel it?

Mr. Rose takes Homer aside.

Homer is unfamiliar with this kind of kidding around; at first he is startled, but then he laughs. Wally laughs, too. They shake hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Rose calls out to Homer from the tractor. The pickers are impatiently waiting for him on the flatbed; they're going back to the orchard. Homer has to run to catch up to them. He jumps on the flatbed; he sees Wally waving good-bye.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. ORCHARDS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
High up in a tall tree on a couple of ladders, Mr. Rose and Homer are picking side by side. Mr. Rose is picking with high-speed perfection, but Homer is slower and fumbling--he drops an occasional apple to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You pickin' more cider apples then anythin' else. Them drops is good only for cider. And you pickin' the stems with the apples only half the time. They good only for cider, too-- if you don't pick them stems.

(Homer watches him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The rule is, you wanna pick the apple *with* the stem, Homer. And see here... see that *bud* that's just above the stem? That's the bud for *next year's* apple--that's called the *spur*. You pick the spur, you pickin' two years in one--you pickin' next year's apple 'fore it have a chance to grow. You leave that on the branch, you hear?

Homer nods; he picks more carefully, with more concentration.

Homer can see over the apple mart parking lot from the top of the tree. He can see the driveway of the Worthington house, where Candy and Olive are saying a tearful good-bye to Wally. Distracted, Homer drops another couple of apples, which Mr. Rose observes with a wry smile.

EXT./INT. CAPE KENNETH/WALLY'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the bicycle stowed in the trunk, Candy is driving Homer back to the cider house. They pass a drive-in movie theatre, the marquee announcing "CLOSED FOR THE SEASON." Homer stares in awe at the giant blank screen.
</DIRECTION>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A movie *outside*?

	I haven't seen "King Kong" since I was a kid!

<DIRECTION>
INT. DINING HALL - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At one table, the children are happily eating apples; a few of the kids are stuffing apples from a big bowl into their pockets. At another table, Larch, Edna, and Angela sit around an open packing crate of apples. Larch takes a bite from an apple and spits it out. Angela takes the apple out of his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<ANGELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a pie apple, Wilbur. Homer said you're not supposed to eat it!

Angela hands him another apple.
</DIRECTION>
<LARCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So he's an apple expert, is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARCH>
<DIRECTION>
Angela gives him a critical look as Larch takes a bite out of the new apple.
</DIRECTION>
<LARCH>
<DIRECTION>
(sarcastically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my, yes! This is a *far* superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARCH>
<ANGELA>

	Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
(incredulous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARCH>
<DIRECTION>
Both Edna and Angela glower at him.
</DIRECTION>
<LARCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARCH>
<EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
(annoyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He probably doesn't make much money picking apples--he must have had to pay to send them, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<LARCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARCH>
<DIRECTION>
Larch angrily tosses the half-eaten apple into the garbage.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wilbur, it's a *gift*! How can you be angry with Homer for sending us a *gift*?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
Larch stares into space, depressed. Then he examines the crate and finds the mailing label that says "OCEAN VIEW ORCHARDS--CAPE KENNETH, MAINE." He rips it off, holds it up triumphantly.
</DIRECTION>
<LARCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll show him a *gift*! I'll give him a gift he can *use*!

Larch storms out of the room.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CAPE KENNETH - MOVIE THEATRE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A newsreel from the war is playing on the screen--soldiers marching, smiling, waving to the camera. Homer and Candy sit together watching. Homer is completely fascinated; Candy watches Homer as much as the news. Her expression changes when the newsreel cuts to footage from an air raid.
</DIRECTION>

Candy and Homer walk out of the theatre, under the marquee and past the poster for "Wuthering Heights."

Homer is embarrassed; he ducks the question.
</DIRECTION>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what did she die of, exactly?

</HOMER>
<CANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.

	Oh, sure!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>

Homer smiles and shakes his head; Candy starts to laugh.

<HOMER>

	What's the *medical* explanation?

</HOMER>
<CANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, she was in a weakened condition...

<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Homer smiles; he knows she's teasing him, and he likes it.
</DIRECTION>
<HOMER>
<DIRECTION>
(mock serious)

	At least King Kong knew what he *wanted*.

EXT. ORCHARDS - DAY

INT. ST. CLOUD'S - DINING HALL - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edna and Angela face the Board of Trustees around a table. Larch circles the table as everyone reads the contents of a folder. Larch has provided a copy for each member. The three elderly gentlemen on the Board don't speak; they just nod their heads to everything Dr. Holtz or Mrs. Goodhall says.
</DIRECTION>
<LARCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and his *pathetic* resume is the best I've seen. Though I find it hard to believe the Board would be interested in this character.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARCH>
<DR_HOLTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he looks like an excellent young man, a first-rate candidate!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HOLTZ>
<LARCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He looks like a bleeding-heart missionary *moron* to me, but that's going to be the problem with any doctor interested in coming here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARCH>
<MRS_GOODHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_GOODHALL>
<LARCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	*No*! I don't want to know him! He's doing *missionary* work--in *India*! I wrote him *weeks* ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARCH>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Steerforth bursts through the door, having been pushed from behind by Mary Agnes. The two stop when they see what's going on--not to mention Larch's stern expression. They back out. Mary Agnes winking at Dr. Holtz before the door closes. Mrs. Goodhall is ready to continue.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_GOODHALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed--that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.

EXT. CIDER HOUSE - RAINY DAY

The rain beats down on Olive's car. Homer gets soaking wet as he leans in to talk to Candy, who's behind the wheel. Mr. Rose calls to Homer from the doorway of the mill room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MILL ROOM - RAINY DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Rose is instructing Homer as they stand bottling cider in their yellow slickers and rubber boots. Rose Rose is hosing down the pressboards; Muddy and Hero and Peaches are operating the grinder and the press. Jack is stirring the vat. In a defiant, contemptuous way, Jack keeps flicking the ash of his cigarette into the vat. This make everyone uncomfortable; only Mr. Rose doesn't appear to notice.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no *good* cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...

	Of *course* there's worms, Homer! And what is them worms, really? They just *protein*, them worms! They is *good* for you!

Everyone but Jack laughs. He takes a last drag on his cigarette, then deliberately drops it into the vat.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_ROSE>

	That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.

</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
We never see Mr. Rose's knife. We see the men circle each other: Jack takes a swipe at Mr. Rose's head--then he steps back, his yellow slicker slashed open. His slicker is opened up, right up the middle. His shirt underneath the slicker is slashed open, too--he feels his bare chest and stomach, feeling for the cut. But there's no cut--Jack's not bleeding, he's not even scratched. Just his clothes have been slashed.
</DIRECTION>

Wally's car comes bouncing along the ditches of the closed drive-in. Homer is at the wheel; Candy calls out some driving instructions. The car comes to a stop next to a speakerpost. Candy leans out; she grabs the speaker and hangs it on the window. Homer sits back and drapes his arms out the window and over the seat. He feels great.

</CANDY>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.

Homer's expression changes from exhilarated to guilty. He leans back in his seat and looks straight ahead at the screen. Candy tentatively leans her head on his shoulder. Homer looks afraid to breathe.
</DIRECTION>

From behind, with her head on his shoulder, they look like a normal couple. We track in toward the huge screen until we see only the screen. There are shadows on the black screen. Suddenly the movie "King Kong" appears.

INT. DINING HALL - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
"King Kong" is playing against the bare, white wall. Fuzzy is very weak, but he smiles at the sight of the love-struck Kong holding the screaming Fay Wray in his giant hand. Dr. Larch runs the projector; he sits close beside Fuzzy. When the film breaks in the predictable place, Fuzzy makes no protest. Dr. Larch looks at Fuzzy, who has stopped breathing; his eyes are closed.

As the men sit at the picnic table eating their cornbread, Rose Rose pours coffee. A jeep comes down the orchard road toward them. It's Olive. Mr. Rose leads the "Good mornin', Mrs. Worthin'ton!" greeting. Olive has an armful of clothing and a fairly sizable package; she brings the latter over to Homer.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>

	Some mail for you, Homer.

	Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?

<DIRECTION>
She finds and old piece of glass among the stones and shells at the high-tide mark.

Candy holds up a piece of glass to the sun for Homer to look at. The ocean is a gray-green color, the glass a paler shade of green.
</DIRECTION>
<CANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me your hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANDY>
<DIRECTION>
She rubs the smooth piece of glass against his hand, then throws it toward the water. It falls short. Homer retrieves it. Candy splashes him playfully. He chases her away from the beach, into the pine trees. Homer locks his arms around her, from behind. He can't let go. She lets him hold her, then breaks his grip. She turns to face him. She is taller then he is, older, obviously more experienced. She initiates the kiss. They drop to the ground right there; they make love by the roots of the tree, Candy guiding him.
</DIRECTION>

	I used to hate it when Wally went back to college--even when it was just college! And this was when his father was still alive... I hated it even then. Naturally I hate this more.

Homer nods in sympathy. His mouth is stuffed with apple pie.

	There's not a lot of work in the winter, and you'll have to tolerate Vernon--even Wally despises him, and Wally likes everyone.

Olive's thoughts drift; her eyes look up at a photo of Wally.

EXT. CIDER HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pickers are moving out; the harvest is over. Olive and Homer stand near the door to the bunkhouse, talking--we can't hear their conversation. Rose Rose and the other men walk past them, carrying the last of their belongings to the truck. Olive and Homer walk over to the truck.

When absolutely helpless women tell me that they simply *can't* have an abortion, that they simply *must* go through with having another--and yet another-- orphan... do I interfere? *Do* I? I do not.

INT. BUNKHOUSE - EARLY EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the newly painted, spruced-up cider house, Homer and Candy are dancing to another slow, sexy song on the radio. He is untucking her blouse, feeling under her blouse--she starts to unbutton his shirt. They kiss while they dance. But the song changes abruptly on the radio to something fast and silly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Homer responds to the music, dancing goofily--instantly out of the mood. Candy laughs, but she picks up a pillow and swings it at him, hitting him. He dances away from her. She throws the pillow; he ducks--the pillow lands somewhere near the door. Now Homer grabs a pillow and chases her from bed to bed. She shrieks--they're both laughing. They each grab a pillow and stand toe to toe whacking each other, laughing all the while, until he pins her arms behind her and, breathing hard--and despite the stupid music that broke the mood--they are passionately kissing again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of a truck is sudden and loud.

<MUDDY>

	It's that Candy, too...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Then comes Mr. Rose, slyly smiling, taking it all in--there's no hiding what's going on. Homer and Candy are caught, their shirts untucked and half-unbuttoned--they're still out of breath. The pillows lie crazily on the beds, each one of which has been stepped on.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_ROSE>

EXT. ORCHARDS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pickers on their ladders, all picking. Homer is now a good picker; he looks over at Rose Rose. She is slumped against the ladder, not picking, completely ignoring an argument beneath them in the aisle between the trees. (Mr. Rose is checking over the apples Peaches has just picked.)

<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So we should "wait and see." For how long?

Rose Rose lies down on her bed with the curtain open. There is something familiar about the way Homer approaches her bedside; he does so with the authority of a doctor. He sits on the edge of her bed with such complete self-assurance that she doesn't protest.

<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many months are you?

Rose Rose dismissively waves her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<CANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's the father, Rose?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Rose looks at Candy and shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<CANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to have the baby?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Rose Rose shakes her head again, more emphatically.
</DIRECTION>
<CANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANDY>
<ROSE_ROSE>

	I can't go nowhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE_ROSE>
<CANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Rose Rose stays silent.
</DIRECTION>
<CANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it the father? Does he know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Rose Rose turns away from Candy.
</DIRECTION>
<CANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANDY>
<ROSE_ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
(almost wistfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE_ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Rose Rose stops; she can't even continue setting the table. Her voice turns bitter, despairing.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It sure ain't Jack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE_ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
There, suddenly, is Mr. Rose, walking past them. He is uncharacteristically tentative.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
(to his daughter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be up top...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Rose leaves Candy and Rose Rose alone again. Rose Rose nods almost invisibly after her father. Rose Rose looks pointedly at Candy, nodding. Candy slowly gets it. Mr. Rose is the father! Rose Rose lets that sink in; she keeps looking at Candy with an ashamed expression.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ORCHARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pickers are at work, on their ladders, when Candy runs down the aisle between two rows of trees. She stops at the bottom of Homer's ladder, out of breath. Muddy and Peaches and Hero, in the treetops, are watching and listening.
</DIRECTION>
<CANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She won't go to St. Cloud's!

	Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.

	<DIALOGUE>
	He's the *father*! He's her baby's father!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANDY>
<DIRECTION>
The pickers can't help but hear this, too. Candy starts to leave, Homer running after her.
</DIRECTION>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait... *wait*! Are you sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<CANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got to keep her away from that bastard!

</CANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Candy leaves. Homer starts looking for Mr. Rose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ORCHARD, NEAR CIDER HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiling his enigmatic smile, Mr. Rose keeps slowly picking while Homer stands at the foot of his ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_ROSE>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it true?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Rose stops picking, his eyes darting to see who's around.
</DIRECTION>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sleeping with your own daughter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Rose, with deliberate slowness, comes down the ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
(slyly; still composed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_ROSE>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<MR_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ain't nobody havin' *sex* with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_ROSE>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Rose switches from sly to threatening in a split second.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Homer, don't you know what business you in? You don't wanna go into no business with me, Homer--ain't that right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_ROSE>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Rose is indignant.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You a fine one to be talkin' about lies. Shame! These people took you in. That boy Wally's at *war*!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
That takes some of the steam out of Homer's superiority.
</DIRECTION>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But she's your *daughter*...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<MR_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I *love* her! There ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as I do!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, Homer--you must know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Homer turns; he speaks over his shoulder as he walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's *pregnant*. Do you know *that*?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<DIRECTION>
By his expression--he looks as if he's been punched--it's clear that Mr. Rose didn't *know that*.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other pickers are on their way to lunch; it's obvious that Muddy, Peaches, and Hero already know that Mr. Rose is sleeping with his daughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CIDER HOUSE - PICNIC AREA - LUNCHTIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rose Rose is sitting at the picnic table when the pickers arrive for lunch, almost simultaneously with Homer. He looks at, then looks away from, Rose Rose. Mr. Rose is the last to sit down at the table as a very tense, wordless lunch begins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ORCHARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Homer is on a ladder picking apples. Muddy climbs a ladder on the other side of the same tree.
</DIRECTION>
<MUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't mess in this, Homer, if you know what's good for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUDDY>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long's this been going on, Muddy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<MUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Long enough. You ain't gonna stop it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Muddy looks all around for Mr. Rose; then he gives Homer his knife.
</DIRECTION>
<MUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's my knife, Homer. It ain't gonna do *me* no good. You give that knife to Rose Rose, you hear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Homer nods, pocketing the knife. As Muddy climbs down and moves his ladder to an adjacent tree, he keeps talking to Homer until he disappears in the leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<MUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You best just watch you ass, Homer! You don't wanna end up like Jack!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Homer thoughtfully continues his work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUNKHOUSE - LATE AT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Homer lies awake in his bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ORCHARD - LATE AFTERNOON, ANOTHER DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pickers on their ladders in the trees; nobody is talking. In the late sun, the leaves have a reddish, fiery glow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ORCHARD - ANOTHER DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's much colder; the pickers are on their ladders in the trees again, but they're dressed for the cold. Homer is high on a ladder; he turns toward the view of the Worthington house when he hears a car come to a screeching halt in the driveway. Homer sees Candy get out of Wally's car; she leaves the door open and runs toward the house. Parked in front of Wally's car is an Army Jeep, with an ENLISTED MAN leaning against it. The indifferent soldier smokes a cigarette as he watches Candy run.
</DIRECTION>
<CANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Homer descends the ladder and runs for the house, down as aisle between the row of trees. The pickers watch him run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera follows Homer into the Worthington house where, from the front hall, he sees Olive and Candy (in profile) sitting on the couch. We can't see who's talking, nor do we recognize the voice. As Homer comes into the living room, we see MAJOR WINSLOW sitting in a chair (also in profile), talking to Olive and Candy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Major Winslow is a smooth, handsome well-briefed officer in the casualty branch of the Army Air Corps; he's done his homework, but he's not all business. He's painfully aware of the delicate nature of his report.
</DIRECTION>
<MAJOR_WINSLOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When the plane was hit, the crew chief and the radioman jumped close together. The copilot jumped third. All on Captain Worthington's orders-- the captain was still flying the plane. None of the men of the ground could see the sky--that's how thick the jungle was. They never saw the plane crash--they never *heard* it crash. They never saw Captain Worthington's parachute, either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAJOR_WINSLOW>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why was he missing for twenty days?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<MAJOR_WINSLOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because the crew thought he'd gone down with the plane. They were hospitalized for almost a week in China before they were flown back to India. It wasn't until that they sorted through their gear...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAJOR_WINSLOW>
<CANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who cares about their *gear*?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANDY>
<MAJOR_WINSLOW>

	Three men jumped from the plane, but they had four compasses with them. One of the crew jumped with Captain Worthington's compass.

<CANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was in Burma for twenty days without a compass?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANDY>
<MAJOR_WINSLOW>

	He followed the Irrawaddy River, all the way to Rangoon. Somehow he managed to avoid the Japs, but not the mosquitoes.

<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then it's malaria?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are no autonomic effects, are there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<DIRECTION>
Major Winslow has to consult his notes.
</DIRECTION>
<MAJOR_WINSLOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No autonomic effects... that's correct.

</MAJOR_WINSLOW>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When will he be home, Major?

INT./EXT. WALLY'S CAR - LOBSTER POUND - END OF DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Homer and Candy are sitting in the parked car in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<HOMER>
<DIRECTION>
(finally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are no autonomic effects, just the paralysis of the lower extremities.

Candy stares at him, uncomprehending.

<HOMER>

Candy cries.

Ray is throwing snails in the water. Candy sits on the end of the dock, slumped on Homer's shoulder.

</RAY>
<CANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy, *please*...

Ray knows that she wants him to leave. He shuffles off the dock, toward the house. He knows how they both must feel.

	Good night, kids. Don't catch cold-- it's gettin' cold already.

<DIRECTION>
Candy buries her face in his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<CANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...to do nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Homer holds her, doing nothing, while she sobs. As her crying subsides, Homer's thoughts are far away. With Candy slumped against him, hugging him, he doesn't look at her; instead, he looks out to sea and at the darkening coast, Candy's words resonating. An unfamiliar expression is on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<HOMER>
<DIRECTION>
(mumbling to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a tempting idea, I know... to do nothing.

Candy is silent. Homer feels strangely agitated; he shifts his position.

INT. BUNKHOUSE - NIGHT

Muddy, Hero and Peaches smoke in their beds. Rose Rose opens her curtain and peers out from her bed. She gets up and goes toward the kitchen area in her nightshirt; she stops at an unused bed, now covered with white rubber sheeting--Homer's medical instruments are displayed and ready. Homer finished scrubbing his hands in the sink. His surgical mask is loosely tied around his neck.

Mr. Rose is looking at Homer's surgical instruments when Rose Rose joins him.

Rose Rose, curled in a fetal position, listens to the rain on the roof. Candy sits on her bed beside her. She helps her to sit up, to drink a glass of water; then Rose Rose lies down again. Rose Rose's expression never changes while Candy talks to her. Mr. Rose lies in his bed in the exact same fetal position as his daughter; he too, is listening to Candy. Homer is putting away his instruments.

	At least there's no more waiting and seeing. At least I got to see the ocean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<DIRECTION>
Candy covers her face in her hands and cries uncontrollably, unstoppably. Homer's anger keeps him impervious to her tears-- another "first" for him. He turns and looks at her with an almost clinical curiosity; then he goes back to staring at the blank screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ORCHARD - IN FRONT OF THE APPLE MART - DAWN
</DIRECTION>

The rain has stopped but the grass is wet, the trees glistening in the dawn light as Wally's car stops and Homer gets out. The car exits the frame in one direction; Homer, walking, exits the frame in another.

INT. BUNKHOUSE - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rose Rose's bed is exposed. The curtains are flung open; her bed is empty. Mr. Rose is still in his bed, in the fetal position we have seen before. Mr. Rose's trancelike expression doesn't change as Homer and Muddy enter.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_ROSE>

	Ain't nobody gonna find her, Homer-- she's long gone.

Homer takes the blanket off him; Muddy gasps. Homer tries to examine Mr. Rose's wound. Mr. Rose smiles at him.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's too late for the doctor now, Homer--ain't that right?
	</DIALOGUE>

<MR_ROSE>

Homer finds Mr. Rose's knife. There's blood everywhere.

Homer and Muddy exchange a glance. Mr. Rose, with his blood- soaked hand, suddenly grabs Homer by the throat.

Mr. Rose dies. Muddy turns away. Homer closes Mr. Rose's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CIDER HOUSE, ROOF - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Muddy and Hero and Peaches are sitting close together on the roof, like banished children. It is from their perspective that we see the police car and the ambulance--two men carrying the body out of the cider house, and a cop or two talking to Homer and Olive, and Homer talking to them. We hear no dialogue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. APPLE MART - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Homer and the men load crates of apple jelly onto a truck. The mood is solemn; they work with tired focus. Candy drives up. The men are evasive with her; they find a reason to work across the mart. Candy walks to Homer, stands next to him. They say nothing for a moment, until Candy breaks the silence.
</DIRECTION>
<CANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think she'll be all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANDY>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She knows how to take care of herself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<DIRECTION>
Candy looks away; she can't think of what to say. She shoves her hands into her pockets, finds a letter there, which she hands to Homer.
</DIRECTION>
<CANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANDY>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>

Homer looks at the letter from St. Cloud's; he puts it unopened in his pocket without a second thought. Candy can't let things end there.
</DIRECTION>
<CANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CANDY>

<HOMER>

Candy can only stare straight ahead.

A tear rolls down Candy's cheek, Homer wipes it away; then he stops touching her and looks off into the quiet orchards.

INT. DISPENSARY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Larch has twisted himself on the narrow bed so that his face is unusually close to the windowsill, and when the ether cone starts to fall off his face--and his slack hand trails down, off the side of the bed--the cone becomes caught against the windowsill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to turn his face away from the cone, but he presses his face into the sill--thus holding the ether-soaked cone over his mouth and nose. His hands twitch, he's trying to wake up; the hand that holds the ether bottle lets the bottle fall. The bottle shatters against the sill; the ether spreads, running red with blood from a cut on Dr. Larch's hand or finger. Music continues Over. It's a funeral.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Buster is bringing in the wood as the music plays Over. Buster smells the spilled ether. He heads toward the dispensary, sniffing. Camera follows him into the dispensary.

EXT. PICKERS' TRUCK - CIDER/PACKING HOUSE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The truck is packed for the long trip south; it passes by the packing house, which looks closed for the season. No one else is about. Muddy is driving slowly, his arm out the open window. In the back, huddled among their belongings, are Peaches and Hero (on one side) and Homer (on the other). The pickers are trying to draw Homer into their conversation, while Homer is giving the apple farm a good-bye look. He has made up his mind about something.

EXT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE, DRIVEWAY - MORNING

As the pickers' truck drives past, Homer is on the side of the truck nearest the Worthington house and driveway; he sees Olive and Candy and Ray helping Wally out of the car and into a wheelchair. A NURSE stands by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wally is wearing what appears to be an oversized officer's coat or flight jacket, his face looking small in the overlarge clothes. He can't move his legs at all, and his mouth is drawn into a tight-lipped smile.

	It's from the ocean. It's for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<DIRECTION>
Curly is duly impressed; he walks away to examine his new treasure. Homer continues unpacking. He pulls his X ray out and puts it aside.
</DIRECTION>
<BUSTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUSTER>
<DIRECTION>
Homer turns to see Buster, Mary Agnes, Angela, and Edna in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY_AGNES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We made up a room for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_AGNES>
<ANGELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wouldn't you be more comfortable by yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELA>
<DIRECTION>
Homer smiles; he nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Angela and Mary Agnes start to put Homer's things back in his bag. Edna picks up the X ray and looks at it with a somber expression.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Homer, do you know what this is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. It's my heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<ANGELA>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes her head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, it's Fuzzy's. There's nothing wrong with your heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELA>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuzzy's?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Larch wanted to keep you out of the war, Homer--that's why he did it. That's why he told you it was yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
Homer is stunned; he puts his hand to his heart.
</DIRECTION>
<ANGELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think he worried about his own heart. He said it would never stand up to Homer Wells going off to war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELA>
<DIRECTION>
Homer takes that in; he nods. Mary Agnes touches him sympathetically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LARCH'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Homer looks at his fake diplomas; they are now framed and hanging on the office wall. Homer surveys the office, as if for the first time; he sits down in the desk chair, as if slowly getting used to his new position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOYS' DIVISION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Homer reads to the boys from "David Copperfield". While his voice is strong--positive, optimistic, certainly reassuring to the boys--there is in the conclusion of the chapter something that distracts him. He seems to hesitate; he misses a line or two, and perhaps he purposely skips one or two others. (Possibly Homer's eyes wander ahead, to the title of the next chapter: "I Make Another Beginning.")
</DIRECTION>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Thus I began my new life, in a new name, and with everything new about me... I felt... like one in a dream... The remembrance of that life is fraught with so much... want of hope... Whether it lasted for a year, or more, or less, I do not know. I only know that it was, and ceased to be; and... there I leave it."
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<DIRECTION>
Homer stops and looks at the boys' faces.
</DIRECTION>
<CURLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happens next?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CURLY>
<DIRECTION>
Homer smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's tomorrow, Curly. Let's mot give the story away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<DIRECTION>
Homer puts out the lights and leaves the boys in the familiar semi-darkness. Seconds, later, the closed door to the hall is flung open, flooding the room with light from the hall, and Homer, dressed in his long white laboratory coat and looking every inch the doctor, delivers his best imitation of Larch's popular blessing.
</DIRECTION>
<HOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night, you Princes of Maine! You Kings of New England!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOMER>
<DIRECTION>
On Copperfield and Steerforth and Curly as the door to the hall is closed and semi-darkness prevails in the room again. Copperfield, smiling, shuts his eyes. After a second, the wide-eyed Steerforth shuts his eyes, too. Then Curly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The last to close his eyes is Buster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
