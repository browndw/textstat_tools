EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAWN CLOSE ON the anxious, sweating, frightened face of DREW MacLEOD, 17, running to save her life. Think Dustin Hoffman in Marathon Man -- someone, something -- is after her but UNSEEN. She glances fearfully behind at her mysterious pursuer, her BREATHING becoming more labored. Cutting through a deserted park, she leaps a bench. Above her, the thin morning sun has only begun to lighten the leaves. Around the corner, she's back on a sidewalk lined with beautiful homes, all quiet at dawn, the only noise her racing FOOTSTEPS and quickening BREATHS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DREW'S POV - HER OWN FRONT DOOR and safety loom half a block down. She pours on the effort, hurdles a hedge, jumps the stairs and makes the door, rips it open, bolts inside and SLAMS it shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE SHRUB where, with the CAMERA AT GROUND LEVEL, a GOLDEN RETRIEVER PUPPY, unable to leap the hedge, PLOWS INTO IT HEADFIRST and disappears. YELP!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - FOYER - CONTINUOUS ACTION Drew, wheezing from the exertion, pulls an ASTHMA INHALER from her pocket, takes a hit, then peeks out the window in the front door and sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DREW'S POV The puppy squeezes through the hedge, wiggling its bum to extricate itself. A SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL picks it up, hugs it close:

INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - PARKER'S ROOM - MORNING CLOSE ON A JAPANESE EXECUTIVE (with a CLOCK in his belly) which suddenly begins SCREAMING IN JAPANESE, ITS JAW WAGGING. From under piles of clothes and sheets, PARKER MacLEOD, 17, Drew's twin sister, opens one eye, shuts OFF the shrieking ALARM CLOCK. With a SIGH, she throws her feet over the edge of the bed. Her room is a train wreck. Grabbing a MatchBox 20 T-shirt from the pile on the bed, she gives it a sniff. Good enough. Pulling it on, she pauses, looks a bit concerned down at her navel. A recent belly-button piercing looks a little red. She touches it. Ouch. When a RINGING is heard, she begins tossing clothes, blankets, shoes, trying to unearth the source. She pulls her BLACKBERRY from under the covers: THOREAU 786: MADE CRITICAL ERROR LAST P.M. Parker snickers, types her return from... NOTATWIN: CONFESS THOREAU 786: DROPPED TRIPLE DEPTH CHARGE AFTER DINNER. NOTATWIN: THAT MUCH CAFFEINE IS ILLEGAL IN UTAH. THOREAU 786: THEN BOUGHT 'NO MONEY DOWN' REAL ESTATE COURSE AROUND 3:00 A.M. This makes her smile. NOTATWIN: A CAREER MAN. I LIKE THAT. CUT TO:

INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING Drew stands before the mirror, perfecting perfection. In a tasteful suit, hair just so, she opens the drawer... ... which is hyper-organized, everything in a little labeled nook. She pulls out tweezers and we see beneath where it says, "tweezers." She leans into the mirror very close, spots a stray eyebrow hair, plucks it. Pulling back, she raises her other eyebrow. Huh. Now they're not even.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She leans in again and plucks one from the other eyebrow. Uh-oh. This is like when your mom cuts your hair and keeps cutting to get it even until you're shaved. She reaches for the other side... but suddenly catches herself and stops. Deep breath. Let's not get too psychotic. She dunks the tweezers in the alcohol jar, then replaces them. Checking her teeth, she spots a stuck bit. Grabbing her WATER PICK she begins cleaning her teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Startled, Drew shoots herself in the eye with the water pick. Parker's ENTERED from her side. Drew shuts off the water pick, dries her face.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why the young executive look?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have my interview at NYU today.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Parker, sleepy, stretches, unaware she's exposing her new belly ring.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way Mom knows about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Self-consciously, Parker drops her arms, pulls her shirt down.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And she never will. At least until after I'm married.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't it hurt?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like hell.

<DIRECTION>
Drew shivers.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Piercings are so... unhygienic.

<DIRECTION>
A little BEEP BEEP from her preset WATCH ALARM goes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Breakfast.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Drew turns on her heel and EXITS. When Parker sets her Blackberry down we get our first glimpse of... ... HER SIDE OF THE BATHROOM which resembles a post- apocalyptic toiletry landscape. There's a very clear line of demarcation on the counter like the demilitarized zone separating the Koreas. Parker reaches among the rubble for her toothbrush but notices another message on her Blackberry: THOREAU 786: KNOW WHAT TODAY IS? NOTATWIN: ANOTHER DAY IN HELL? THOREAU 786: TWO WEEKS SINCE OUR FIRST CHAT. NOTATWIN: OUR ANNIVERSARY. HOW SWEET. THOREAU 786: SINCE IT'S A SPECIAL OCCASION, MY REAL NAME'S WARREN COLLIER. IF YOU'RE EVER IN THE CITY, I'D LOVE TO MEET. GOTTA GO. Accompanying the text, a PICTURE Warren has sent finishes downloading -- eighteenish, the shaggy chic, Calvin Klein model-type.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly wide-awake)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hellooo, Warren.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Distracted, Parker drops her toothbrush, which bounces off the counter and PLOPS into the toilet. ON THE TOILET BOWL -- there it is, slowly sinking. Parker is stone-faced. She looks to her sister's side of the counter where a fresh brush sits in the flowered holder. She's considering... she's reaching... then... nah. Instead, she squeezes the tube straight into her mouth, brushes with a finger and spits.

INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING Drew's seated, napkin on lap, eating granola and studying her open DAYBOOK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DR. QUINN MacLEOD, dressed professionally and obviously together even at this hour, pours coffee for herself and her husband, PROFESSOR CHARLEY MacLEOD, who ENTERS still in his ratty old bathrobe and outrageous bed-head. As a matter of routine, Quinn holds out his cup and he takes it, kisses her and sits down to the paper.

<CHARLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(sigh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sweety, my writing process is a lot like a giant hydroelectric dam. For a long time I just let the great ideas build up and build up until the sheer weight of them spills over and the words just come pouring out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still stuck, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHARLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not a word.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Parker ENTERS with her Blackberry in hand, smooches her pop, then takes a sat. Parker's clearly a chip off her Dad's block. Both pour milk first into their bowl, then Charley drops in Super Sugar Crisp while Parker pours in Count Chocula. Both hit 'em with a couple of spoons of extra sugar. Mom takes a seat, too, primly eating a piece of dry wheat toast that she slices in half first. Like Mom, like Drew. Drew spots the BLACKBERRY JPEG of Warren before Parker can turn it over.

<DREW>

(funny you should ask)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've prepared a color-coded itinerary based on dividing the day into fifteen minute increments alternating blue/red, double- checked the train schedule, confirmed with the Weather Channel and rehearsed a couple of alternate scenarios last night, you know, just to account for all the possible glitches.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll take that as a yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHARLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm proud of you for sticking to your plan all these years, sweety.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I still don't understand why you want to finish college in two years? What's the big hurry?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to hit the ground running. All those football games and the partying and the whole dating scene. It just seems like a lot of wasted time that could be spent more productively.
	</DIALOGUE>
<QUINN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Accelerated program would look great on your med school application.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Football games I get. But partying? A waste of time?

Parker looks to her dad. He shrugs.

	What -- ?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Drew CHOKES on her granola and a little milk trickles out her nose.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't that great! We can do some shopping, have lunch, real girl stuff. Won't that be fun?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you want to have fun, I'm the one who should go, not Mother Teresa over there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Drew is still choking -- pretty badly.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me know if you want me to do the Heimlich. It'd be cool to have you owe me your life.

WHOOSH! The granola goes down and she sucks air.

<QUINN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and both my babies are going away to college next Fall.

<DIRECTION>
She takes her plate and goes to the sink and Parker follows her, putting an arm around her shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be sad, Mom. Just think, when Drew leaves for school, you won't be losing a daughter, you'll be losing an anal-retentive social misfit who will be voted most likely to die a virgin.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Drew throws an arm around Quinn's other shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Mom. It's really sweet of you. But don't worry. Parker will be living here with you forever since no college on earth will ever take her.

The BEEP BEEP of Drew's alarm WATCH signals time to go. Drew is trying to cover up, but she's reeling from the news that her mother's going to accompany her.

INT. DREW'S ROOM - MORNING Drew's room looks like a four-star hotel suite. Almost trembling with tension, she ENTERS and immediately sits down at her desk with her DAYPLANNER, turning to the present DATE: CLOSE ON THE PAGE, WHERE EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES IS COLOR- CODED AND ACCOUNTED FOR RIGHT UP TO... 2:07 -- PROFESSOR QUE SPAULDING, CHAIR, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY ACCELERATED STUDIES PROGRAM, ADMINISTRATION BUILDING, SUITE 101.

</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're smart. You're resourceful. You'll find a way to make it work.

She tries to sell herself on this by smiling, but something in the smile suggests SHE'S SCREWED. Collecting her Dayplanner, purse, interview file and cell phone, she drops them into her matching Coach shoulder bag.

EXT. DRIVEWAY - MacLEOD HOUSE - MORNING Quinn hops in her Saab. ANGLE ON the doorway, where Drew pauses, takes a deep breath to brace herself, then walks like a condemned prisoner to her mother's car and climbs in.

Drew smiles, hugs her mom and jumps out, waving as her mom backs down the drive and disappears down the street. With the weight of the world suddenly lifted from her shoulders, Drew looks to the sky and mouths, "thank you." This is when Parker comes hauling down the driveway in her Honda Accord. Drew signals her to stop, so of course her sister IGNORES HER and jets into the street.

	You know, Parker. Chemistry is important. When you think about it, everything's made of chemicals.

	Oh, I'm interested in chemistry. Just not the kind with all the numbers and stinky test tubes.

INT. FIRST TRAIN CAR - MORNING Drew finds a seat. She neatly folds her jacket and sets it next to her. She pulls out a lumbar support pillow and tucks it behind her -- just right. Next, she takes out a tiny inflatable lap desk, blows it up and sets it across her lap. A pen goes in the little holder. Coffee from her Thermos. After laying out her interview materials, she turns to her reflection in the window.

An EXECUTIVE takes the aisle seat next to her, and after a sideways glance at Drew's portable office, opens his Wall Street Journal as the train begins to pull away. EVERY COMMUTER is quietly reading the paper or staring off into their own world, wondering why their life has lead them to this sad moment when... ... they're all distracted by an AWFUL, AWFUL VOICE singing Sheryl Crow's "Soak Up the Sun." It's Parker, wearing her headphones and looking for a seat in the full train car. Drew stares at her, dumbfounded.

	No! It's about spontaneity, which you obviously wouldn't know anything about.

He goes back to his paper.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE PLATFORM No Parker. He hauls Drew down the aisle but as they EXIT THE CAR, SHE BUMPS HEAD-ON INTO BIKE MESSENGER/PRE-MED/MOUNTAIN CLIMBER/MALE MODEL GUY -- they really do CRACK FOREHEADS, OUCH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IS DREW SEEING STARS? OR IS IT THE MAGIC OF THIS INSTANT IN TIME WITH DREAM GUY? BOTH OF THEM SHAKE OFF THE WOOZIES. He smiles:
</DIRECTION>
<DREAM_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm... ouch.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CONDUCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's fine, considering she should be in jail.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As the Conductor escorts her down the stairs, she and Dream Guy share a last look before she's... ... left on the platform just as the train's pulling out. Still no sign of Parker and Drew doesn't have all her wits about her.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This can't be happening! I have a... a... little paper thingy. What are they called? Ticket! I have a ticket! It's right...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She drops her bag, contents spilling willy-nilly. On her hands and knees, she frantically searches for her ticket in the mess. The Conductor, however, is already on the train stop as it pulls away. He just waves, victorious. Parker steps back out onto the platform and the Conductor spots her. He looks from one sister to the other -- oops, mistake. But it's too late. Sheepishly, he climbs inside and the train is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
<DIRECTION>
(to the gods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	AARRGGH! PARRR... KERRR!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Parker steps up from behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You get kicked off, too? Why didn't you just buy a ticket?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Parker stoops to help collect a couple of things but Drew, mad at hell, swats her hand away.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to your head?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, just a minor concussion I sustained while the Conductor was throwing me off the train because he thought I was you sneaking back on the train!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll bet.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Drew throws her bag over her shoulder and heads for the ticket counter. The WELT on her forehead is gonna be a doozey.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
(calling after)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am! Where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To see when the next train leaves.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I already --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
But Drew's inside the stationhouse.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- did. They said something about a delay.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Parker follows into the stationhouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRENTON TRAIN STATION - CONTINUOUS ACTION Packed with frustrated COMMUTERS. Drew's standing in a long line at the ticket counter, steaming, turning a cold shoulder on... ... Parker, who walks right through to the street side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRENTON TRAIN STATION - STREET SIDE - CONTINUOUS ACTION Parker steps outside where it's just as crowded. She scopes the situation, which isn't good -- stranded COMMUTERS jostle for the few remaining TAXIS. TWO EXECUTIVES get into a shoving match. To the left, a couple of BLACK LINCOLN TOWN CARS -- standard car service rigs -- sit IDLING, each with a DRIVER next to it, holding up his sign with his client's name scratched on it. An EXECUTIVE (#2) passes her, finger in the air, signaling the FIRST DRIVER who holds a sign that read: "Wilcox."
</DIRECTION>
<EXECUTIVE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
With no further ado, the driver opens the back door for him, the Exec climbs in, the driver hustles around to his side and in an instant, the car leaves the chaos behind. Parker raises an eyebrow. Hm. The second driver (BENNIE) with a head like a cinder block and no neck, is talking on his cell phone and holding up a sign, "SCARPELLI." Parker shoots a finger into the air. This barely gets his attention but he nods, nonchalantly. Parker signals again -- one minute -- then turns back inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRENTON TRAIN STATION Drew has reached the counter, where a bitter TRAIN CLERK who wishes he'd paid attention in school is tired of angry commuters.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That can't be. I have to be there before two!
	</DIALOGUE>
<TRAIN_CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, maybe if you flap your arms real fast you can fly there, because you won't get there on a train.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
<DIRECTION>
(about to explode)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you just say?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Parker arrives in the nick of time, pulling her by the arm.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. Hurry. I got us a ride.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let go of my arm.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
But Parker drags her away. Drew shoots a look back at the Clerk, who sticks out his tongue at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRENTON TRAIN STATION - CONTINUOUS ACTION Parker pulls Drew toward the Town Car.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A car service.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Car service? You couldn't have called for a...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
But Bennie opens the door for Parker like he's done it a thousand times.
</DIRECTION>
<BENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning, miss.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning. Thank you. My sister's coming, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Drew KNOWS SOME SKETCHY SHIT IS GOING DOWN buy she's only got this instant to consider. She glances at the STRANDED MOB descending on a lone approaching CAB, engulfing it.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to make that interview, or not?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Drew lets herself be pulled inside. Bennie shuts the door and waddles around to his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOWN CAR - MORNING Parker tries to play cool -- Drew's rigid -- angry and afraid. Bennie checks his invoice.
</DIRECTION>
<BENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're headed to the Teamster's Hall on Second Street?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
(chewing a lip)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, Mister...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She checks his Chauffeur's License up front: Benjamin Loyola.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Loyola.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bennie.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Bennie? We have a slight change of itinerary. We need to go into Manhattan. 57th and 5th will be fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Bennie doesn't seem perturbed a bit.
</DIRECTION>
<BENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's pre-paid. No skin off my nose.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
<DIRECTION>

	Pre-paid? What's 57th and 5th?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering throughout)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Barneys.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not Barneys.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got five hours. Relax.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He FIRES UP the LINCOLN and off they go. Drew now has a pretty clear inclination as to what's going on. She leans into her sister and WHISPERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was supposed to be someone else's car, wasn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENNIE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, Bennie tosses the sign, which he'd stashed on the dash, onto the seat next to him, face up so Drew can read:
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Scarpelli'? We're supposed to be Italian?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Northern Italian.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is so... wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? You need to get to that interview. We now have a ride. We will pay for the ride. End of big deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
This is when Bennie's CELL PHONE RINGS and he answers it.
</DIRECTION>
<BENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. The city.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'a you talkin' about?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Bennie glances into the REARVIEW MIRROR, smiling at the girls...
</DIRECTION>
<BENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I already got 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
... but his smile TURNS DOWN AT THE CORNERS as he listens. The girls exchange doubtful looks. It gets worse.
</DIRECTION>
<BENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're right here in the car.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to girls)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Scuse me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Bennie RAISES THE PRIVACY GLASS but doesn't realize he's left the intercom button on so they can still hear his half of the conversation. The girls are PETRIFIED.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
(low to Drew)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not good.

	What's happening?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(to phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you think that's a little severe? I mean, they didn't see nothin' yet. They can't hear nothin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
YES THEY CAN and they're now scared as hell.
</DIRECTION>
<BENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the boss.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it easy. I'll fix it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't have a shovel. Not today. It'll be a big mess. Besides, I just had this suit cleaned.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The girls want OUT OF THIS CAR!
</DIRECTION>
<BENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take 'em to the wharf, what difference does it make?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Drew yanks out her inhaler and sucks on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
<DIRECTION>
(whispered terror)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Parker, I think maybe we should get out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Parker sees the LIGHT AHEAD TURN RED.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I agree. How about... NOW!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Just as Bennie brakes for the light, Parker throws her door open and pulls Drew into the street! An ONCOMING BUICK LOCKS UP its BRAKES as they dash for the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<BENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey?! Where you goin'?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JERSEY SIDEWALK - MORNING They hit the sidewalk and without breaking stride, race around the first corner, looking back over their shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's stuck at the light!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
VRROOOM! Here comes the Lincoln storming around the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has no respect for traffic laws!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They run into the first ALLEY and hunker down by a GARBAGE CAN. The Lincoln flies past. They dash back out, the same way they came. SCREECH! Bennie LOCKS UP the WHEELS! They round the same corner going the opposite way and Parker pulls them into the first door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MINI-MART - MORNING ... where they crouch down the magazine rack. Among the magazines is DOG FANCY with a picture of a Chinese Crested Hairless on the cover and the headline: "EMPEROR DEFENDS CROWN." Parker peers over the top and out the window. PARKER'S POV -- slowly, the Lincoln cruises the street, Bennie scanning the neighborhood for them.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he gone? I can't believe this. What did you get us into?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We lost him. Wow. That was a rush.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A rush? Are you out of your mind?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BUM>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. Give me a quarter, will ya?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Spooked, they both turn to find a scraggly HOMELESS GUY with a Slushee in his hand. They stand. Parker reaches in her pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI_MART_CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get outta here, Uncle Jerry!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Homeless Guy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have any change, but here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Parker starts to find the Homeless Guy a dollar but Drew reaches over to stop her...
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Parker, you're only feeding the poor man's disease. Buy him a healthy snack.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
... just as the Homeless Guy reaches for the dollar and the SLUSHEE IS KNOCKED FROM HIS HAND. We watch in SLOW MOTION AS THE SLUSHEE TAKES FLIGHT, THE CAP FALLING OFF AND THE STICKY, CHERRY RED MESS FANNING OUT UNTIL... ... BACK TO FAST MOTION -- SPLAT! IT CATCHES DREW FULL- FACED, DRENCHING HER. The Homeless Guy snags the dollar.
</DIRECTION>
<HOMELESS_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta go.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And he EXITS. Parker SNIFFS.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ew. That stinks. That's not just Slushee.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The MINI-MART CLERK approaches them, shaking his head.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI_MART_CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Mad Dog. Look at that mess. It's gonna smell up the store all day.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Drew appears STUNNED, unable to form words so Parker speaks for her.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May we use your bathroom please?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The cherry syrup and cheap wine concoction drips down Drew's blank face.
</DIRECTION>
<MINI_MART_CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gas station at the end of the block. Have a nice day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINI_MART_CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BURT'S PUMP 'N' GO - MORNING BURT, who has no teeth, hands over the restroom key to the girls. The key is attached to a full-sized STEERING WHEEL. Burt SNIFFS, wrinkling his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<BURT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, it's not my place to say, but you young girls got your whole lives ahead of you. You shouldn't be drinkin' at this hour of the day.

<PARKER>

	That's what I keep telling her.

<BURT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Round the side.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BURT'S PUMP 'N' GO - MORNING The girls practically have to drag the key around to the restroom on the side. Parker puts the key in and slowly... slowly... CREAKING... opens the GATES OF HELL ON THE GIRLS -- WHO STARE IN HORROR INTO THE ABYSS FOR A BEAT, THEN:
</DIRECTION>
<GIRLS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	AHHHHHHH!!!!

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUS - MORNING Sitting side by side. A YOUNG MOTHER sits in front of them with her NINE-MONTH-OLD BABY who's standing on the seat facing the girls. Drew's BUMP on her forehead is large and inflamed, her hair a stringy, ratty mess of booze and red-dye number four and glucose. She is in a REALLY BAD MOOD, only staring straight ahead. Parker's playing peek-a-boo with the baby and trying to lighten up her sister's mood.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything's going to be fine.

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
BLECCH! The BABY PUKES all over Drew. She looks sideways at her sister.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will never, ever, forgive you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TIMES SQUARE - MORNING The bus pulls over then pulls away, leaving the girls on the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See? New York. We made it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could be arrested for vagrancy looking like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen. I've got an idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No ideas. I'm going straight to that interview and wait, without moving or speaking, especially to you, for four hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
(ignoring her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on! We're going to the Plaza! We can be Eloise! We'll get a nice room, you can take a shower and I'll swap clothes with you! Simple as that!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have the slightest clue what that would cost?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So? You've got the emergency credit card Mom gave you, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Drew's suddenly looking at her EMPTY HANDS.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong?

	Oh.

<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He knows where I live. He's going to hunt me down and kill me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Drew. I don't think even the Mafia kills people just for scamming a ride. Quit being paranoid.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, we don't do the Plaza. I've got...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Parker digs in her pockets.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Six dollars and thirty-two cents.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That won't get me hosed down at a car wash.

<DREW>

	<DIALOGUE>
	My secret-safety twenty. Of course. But it's only for emergencies.

Parker looks her sister right in the eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Drew takes off her shoe, lifts the inner sole and pulls out a twenty, then realizes:
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, how'd you know about my secret-safety twenty?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not important now. But let's just say that it's a good thing for you I think those shoes are so ugly I never borrowed them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, how about there?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Parker points to hotel where the dilapidated sign reads: THE RITZY PLAZA -- HOURLY RATES, HOT TUBS.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I want to get clean, not contract hepatitis.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty-six dollars and thirty-six cents.

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Parker leads them inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE RITZY PLAZA This looks like a good place to get your throat cut fighting over a dime's worth of crack. There's no real lobby, just a small area to stand at the "desk" which is behind iron bars. Behind the iron bars a rabbit-eared TV with a busted-in tube houses a dead houseplant. An old easy chair leaks stuffing.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
(swallowing)

	<DIALOGUE>
	We need a room... with a shower. Just for an hour.
	</DIALOGUE>

There's the sound of something SCRAPING across the floor and then the MIDGET HOTEL CLERK appears behind the counter. Now he's standing on a STOOL and we don't know what he was doing behind the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<DESK_CLERK>

	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
<DESK_CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe if you two were in school you could figure out that half a sixty is thirty.

<PARKER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, all right, don't get your underwear in a bunch. As a public service, just 'cause you stink so bad, you can have it for twenty-five.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He retrieves a key and holds it up just out of reach between the bars.
</DIRECTION>
<DESK_CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten-dollar deposit on key.

<DESK_CLERK>

	I give you some special deal, the next thing you know, you two are telling everybody, hey, this midget was a real sap. We gave him some sob story and the little guy just busted up into crocodile tears and handed over the key.

<DIRECTION>
He grudgingly holds out the key for Parker, who takes it and hands it to Drew while she gets the money out. ON DREW -- sensing something, she looks down at her feet where a HUGE RAT is licking the sweet stuff off her shoes. There's a rather LONG BEAT while this horror sinks in, then:
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	AHHHHHH!!!!

Key in hand, Drew makes a beeline out the door.

	Man, that little guy could really motor. Why'd you bolt?

Drew's sucking on her inhaler but is so irate she spits out the words.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Parker, it was not 'our' money and this is not 'our' day in New York. What it is, is quite possibly the most important day of my life. I've resigned myself to the fact that you don't give a crap about what you do with yours, but if you could find it in your heart, your tiny, cold steel heart, to respect what this means to me, I would appreciate it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
But Parker's not listening. She's staring intently... ... ACROSS THE STREET where several TOWN CARS are parked, the DRIVERS chatting next to a HOT DOG/PRETZEL CART. Among them is Bennie, sipping coffee. Parker spots him and freezes.

	What I meant was, it isn't paranoia if someone really is chasing you.

Parker tries to subtly indicate with her eyes that Drew should look across the street.

<DREW>

	What's wrong with your eyes?

<PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)

Drew finally turns and she, too, freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quiet. Don't run. He'll see us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Not wanting to draw his attention, the Girls shuffle off quickly down the street. ON Bennie -- squinting across at them. Can he make them out in the crowd? He nods to ANOTHER DRIVER, tosses his coffee cup and climbs in behind the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HE SAW US!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The girls break into a run.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd he find us?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it's just coincidence!

<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or maybe WE TOLD HIM WHERE WE WERE GOING!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She points up at the street sign -- 57th and 5th. Oops.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Parker leads her into traffic, HORNS BLARING, as they weave their way across. On the far side, a HORSE CARRIAGE pulls away from the curb and at the last minute, Parker spots a fresh pile of... ... HORSE SHIT, which she manages to leap. Drew, however, ISN'T GOING TO MAKE IT OVER. She closes her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jump!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Drew stumbles, wrong-foots the takeoff but somehow manages to get across it to the curb. For just a BEAT, we see her surprised face. Hm. I did it. Then they see Bennie crossing in traffic, huffing and puffing after them and not seeing the pile, which he hits in full stride, slips on, and PLOPS INTO on his ass. This gives the girls the opening they need and they ditch inside some revolving doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PLAZA - GIRLS' POV - DAY IN THE STREET, Bennie's getting up, brushing the crap off. When a CAB HONKS at him, he gives it an Italian salute and slaps the hood, but when he reaches the curb it's clear: He's lost the girls.

<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Don't look.

<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you ask a question like that, the person is going to look.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Drew drags her behind a palm. Sure enough, across the lobby, a guy dressed as PLAINCLOTHES HOTEL SECURITY (MORTY SESTERO) now pretends he wasn't keeping an eye on them.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think he was.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drew, we haven't done anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but I'm standing in the lobby of the Plaza looking like a deranged street person who might attack at any moment. In fact, I might attack at any moment.

The ELEVATOR behind them opens.

	Great. Now we're emulating Blake Greer, voted most likely to commit a felony before having to shave.

DOWN THE HALL a door swings open and MR. AND MRS. LO BIANCHO, wealthy Bostonians, EXIT their suite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE REVEALS -- at the opposite end of the hallway, Parker and Drew aren't the only ones watching. A PAINTER with one lazy eye, ROGER, pauses with his roller and carefully peeks around the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_LO_BIANCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the New York Kennel Club, Emile, not the New York Knickerbockers. Please call the caterer and cancel the beer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The ELEVATOR OPENS for them and they step in. Parker RUNS LIKE HELL for the door of their suite... it's just about to close when she SLIDES LIKE PETE ROSE INTO FIRST, just getting a hand on it. She lies there on the floor, holding the door and WHISPERS LOUDLY to Drew.

<DIRECTION>
Parker leads her to the big double doors of the master bedroom and slowly OPENS them. There, on the bed, is THE EMPEROR, defending champion of the New York Kennel Club Dog Show. A CHINESE CRESTED HAIRLESS with his little crown sticking straight up, he may be the most absurd-looking dog in history. He simply eyes them. He might even be smiling.

	Hi, little guy. You don't look so tough, huh? You don't look much like a dog, actually. More like Woody Woodpecker.

Happy to give the company, The Emperor practically jumps into Parker's arms.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>

Parker, holding The Emperor, opens the door a crack to keep a lookout.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Come back here, little ratdog. Come to Mommy Parker.

Parker pulls off a shoe and sticks it in the doorway to keep it from closing, then, hesitantly, trying not to spook him into running away from her, she steps into the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - THE PLAZA But sure enough, just as she gets close, he turns and dashes down the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bad ratdog!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She chases him down the hallway and then around the corner where they have to dodge cans of paints, a ladder, until finally The Emperor slides on some plastic sheeting, careens into a can of mauve paint and is COVERED. Arms reach down, pick him up and Parker looks up to see the Painter (ROGER) with the now-mauve Emperor in his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
(breathless)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. Thank you.

WHAM! -- Drew's CLOTHESLINED at the intersection by a BIKE MESSENGER who, in a valiant attempt to avoid her, brakes so hard he flies off the handlebars and lands RIGHT ON TOP OF HER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's DREAM GUY from the train and for a confused BEAT they look into each other's familiar faces where we read recognition, love, unstated chemistry, then:
</DIRECTION>
<DREAM_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, one of us is gonna get hurt if we keep doing this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
O.S. SIRENS signal that the police are now involved.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, complete stranger! Get off my sister!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Parker yanks Drew from underneath Dream Guy.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm, uh, late for this place, thing, where I'm supposed to be. College. Interview!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREAM_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where at?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
But Parker's got her by the arm and she can only call back over her shoulder...
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NYU!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
... before disappearing into the CROWD on the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<DREAM_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(too late)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me, too!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
AROUND THE CORNER comes Morty who, without time to react, trips headfirst over Bike Messenger Guy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDEWALK IN FRONT OF PLAZA - DAY The girls weave through the PEDESTRIANS but spot a COP CAR SCREECHING to a halt in front of them and quickly take a left into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE OTHER ALLEY ADJACENT THE PLAZA - DAY Where to now? Thinking fast, Parker pulls on a door -- locked -- the next door SWINGS OPEN as if by divine providence and two HIGH FASHION MODELS step past them out while the girls step inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RUNWAY SHOW - BACKSTAGE - DAY Chaos. MODELS, DRESSERS, SYCOPHANTS, "I ONLY DATE MODELS" GUYS and the famous couture fashion designer, BOBO, are mid-show and friggin' frantic.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBO>
<DIRECTION>
(French accent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are they?! No more breaks! Do you hear me! We have a show to do, you nitwits! Models! BAH! You have hollow gourds for heads! The kind they make those Mexican rattles out of!
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHOWRUNNER>
<DIRECTION>
(always at his elbow)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maracas.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BOBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maracas! Maracas that take coffee breaks when I am paying them a FORTUNE!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Bobo spots the girls coming through the back door and physically grabs them both, pushing them at the Showrunner.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hair! Makeup!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Parker)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daywear!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Drew)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clubbing! Vite!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
This is when he gets a load of Drew's matted hair, running makeup and shower curtain and does a double-take. Hm. Does he like it?
</DIRECTION>
<BOBO>
<DIRECTION>
(confess)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that Helmut Lang?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(recovering himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Showrunner shoves Drew one way, Parker the other -- Drew looks at her -- what the hell? Parker CLEARLY MOUTHS: HAIR! MAKEUP! CLOTHES! and TEAMS OF DRESSERS virtually surround them. INSIDE THE MOB OF DRESSERS SURROUNDING DREW the HAIR STYLIST raises his brush and scissors, but PAUSES. The rest of the team stops, watching him make his decision. He shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<HAIRSTYLIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perfection.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He excuses himself and the others begin shoving her into couture. CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DRESSING TEAM - A MOMENT LATER And the DRESSING TEAM surrounding Parker parts, revealing her in a very un-Parker-like, super-chic business suit. She catches a glimpse of herself in the mirror and rolls her eyes. Boring. The DREW TEAM parts and we are stunned to see they've chosen to drape her in a show-stopping couture FREAK SHOW OUTFIT that is some sort of marriage between dominatrix and nun, complete with a habit and black leather bikini. ON PARKER who spots Drew and is, for the first time in the movie, speechless.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why does this not surprise me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
THE NEXT MUSIC CUE COMES UP and the SHOWRUNNER grabs Drew...
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, but I'm supposed to be going to my college interview.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHOWRUNNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's rich. A model going to college. What next? Talking monkeys?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
... and pushes her through the curtains and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RUNWAY - DAY FLASH go a hundred CAMERAS! Blinded, Drew stumbles forward on a nine-inch spiked heels down the catwalk. ON THE AUDIENCE -- ALSO SPEECHLESS. This is when Drew catches sight of herself on a TV MONITOR at the end of the walk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her first instinct is to RUN, but suddenly THE AUDIENCE HAS DECIDED -- IT'S A SMASH! THEY APPLAUD MADLY! BRAVO! BRAVO! Drew recovers herself a bit. Wow. They're clapping for me?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RUNWAY SHOW - BACKSTAGE Parker's watching through the curtains when she spots Morty leading two NYPD DETECTIVES (WILLIAMSON AND HOGAN) through the back door. Uh-oh. The Showrunner's holding her arm, waiting to throw her onstage but when Morty turns in her direction, Parker takes the initiative and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RUNWAY ... jumps onstage, vamping it down the catwalk like she was born to it. Drew's still at the end of the runway, basking in the APPLAUSE and attempting to negotiate a precarious turn in her SCARY SPIKED HEELS when Parker approaches her and... ... throws a hand on her hip, thrusts it out -- sexy executive! and leans into her sister:
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The hotel guy's here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The juxtaposition of the TWO POLAR OPPOSITE OUTFITS draped over twins suddenly throws the audience into PAROXYSMS OF APPRECIATION for the inspiration of the artist and they call him out! Bobo! BOBO! AUTEUR! BRAVA! Here comes a smiling Bobo, through the curtains, blowing kisses and heading for the girls.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
(louder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the police.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Bobo presses himself between the girls, taking their hands and beginning his bows, but the girls spot Morty peeking from backstage, and they TAKE OFF, leaping off the front of the stage into the audience like punks jumping into the mosh pit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ADORING CROWD holds them up and they CROWD SURF toward the rear of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody washed their hands, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MORTY Spotting the commotion, he and the two cops race down the catwalk. Realizing he'll never get through the crowd, he, too, leaps off the stage to surf toward them but... THE CROWD ABRUPTLY PARTS and he does a complete FACE PLANT.
</DIRECTION>
<HOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess that explains why he's a security guard.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE GIRLS who bust out the back doors of the large room and unwittingly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PLAZA - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS ACTION ... right back into The Plaza lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
<DIRECTION>
(realizing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perfect.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this what they call 'returning to the scene of the crime'?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Unfortunately for them, to get to the front door they have to pass by... ... the PLAZA MANAGER and the other HOUSE SECURITY AGENT, BRUCE (butch haircut, bad suit), consoling Mrs. Lo Biancho. When MORTY and the COPS come through the doors behind them, however, there's no choice. The girls try to look as inconspicuous as possible heading for the revolving doors but they overhear:
</DIRECTION>
<PLAZA_MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I assure you, Mr. and Mrs. Lo Biancho, The Plaza will do everything in its power to see that The Emperor is safely returned and that the criminals are brought to justice.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MRS_LO_BIANCHO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Justice?! I want them executed! Tortured first, slowly, and then beheaded!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PLAZA_MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Plaza's policy is of course to serve you in any capacity we can.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Morty spots the girls across the lobby just as they reach the revolving doors.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTY>
<DIRECTION>
(calling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bruce! 10-80 at the wagon wheel!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Bruce looks over to Morty like he's speaking Slavic, but Morty's furiously pointing and Bruce sees... THE GIRLS break for the revolving doors. Parker gets there first, plunges in so fast that a MAN ENTERING is tossed headlong into the lobby. Drew tries to time the quickly-spinning door but one of the very high SPIKED HEELS catches, throwing her forward and sandwiching her in the revolving door.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
<DIRECTION>
(no breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Park...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE -- Parker sees Drew caught in the door as Bruce, Morty and the cops close in. Quickly, Parker pushes the door back, releasing Drew, who jumps in and swings out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE PLAZA - CONTINUOUS ACTION Then, Parker HEAVES THE DOOR WITH ALL HER MIGHT, spinning it so fast the security guys and cops can't jump in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOBBY OF THE PLAZA - CONTINUOUS ACTION The four men all stand there, watching the spinning door.
</DIRECTION>
<MORTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn it!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Then, just to their right, an ELDERLY WOMAN walks through the regular door just adjacent the revolving doors. All four share a sheepish look -- uh, maybe we should have thought of that -- then BOLT outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE PLAZA - CONTINUOUS ACTION The police and security look left, right, across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd they go?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They couldn't have gone very far. We'll split up.

<DIRECTION>
(pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You go that way! You take Fifth! Come on, get on your horse!

Morty and Bruce take the cop's order and race off in separate directions. Neither Hogan nor his partner moves.

<HOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two black.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where do you think those two went?
	</DIALOGUE>
<WILLIAMSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beats me. They didn't have any stupid dog with them from what I could see.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Might have stashed it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<WILLIAMSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe they ate it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The cops giggle at this.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAMSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The rent-a-cop said the mutt's worth like 50 G's. That makes it grand theft, my friend. Five to ten.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE NEWS STAND where a BLIND CASHIER (SPEEDY) smiles at the two policemen.
</DIRECTION>
<HOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to blind cashier)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Speedy. You didn't see a couple of blondes run past here, did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SPEEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yep. Couldn't miss 'em. Real criminal types. Looked like they were headed to Mexico.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's where they all go.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE REVEALS Drew and Parker, crouched down behind the counter right next to Speedy.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAMSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you around.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SPEEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not if I see you first.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The cops head back to The Plaza.
</DIRECTION>
<HOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I say we put Abbott and Costello on the ransom watch. I don't want to be stuck in the same room all day with Leona Helmsley's nasty stepsister.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
With the Detectives gone, Speedy turns up his nose and waves the air, fanning away a bad smell.
</DIRECTION>
<SPEEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whew. You know, it's not some old wives' tale about blind people having an acute sense of smell.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SPEEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So? What did you do with that dog?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We didn't steal it, I swear.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A painter did.

<SPEEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You girls best give yourselves up and tell 'em the story.

<DREW>
<DIRECTION>
(torn)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's right, Parker.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course he's right. We're going to march in there and give ourselves up right this minute. They will, of course, take us down to the precinct, call Mom and Dad, we'll give our statement, they'll grill us under hot lights for a few hours, force us to confess with some tricky good cop/bad cop routine and the next thing you know we're doing five to ten in Attica.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Drew checks her watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So we'll turn ourselves in right after the interview.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SPEEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I make one suggestion?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SPEEDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hit the showers before you do anything else.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A BEEP BEEP indicates Parker's BLACKBERRY is receiving a message.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're facing felony charges, Parker. Maybe you can do your on- line flirting later. Better yet, he can see you during visitor's hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Parker reads the incoming MESSAGE from... THOREAU 786: HOW'D CHEM TEST GO?
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
(beat; epiphany)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God. Warren works in the city.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Warren? WARREN?! So you lied, right to my face. No, Drew, this isn't about the chat room guy. Nah!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
But Parker's typing furiously even as Drew rants on -- she has to lean around Speedy's legs. A GUY buying a newspaper peers down at the strange sight.
</DIRECTION>
<SPEEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(to guy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take your daughters to work day.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guy pays for his paper, leaves. NOTATWIN: WARREN. MY REAL NAME'S PARKER MACLEOD. MY SISTER AND I NEED A FAVOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you listening to me?! Give me that stupid thing!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Drew reaches for the Blackberry.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Knock it off, Drew! This guy might be able to help. He lives here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Parker, you have completely lost your mind if you can be thinking about boys at a time like this!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
THOREAU 786: PARKER. THANKS FOR SHARING. ANYTHING YOU NEED. NOTATWIN: BIT OF A JAM IN THE CITY. MOB, POLICE AND HOTEL SECURITY ON OUR TAIL. COULD USE A HIDEOUT. THOREAU 786: LOL! ADVENTUROUS TYPE. MEET ME AT WORK? I'M AT THE U.N.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>

(to Drew)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The United Nations?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't possibly know somebody who works at the United Nations. Maybe he meant United Sub Sandwiches. Or United Skate Rats Store.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
NOTATWIN: UNITED NATIONS? THOREAU 786: JUST A DAY JOB. JOIN THE 11:00 TOUR. SOON. Parker pockets the Blackberry.
</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. We're going to the United Nations to use the restroom.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How convenient. You arrange a little date while your sister's future hangs in the balance.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, he said he'd help and it's only a couple blocks away. You got a better idea?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Speedy opens the rear door of the newsstand.
</DIRECTION>
<SPEEDY>
<DIRECTION>
(how's he know?)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coast's clear.

INT. MacLEOD HOUSE - CHARLEY'S STUDY Head thrown back, mouth wide open, still in his bathrobe, Charley sleeps in the chair directly in front of his laptop. The SCREENSAVER, an animated version of Jack Nicholson in THE SHINING, just keeps typing "All work and no play..." When the PHONE RINGS it nearly knocks him out of his chair.

An in-house MONITOR mutely broadcasts the now empty ASSEMBLY ROOM. Nothing here, Hogan closes the door. IN A BEAT, one of the mail sacks wriggles and Warren sticks his head up.

Even as she holds out the file, he races past her, puckering his bum. She watches him waddle up the stairs BUT AS HE EXITS, HE PASSES WILLIAMSON AND THE U.N. SECURITY GUY IN THE DOORWAY. Drew sees them. Uh, oh. The only thing she can do to make herself inconspicuous is to drop into the Canadian Rep's chair and turn her back on them like she's one of the Assembly members. She sits up, shuffles the files around. Glancing furtively to either side, she sees that everyone else is wearing the TRANSLATION EARPHONE. She puts one on.

<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How?

Drew is near tears.

A look from Parker quiets Warren. Drew's choked up. She just nods, yes.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I called and the secretary said there were no exceptions to the deadline so I was going to try to see him when he finished the other interviews. I knew it was hopeless, but... I was so... embarrassed.

Drew wipes her tears, then:

EXT. BLOCK NORTH OF THE GARDEN Drew watches as Roger climbs out, looks up and down the street, then moves around to the passenger side, grabs The Emperor and drops him into a gym bag. AT THE END OF THE BLOCK -- SPECTATORS for the New York Kennel Club Dog Show have begun filing into the Garden. Ever wary, Roger carries The Emperor under one arm. The Emperor pokes his nose out.

The Students dive out of the way as Jim comes barreling across campus with Drew clinging for life to his handlebars. Just outside the Administration Building, Jim hits the brakes and Drew FLIES OFF THE HANDLEBARS and like the puppy in the opening, disappears into a shrub.

</DIRECTION>
<PARKER>
<DIRECTION>
(primly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I promise you, though my missing the deadline seems to suggest otherwise, my studies would never suffer on account of my being unorganized. This was, and I think anyone who knows me would vouch for this, a complete anomaly. I was so thrown when my sister asked Bernard to the dance that I simply failed to post the schedule request and seeing it already checked off on my to-do list, I over-looked it until after the deadline had passed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PROFESSOR_SPAULDING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms. MacLeod, I recall your application being one of the strongest we received. Not seeing your name on the interview list surprised me. I assumed, of course, that you'd changed your mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Not at all. This program is my number one priority.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PROFESSOR_SPAULDING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, well, I'm sure you can appreciate that with so many applicants for so few spaces there must be rules to govern the selection process.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A FUSS from the OUTER OFFICE interrupts them and suddenly the door bursts open and Drew BURSTS IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Professor Spaulding? I can't apologize enough for barging in like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Professor is not only thrown by the interruption, but by Drew's particularly bizarre, barefoot look.
</DIRECTION>
<PROFESSOR_SPAULDING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Please. It looks like I'm taking the red-eye now anyway.

Drew shuts the door and then is startled when she gets a face full of Parker, already there.

	Parker, consider, just for a moment, whether this is the appropriate time and place.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I considered. What I want to say is, I didn't purposefully set out to ruin your day, but that doesn't mean I'm not a little... jealous.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jealous?

<PROFESSOR_SPAULDING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's got to be something. Like how you lost your shoes?

<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How you're secretly jealous of me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would I be jealous of you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, let me see. Because I don't have a stick up my butt? Because I know how to have fun? Because I'm spontaneous and creative and men are all my love slaves?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Drew stops, ponders this deeply.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope.
	</DIALOGUE>

Then she smiles, only a teensy bit.
</DIRECTION>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, maybe about the love slaves.

This is the first moment in a long time when the sisters share a smile. Drew turns to the Professor.

	Professor, I'm Drew MacLeod.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PROFESSOR_SPAULDING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you certain?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DREW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted more than anything in the world to be a part of your program. I still do. But I failed. I didn't follow the rules. And honestly, before today, I didn't know how I was going to live with that. How to live with failure. I'm not good at it. I haven't done it much. But today I realized that I've lived in fear of it too long. I hope my application was a strong one and I came here today to ask your indulgence and to place my name back into consideration. If you won't, I'll understand. Better yet, I'll get over it. Maybe I shouldn't be in such a hurry after all. Maybe it would be best for me to just take this...
