INT. ALICE'S - NIGHT - EXTREMELY CLOSE ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a moving wall of muscled skin, tinged blue by moonlight. Four claw-like scratches are raked across this landscape in bright red. Throaty, guttural MOANS drift up from somewhere. Are we in heaven? Or hell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT SHOTS ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A delicate hand caressing a muscled bishop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A woman's leg entwined around a man's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cascade of red hair falling across an unshaven cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two faces pressed tightly together in a kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The faces belong to ALICE and DAN, and as their moans build to a crescendo we realize it isn't pain we're hearing but the opposite. Afterwards...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE'S HANDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
gently rove Dan's back, tenderly caressing the scratches they've just made.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
her relaxed, happy face gazes up from the pillow. She turns and smiles at Dan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dan sleepily smiles back, then gently reaches out to caress her shoulder. Their eyes hold for a moment. Alice leans over and kisses him.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to take a shower.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Dan nods and closes his eyes, still smiling. Alice climbs from bed. FOLLOW HER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALICE'S BATHROOM - NIGHT - ON SHOWER DRAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Water pours down into the drain from the shower. TIGHT on Alice's HEAD AND SHOULDERS as she steps INTO FRAME and stands under the cascading water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE SHOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hot water streams down onto Alice's face. She scrubs herself clean. The water beats down on her shoulders and back. She rinses her hair. Shakes her wet head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DRAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
gives an odd gurgle, like something had backed up the plumbing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
glances down. Nothing. Turns back the jets of water. The pressure builds up a little. She turns it down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DRAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the gurgles again. The water starts to back up, rising around Alice's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She notices. Leans down, perturbed, as the water reaches her ankles and tries to clear the drain. No success. The water continues to back up.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh great. The drain monster strikes again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stands back up now, a little apprehensive. As the water rises to her knees, the pressure from the shower jet suddenly DOUBLES! Gallons of water now BLAST into the shower. Alice tries to turn it off but the handles come off in her hands!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to open the shower door. IT WON'T BUDGE! She's trapped and now the water is climbing to her neck! Frantic, Alice POUNDS on the glass!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Completely full. Alice stands inside, completely under water, slamming her fists against the door, in desperation. Suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR OF DOORS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the door opens. But it is no longer Alice's glass shower door. It's one of the heavy doors in the asylum. As it opens toward CAMERA, Alice stumbles out of the STATIC WALL OF WATER into a dark room. The door closes behind her and melts into the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice looks around. She is in a dark empty corridor. Two doors flank both ends of the hallway. One opens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice tries to peer beyond it. Darkness. Slowly, she gets to her feet and steps through it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
further on, opens, beckoning her forward. And another door beyond that. And another. Cautiously, Alice moves down this corridor of invitations until...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ASYLUM - TIGHT ON ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she steps through the last door. Shadows and light play across her face. She looks around. What she sees sends fear into her eyes. This is where Amanda Krueger was raped. The asylum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
slowly down the length of this nightmarish room. Fingers of lights stab up from crusting floor grates and reach through the thick, murky air toward a dark cathedral ceiling, who's beams appear to be made from the bones of some unearthly creature.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA CONTINUES BACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
revealing beds and mattresses crowded along the walls. Old. Filthy. Some torn to pieces. We can make out the figures of men lying in them. And others milling around. These are AMANDA'S HUNDRED MANIACS. All dressed in the garb of 1940's mental patients. Some pace aimlessly. Devoid of sanity and purpose. Others sit, lost in their own private hells. No one has noticed Alice. Yet. At the end of the room...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA CRANES UP, CONTINUING BACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
revealing a staircase that leads to a huge IRON DOOR. Two ORDERLIES hover on the landing before it, gazing into the dim scene below. One of them pokes his finger into the dark, silently counting. The other is eager to go.
</DIRECTION>
<ORDERLY_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, will ya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORDERLY_1>
<ORDERLY_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up, you'll make me lose count... eighty-two, eighty-three...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORDERLY_2>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looks down at herself. Now she is dressed in an old fashioned nurse's uniform. White and starched. There is a name tag over her left breast. It reads: AMANDA KRUEGER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice barely has time to react when she hears the first orderly impatiently say...
</DIRECTION>
<ORDERLY_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Close enough. Let's call it a hundred and call it a day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORDERLY_1>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the SOUND of RUSTY HINGES as the heavy door starts to swing closed. Alice looks up. Starts moving toward it.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...WAIT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it slams closed with a resounding CLANG. We hear the SOUND of heavy bolts being thrown in place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
whirls around. WHIP PAN with her as she discovers that the door she came through is no longer there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns back to the room, frightened. Starts moving for the bolted steel door at the far end. As she hurries forward, the maniacs notice her. All heads turn. Horrible faces peer at her from everywhere. Some of the men move toward the center of the room, blocking her way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice stops. There is no way past them to the door. She turns. The maniacs move in on her from all directions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freddy's hundred fathers. A drooling, macabre parade of human beings. Hands grope toward her. Hideous faces leer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watches, terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is looking less like an insane asylum in the 1940's and more like a nightmare scene of London's 16th century Bedlam!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The maniacs converge on her. One pushes his way through the others. (we recognize him as Robert Englund, sans Freddy make-up.) As he reaches toward her...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIGH SHOT, LOOKING DOWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as CAMERA begins to descend, pushing in, moving closer, the maniacs surround her. As they begin to drag her down, Alice turns her face up toward CAMERA. PUSH IN EXTREMELY CLOSE as she SCREAMS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MATCH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALICE'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice lunges up from bed INTO FRAME. SCREAMING. Dan immediately sits up beside her, concerned. A hand rests on her shoulder, between them. Alice realizes where she is.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA TRACKS AROUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
until Alice's profile blocks Dan's face. The following line begins OFF SCREEN, during the CAMERA TRACK.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter hon? Bad dream?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly ENGLUND's leering face pushes into FOREGROUND FRAME, beside Alice. It's his hand on her shoulder and we realize that he spoke the line, not Dan. She turns, startled, then SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Englund rolls on top of her, pinning her to the mattress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON ENGLUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
grinning down at her, his tongue snaking out his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<ENGLUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no such thing as safe sex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENGLUND>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pushes him away with every ounce of her strength. She starts to sit up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALICE'S - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice sits up, terrified! Looks around in panic. Realizes she's alone in bed. Where's Dan? She reflexively glances toward her open bedroom window. Its curtain gently billows with the morning breeze. Dan has gone home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice tries to collect herself. The dream is over. But we can tell by her face that she is far from all right. She pulls on a robe and shakily climbs from bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALICE'S BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice moves toward the shower. Pauses before it. Takes a breath and opens the door. Looks inside. Normal enough. Turns on the water. Watches apprehensively as it pours serenely down the drain. She'd really rather not, but Alice reluctantly starts to remove her robe...
</DIRECTION>
<DAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...we stand naked and defenseless before an ever more unimaginable horror

SLOW DISSOLVE TO:

<DIRECTION>
EXT. SPRINGWOOD HIGH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON SPRAY OF WATER FROM A LARGE FOUNTAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAN DOWN from the water to a statue in the fountain's center. And from the statue down to Dan, dressed in a graduation cap and gown. He's perched on the statue's pedestal, his arm draped irreverently across the stone man's shoulder, grinning as he speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<DAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...college. High school was only the beginning for some of us. Don't forget: S.A.T. stands for Sadistic, Anti-human, Torture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAN>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laughter from a sea of fellow graduates who are gathered round the base of the fountain, outnumbered by their less amused parents. Beyond them, we glimpse even more caps and gowns milling with roving bands of adults.
</DIRECTION>
<DAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most of us have just this one summer to live... and by live I mean...paaarty!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAN>
<DIRECTION>
The kids sends up a cheer as Dan throws his cap into the air and leaps off the fountain. He floats DOWN through a seas of ASCENDING caps, disappearing into the crown of students.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAN OVER TO GRETA AND HER MOTHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
standing at the edge of the group. Greta is living proof of what God can create when he's having a good day. She's beautiful. and fashion model-thin. Her only flaw might be the hint of neuroses in her perfection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her mother, RACINE GIBSON, a once beautiful woman now expanding into middle age, raises a disapproving eyebrow toward Dan and the boisterous kids around them.
</DIRECTION>
<RACINE_GIBSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How colorful. Who is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACINE_GIBSON>
<GRETA>

ANGLE ON GRETA

<DIRECTION>
a head TALLER than everyone around her as she suddenly squeals with delight, recognizing...
</DIRECTION>
<GRETA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alice! Yvonne!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRETA>
<DIRECTION>
Through the swirling crowd we see Alice standing with YVONNE, a very grounded black girl. Her father stands with them. Alice is a little glum, but Yvonne breaks into a wide grin as they both turn toward Greta.
</DIRECTION>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, girl!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
Yvonne gives Alice a little tug and they hurry toward Greta.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE THREE GIRLS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yvonne and Greta throw their arms around one another and send up shrill noises of girlish delight. Then Yvonne breaks into the girls RAP.
</DIRECTION>
<YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm the Y, the V-O-N-N-E, and wherever I am, that's the place to be.

<ALL_THREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yvonne!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALL_THREE>
<DIRECTION>
Alice isn't getting into the spirit of things. Yvonne tries to inject a little enthusiasm into her.
</DIRECTION>
<YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Alice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, honey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
Alice joins in, trying to be cheerful.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm the A-L-I-C-E. Blond hair on my head, blue eyes to see.

	We're the three together, and together we'll be. The Y, the A, don't forget the G!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALL_THREE>
<DIRECTION>
The all three put their hands together in an overhead SLAP. Greta and Yvonne break into laughter. Alice halfheartedly joins them, about a step behind their good spirits.
</DIRECTION>
<YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Alice, good naturedly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, what's wrong with you -- let's see a smile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Had kind of a long night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<YVONNE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Dan keeping you up again? Put a lock on that window, girl.

<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, the Dan part was nice...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Greta playfully tugs at her gown, interrupting them.
</DIRECTION>
<GRETA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These things are wild...
	</DIALOGUE>

(striking pose)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think?

</GRETA>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Makes you look like a nun--

<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to cheer up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah - kick the habit! Break those vows!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
They laugh. Greta feigns hormonal desperation.
</DIRECTION>
<GRETA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Find me a man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRETA>
<DIRECTION>
MARK, good-looking, though considerably off-the-wall, STEPS INTO SHOT holding a SMALL SKETCHPAD and a LARGE, EXCESSIVE LOLLIPOP. He speaks to her as though he were a fashion photographer.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's all wrong. Sell it! More teeth and raise the arms a bit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Greta drops the pose and addresses the heavens.
</DIRECTION>
<GRETA>
<DIRECTION>

<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(playfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe God's trying to tell you something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Mark smiles at Greta, as he puts away his sketchbook. They're old friends and this is a familiar game.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, when are you gonna come to your senses?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<GRETA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next life. Oh, what's that?

</GRETA>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>

Yvonne and Alice laugh.

Past her shoulder, Greta indicates Mrs. Gibson, glaring disapprovingly. Mark gets conspiratorial.

	</DIALOGUE>
</GRETA>
<DIRECTION>
All turn as Mark's father, MR. GREY, approaches. Mr. Grey steps into shot. A rugged, blue collar type, he glances at the girls then at Mark. His hearty cheerfulness contains a note of reproach.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_GREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Rembrandt!. No wonder I couldn't find you. I thought you'd be hanging out with the guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_GREY>

Mark becomes uncomfortable in this big man's presence.

<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hi, Dad. I thought the guys could hang out with themselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
They offer up a trio of hellos. Alice turns to Mark.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you bring your sketchbook to the ceremony. I'd love to see what you did to D.W.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<MR_GREY>

</MR_GREY>
<GRETA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	D.W. Yates. The Principal.

He looks to Mark, who goes sheepish, then fesses up.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, Dickweed, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Mark's dad isn't too amused.

<MR_GREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh huh... I hope you had time to finish those cross-sections I asked for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_GREY>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we get into that later, Dad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
There is an awkward beat as everyone falls quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good to see you again, Mr. Grey.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(begs off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got to go find Dan.

</ALICE>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, before they revoke his diploma.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
As Alice turns away, the cheerful face she put on dissolves and we see that underneath she's still on the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOLLOW ALICE through the crowd. Suddenly, a DARK SHAPE looms up behind her, lifting her in a bear hug. Alice jumps, startled. As the big arms twirl her around she comes face to face with Dan. He smiles.

<DIRECTION>
He plants one on her lips. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got a present for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAN>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches into a pocket beneath his gown. Grins as he hands her two AIRPLANE TICKETS tied with a ribbon. She tries to be enthusiastic, but doesn't come off.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The tickets.

<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay, Dan
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Dan and his parents move away with the coach. Alice stares after them as they disappear into the crowd. Turns away...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE FOUNTAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wall of people moves away and Alice finds herself among Yvonne, Greta and Mark again. Mark is answering Greta.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That club sucks, they card everybody. Let's just party at your place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<GRETA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know my mother -- get real. What about Alice's?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRETA>
<DIRECTION>
Alice shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My dad's got this thing about drinking in the house.

</ALICE>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well we gotta do something!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Yvonne shares an amused look with Alice, then steps in takes control.
</DIRECTION>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right kids, I tell you what we're gonna do. I've got swimming practice until six-thirty today...

(trying to follow)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRETA>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That means they're gonna give me the key to the pool so I can lock up when I'm done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
Mark's face lights up. He goes off like a joy bomb.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pool party! I dig it! Babes in wet T- shirts. No -- topless! Fucking heaven!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
The three girls look at each other, annoyed. Then break out in mischievous grins.

<ALICE>

<GRETA_YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't forget the G!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRETA_YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
On cue, the girls all give Mark a SHOVE! He falls back, arms flailing, and lands on his ass in the middle of the fountain! Everyone nearby LAUGHS. Mark looks up at the girls, innocent.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd I say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
The girls help pull a chagrined Mark from the fountain. Suddenly, Alice frowns, remembering something.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, damn! I have to work tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<GRETA>
	<DIALOGUE>

<GRETA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn. They caught me, too. Guess I'd better go gnash my thousand-dollar teeth for the paparazzi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRETA>
<DIRECTION>
Alice glances at her watch. Looks around for someone. Can't find him. She looks a little more unhappy. As Mark, Greta, and Yvonne prepare to go...
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	you guys go ahead. I'll catch up with you later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
NEAR THE TREES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice trudges along, staring at the ground, unhappy.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congratulations, Alice. You looked beautiful up there. I'm so proud of you...gee, thanks Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do look beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Alice looks up, surprised. Her father stands before her, near a tree. She smiles. Her father tentatively smiles back; a gruff man, uncomfortable with emotional displays.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was afraid you weren't coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<ALICE_S_DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I watched from behind the stands. Didn't want to embarrass you, ya know. "The drunk showed up", that kind of thing...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE_S_DAD>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's in the past. Unless you've stopped going to the meetings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<ALICE_S_DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. A deal's a deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE_S_DAD>
<DIRECTION>
He produces a wrapped present from behind his back. Hesitates, awkward, then hands it at her. Alice's face lights up as she stares at the package.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE_S_DAD>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, go on. Open it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE_S_DAD>
<DIRECTION>
She gleefully rips the paper off and opens the box. It's a camera. She smiles, delighted and surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<ALICE_S_DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the model you've been saving up for. I wanted you to have it for your trip.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE_S_DAD>
<DIRECTION>
Alice stares lovingly at him.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't give a damn what they might think. You're terrific.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
She gives him a kiss on the cheek. He tries to take it in stride. She ponders him a second longer. Then takes his arm and begins to lead him toward the foundation.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE_S_DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are we going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE_S_DAD>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To take a picture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON PARENTS AND KIDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lining up for a group photo. Alice and her father ENTER SHOT. Alice hands her camera to someone just OFF SCREEN. We see them all taking places, changing their minds, moving next to someone else. Mark's father puts a big arm around Greta's mother. Beams, unaware of the horror and distaste that just leapt onto Racine's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parents and off spring are moving toward their cars. CAMERA PANS across the crowd to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE AND DAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hugging. Her father stands a few feet away.
</DIRECTION>
<DAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call me when your shift ends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAN>
<DIRECTION>
Alice nods. Dan shakes her father's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, sir. I'll have her home by August.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAN>

Alice's father frowns.
</DIRECTION>
<DAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just kidding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAN>
<DIRECTION>
Dan smiles at Alice and heads off. Alice hands her gown and flowers to her father as he opens the car door.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for everything, Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<ALICE_S_DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure you don't want a ride to work?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE_S_DAD>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just across the park.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
He climbs into the car. Smiles his gruff smile.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE_S_DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, angel. Have fun tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE_S_DAD>
<DIRECTION>
Alice waves goodbye as he starts the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SPRINGWOOD - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice walks down an empty street. Perhaps too empty to be right. There is a faint SING-SONG NOISE, but it's not yet discernible as anything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
gives a faint look of ominous recognition.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice passes the entrance to the park.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARK - ALICE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Groups of kids are playing on the swings, in the sandbox, on the slide. The SING-SONG continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sees something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE'S POV - PAST THE OTHER CHILDREN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ELM STREET CHILDREN play their ominous rope games... The SING-SONG becomes identifiable now. It's the Elm Street Children's Anthem... "three four, better shut the door..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her face hardens with resolve.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. This isn't going to happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
She closes her eyes tight. Then opens them again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Worse now. All the normal children are gone. Only the Elm Street Kids remain...playing their endless games.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
grows more determined. Heads into the park. CAMERA STAYS WITH HER as she moves with increasing speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ELM STREET CHILDREN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
always managing to somehow stay one turn ahead of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
itself has taken on a foreboding darkness. The trees cast oddly elongated shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
has left the path. She moves rapidly now through branches that tear at her clothing and her face. Soon she is running blindly in the direction of the ever present VOICES. She breaks through some bushes and finds herself in a...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLEARING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An open green in the center of the park. She is all alone... and the effect, even to the color of the grass at her feet, is dreamlike. The VOICES have ceased.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE'S POV - IN A 360 PAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is nothing but the green common with the trees and brush all around it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But from somewhere nearby, she hears the chanting VOICES they've added a new couplet.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nine ten, Freddy's back again...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICES>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA CONTINUES IN A SECOND 360
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now, where there was foliage a moment ago we see a set of GOTHIC STEPS, framing a SILHOUETTED NUN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stares with intrigue as the children's voices fade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE STEPS - LOOKING DOWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
past stone GARGOYLES in the FOREGROUND. The nun hurries up the steps toward CAMERA, her face obscured by her habit's veil. As the nun moves PAST CAMERA we see Alice, at the bottom of the steps, hurrying after her.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON ASYLUM DOORS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
at the top of the steps as the nun moves inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON STEPS - FROM INSIDE DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice runs up, INTO SHOT. Stops. Glances up at something high above her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE ASYLUM TOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rising toward the sky. Immense and imposing. Three windows set in a row at the very top, are it's only features.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGEL - LOOKING DOWN AT THE STEPS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL CONVENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Completely deserted. Alice moves slowly down a seemingly endless corridor. She passes a deserted reception area, then an empty nurses station. Open doors lead into frightening pits of darkness all along the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT Alice's pensive watchful face with the shadowy ominous world through which she is walking. We just know that something really nasty is going to happen. As she passes an open doorway, she hears a strange, animal SOUND form the room within. She pauses, looks inside, then recoils with shock as she sees a sheep, it's mouth all bloody, standing with it's lamb, near the carcass of a large, dead snake. Suddenly she hears the sound of rusty wheels and whirls around to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FREDDYESQUE BABY STROLLER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
black, ominous looking, rusting, rolls slowly down the corridor toward Alice from behind. As it moves toward CAMERA, PAN WITH IT TO...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she backs against the wall watching the evil pram roll past. Then Alice notices something beyond it, far down the corridor. CAMERA follows her gaze to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE NUN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hurrying SOUNDLESSLY through a doorway. We only catch a glimpse of her as she disappears from view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reacts. Runs past the stroller towards the nun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WHITE OF A NUN'S HABIT SWIRLS OUT OF CAMERA to reveal staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOOTING FROM OVERHEAD as Alice moves INTO FRAME and starts up the staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving up. There is a SQUEAKY ECHO OF WHEELS OFF-SCREEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ALICE FROM BELOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she turns to look down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she looks back up the stairs. She takes one step forward and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's yanked down OUT OF FRAME!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SET OF DOUBLE DOORS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANGS open. Alice lies on a gurney, her head tilted back to face the CAMERA mounted behind her head. The gurney races down a corridor, pushed by a dirty, unshaven, orderly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is pushed through another set of doors into
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DELIVERY ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHITE HABITED NURSES, AIDES, and DOCTORS all crowd around and peer down at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looks around, horrified and confused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DOCTOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
leans down toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nothing to be afraid of. Just do exactly what I say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sits bolt upright on the gurney.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!!!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
HER POV PANNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd of spectators...orderlies, nurses and doctors, have all backed away and now crowd the walls of the room. STOP ON ALICE AMONG THEM AND TRACK INTO CLOSE UP. (Alice is still in hospital gown.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE (IN THE SPECTATORS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes lock with...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AMANDA KRUEGER'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who is now the one on the gurney, about to give birth.
</DIRECTION>
<AMANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me...why is this happening again? Please! Don't let him do this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMANDA>
<DIRECTION>
A painful contraction wracks her body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
tries to understand the meaning of her words.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AMANDA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is now lost in the agony of Freddy's birth.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't panic, sister. We've got a breach birth here. It's backwards. I'm going to have to turn it around. Okay. Deep breath. Here we go. I need you to push...now! Push!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The birth proceeds.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit!! What is it?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
A NUN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stands, holding something in swaddling (which obscures the thing from her view. She addresses her answer to Amanda.)
</DIRECTION>
<NUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is still one of God's creatures, you know. Take solace in that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NUN>
<DIRECTION>
AMANDA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
struggles upright on the operating table. She is drenched in sweat and clearly terrified. She stares directly into the eyes of the nun holding the swaddled bundle.
</DIRECTION>
<AMANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is no creature of God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMANDA>
<DIRECTION>
THE NUN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
gazes at Amanda, shocked by her words. She starts to speak. Suddenly, the swaddled bundle begins to kick and beat furiously. The nun fights to keep hold of it, but the bundle struggles free from her grasp and falls under the gurney. In a second, it scuttles into the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a horrible BRAYING SOUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ORDERLIES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
involuntarily step back, staring at the thing on the floor. Then general panic sets in.
</DIRECTION>
<AMANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it! Give it to me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMANDA>
<DIRECTION>
A few orderlies scramble to close the doors. Some bolt through them, racing to get away from the thing on the floor. Bedlam reigns as people shout and rush around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watches, transfixed. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BABY FREDDY'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
streaking towards Alice. He scuttled between her legs and out through the double doors.
</DIRECTION>
<AMANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(0.S. cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't let it get away!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMANDA>
<DIRECTION>
THE DOUBLE DOORS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
swing closed. PAN to Alice, as she gets back to her feet and turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The delivery room is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
turns back to the doors. She moves slowly and deliberately.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DOORS - ALICE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA moves toward them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
scared but determined. She stops in front of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DOORS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLD LONG ENOUGH so that we're dead sure something evil is going to jump right into Alice's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
takes a deep breath and reaches out to open the doors!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing awful grabs her. Her expression changes to one of horrified recognition.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHURCH - OVER ALICE'S SHOULDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where Freddy "died" in Nightmare Four. That horrible BRAYING SOUND comes from somewhere nearby. TRACK WITH HER as she starts into the church. CRANE UP OVER HER to reveal the church in all its horrid glory, full of Freddyized church artifacts. There is no sign of the "baby."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
moving past row after row of pews. There are SLIMY, GULPING NOISES now, SOUNDS even more unspeakably unpleasant that the thing's BRAYING. The SOUNDS echo in a way that tells Alice nothing about where they're coming from. The thing could be anywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ain't to happy about that!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEAR THE ALTAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freddy's fetid remains lie in a crumpled heap. We recognize bits of striped sweater. A claw catches a stray bit of light from somewhere. In the distance, Alice moves slowly forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stops for a moment...staring at the place she thought she left her nightmare forever.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a SLITHERING SOUND from the steps leading to the altar!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watches in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FETAL MONSTER - ALICE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
now we see this "baby". It's shape is vaguely human, but with the gleaming skin of a flayed goat. It seems to grow as it moves. The thing slithers toward the decaying remains of Freddy's signature outfit. All the while, its shape is becoming more loathsomely human...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes widen as she realizes what is about to happen.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't make me bring you BACK!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
THE THING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
begins to crawl in through on of Freddy's pants legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
runs toward the altar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is an EAR-SPLITTING NOISE OF WOOD BEING RIPPED AWAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ALTAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rise from the floor. The floorboards begin to tilt up toward Alice as they are torn from their foundation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The angle of the rising floor throws Alice back. She looks at the altar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It continues to rise, preventing her from reaching it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
can only desperately, impotently try to crawl "uphill" through the dust and smoke towards the impending resurrection, powerless to prevent it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE INTERCUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice's struggle to reach Freddy before he is "resurrected" with...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPLINTERING WOOD; SHATTERING GLASS; the RISING ALTAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOTS of bits and pieces of Freddy's metamorphosis seen through the growing dust of the crumbling church, as that embryonic thing GROWS...into clothes...into the glove...into the body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
struggles, but there is no way she can even reach the altar, and God knows what she could do even if she did get there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONE FINAL CLOSE UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
of Freddy's mid-section, stretching fully into shape. And then, suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The floor falls back into its level position with a dust raising THUD. Alice hits the ground. HARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SILENCE. And dust. Then.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
raises herself up off the floor. Looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing but dust and smoke, back-lit by light streaming in through the broken stained glass windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in BACKGROUND, through the smoke as...in EXTREME FOREGROUND CLOSE-UP, the charred remains of a hand, reconstructing itself, reaches down and slips into the glove.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she hears the GHASTLY SCRAPING SOUND of Freddy's claws.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ALTAR - ALICE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing but the settling dust...and somewhere behind it, a figure silhouetted in the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREDDY EMERGES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
standing in front of the pulpit with his arms raised in an ultimate mockery of the resurrection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks even a little more grotesque than usual. Misshapen, like the Crooked Man. His arms and legs aren't quite the same length. The joints are twisted so that nothing in his body seems aligned. Nevertheless, he smiles at Alice, and his smile's more malevolent then ever.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
backs away from him, frightened...and angry. Freddy's not in a very good mood, either. The two circle each other, keeping their distance.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't come back! I locked the door on you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Freddy laughs, a dry rasping cackle. Takes a step closer to her. Terrified, Alice reflexively strikes out. But Freddy vanishes. His chilling laugh echoes around the church walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice follows that laughter with her frightened eyes, searching for him. Suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freddy appears right behind her. He slips his arm around her waist and caresses her tummy with his clawed hand.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I found the key!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Alice almost jumps out of her skin. She spins around to see
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freddy throw his head back and CACKLE...then a shaft of light comes through the rear doors of the church. Freddy turns toward it. His laughter abruptly dies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice faces the doors too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AMANDA KRUEGER

FREDDY

Alice struggles to get the big doors open. When she does, she hurries through only to find herself...

INT. CRAVE INN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...walking through the diner's front door. (She's back in her street clothes.) The place is empty. Too empty. We're certain that Alice is still in her nightmare. She looks around. Puzzled. Completely freaked out. She feels the counter and furniture, checking out the "reality" of the place.

<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (near shout)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alice! Where've you been?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Alice damn near jumps out of her skin. Spins around! It's ANNE, a classmate and co-worker of Alice's. She's pretty pissed off. Relieved, Alice starts to break down. She's obviously disturbed and frightened.

<ALICE>

	Anne! Oh god, I'm glad it's you. It was terrible.

<ANNE>

She throws her apron at Alice. WHIP PAN with the apron to Alice. She's genuinely stunned.

<ALICE>

	Hours? Last thing I remember was crossing the park...

</ALICE>

She looks at the clock. It's after midnight. Anne angrily gathers her things.

<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The party'll be history by the time I get there... Great!

Alice just stands there, stunned. Anne shakes her head and moves toward the door.

EXT. CAMPUS SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A raucous pool party in full swing. People are splashing around in the water. Some dive from pool's edge to cannonball their friends. Laughter. Chatter. And the blare of loud ROCK MUSIC fills the air. Suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GIRL'S BLOODCURDLING SCREAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rises above the cacophony. People scatter to get the hell out of the way as...

<DIRECTION>
YVONNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
leaping off the high-dive, plunges like a graceful comet toward the water's surface. Strikes the water where everyone else used to be.

She comes to the surface and swims to the pool's edge amid applause from the others. As she climbs from the water, FOLLOW HER through the swirling crowd of partying teens to

DAN AND MARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dan sleepily lies in a lounge chair. An unopened bottle of champagne, decked with a ribbon, rests beside him. Mark is busy sketching in his book -- a "big hunk" with his arms around two "babes". He takes a sip of beer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Greta sits next to them in a gorgeous bikini. She reaches into an ice chest and hands Dan a beer.
</DIRECTION>
<GRETA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what did your dad say about you and Alice going to Europe?

</GRETA>
<DIRECTION>
Dan passes the beer to Mark, who lines it up next to the one he's already got.

Greta stares at him, blown away.

	You're weird, you know that?

There is a beat, as all ponder this in silence. Then Mark breaks their reverie. Grabs Dan's champagne.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Screw 'em. Open the champagne. Let's have a party.
	</DIALOGUE>

Dan grabs the bottle away.

	Hands off squirrel. That's for me and Alice...for later.

Behind them we hear the SOUND of a glass breaking O.S., followed by a loud OUCH! They turn toward the sound.

One of their classmates clutches his foot in pain, then pulls a piece of broken glass out. BLOOD pours out of the wound.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MARK, DAN, GRETA AND YVONNE

Everyone cringes. But Mark really reacts. He turns PALE. Closing his eyes tight.

	Oh man! I could've gone all night without looking at that.

Dan shakes his head at Mark's sensitivity. He closes his eyes and leans back on the lounge chair as a JOCK approaches the group. Greta pats Mark on the shoulder.

Mark sits next to Greta, showing her his sketchbook. Yvonne is stretched out in Dan's lounge chair. Dan hurriedly approaches and yanks his jacket from the back of the chair, pulling Yvonne up a couple inches.

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dan's truck speeds along a deserted stretch of road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dan is at the wheel. He looks intense, worried about Alice. He's also very tired. The VOICE of an abrasive TALK RADIO DJ fills the cab. We listen to him while Dan fights to keep his eyes open.
</DIRECTION>
<D_J>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)

	Right, lady...and Elvis killed Marilyn 'cause the Kennedy's put fluoride in his water. WHAT'S THE MATTER, LADY...DID YOU GO OFF YOUR MEDICATION?!

Dan's eyes close for a second. There is an eerie BUZZ and STATIC from the radio.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm calling about my wayward ex-son Daniel, who has just acted like on ungrateful, unmanageable Dickweed, ever since he was seduced by this bimbo, slut- whore, Alice...

Dan's eyes open and he stares in shock at the radio which has transformed itself into a rusting antique.
</DIRECTION>
<DAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAN>
<DIRECTION>
Then another voice comes to him through the radio.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I were you lady, I'd kill the ungrateful piggy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
THE RADIO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
changes from "talk show" to a BLARINGLY LOUD HEAVY METAL STATION. Les's brilliant speed metal masterpiece "Fast Track To Hell" fills the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stares down at the radio. His confusion has given way to fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SEAT BELTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
snake out to impossible length, wrapping around his arms. Dan manages to keep his right hand free, but the belts wind around the rest of his body, pinning his left arm uselessly to his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
crosses over onto the center divider, out of control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON GAS AND BRAKE PEDALS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dan tries to hit the brakes. But as his foot comes off the accelerator, the BRAKE PEDAL snakes around and slams down on top of his foot, pushing the accelerator to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
winces in pain. Wrenches his left arm free of the belts and grabs the wheel. Desperately reaches with his right for the GEAR SHIFT, which ducks away from his groping hand like a darting cobra.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lurches across the center divider and charges into the oncoming traffic!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hunts wildly for the elusive gear shift. Hears a LOUD POP from inside the cab. He looks over...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREDDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is now sitting in the passenger seat, clutching Dan's bottle of champagne. His side of the truck is now "Freddyized". He takes a huge gulp of champagne. Then...spits it out. It hits the dash, SIZZLING like ACID. More of it runs down his arm and shoulder. It's smoking, too. He turns to Dan.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bad year.

</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
DAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
some of the drops hit him, burning his chest and arms. Dan SCREAMS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREDDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His striped jersey begins to smoke as the shoulder socket melts away. Freddy grins. Turns to Dan.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Better buckle up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
LOW ANGLE ON FREDDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he reaches with his left arm and RIPS his right arm off. Then he welds the smoking socket onto the doorjam above the corner of the passenger window... and pulls his on his CLAW. His arm STRETCHES like an extending seatbelt. He hooks his claw into a "Freddy buckle" at his waist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
has been watching all this in horror. Suddenly...he hears a loud HONK. WHIP PAN with Dan to his POV through the windshield as the BRIGHT LIGHTS of an approaching truck WHITE OUT OF FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING TOWARDS DAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he looks down at the gear shift lever.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON HIS HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
slamming the lever into REVERSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON DAN'S TRUCK TIRE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
skidding on the pavement. Burning rubber. Starting to melt as the brakes lock!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is slammed headfirst through the windshield. Shattering glass EXPLODES all around him, as Dan flies over the hood!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMPUS SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON CEMENT AT POOL'S EDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dan slams down INTO SHOT, bouncing on the hard ground. His lounge chair tumbles after him. Dan's entire body is lacerated with small cuts, his hair is singed and what's left of his clothes are tattered, smoking shreds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He manages to untangle himself from the overturned chair and get to his feet. Somewhere a telephone is RINGING. That's what must have awakened him in time to save his life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dan looks around, dazed. The pool is empty. The party has broken up. Dan turns toward the ringing phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him is a glassed in cubicle/office. The ringing phone sits on a desk inside. Dan tries the door. Locked. Then suddenly comes to his senses in recognition.
</DIRECTION>
<DAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alice!....
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAN>
<DIRECTION>
Dan turns, and charges toward the parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMPUS PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAN'S TRUCK in the FOREGROUND. Beside it sits a gleaming MOTORCYCLE. Dan comes running INTO SHOT, searching himself for his keys. Can't find them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to open the truck's door. Locked. He slams the hand against it in frustration. Then notices the Yamaha 1200.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Its key is snugly in the ignition slot, like an invitation. Dan hops on the bike. Turns the key, and kick-starts the monster. The engine jumps to life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE PARKING LOT EXIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From across the lot we see Dan and bike charging toward us. He roars PAST CAMERA and screeches onto the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dan guns the bike's motor and races toward the Crave-Inn. Suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ENGINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
gives a terrific GROWL. The bike's front end comes off the ground as the bike goes into a wheelie, then accelerates down the street at an outrageous speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
frantically dodges several cars, swerving into the oncoming lane to pass one, then careening back to avoid a pair of looming headlights. Dan looks down at the instrument panel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON PANEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the gauges are RED LINED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAN'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
begins to distort with the G-FORCE of this impossible ride. The bike just keeps increasing speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE INSTRUMENT PANEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
goes out of control. The gauges swing erratically. They begin to speed up dizzyingly, then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PANEL EXPLODES!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Its cover flies away in shards revealing a frenzied collection of MOVING WIRES and BLINKING LIGHTS beneath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wires and lights begin to ungulate in an evolution of patterns. Soon we realize a FACE is beginning to form out of this tangled, sparking mess.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BIKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is moving so fast now the other cares are only passing blurs. Dan slaloms through them at an impossible rate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE INSTRUMENT PANEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
continues to metamorphasize. Wires spark and leap as they wind in and around each other. Lights at the top move toward the center to form two eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shards of sparking metal marshal themselves into two rows of electric teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Other wires form cheekbones, lips, and the sickeningly recognizable scar patterns of Freddy's skin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And that's just what we're looking at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CYBERNETIC FREDDY!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His electric eyes stare up at Dan's frightened face with the glee of anticipation. He speaks with Mr. Jordan's voice.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time to feel the need for speed, Dickweed!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
DAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stares down at the face in horror. Then he sees something really bad...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAN'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
his right hand clutches the handlebar/throttle. Cables feed out from the brake and throttle grip and PLUNGE INTO HIS HAND with a smoking SIZZLE, attaching him to the machinery. His skin begins to undulate and BUBBLE UP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHIP PAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To Dan's left hand. Cables have melded with his bubbling flesh there, too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA CRANES DOWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
across the side of the bike, where the gas tank is starting to transform into a hideous living creature/machine. Distended ribs protrude. The gas tank/torso begins to undulate as it breathes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA CONTINUES DOWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
toward the cylinders, which stretch and begin to breathe, then comes to rest between them and the whirring spokes of the front wheel. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and we see Dan from below the handlebars. Through the tatters of his shredded clothes we see more cracking, bubbling skin. His face is wracked with torture and something beyond even horror. Suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HANDLEBARS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
now joined completely to Dan's hands, THRUST DOWNWARD, slamming his chest to the body of the bike. Dan stares into Freddy's robotic face, now an inch from his own.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA TRACKS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
from left to right, passing beneath the breathing cylinders. The highway blurs below us. The CAMERA emerges on the left side of the bike, looking back toward Dan's left leg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE EXHAUST PIPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is merging with Dan's leg. Growing into it, as Dan's skin continues to bubble, and billow up, then peel off...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TILT UP TO DAN'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and now we realize that Dan has become a MACHINE/MAN, like a butterfly emerging from its cocoon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON DAN'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only his eyes remain human. Dan struggles, continuing to meld with the machine. He opens his mouth, forcing the metallic skin to crack around the edges, and begins A LONG HIDEOUS SCREAM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA RAPIDLY PULLS BACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
to reveal a FULL SHOT of the FREDDY BIKE hurtling down the street that has become nothing more than an abstract blur of movement and light. Dan's SCREAM continues to build, forming into a plea of terror...

A bright light washes over Dan's eyes; We hear an EARSPLITTING DIESEL HORN! Dan looks up INTO CAMERA. Squints against the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAN'S POV FROM INSIDE DAN'S TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MASSIVE DIESEL SEMI TRUCK hurtles toward CAMERA like a juggernaut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK to reveal that the POV is now from inside Dan's truck, staring out the windshield at the twin beams of an APPROACHING SEMI!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA TILTS DOWN to Dan's unattended steering wheel...

REVERSE ANGLE - FAST TRACK

through the windshield, IN SLOW MOTION. Dan frantically tries to return his now human hands to the wheel...too late!

she is pouring a late night CUSTOMER a cup of coffee. Suddenly...the restaurant SOUNDS distort. She hears Dan's VOICE calling her name. Alice snaps to as the coffee cup she's filling overflows. She drops the pot of coffee. The entire wall behind her changes to

AN EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF DAN'S RUSTED, NIGHTMARE FACE - SCREAMING HER NAME!

Alice turns. Runs toward the wall.

<DIRECTION>
He disappears into the depths just as Alice reaches the wall. She stretches out her hand...and the wall returns to reality.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is wracked with a SPASM and PAIN! She clutches her stomach and doubles over, as though she'd been kicked. She fights the pain away. Then gets up and runs wildly to the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CRAVE INN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice charges out of the diner. Behind her, far down the street, we can make out the silhouette of a JACK-KNIFED SEMI, back-lit by the flames and smoke of DAN'S BURNING TRUCK! We hear the BLARE of a jammed horn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SERIES OF JUMPCUTS BETWEEN Alice's face and her POV END CLOSE ON HER FACE as she SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA TURNS WITH HER and FOLLOWS HER as she runs panicked, toward it. The BLARING horn grows LOUDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she nears the semi, the driver's door swings violently open! A figure LURCHES from the cab. Grabs her as she moves past. The momentum swings them both around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TRUCK DRIVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
his bloody face is lit by the burning wreck of Dan's truck. His eyes are glazed and shocked. He SCREAMS madly into Alice's face.
</DIRECTION>
<TRUCK_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He came flying out of nowhere! Like he was a fucking rocket! I didn't even see him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRUCK_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a WALL of approaching SIRENS. Alice's tear-stained face is strobed in a flashing red light as she looks past the semi driver to see Dan's mangled body enmeshed in the wreckage. As she tries to get to him his eyes snap open and he looks straight at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAN>
<DIRECTION>
Blood wells from his gaping wounds as he chokes and dies. Her eyes begin to lose focus. In a moment...Alice collapses, falling OUT OF FRAME...leaving only the black of the night sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK. Then... Alice's rim-lit profile moves into frame. Track around to reveal Yvonne working in the background. Continue tracking to reveal that we're in an unlit hospital room. What little light there is comes from the glass observation window in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the window we can see Alice's father conferring with a DOCTOR, Dan's parents and TWO POLICE OFFICERS. Beyond them we see traffic in the corridor. Alice's eyes open suddenly.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Yvonne hears her and comes over, leaning into frame.
</DIRECTION>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're alright...It's okay, honey. I'm right here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
Alice stares at Yvonne. Things are far from alright.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alice, Dan's been in an accident...
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
Alice shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(in a monotone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was no accident. It was Krueger. He used to get in through my dreams, but not anymore. He's found some other way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alice, it's no dream. I'm sorry...Dan's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
Alice stares at her as her eyes fill with tears as she remembers. As she starts crying she clutches Yvonne in a desperate embrace. At the sound of her crying, Dr. Moore and her father leave Dan's parents and approach Yvonne and Alice.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Calm down. Take it easy. You're hitting shock.

</YVONNE>
<ALICE_S_DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alice. The police found fragments of a champagne bottle...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE_S_DAD>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dan didn't drink. You know that. It was probably for me - to celebrate our trip.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Her father looks away, helpless. Dr. Moore turns to him and speaks in a confidential, professionally calm voice.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These sorts of outbursts aren't entirely uncommon. Many women have them in the first few weeks. Especially if they've suffered a traumatic shock.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Alice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But don't worry young lady, you're going to be fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_MOORE>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(getting increasingly hysterical)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't be fine and neither will any of my friends. We've got to do something. Dan's already dead...Don't you see? He's back and he's just getting started.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as she remembers what Moore just said)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean? What's he talking about? What's wrong with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Yvonne speaks up, trying to be comforting.
</DIRECTION>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.

She and Alice hold eyes for a beat. Everyone is silent.

Stunned. She lies back, closing her eyes tightly. A tear forms at the edge of one and spills down her cheek.

	Just for routine observation. To make sure you're as comfortable as possible.

Alice hasn't been listening. We hold on her troubled face as she opens her eyes again, the full ramifications sinking in.

<ALICE>

FADE OUT.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL OBSERVATION ROOM - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice lies in bed, apparently asleep. The camera pans slowly around the room. It is eerie in here now with the long shadows of hospital equipment thrown across the walls by the dimmed hallway lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera continues slowly, deliberately to move around the room until we are on the OPEN doorway. STOP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACOB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a boy of about six or seven years stands there, watching Alice. He's frail. Other worldly. Not ghost-like, but possessing a strange, transcendent quality.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wears a white hospital robe and stands without moving, just staring at Alice with a transfixed smile of happiness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice's gaze at the ceiling slowly moves toward the child, as though she were willed by some force to notice him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's startled at first by his presence. Then she realizes he's only a boy. Even if he is a little odd.
</DIRECTION>
<JACOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey...wake up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACOB>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(tentative)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
They gaze at one another for a beat. They each seem to be transfixed by each other.

</ALICE>
<JACOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Jacob.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACOB>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles. She waits. He just watches. He stands there in the way that little kids have of feeling no need to fill a silence with conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shouldn't you be in your room, Jacob?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<JACOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's lonely in there, in my room.

He cuts her off with:

<JACOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry your boyfriend got killed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACOB>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(shocked)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you know that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<JACOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could tell you were sad. I just wanted to see if you were all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACOB>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles kind of shyly and turns. Alice calls after him.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jacob. Wait. Don't go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
But he has already disappeared down the dark corridor. HOLD ON Alice's troubled face.

EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY

Alice and Yvonne walk out of the building.

	There aren't any little boys on your floor.

Yvonne shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't have a children's ward.

Alice stops. Puzzled.

<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he was wearing a hospital robe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Yvonne looks at Alice with a mixture of impatience and compassion.
</DIRECTION>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what to tell you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
Alice takes this in. Thinks about it. Yvonne looks a little more concerned about Alice's state of mind.
</DIRECTION>

</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
She blows smoke in his face.

There is a beat, then...

	Look. Dan's parents were pushing him. Pushing him hard. He was bitching about it at the party last night. He was under pressure. We all are.

<GRETA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pushy parents can make you more than a bit crazy.

	Christ, Mark! Mister compassion.

Everyone stares at her. Not knowing what to say.

Great stands. Puts her hands on Alice's shoulders.

Alice removes a couple of frozen microwave dinners from the refrigerator and sets them on the counter. While she does so, the CAMERA TRACKS around and as she leans on the counter, we push in to reveal she is lost in thought, tears forming in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her father comes in carrying a bag of groceries - healthy stuff: veggies, chicken, fruit, Rye Crisp, juices. As he comes in, Alice covers up her tears and turns away to put the dinners in the oven. He obviously has something to say to her in mind and the two of them talk simultaneously.

The house is decorated in "modern pretentiousness" and the guests match the spirit of the room. Greta sits at the opposite end of the table from her mother, wearing a beautiful white dress.

One of the guests turns from Greta to her mother.

Mrs. Gibson cuts her off, trying to damage-control Greta's association with someone her guests might disapprove of.

Another guest speaks up, a THIRTYSOMETHING TYPE.

Greta tires to ignore him. The other guests jump in with their own literary allusions and comparisons. Greta CLOSES HER EYES to shut them out. For a second she seems to nod. Catches herself. Looks up as...

FREDERICK, the caterer, steps forward and offers her selections from a tray of food. We don't see his face, but a sliver of a GREEN AND RED STRIPED JERSEY peaks out from above his starched tuxedo collar. Greta shakes her head no.

<GRETA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thank you. I'm not hungry.

Frederick steps away. The other guests strangely cease conversing mid-sentence and turn to her. Greta's mother notices with alarm. Faces her daughter.

He wheels in a trolley with a sterling silver chafing dish on it. He turns to Greta and pushes in the tray to the hideous baby chair, which Greta's chair has become, pinning her in place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guests continue chowing down, while Mom beams approvingly. Greta stiffens into a parody of too-straight posture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frederick removes the lid of the sterling silver chafing dish with a flourish, revealing a perfect, miniature doll-like replica of Greta.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a flourish, he proceeds to slit it open, filleting it in front of Greta's horrified eyes with one of the blades on Freddy's clawed hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frederick has now become Freddy, transforming from the normal Robert Englund to Freddy Krueger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the end of the blades on Freddy's claw, a sharpened silver spoon now exists.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He scoops into the dissected doll and begins to feed Greta, forcing some of the mush into her mouth. Greta resists, turning her head to spit it out.

Freddy jerks her head back to the front.

screams in horror as she realizes what she's eating.

INT. ALICE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVER ALICE'S SHOULDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she steps to the refrigerator and grasps the door handle, we get a glimpse of something foreboding a split second before she opens the door...a Freddy magnet above the handle that says DIE BITCH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice pulls the door open. PUSH IN past her to the groceries inside. a real Freddy food feast of graveyard leftovers -- flies swarm when Alice opens the door. Maggots, rot and cobwebs. Dripping fetid garbage. Then suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Greta's hideously mutated face SHOOTS INTO CLOSE UP from RIGHT FRAME! Her cheeks have been horribly distended. Food spills from her mouth as she tries to scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVER GRETA'S SHOULDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who we can now see is impossibly coming out in the open refrigerator door. Her arms desperately reach out towards Alice who stands frozen, FACING CAMERA, in open-mouthed shock.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Greta!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Then Alice leaps into action. She grabs Greta's hands and begins to pull with all her might. But she can't get Greta out!

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE AND GRETA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice has managed to pull Greta a couple inches further from the open door when Freddy LUNGES out of the refrigerator! With lightning speed he grabs Greta's arm and YANKS the door closed with a WHAM!

ALICE

INT. GRETA'S DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE DREAM - FREDDY AND GRETA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freddy shoves another clawful of stuff into Greta's mouth. She starts to CHOKE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freddy pulls Greta to him. Hugs her, patting her back, like a parent burping an infant. He's almost cradling her as she continues to choke the life out of herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freddy's "patting" becomes harder. Greta jolts under each slap on the back...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE DINNER PARTY - ON GRETA - FROM BELOW, SHOOTING UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to choke. Her face goes blue. She stands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GUESTS

<DIRECTION>
stare at her in shocked amazement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRETA
</DIRECTION>

EXT. GREY'S CONSTRUCTION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A big industrial shop. Mark's father's business and their home. Rain falls on the cement drive, glistening in the light that spills from beneath the big, half open delivery door. Across the door we see: GREY & SON CONSTRUCTION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The "& SON" has been recently added. Alice and Yvonne, still in her nurse's uniform, approach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GREY'S CONSTRUCTION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge warehouse and commercial shop. Rows of scaffolding, filled with prefab door and wall units, recede into the darkness. A glass partitioned office fills a corner near the door. We can see Mark's father moving around inside of it. Alice and Yvonne enter and move toward the office door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE OFFICE DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice and Yvonne peer inside. Mr. Grey, dressed in workman's clothes, is stoically trying to repair a broken name-plate. We can tell that one of the two desks in here was intended for Mark. Alice looks around, concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Grey...is Mark around?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up, very upset. Nods. Angrily gestures toward the labyrinth of racks.

<MR_GREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back there somewhere.

</MR_GREY>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE RACKS OF THE SCAFFOLDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rays of a single worklight high on the back of the wall stab like fingers through the maze of scaffolding. Silhouetted against them, Mark slowly glides between the racks on a skateboard, a solitary and forlorn figure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice and Yvonne enter shot, backs to CAMERA, watching him.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>

</ALICE>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I'm just aces.

</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Looks like he's not. Mark ignores them as Alice and Yvonne move closer. He's a tightly wound coil, ready to snap.

<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to talk to both you guys about Greta. And...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(snapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm very fucking sorry, but Greta is dead today. Could we interest you in someone else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Alice steps closer to him, her empathy allowing her to ignore his tone of voice.
</DIRECTION>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was just an accident. Like with Dan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No accident. I tried to warn all of you about Krueger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Yvonne shakes her head. Not wishing Alice to indulge her fantasies.
</DIRECTION>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Alice...
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
But Alice's words have left an effect on Mark. He brings his skateboard to a halt. Gives her a direct look.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She must've fallen asleep at the table...

Mark glances at her.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too bad.

</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He goes back to Alice.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(frustrated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't understand what's happening. Krueger has to use my dreams, but he got to Dan and Greta while I was awake. How's he doing it?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you two stick to reality.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
Mark turns his displaced anger on her full force.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you shut up and let her talk! Two of us died in the last two days, does that strike you as particularly normal?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark...
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not finished - I loved Greta. A lot. And if maybe, just maybe, someone or some thing killed her, I'd like to hear about it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't listen to this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to turn away. Mark gets angry again. Shouts.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then get out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Hurt, Yvonne starts to get up. Turns for the stairs. Mark realizes he's being a jerk. Punches his fist against the scaffolding in frustration. Calms himself down.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aww,shit...Yvonne, wait a minute, will ya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
She stops. Turns.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>

(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm an asshole. I know I'm not dealing with this very well and it's not your fault. I'm sorry.

</MARK>

Yvonne gives him a little hug. Tries to smile.
</DIRECTION>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stick around, please?

</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Yvonne brushes Mark's hair from his face like a big sister.
</DIRECTION>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wish I could, but I'm on night shift again...gotta go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>

Mark nods. Tries to smile. Alice steps up to them. Puts a comforting hand on Mark's shoulder.

	I can stay for awhile if you want.

INT. MARK'S ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A combination studio and storage space for the world's largest collection of comics. The entire loft is a network of scaffolding. Shelves for his comics, fantasy posters, and sci-fi memorabilia. Stuffed in among them are tons of books on mythology and the occult.

<MARK>

	Do you think I'm an idiot...for being in love with her?

(O.S.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody thinks that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Tacked to the walls and scaffolding, are dozens of drawings. Works in progress of Mark's super hero comic book creation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the CAMERA pans across the sketches, we see the evolution of this character. Several names have been tried and crossed out as Mark's conception has continued to bloom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CONTINUE TO PAN until we come to a SIX FOOT POSTER of the character in final incarnation as...THE PHANTOM PROWLER.

	I mean, I know I didn't stand a chance in hell, but...

PAN PAST THE PROWLER to Alice and Mark, sitting near his drawing table. She sits next to him, a comforting arm around his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She cared a lot about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Mark nods. Thinks.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it was her mother who killed her, with all that Polly Perfect shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't her mother. The only reason we're still here is that none of us has slept since the grad party.

Mark looks at Alice. Sees the certainty on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me some more about this Krueger guy.

THE TABLE - ALICE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sketch of Greta begins to move, reassembling itself into a drawing of the ELM STREET HOUSE. Mark stands on the porch, opening the door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
realizes what's happening. Reaches her hand toward the page.

<ALICE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark! No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
But he goes inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice quickly picks up one of Mark's colored felt tip pens and draws a stick figure of herself next to the Elm Street house. She writes "Alice" above the figure then throws down the pen and closes her eyes, concentrating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUSH IN on Alice, eyes closed, using all her will... (The BACKGROUND distorts as Alice goes into the dream.) PULL BACK from Alice's face and now we see that we're

Alice rushes inside. Comes to a halt as she sees
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HUGE, GAPING HOLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in the floor, with jagged "paper" edges, like something out of Mark's cartoons. Mark desperately clings to one of the edges, which slowly begins to tear...

<DIRECTION>
Alice rushes over. Through the hole, she sees what Mark is about to drop into...the pulsating FETAL CANAL!

CLOSE ON ALICE
</DIRECTION>

as she kneels and stretches her hand toward Mark.
</DIRECTION>

CLOSE ON MARK

He looks up at Alice, noticing her for the first time, and maybe not sure if she's really there. He hesitates. The paper tears some more. He's about to fall!

Alice gets down on her belly, trying to reach closer to Mark, who keeps slowly slipping further into the hole.

fingertips quivering a millimeter apart, then touching, then moving toward each other's palms until their hands firmly grip!

ALICE AND MARK - SIDE ANGLE

Alice watches as Mark feints himself AWAKE. As he's about to hit the floor, he dissolves away. Alice starts to turn back to the door when something OUT OF FRAME catches her eye.

CAMERA PANS TO RIGHT until we see... JACOB standing at a window, staring forlornly into the street.

Jacob turns to her. His face full of hurt and accusation.

	You had me scared on the phone. What's wrong with the baby?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think Krueger's trying to do something to it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Yvonne suddenly pulls Alice to a halt, dismayed.
</DIRECTION>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Alice...no. Honey, I love you but you're going to have to get a hold of yourself...
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark knows I'm not crazy. Ask him to show you his hands.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Alice starts off again. Yvonne really looks worried now.
</DIRECTION>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really think you need to calm down now, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just can't figure out how he's getting in when I'm awake...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a thought strikes her. She wheels on Yvonne.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do unborn babies dream?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Yvonne hesitates, afraid her answer might feed Alice's fantasies.
</DIRECTION>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...they do, but...do us both a favor...don't mention any of this to Dr. Moore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DR. MOORE'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yvonne adjusts the ULTRA SOUND MONITOR. Dr. Moore finishes his pre-examination of Alice. He is extremely irritated.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Developing fetuses can spend up to seventy-percent of their day in what we call dream state. More as they mature.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
Yvonne shoots a frustrated look at Alice.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would I be able to sense them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DR_MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
(annoyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that why you're here? To see if your baby's having nightmares?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_MOORE>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're here to find out everything we can, aren't we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DR_MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frankly, I've found nothing about you that would indicate the necessity of ultra-sound at this stage of your pregnancy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Moore throws a dark look at Yvonne.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just want to make sure my baby's all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Yvonne hands the ultra-sound device to Dr. Moore. He runs the device over Alice's baby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ULTRA-SOUND MONITOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The screen comes on with a BLIP. A barely distinguishable black and white image appears...
</DIRECTION>
<DR_MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The heart seems strong. Let's hear it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
Yvonne flicks a switch and a steady RHYTHMIC BEAT begins on the TRACK, coming from a speaker above the monitor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice watches the screen, fascinated. Suddenly... The picture begins to shift and distort with electronic spasms. The SOUND of the baby's heartbeat begins to grow LOUDER and SURREAL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice turns apprehensively to Yvonne and Dr. Moore, who are oblivious to any of this. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wall behind Alice starts to PULSATE...become FLESHLIKE. It ripples blue-red with veins. Then...a gaping hole opens and we are staring into the fetal canal!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOSH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice is sucked through the opening!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN IRIDESCENT BEAM OF LIGHT (ALICE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
flies through a landscape of pulsing blood vessels and living tissue. We are inside Alice's body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN ENORMOUS VALVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stretches open and the beam of "light" shoots through it, then drops down OUT OF FRAME. Hold a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Alice floats up INTO FRAME...a translucent figure, ethereal. She is caught in a GLOW OF LIGHT. WE TURN WITH HER to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER UNBORN BABY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
glowing with innocence. Floating...umbilical chord in the FOREGROUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she approaches the child. She's fascinated...enchanted. Until she sees something beyond the baby, a face, protruding from the uterine wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREDDY KRUEGER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
smiling at Alice.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. See a family resemblance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reacts in fear as she sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE UMBILICAL CHORD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
beginning to bulge as something forces its way through it toward her baby. The bulge moves down the chord, then a second one enters from the wall...both "things" travel toward the fetus' belly like golf balls moving through a python. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOSH, WHOOSH, they shoot into the fetus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
fear turns to utter horror as she sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FETUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
its skin has turned translucent and we see the tiny, "as in hideous death" souls of DAN and GRETA in the child's belly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE SOULS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
screaming in terror!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREDDY'S HUGE FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
leering in twisted pleasure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BABY'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
begins to slowly transform into a mask of fear and pain. Its eyes begin to flutter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON FREDDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he realizes the child is on the verge of awakening. He grimaces in anger and frustration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
screams at Freddy.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't touch him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
THE CHILD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
begins to turn toward Alice as it nears consciousness. Its eyes open, staring in wonder for just a second, then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MATCH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DR. MOORE'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
eyes open wide in terror. She looks around, panicked.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's he doing to my baby?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
DR. MOORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
leans INTO SHOT, removing the testing device.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your baby is perfectly healthy... a little large for so early on, but as normal as any I've seen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
HOLD ON ALICE. She's got knowledge Dr. Moore hasn't got. She turns to Yvonne.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's taking their souls...Their spirits to make the baby...like him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Yvonne shoots a look at Dr. Moore. She realizes she'd better get Alice out of there before he has her committed. Yvonne moves to Alice.
</DIRECTION>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, sweety. I'll take you home. You'll feel better after you get some real sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
Yvonne manages to guide Alice from the room. Dr. Moore watches them leave. Then he checks something in Alice's file. Picks up the telephone and dials a number.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALICE'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice ENTERS, carrying two mugs of coffee and speaking in a frantic rush. Yvonne follows behind, a look of deep concern on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Dan was there. Greta, too. Krueger killed them! And now he's feeding them to Jacob!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
She hands one of the cups to Yvonne, who tries to get her attention.
</DIRECTION>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alice...
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
Yvonne sets her mug down and gently places her hands on Alice's shoulders, adopting a very reasonable tone.
</DIRECTION>
<YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alice, I want you to stop and listen to yourself. Do you know how you sound?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
Alice nods. Calmly replies.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Completely insane. But I'm not
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if you're my friend you'll try to believe me a little.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Yvonne looks into Alice's eyes. We see that she really cares about her, and that Alice is starting to scare her.
</DIRECTION>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am your friend, and I'm worried sick about you. But, you're like a locked safe. You've gotta start dealing with reality.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Krueger is reality.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
(voice rising)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so is your baby. You've got more than just yourself to think of now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(getting angry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think I'm doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pauses)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. Whether you believe it or not, Krueger is back. He's after the baby and if I don't try to do something about it, who will??
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the door is pushed open and Mark enters carrying a folder stuffed with xeroxed newspaper clippings. He looks from Alice to Yvonne and back.
</DIRECTION>
<YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing the discussion)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I know is that you are not doing yourself or the baby any good by acting like a crazy woman. Why don't you take off - leave Springwood and cool out somewhere for a while?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn it, Yvonne! You don't just run away from this guy! He finds you in your dreams.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at Yvonne)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He sure found a few others before us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Yvonne looks at him with frustration.
</DIRECTION>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You, too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He invited me to his house last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Yvonne ruefully shakes her head. Tries the calm approach.
</DIRECTION>
<YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look...we're all tired. None of us had any sleep since Friday night...
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the only reason you're alive...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Yvonne abandons the calm approach. Wheels on Alice.
</DIRECTION>
<YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No it's not!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
She turns for the door. Mark shoves the folder towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yvonne, look through this stuff. She's not crazy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Yvonne knocks the folder from Mark's hand, scattering its contents everywhere. Then she storms out, slamming the door behind her. The xeroxed clippings float to the floor. Mark glances at Alice.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Alice nods. They start picking up the scattered clippings.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I found out how Krueger's been doing it while I'm awake. He's using Jacob's dreams. We've got to stop him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Mark looks up at her.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know there is...one way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Alice looks up at him, intrigued.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you thought about not having the baby? I mean, no baby, no baby's dreams.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Alice thinks about it, very hard. Finally shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't do that, Mark. He's my last link with Dan...No, I want him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(nods, smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then we'll find another way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
leans down again and continues picking up the clippings. One, bearing a photo of Amanda Krueger, lies in FOREGROUND. She picks it up, stares at it, pondering.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've seen her...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Her father's voice floats up from downstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE_S_DAD>

	Alice, can you come down a minute?

INT. ALICE'S LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice comes down the stairs. Her father is sitting in the living room with Dan's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Jordan.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hi...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Jordan smiles at Alice a little too sweetly. We see the strain of her son's death in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alice...Mr. Jordan and I wanted to see how you were feeling. Come, sit down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JORDAN>
<DIRECTION>
Alice hesitates, this is the last thing she needs right now.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE_S_DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't really a good time. Maybe if you could come back...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE_S_DAD>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Jordan nervously cuts him off.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frankly, dear, we wondered what you intend to do with our baby?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JORDAN>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I what? Well, I've thought about it. I plan to keep him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Jordan glances at her husband. He uncomfortably shifts in his chair, then reluctantly speaks up.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're concerned that this all might be a little too much for you...I mean, being single and, well everything...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_JORDAN>
<DIRECTION>
His voice trails off. His wife frowns at his lack of fortitude. She jumps in.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What Mr. Jordan means is that we're aware of the burden that raising a child would place you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JORDAN>
<DIRECTION>
Alice continues to stare at her, not quite sure where this is going. Mark quietly appears on the stairs behind her holding the folder of clippings.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JORDAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're offering to help...adopt it and raise it as though it were --

<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I appreciate what you're offering, but no. He is my responsibility.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<MRS_JORDAN>
<DIRECTION>
(getting adamant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And ours. It's our grandchild.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JORDAN>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Jordan, clearly uncomfortable, tries to cut her off.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doris, maybe this wasn't such a good --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_JORDAN>
<DIRECTION>
She ignores him, getting more forceful.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In your present condition, Alice, we're worried about your ability --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JORDAN>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about? My "condition"?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Alice's father gives Mrs. Jordan a dark look. Surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We had a call from Dr. Moore. He said Alice was hysterical. That she's been having paranoid delusions and...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_JORDAN>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't understand...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<MRS_JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We know you've been through a lot but there's more than your feelings at stake here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JORDAN>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not taking my baby!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Jordan stands, losing her composure.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The courts may not agree with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_JORDAN>
<DIRECTION>
Alice's father stands. Turns an angry gaze on Mrs. Jordan.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE_S_DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I do. I've heard enough of this crap. You think you can just walk into my house and start threatening my daughter?

SWIRLING JACUZZI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Yvonne approaches. She steps up to the side and gingerly stretches out her foot to test the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON SURFACE OF WATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
frothing and bubbling ominously. Yvonne's toe glides down INTO FRAME, hovers, then dips into the swirling white water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON YVONNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
smiling happily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON SURFACE OF JACUZZI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Yvonne lowers herself into the luxurious water. We're sure any second something is going to rise up and eat her...But nothing happens...yet. She sinks in up to her neck, purring like a kitten. Her eye lids grow heavy. Start to slide closed. She quickly opens them. Starts to rise up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAMPUS POOL - WIDE SHOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No one in sight. Yvonne ENTERS, wet from the jacuzzi. Tosses her towel on a chair and heads for the high dive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LADDER - LOW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yvonne climbs INTO SHOT, going up the ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE BOARD - OVERHEAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stretches, then starts walking out on the board. Water shimmers in the pool thirty feet below her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVER YVONNE'S SHOULDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she moves out onto the board. CAMERA TRACKS DOWN level with the back of her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END OF THE BOARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
from below, looking back and up at Yvonne as the board strangely begins to tremble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON YVONNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reacting as the trembling increases.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ENTIRE BOARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
begins to shake violently, whipping back and forth. Yvonne fights to keep her balance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YVONNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reaches for the rail. It comes off in her hand!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOOKING OVER YVONNE'S SHOULDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
at the end of the board. Rust runs back from the end like a wave breaking on the shore. Then the board begins to split and crack, forming into four pieces. Freddy's claws!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BOARD (SIDE ANGLE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The claws at the end of the board begin to roll up and move toward Yvonne. She steps back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOOKING OVER YVONNE'S SHOULDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she retreats from the approaching claws. Suddenly, a jagged "thumb", formed from the rear of the board, rolls INTO SHOT, trapping her. She is literally in the palm of Freddy's hand!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREDDY'S CLAW - FROM BELOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rolling up around Yvonne.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREDDY'S CLAW - SIDE ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holding a terrified Yvonne in its palm, and about to close over her. She has only a second to act.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YVONNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
leaps from the claw.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON YVONNE - SLOW MOTION
</DIRECTION>

as she moves down THROUGH FRAME, tumbling out of control.

<DIRECTION>
about seventy-feet below and getting closer every second as CAMERA races for it!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON YVONNE - SLOW MOTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
she begins to regain her equilibrium. Straightens out, starts moving into a diving position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE ON YVONNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now in perfect diving form, she gracefully slices through the air like a knife...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON YVONNE'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
suddenly filling with horror. She SCREAMS as she sees
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE POOL - FROM ABOVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
which was FULL a second ago, is now EMPTY, save for a small puddle in the center.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yvonne hits the puddle! Water splashes up and...she keeps going, right through the concrete!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK LIMBO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
suddenly Yvonne breaks through the void in a crash of shattering glass. Fragments and shards SPARKLE and GLIMMER as she plummets past CAMERA!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FREDDY JACUZZI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small room with rusted and decaying lockers along the walls, like something forgotten in an ancient gym. The entire floor is a NIGHTMARE JACUZZI, churning with BLOOD! Eerie red light, coming from beneath the swirling surface, plays over the crusted walls. Suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yvonne dives down INTO SHOT, plunges through the surface of the BOILING BLOOD then disappears!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARK'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON GRAINY B&W PHOTO OF AMANDA KRUEGER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frozen in time. Staring from her nun's habit, eyes filled with infinite sadness and despair. She's standing on the grounds of the asylum, its tower looming behind her.

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's their problem.

</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
The photo is yanked down out of frame, WHIP PAN to Alice looking up from the photo towards Mark, across the room. We are in Mark's loft. He's scanning one of the copied newspaper articles.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's our problem, Mark. If I don't deal with this, they really might try to take Jacob.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said she committed suicide?
	</DIALOGUE>

<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what the newspapers thought. She spent the rest of her life in the asylum. After Krueger's trial she flipped out and hung herself, so they thought.

	Meaning?

Mark shakes his head, grinning at the creepiness of it.

	Empty plot. Memorial stone. Vacant. They never did put her under. Cool, huh?

Mark finds what he's looking for. A huge volume with a crumbling leather cover. He pulls it out and sets it on his drawing table with a THUD.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>

	In here...somewhere.
	</DIALOGUE>

Alice looks down at the book. It's RLA Frakes' EARLY CHRISTIAN MYTHOLOGY. Mark opens it. Moves his desk lamp closer. Thumbs for a page. Finds it. Reads.

Alice gives him a frown, then goes back to Amanda's photo; the nun and the asylum tower.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(thinking out loud)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the dream...she was trying to stop him...she started to tell me how, then the door slammed.

	<DIALOGUE>
	He must have done it.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON PHOTO - TIGHT ON AMANDA'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Following Alice's gaze, CAMERA PANS UP from Amanda's face, to the ASYLUM TOWER behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pondering the tower.

<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to find out how to deal with this guy for once and for all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Alice turns and steps out of frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
still perusing the volume, his back to Alice. Suddenly, FREDDY'S CLAW shoots out from the DESK LAMP and SLAMS the book closed!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
jumps, stunned. He blinks, did that really happen? Then he grabs his mug of coffee and takes a long drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUSH FOCUS FULL SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
to drawing of Mark's comic book creation, THE PHANTOM PROWLER. Suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HUGE HAND holding a PENCIL comes INTO FRAME, and continues the sketch. SLOWLY TILT UP TO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARK'S TIRED FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
filled with an artist's concentration. He glances OFF SCREEN, and CAMERA slowly follows his gaze to
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
asleep in his bed. TRACK IN CLOSE on her face until the dark wall behind her becomes the corridor in the asylum. She opens her eyes and sits up. CAMERA FOLLOWS HER as she stands and moves down the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amanda!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Alice moves down the corridor, away from CAMERA, searching for Amanda. Comes to a corner. Turns down it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARK'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON a spread of PHANTOM PROWLER sketches lying on the floor. CAMERA TRACKS across them, following a TRAIL OF SKETCHES that lead to the far side of the room where we find Mark, lying on the floor at the base of a rack of comic laden shelves, propped up on one elbow, bored, flicking through yet another comic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACK AROUND MARK to reveal Alice still asleep on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ASYLUM CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long, arched, Gothic corridor, lit by pools of light. At the far end, we see a staircase, silhouetted by a rainspattered window behind it. The stairs lead up into the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amanda! I need to talk to you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE walks past CAMERA INTO SHOT and pauses. Sees the staircase, starts hurrying for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE STAIRCASE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice glances toward the top. Instead of leading to a doorway, the stairs dead-end against a BRICK WALL. She climbs the stairs to the bricked up doorway at the top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laying her head on the wall, pressing her hands to it, she murmurs.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Found you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, from behind...

<FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where you goin', piglet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Alice turns toward the voice.

<FREDDY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The party's just starting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
ON ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She starts rolling across the wall. As we pull back, the camera turns on it's axis to reveal that Freddy has adjusted things. The set is now tilted on a different axis Alice is rolling away from the camera, down the staircase, but on the wall, not the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a RUSTING METAL DOOR is revealed in the wall down which she rolls. She rolls into it and crash lands in the nightmare jacuzzi room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freddy slowly rises from the boiling jacuzzi, until he stands on the surface of the pool, grinning smugly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice climbs to her feet, warily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREDDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
plunges his arm beneath the surface and yanks Yvonne up by the hair! She sputters and chokes, gasping for air. Freddy laughs...
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look what I found.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE

Alice glances toward the top. Instead of leading to a doorway, the stairs dead-end against a BRICK WALL. She climbs the stairs to the bricked up doorway at the top.

</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Found you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a door slams. Alice, startled, looks. But before she can react, she is swept off her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice starts rolling across the wall. As we pull back, the camera turns on it's axis to reveal that Freddy has adjusted things. The set is now tilted on a different axis and Alice is rolling away from the camera, down the staircase, but on the wall, not the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a RUSTING METAL DOOR is revealed in the wall down which she rolls. She rolls into it and into the bloody jacuzzi room. She grabs a hanging chain, but can't hang on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She drops into the murky water. She slowly turns with utter distaste.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where you goin', piglet? The party's just starting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Alice, startled, quickly regains her composure.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know exactly what you're up to, Krueger!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee, Alice, I thought I was up to...Yvonne!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
He plunges his arm beneath the surface and yanks Yvonne up by the hair. She sputters and chokes, gasping for air. Freddy laughs. Alice is taken by surprise. She steels herself.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let her go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Freddy cackles and dunks Yvonne savagely.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Going once. Going twice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
FREDDY AND YVONNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
he hoists her closer, until their faces are an inch apart. he licks Yvonne's cheek. She doesn't know whether to scream or throw up. Then Freddy slowly runs a CLAW across her breasts, leaving a thin trail of blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice circles Freddy until she is on the opposite side from Yvonne.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm the A, the L , the i,c,e. We're three together...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Yvonne's eyes swivel to Alice in recognition. As Alice speaks, she grabs a jacuzzi/pool instrument (a skimmer, a harpoon-shaped window hook)...
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE_AND_YVONNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's the way it's gonna be!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE_AND_YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
and as they speak, she flails Freddy across the stomach, while Yvonne executes a backflip (as previously seen in her diving sequence) out of Freddy's grasp and on to dry land.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freddy staggers back and disappears into the jacuzzi.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice and Yvonne run back into the asylum and SLAM the door behind them on the now empty jacuzzi.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We cut back inside the jacuzzi to see Freddy's hand emerge and pull under his still-bobbing hat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YVONNE AND ALICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sprawled on the corridor floor where they landed. Yvonne turns to Alice, they throw their arms around each other.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you alright?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
(nods, collecting herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...So that's him. And you're not crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YVONNE>
<DIRECTION>
Alice and Yvonne share a weary, rueful smile. Alice pulls Yvonne to her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got to find Amanda. She's the key.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARK'S ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark lays on the floor, still propped up on one elbow, reading the comic. Bored, he pushes it away. Notices on nearby which he hasn't seen before. Pulls it over
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE COMIC'S COVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
has something very familiar on it...Freddy's claw, in mid- scratch, as though it were tearing the cover open. Written across the top in dripping letters is the title: NIGHTMARE ON YOUR STREET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
intrigued, rolls hover on his stomach and opens the comic with both hands. His expression changes as he sees
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE COMIC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
drawn in black and white, a comic book style representation of Greta's death sequence!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
begins to flip back through the comic book. INTERCUT his horrified reactions with
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE COMIC BOOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the B&W illustrations depict the other mayhem that Freddy has already caused. Dan's death and Yvonne's dive.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shitty son of a bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
There is a drawing of him, lying on the floor, reading a comic book. The drawing is followed by several BLANK FRAMES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stares a moment, touches the first empty frame, then he TURNS A LINE DRAWING and begins to UNRAVEL into the COMIC BOOK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK AND WHITE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a whirlwind of black and white comics swirl round and round, slowly abating to reveal
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in COLOR, backed against a wall of BLACK AND WHITE Freddyized scaffolding. (Mark will be the only thing in color throughout the sequence.) He looks around, amazed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK to reveal he's standing in a corner made by two walls of scaffolding. They tower above him, rusting, decrepit, held together at odd angles -- a nightmarish cross between Mark's comic-stuffed racks and the ones in his father's workshop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark looks around, frightened. Starts climbing his way up and out. Freezes when he hears...RIP!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark looks through the scaffolding and sees
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREDDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
on the other side, ripping through the scaffolding supports as though they were made of paper, cutting his way to Mark
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time to cut another character out of the story!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
MARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
eyes going wide. He jumps down. Turns around. Sees the towering walls of scaffolding stretching ahead of him to seeming infinity. He races away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
running away from CAMERA down an enormous CANYON OF FREDDYIZED RACKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CANYON OF RACKS - DOWN ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking down from far above we see Mark frantically racing through the canyon. Freddy steps into the canyon behind him. Long shadows stretch out before them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
slides to a halt as he comes face to face with A DEAD END. No way out. He turns as he hears FREDDY'S CACKLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK AND WHITE FREDDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
laughs as he reaches out and grabs the scaffolding on either side of him. His fingers and claws plunge through the paper racks. Freddy cackles with laughter, then starts racing like a missile toward Mark!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK AND WHITE FREDDY - SIDE ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING with Freddy as he rushes down the aisle, riding a SKATEBOARD, ripping and tearing through the rack supports.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
at the dead end. CAMERA RACES right toward him! He raises his arms against the impending collision.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH MARK'S HANDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as we see BLACK AND WHITE FREDDY's leering face loom right into CAMERA about to CRASH right into MARK! Then
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freddy's gone! Mark lowers his arms, amazed and relieved. But his relief evaporates as CAMERA QUICKLY TRACKS AROUND and we see the scaffolding begin to collapse from the far end of the canyon forward, falling like dominoes toward us
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MARK - DOWN ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as ton after ton of scaffolding and shelves crash down around him, trapping him at the dead end corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looks at all the destruction around him. Suddenly, SPLAT! Something red drips onto him from above. He looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE SCAFFOLDING BEHIND MARK - LOW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shelves that were stuffed with comics a second ago have become a WALL OF DOLLS; everything from BARBIES to RAGGEDY ANNS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, about halfway up, B&W FREDDY steps into view, dragging a GRETA DOLL IN A HIGH CHAIR with him. (They are the same size as the other dolls around them.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Greta's porcelain face and stomach bear large cracks, through which an evil, soupy, RED goop oozes out. She stares imploringly at Mark. Speaks through cracked lips.
</DIRECTION>
<GRETA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark...help me...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRETA>
<DIRECTION>
MARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stares up at her, horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREDDY AND GRETA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freddy teasingly scoops his clawed finger into Greta's torso. Lovingly licks her red goop off the end of his claw.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is she delicious or am I crazy? Try a bite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs. Then gives her a shove. The high chair tilts forward, then topples off the scaffolding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
screams in frustration and rage.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MARK'S SNEAKERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as they step back OUT OF SHOT. Greta, now a tiny porcelain doll, smashes to the floor, exploding into fragments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stares down at the shattered fragments of tiny Greta. Outrage begins to crawl across his features.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK AND WHITE FREDDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
leaps off the scaffolding to Mark, below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON MARK'S BACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shaking with anger and rage. Freddy drops down into the foreground behind him. Chortles smugly as he raises his claws for the kill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Mark whirls around, and as he does he is no longer Mark, but
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PHANTOM PROWLER (IN COLOR)
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Payback time, you scarfaced limpdick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
He glares menacingly at Freddy as he raises two FUTURISTIC PISTOLS. Aims point blank into Krueger's chest and starts blasting away!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK AND WHITE FREDDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
eyes open in wide surprise. Wads of CONFETTI fly out of the holes being hammered into him. The impact knocks Freddy to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON PHANTOM PROWLER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gun smoking, he advances on Black and White Freddy who lies unmoving in FOREGROUND. Suddenly...WHOOSH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK AND WHITE FREDDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
leaps to his feet! He is now transformed into SUPER FREDDY, a bulked up, rippling muscle Freddy Krueger. He stands with his hands on his hips, like a comic book hero.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faster than a bastard maniac!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
THE PHANTOM PROWLER
</DIRECTION>

quickly raises his gun again. FIRES!

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ME!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Then he whips his clawed hand up, swiping out toward CAMERA!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MARK'S BACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Freddy's claws RIP and TEAR through it. The tears wide and grow until we are looking right through him at... Freddy's hideous face!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK to reveal the now PAPER Mark. As Freddy continues to slash him to shreds, the COLOR begins to DRAIN OUT of Mark and RUN ONTO THE FLOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - FREDDY'S CLAWS CUTTING PAPER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE THROUGH A SERIES OF SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
of Black and White Freddy cutting Mark to shreds. His mouth open in SOUNDLESS SCREAMS.

<FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Told ya comic books were bad for ya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
FLUTTERING PIECES OF PAPER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
fill the air. They float down. FOLLOW THEM as they move together towards the open comic book on the floor of Mark's room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON COMIC BOOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the pieces of paper reassemble, filling the empty frames of the book with the illustrated version of Mark's death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK from the comic and we see Mark lying on the floor next to it, CRUSHED TO DEATH beneath a section of his collapsed shelving. The COLOR that drained from the PHANTOM PROWLER is now a growing pool of Mark's own blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA CONTINUES TO PULL BACK and we see the rest of his room is unharmed, except for a single set of shelves near Mark that teeter dangerously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the BACKGROUND, Alice lies on the bed still sleeping. But as we continue back, we see that Mark's room is now part of the Asylum corridor. We can hear Alice's voice, speaking to Yvonne OFF SCREEN.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>

</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
KEEP PULLING BACK UNTIL CAMERA REVEALS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE AND YVONNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
standing in FOREGROUND in the corridor. We see the back of Alice's head as she looks at Yvonne. Before she can answer, the CRASH of Mark's teetering bookshelves cause them to turn back toward the scene of the carnage. Mark's lifeless body lies beneath all the scaffolding. Alice clutches her belly in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	NOOO!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Alice sees herself on the bed in Mark's room. Alice on the bed becomes awake. At that moment, both she and Yvonne VANISH from the corridor, yanked out of the dream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAMPUS SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT

Yvonne's eyes snap OPEN as she comes awake with a start. She quickly glances around, realizes where she is, then hurriedly rises from the water
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GREY'S CONSTRUCTION - NIGHT

Police cars are parked out in front, their twirling lights strobing the scene RED and BLUE as a small crowd of onlookers gather to watch Mark, in body bag, being wheeled into a waiting coroner's van.

The cop turns away. Alice's father nods, starts leading her toward the street.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON STREET

closes her eyes, relieved, but not really wanting to see this. As Freddy's O.S. screams recede, HOLD ON ALICE

A puzzle world made up of bits of Freddy's boiler room, the asylum corridors and TOWER, the Elm Street house interior, the abandoned church, etc. It's an insane, logic-defying world where water runs uphill and stairs and doors stand at impossible angles to one another. Across everything, Freddy's boiler, on a huge PENDULUM, swings back and forth, counting cadence.

Freddy at first looks suspicious, then smiles and extricates himself from Alice who is looking at Jacob in horror. Freddy gives her an obscene kiss as he separates from her. She sinks to the ground exhausted and beaten.

Freddy approaches Jacob who smiles evilly. Suddenly Freddy stops. He snarls as he sees something behind Jacob.

As he speaks, his mouth grows larger, impossibly large. A violent wind appears to be rushing from him.

Finally with a roar, the decrepit souls of DAN, GRETA and MARK rush from him and hurl themselves upon Freddy. The ectoplasmic trio strike Freddy full in the chest, ripping through him and emerging from his back. As they doe so, they pull him backwards towards Amanda.
