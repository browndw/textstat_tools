Burt gives a small head signal and two very large men stand up from a nearby table. They each grab one of Julius's arms.

Just then, so sudden and quick that it's over as soon as it begins, Julius double kicks the seated Burt and Bob in the head. They're out cold before they realize they've been attacked. Without stopping, Julius whips his arms together in front of him bringing Sam and Dave into painful contact with each others' head. They, too, are now out cold. Vince uses this opportunity to stomp, with all his might, on the toe of Morris who's busy watching Julius dismantle his relatives. Morris screams and lets go of Vince, who runs to the nearby pool table, grabs a cue and slams it over the head of the now hobbling Morris. All five Klanes are out cold.

Julius looks fondly at his brother as he sees him to the door.

sits watching the TV, nodding in amusement, laughing, slapping his knee in pleasure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He returns his attention to the book he's been reading -- something the size of a dictionary -- but can't help returning his gaze to the TV. He freezes at the sound of a KNOCK at the DOOR. Embar- rassed by what he's been watching, he quickly turns off the TV, and goes to answer the door, still holding the book.

	Hi.

</JULIUS>
<MARNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi -- Vince and Linda want to be alone, so I'm afraid I'm going to stay here. Which bed should I take?

<JULIUS>
<DIRECTION>
(stunned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Either... I always sleep on the floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Watched by Julius, Marnie pulls the curtains shut, kills the overhead lights, all the while providing him with glimpses of various parts of her anatomy. She gets into one of the beds, turns off the bedside lamp.
</DIRECTION>
<MARNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JULIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night.

Julius puts the blanket and pillow from the other bed onto the floor between the two beds, then shuts off the other lamp. Silence...
</DIRECTION>
<MARNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This mattress is awful.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Getting out of bed, she pulls the blanket and pillow with her as she steps over Julius, who tries not to look up, and gets into the other bed.

She gets out, again dragging the blanket and pillow, puts them down on the floor next to Julius. She crawls under the blanket, turns her back to him.

	It's alright.

<JULIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, please, take my shirt. I'm baking.

Julius strips it off and hands it to her. She puts it on and pulls the blanket over her shoulder. Again she shivers.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You still cold?

</MARNIE>
<MARNIE>

She spills the water all over her top and bedding.

	Oh, great!

She starts stripping off everything she's wearing. Julius averts his eyes.

	Do you mind if I share your blanket? -- Mine's all wet.

</MARNIE>
<JULIUS>

	No -- that would be okay.

They both lie down under his blanket. Silence...

	Could we switch sides? I like to sleep on the left.

<JULIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.

She starts to roll over Julius, then pauses directly above him and looks him dead in the eye.

	Do you like me? I mean, even a little bit?

	We're a good family. I'm sorry, Vince, but we have to return the money.

<VINCE>

	Return the money?!? Are you nuts?!? This is dirty money, Julius -- it doesn't belong to anybody --

Dozens of them -- everywhere -- all over her apartment -- beautifully arranged -- in gorgeous vases.

Taking it all in, her resistance melting. She turns, flings open the door, looks out -- no sign of Vince... until CAMERA TILTS DOWN to reveal Vince on his knees.

It reads: "The Benedict Corporation." CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal we are -- inside Vince's office. The offices have been redecorated -- they look serious, professional, and are filled with computer terminals and other high-tech equipment. Julius is sorting through a stack of mail while Vince talks to a prospective client on the phone. Both of them are wearing suits and ties.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCE>
<DIRECTION>

Vince hangs up the phone, loosens his tie. Julius excitedly holds up a stack of letters.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at this, Vince -- proposals from the Red Cross, UNICEF, the World Health Organization -- we should only have clients who do humanitarian work.

	Just as long as they pay -- we're not running a charity, you know.

VINCE AND JULIUS Confused, just look at her for a moment.

MARY ANNE

Clearly overwhelmed, struggles to find the appropriate words.

Staring at each other in silence, until --

<MARY_ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see, I didn't believe you, I mean who would believe a story like your story -- crazy -- They lied to me all these years... And they lied to you... But you found one another ... And you found me... Please -- God -- one of you say something.

JULIUS Watching them. Now there are tears on his face, too. He goes to them, gently puts his arms around them, lifts them both up in to the air, cradling them. They're laughing. They're crying. They're holding each other.

No words are necessary. Slowly...

The three women all turn and gaze affectionately back at --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VINCE AND JULIUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walking along the path behind them. We assume it's them the women were discussing, until we notice that each of them is pushing a double-stroller with identical twin babies inside! It's the twin children that are the source of the women's wonder, and Vince and Julius' as well. Vince and Julius both yawn simultaneously.

	Not you, too -- It's not a competition, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They both start pushing their strollers again.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just think what we'd be like if we'd been raised together.

<VINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that's a scary thought.

They both yawn simultaneously once again.
