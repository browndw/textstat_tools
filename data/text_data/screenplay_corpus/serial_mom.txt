MOM closes car door quietly, watches DOTTIE HINKLE up the street undetected and then takes the scissors from her purse and hides them up her sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As MOM sneaks up street towards DOTTIE, intercut are obsessional flashbacks of details of the traumatic parking place incident; MOM'S POV of DOTTIE pulling into space, DOTTIE'S maddening nonchalance as she snottily gets out of her car and trots right past MOM without the slightest apology, MOM'S sputtering face paralyzed with anger when she realizes there is nowhere else to park.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back in the present, MOM starts walking faster and faster as she sees DOTTIE begin to pack up her gardening tools to go back inside her house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Arriving just a second too late as DOTTIE closes the door behind her, MOM spots a can of gasoline near DOTTIE's lawnmower. Thinking fast, MOM dumps gas on DOTTIE's mail in the mailbox on porch, lights it on fire and runs from the flames, happily throwing a coin into DOTTIE's wishing well as an afterthought.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOM walks as fast as possible back to her car, gets in and pulls off. Smiling evily to herself, she drives by and sees DOTTIE HINKLE screaming in horror and trying to beat the fire out with a broom.

SCOTTY is at the edge of the stage. He sees MOM almost on top of him and leaps onto stage and runs for his life, dodging bouncers and beer bottles being thrown from audience.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOM looks furious that SCOTTY has escaped but then looks up at theatrical light rigging overhead and then back down at SCOTTY's face as "CAMEL LIPS" tries to hit him with their instruments. MOM looks over her shoulder and sees DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD advancing on her. Ducking behind a giant speaker, out of view of the crowd MOM pulls butcher knife from purse, cuts supporting rope and sends whole set of lights crashing down on SCOTTY's head.

SCOTTY runs across the stage ablaze as "CAMEL LIPS" plays the final deafening note of their song and the crowd gives a screaming ovation, all holding up lit lighters, thinking SCOTTY on fire is all part of the act.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD look to the stage in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAD gasps in fear. MISTY and CHIP stare speechless as SCOTTY falls to his knees and keels over. BIRDIE comes to and then faints again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The LEAD SINGER thinks it's a joke, pours a little Jack Daniels on the smouldering corpse and then jumps back in comic over-reaction when the flames light up again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOM, now caught in the front row of laughing slam-dancing spectators, turns to her dumb-struck family, smiles and sticks fingers in her ears, mimicking that the music is much too loud.

DET. MOORE and DET. BRADFORD slamdance MOM from both sides and knock her to the ground and handcuff her.
