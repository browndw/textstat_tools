COMPUTER SCREEN

So close it has no boundaries.

<DIRECTION>
A blinking cursor pulses in the electric darkness like a heart coursing with phosphorous light, burning beneath the derma of black-neon glass.

A PHONE begins to RING, we hear it as though we were making the call. The cursor continues to throb, relentlessly patient, until --

Suddenly, a flashlight cuts open the darkness and we find ourselves in --

<DIRECTION>
INT. CHASE HOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hotel was abandoned after a fire licked its way across the polyester carpeting, destroying several rooms as it spooled soot up the walls and ceiling leaving patterns of permanent shadow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We FOLLOW four armed POLICE officers using flashlights as they creep down the blackened hall and ready themselves on either side of room 303.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The biggest of them violently kicks in the door --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other cops pour in behind him, guns thrust before them.
</DIRECTION>
<BIG_COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Police! Freeze!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIG_COP>
<DIRECTION>
The room is almost devoid of furniture. There is a fold- up table and chair with a phone, a modern, and a powerbook computer. The only light in the room is the glow of the computer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting there, her hands still on the keyboard, is TRINITY; a woman in black leather.
</DIRECTION>
<BIG_COP>

	Get your hands behind your head!

Trinity rises.

EXT. CHASE HOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A black sedan with tinted windows glides in through the police cruisers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AGENT SMITH and AGENT BROWN get out of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They wear dark suits and sunglasses even at night. They are also always hardwired; small Secret Service earphones in one ear, its cord coiling back into their shirt collars.

INT. CHASE HOTEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Big Cop flicks out his cuffs, the other cops holding a bead. They've done this a hundred times, they know they've got her, until the Big Cop reaches with the cuff and Trinity moves --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It almost doesn't register, so smooth and fast, inhumanly fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The eye blinks and Trinity's palm. snaps up and the nose explodes, blood erupting. The cop is dead before he begins to fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Trinity is moving again --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seizing a wrist, misdirecting a gun, as a startled cop FIRES --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A head explodes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In blind panic, another airs his gun, the barrel, a fixed black hole --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And FIRES --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trinity twists out of the way, the bullet missing as she reverses into a roundhouse kick, knocking the gun away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cop begins to scream when a jump kick crushes his windpipe, killing the scream as he falls to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at the four bodies.
</DIRECTION>
<TRINITY>

	Shit.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She bursts out of the room as Agent Brown enters the hall, leading another unit of police. Trinity races to the opposite end, exiting through a broken window onto the fire escape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIRE E5CAPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the alley below, Trinity sees Agent Smith staring at her. She can only go up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the roof, Trinity is running as Agent Brown rises over the parapet, leading the cops in pursuit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trinity begins to jump from one roof to the next, her moverents so clean, gliding in and out of each jump, contrasted to the wild jumps of the cops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Agent Brown, however, has the same unnatural grace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The METAL SCREAM of an EL TRAIN is heard and Trinity turns to it, racing for the back of the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The edge falls away into a wide back alley. The next building is over 40 feet away, but Trinity's face is perfectly calm, staring at some point beyond the other roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cops slow, realizing they are about to see something ugly as Trinity drives at the edge, launching herself into the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From above, the ground seems to flow beneath her as she hangs in flight
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then hitting, somersaulting up, still running hard.
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Motherfucker -- that's impossible!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<DIRECTION>
They stare, slack-jawed, as Agent Brown duplicates the move exactly, landing, rolling over a shoulder, up onto one knee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just below the building are the runbling tracks of riveted steel. The TRAIN SCREECHES beneath her, a rattling blur of gray metal. Trinity junps, landing easily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks back just as Agent Brown hurls through the air barely reaching the last car
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Agent Brown stands, yanking out a gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trinity is running hard as BULLETS WHISTLE past her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead she sees her only chance, 50 feet beyond the point where the train has begun to turn, there is --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A window; a yellow glow in the midst of a dark brick building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trinity zeroes in on it, running as hard as she can, her speed compounded by the train. The SCREAM of the STEEL rises as she nears the edge where the train rocks into the turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trinity hurtles into the empty night space, her body leveling into a dive. She falls, arms covering her head as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The whole world seems to spin on its axis --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And she crashes with an EXPLOSION of GLASS and WOOD, then falls onto a back stairwell, tumbling, bouncing down stairs bleeding, broken --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But still alive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the smashed window, she glimpses Agent Brown, still on the train, his tie and coat whipping in the wind; stone-faced, he touches his ear piece as the train slides him past the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trinity tries to move. Everything hurts.
</DIRECTION>
<TRINITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get up, Trinity. You're fine. Get up -- just get up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINITY>
<DIRECTION>
She stands and limps down the rest of the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trinity emerges from the shadows of an alley and, at the end of the block, in a pool of white street light, she sees it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The telephone booth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Obviously hurt, she starts down the concrete walk, focusing in completely, her pace quickening, as the PHONE begins to RING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the street, a garbage truck suddenly u-turns, its TIRES SCREAMING as it accelerates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trinity sees the headlights on the truck arcing at the telephone booth as if taking aim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gritting through the pain, she races the truck --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slamming into the booth, the headlights blindingly bright, bearing down on the box of Plexiglas just as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She answers the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a frozen instant of silence before the hulking mass of dark metal lurches up onto the sidewalk --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barreling through the booth, bulldozing it into a brick wall, smashing it to Plexiglas pulp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, a black loafer steps down from the cab of the garbage truck. Agent Smith inspects the wreckage. There is no body. Trinity is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His jaw sets as he grinds his molars in frustration. AGENT JONES walks up behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you get anything from the room?

</AGENT_SMITH>

<AGENT_JONES>

<DIRECTION>
We are SUCKED TOWARDS the mouthpiece of the phone, CLOSER and CLOSER, UNTIL the smooth gray plastic spreads out like a horizon and the small HOLES WIDEN until we fall through one --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Swallowed by the darkness that becomes --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A computer screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are on-line, inside a chat room called "The Matrix." It is an exklusive web-site where hackers hang out.
</DIRECTION>

	JACKON: I heard Morpheus has been on this board. SUPERASTIC: Morpheus doesn't even exist and the Matrix is nothing but an advertising gimmick 4 a new game.

INT. NEO'S APARTMENT

It is a studio apartirent that seems overgrown with technology.
</DIRECTION>

Weed-like cables coil everywhere, duct-taped into thickets that wind up and around the legs of several desks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tabletops are filled with cannibalized equipment that lay open like an autopsied corpse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We turn towards the center of this rat-nest of technology, following the slurping and crunching of cereal. We pass an open box of Capln Crunch as we find --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEO, a younger man who knows more about living inside a computer than living outside one.

A chill runs down his spine and when someone KNOCKS on his door he almost jumps out of his chair.

He looks at the door, then back at the computer but the message is gone.

He shakes his head, not completely sure what happened. Again, someone knocks.

An older Chicago apartment; a series of halls connects a chain of small high-ceilinged rooms lined with heavy casements.

Smoke hangs like a veil, blurring the few lights there are.

Dressed predominantly in black, people are everywhere, gathered in cliques around pieces of furniture like jungle cats around a tree.

Neo stands against a wall, alone, sipping from a bottle of beer, feeling completely out of place, he is about to leave when he notices a woman staring at him.

<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Matrix. What is the Matrix?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<TRINITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twelve years ago I met a man, a great man, who said that no one could be told the answer to that question. That they had to see it, to believe it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINITY>
<DIRECTION>
Her body is against his; her lips very close to his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<TRINITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He told me that no one should look for the answer unless they have to because once you see it, everything changes. Your life and the world you live in will never be the same. It's as if you wake up one morning and the sky is falling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINITY>
<DIRECTION>
There is a hypnotic quality to her voice and Neo feels the words like a drug, seeping into him.
</DIRECTION>
<TRINITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The truth is out there, Neo. It's looking for you and it will find you, if you want it to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINITY>
<DIRECTION>
She takes hold of him with her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<TRINITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all I can tell you right now. Good-bye, Neo. And good luck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINITY>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. Who was it? Who was the man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<DIRECTION>
She leans close, her lips alrost touching his ear as she whispers.
</DIRECTION>
<TRINITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know who.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINITY>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and he watches her melt into the shifting wall of bodies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SOUND RISES steadily, growing out of the music, pressing in on Neo until it is all he can hear as we --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEO'S APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound is an ALARM CLOCK, slowly dragging Neo to consciousness. He strains to read the clock face: 9:15 A.M.

EXT. SKYSCRAPER

The downtown office of CorTechs, a software development company.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CORTECHS OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The main offices are along each wall, the windows overlooking downtown Chicago.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RHINEHEART, the ultimate company man, lectures Neo without looking at him, typing at his computer continuously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neo stares at two window cleaners on a scaffolding outside, dragging their rubber squeegees down across the surface of the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<RHINEHEART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a problem, Mr. Anderson. You think that you're special. You believe that somehow the rules do not apply to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHINEHEART>
<DIRECTION>
He stops, glancing over his glasses at Neo, who turns in time.
</DIRECTION>
<RHINEHEART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Obviously, you are mistaken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHINEHEART>
<DIRECTION>
His long, bony fingers resume clicking the keyboard.
</DIRECTION>
<RHINEHEART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This company is one of the top software companies in the world because every single employee understands that they are a part of a whole. Thus, if an employee has a problem, the company has a problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHINEHEART>
<DIRECTION>
He turns again.
</DIRECTION>
<RHINEHEART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The time has come to make a choice, Mr. Anderson. Either you choose to be at your desk on time from this day forth, or you choose to find yourself another job. Do I make myself clear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHINEHEART>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Mr. Rhineheart. Perfectly clear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEO'S CUBICLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entire floor looks like a human honeycomb, with a labyrinth of cubicles structured around a core of elevators.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neo slumps down into his chair. A TALL EMPLOYEE stands up in the adjacent cubicle, leaning over the partition.
</DIRECTION>
<TALL_EMPLOYEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did he say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALL_EMPLOYEE>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I was late again, I'm going to be fired.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<DIRECTION>
He smirks.
</DIRECTION>
<TALL_EMPLOYEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it was nice working with you.

Neo glares at him, as he sinks down.

Neo turns and finds a FEDERAL EXPRESS MAN at his cubicle door.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. That's me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<DIRECTION>
Neo signs the electronic pad and the Fedex guy hands him the softpak.
</DIRECTION>
<FEDEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have a nice day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEDEX>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the bag. Inside is a CELLULAR PHONE. It seems the instant it is in his hand, it RINGS. Unnerved, he flips it open.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>

Neo's knees give and he falls into his chair.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had hoped for this conversation to take place under less adverse conditions, but you can never count on hope, can you, Neo?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been watching you, Neo, and I want to meet you. I don't know if you're ready to see what I want to show you, but unfortunately, we have run out of time. They're coming for you, Neo. And I'm not sure what they're going to do.

<MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Now.

</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Neo starts to stand.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do it slowly. Slowly. The elevator.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
His head slowly peeks up over the partition.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the elevator, he sees Agent Brown and Agent Jones leading a group of cops. A female employee turns and points out Neo's cubicle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neo ducks.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy fuckin' shit!

</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>

One cop stays at the elevator, the others follow the agents.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck do they want with me?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure. But, if you don't want to find out, you better get out of there.

	How?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can guide you out, but you have to do exactly what I say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
The agents are moving quickly towards the cubicle.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The cubicle across from you is empty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what if...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go! Now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Neo lunges across the hall, diving into the other cubicle just as the agents turn into his row.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neo crams himself into a dark corner, clutching the phone tightly to him.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay here for a moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
The agents enter Neo's empty cubicle. A cop is sent to search the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Morpheus' voice is a whisper in Neo's ear.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A little longer...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Brown is talking to the tall employee.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I tell you, go to the end of the row to the first office on the left, stay.as low as you can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Sweat trickles down his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Neo rolls out of the cubicle, his eyes popping as he freezes right behind a cop who has just turned around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Staying crouched, he sneaks away, down the row, SHOOTING across the opening to the first office on the left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. Now there is a window. Open it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know all this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<DIRECTION>
Morpheus laughs quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The answer is coming, Neo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the window. The window howls into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Outside, there's a scaffold. You can use it to get to the roof.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Leaning out the window, he sees that the scaffold is several offices away.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! It's too far away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a small ledge. It's a short climb. You can make it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Neo looks down; the building's glass wall vertigos into a concrete chasm.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way, no way, this is crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be controlled by your fear, Neo. There are only two ways out of this building. One is that scaffold. The other is in their custody. You take a chance either way. I leave it to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK. He hangs up. Neo looks at the door, then back at the scaffold.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is insane! Why is this happening to me? What did I do? I'm nobody. I didn't do anything. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<DIRECTION>
He climbs up onto the window ledge. Hanging onto the frame, he steps onto the small ledge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scaffold seems even farther away.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<DIRECTION>
The WIND suddenly BLASTS up the face of the building, knocking Neo off balance. Recoiling, he clings harder to the frame, and the phone falls out of his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He watches as it is swallowed by the distance beneath him.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is insane. I can't do this! Forget it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<DIRECTION>
He climbs back into the office just as a cop opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't do anything!
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKYSCRAPER
</DIRECTION>

The agents lead a handcuffed Neo out of the revolving doors, forcing his head down as they push him into the dark sedan.

Trinity watches in the rear view mirror of her motorcycle.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - CLOSE ON CAMERA MONITOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wide angle view of a white roon, where Neo is sitting at a table alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We MOVE INTO the monitor, ENTERING the room as if the monitor were a window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the same moment, the door opens and the agents enter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smith sits down across from Neo. A thick manila envelope slaps down on the table between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neo glances at the name on the file: "Anderson, Thomas A."
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you can see, we've had our eye on you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGENT_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the file. Paper rattle marks the silence as he flips several pages. Neo cannot tell if he is looking at the file or at him.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It seems that you have been living two lives. In one life, you are Thomas A. Anderson, program writer for a respectable software company. You have a social security number, you pay your taxes and you help your land lady carry out her garbage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGENT_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
The pages continue to turn.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The other life is lived in computers where you go by the hacker alias Neo, and are guilty of virtually every computer crime we have a law for, including the unauthorized use of the D.M.V. system for the removal of automobile boots.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGENT_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
Neo feels himself sinking into a pit of shit.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One of these,lives has a future. One of them does not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGENT_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
He closes the file.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to be as forthcoming as I can be, Mr. Anderson. You are here because we need your help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGENT_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
He removes his sunglasses; his eyes are an unnatural ice- blue.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We know that you have been contacted by a certain individual. A man who calls himself Morpheus. Whatever you think you know about this man is irrelevant to the fact that he is wanted for acts of terrorism in more countries than any other man in the world. He is considered by many authorities to be the most dangerous man alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGENT_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
He leans closer.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My colleagues believe that I am wasting my time with you, but I believe you want to do the right thing. It is obvious that you are an intelligent man, Mr. Anderson, and that you are interested in the future. That is why I believe you are ready to put your past mistakes behind you and get on with your life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGENT_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
Neo tries to match his stare.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are willing to wipe the slate clean, to give you a fresh start and all we are asking in return is your cooperation in bringing a known terrorist to justice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGENT_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
Neo nods to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Wow. That sounds like a real good deal. But I think I have a better one. How about I give you the finger --
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<DIRECTION>
He does.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you can cram that file up your Secret Service sphincter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<DIRECTION>
Agent Smith puts his glasses back on.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You disappoint me, Mr. Anderson.

</AGENT_SMITH>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ain't seen nothing yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<AGENT_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The irony of your situation is that you have no choice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGENT_SMITH>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't scare me with this gestapo crap. I know my rights. I want my phone call.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<DIRECTION>
Agent Smith smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And tell me, Mr. Anderson, what good is a phone call iy you are unable to speak?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGENT_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
The question unnerves Neo and strangely, he begins to feel the muscles in his jaw tighten.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The standing agents snicker, watching Neo's confusion grow into panic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neo feels his lips grow soft and sticky as they slowly seal shut, melding into each other until all trace of his mouth is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wild with fear, he lunges for the door but the agents restrain him holding him in the chair.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are going to help us, Mr. Anderson, whether you want to or not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGENT_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
Smith nods and the other two rip open his shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From a case taken out of his suit coat, Smith removes a long, fiber-optic wire tap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neo struggles helplessly as Smith dangles the wire over his exposed abdomen. Horrified, he watches as the electronic device animates, become an organic creature that resembles a hybrid of an insect and a fluke worm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thin, whisker-like tendrils reach out and probe into Neo's navel. He bucks wildly as Smith drops the creature which looks for a moment like an uncut umbilical cord --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before it begins to burrow its, tail thrashing as it worms its way inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Screaming, Neo bolts upright in bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He realizes that he is home. Was it a dream? His mouth is normal. His stomach looks fine. He starts to take a deep, everything-is-okay breath, when --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PHONE RINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It almost stops his heart. It CONTINUES RINGING, building pressure in the room, forcing him up out of bed, sucking him in with an almost gravitational force.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He answers it, saying nothing.

Neo feels sick.

An EL TRAIN RAGES against its metal rails.

INT. TRAIN

It is three a.m., and the train carries the usual urban night crawlers. Neo sits alone, eyes shifting, watching everything nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a METAL BANG and TRAIN CLATTER fills the car as the door is opened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neo turns and sees a large man enter. He is wearing sunglasses and a black leather jacket. His name is APOC and he walks straight at Neo.
</DIRECTION>
<APOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APOC>
<DIRECTION>
Neo stands just as the door at the opposite end opens and two police officers rush in, drawing their guns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Apoc grabs Neo, muscling him to the nearest exit. There is no upcoming station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Apoc yanks the emergency brake and the train buckles against its own speed. The cops are thrown back. Neo slams against the metal rail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors open onto nothing and just when Neo regains his balance, Apoc shoves him backwards --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He flies out from the train, arms windrilling as he falls from, the raised tracks --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hurtling towards a busy city street when, out of nowhere, a truck races under him and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crashes into a large dumpster-bed filled with empty boxes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRUCK BED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still shaking his head, Neo realizes he is not alone. A man named Cabie is aiming a big gun at him. Trinity is next to him, talking into a cellular phone.

EXT. LOWER WACKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A featureless black van glides up to a staircase that curls down from the city's surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
trinity guides the blind Neo down the steps. The back of the van slaps open, revealing a young, skinny man who looks to be still in his teens, wearing an outfit that is a cross between a surgeon and a telephone repair man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His name is GIZMO and he smiles lewdly at Trinity, exposing his teeth that are wired with weird-looking braces.
</DIRECTION>
<GIZMO>

Hacksaw is a huge man in a leather welder's apron. He shoulders Neo and hauls him into the van.

Neo is strapped down to an ambulance cart, listening nervously as Gizmo gets to work.
</DIRECTION>
<GIZMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, first we take a little look under the hood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIZMO>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls up the goggles hanging at his neck and they blink to life with tiny halogen lights and lenses irising to varying levels of magnification.
</DIRECTION>
<GIZMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to feel a little prick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIZMO>
<DIRECTION>
He inserts acupuncture-like needles into Neo's lower abdomen. The needles are wired to video monitors. Hacksaw pilots the fiber-optic lens.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<TRINITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We think you're bugged. We can't take you to Morpheus until you're clean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINITY>
<GIZMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIZMO>
<DIRECTION>
On a monitor, we see the bug nestled in among Neols large intestines.
</DIRECTION>
<GIZMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hit him with 10 ccs of local.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIZMO>
<DIRECTION>
Hacksaw loads a hypodermic needle and pumps an anesthetic around Neols navel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Using a device that looks like a miniature speculum, Gizmo inserts a knuckled dental pick. Typing into a calculator keypad wired to the pick, he automates the tip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the monitor, we watch it telescope out and the end separate into a tiny hooked, metal claw.
</DIRECTION>
<GIZMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIZMO>
<DIRECTION>
The claw snags hold of the bug.
</DIRECTION>
<GIZMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotcha!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIZMO>
<DIRECTION>
But the bug reacts violently. Neo screams as it wraps itself around the soft tissue web of intestine.
</DIRECTION>
<GIZMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIZMO>
<TRINITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's happening?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINITY>
<GIZMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. They've never done that before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIZMO>
<DIRECTION>
Neo writhes in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<GIZMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold him down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIZMO>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus! God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<TRINITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do something!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINITY>
<GIZMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got it! Maybe we can stun it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIZMO>
<TRINITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you crazy? That will kill him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINITY>
<DIRECTION>
We watch Neo, who can't see what they are talking about.
</DIRECTION>
<GIZMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll work. Come on, do it or Hacksaw will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIZMO>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<DIRECTION>
The instant he hears the word, he knows.
</DIRECTION>
<TRINITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINITY>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, shit --
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<DIRECTION>
The cry is frozen in his mouth as the paddles hit his chest. Gizmo wrestles with the bug.
</DIRECTION>
<GIZMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hit him again!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIZMO>
<DIRECTION>
Again, the electricity convulses through him as Gizmo yanks the speculum out.
</DIRECTION>
<GIZMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIZMO>
<DIRECTION>
Trinity touches Neo, who is just beginning to breathe. She eases the tape off his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<TRINITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neo, are you okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINITY>
<DIRECTION>
He nods.
</DIRECTION>
<TRINITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's over. We got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINITY>
<DIRECTION>
Hanging from the claw pick is the inanimate metal wire- tap.
</DIRECTION>
<GIZMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nasty little bugger, ain't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIZMO>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The van stops in a deserted alley behind a forgotten hotel. The doors open and Trinity helps Neo get out.
</DIRECTION>
<TRINITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for your help, Gizmo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINITY>
<GIZMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just hope the man knows what he's doing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIZMO>
<DIRECTION>
She nods then climbs out of the van. Gizmo ogles the tight leather pants.
</DIRECTION>
<GIZMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn, what I wouldn't give for a copy of that software.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIZMO>
<DIRECTION>
Trinity turns around.
</DIRECTION>
<TRINITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gizmo, you don't have the hardware to handle this software.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINITY>
<DIRECTION>
He howls with adolescent laughter as the van pulls away. Trinity turns to Neo.
</DIRECTION>
<TRINITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go. He's waiting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINITY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL LAFAYETTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a place of putrefying elegance, a rotting host of urban maggotry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trinity leads Neo from the stairwell down the hall of the thirteenth floor. They stop outside room 1313.
</DIRECTION>
<TRINITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINITY>
<DIRECTION>
Neo can hear his own heart pounding.
</DIRECTION>
<TRINITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me give one piece of advice. Be honest. He knows more than you can possibly imagine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINITY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROOM 1313
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the room, a dark figure stares out the tall windows veiled with decaying lace. He turns and his smile lights up the room.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At last.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
He wears a long black coat and his eyes are invisible behind circular mirrored glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He strides to Neo and they shake hands.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome, Neo. As you no doubt have guessed, I am Morpheus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's an honor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. Come. Sit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
He nods to Trinity.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Trinity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
She bows her head sharply and exits through a door to an adjacent room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They sit across from one another in cracked, burgundy- leather chairs.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I imagine, right now, you must be feeling a bit like Alice, tumbling down the rabbit hole?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could say that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can see it in your eyes. You have the look of a man who accepts what he sees because he is expecting to wake up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
A smile, razor-thin, curls the corner of his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ironically, this is not far from the truth. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Can you tell me, Neo, why are you here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're Morpheus, you're a legend. Most hackers would die to meet you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Thank you. But I think we both know there's more to it than that. Do you believe in fate, Neo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I don't like the idea that I'm not in control of my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know exactly what you mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Again, that smile that could cut glass.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me tell you why you are here. You are here because you have the gift.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What gift?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've watched you, Neo. You do not use a computer like a tool. You use it like it was part of yourself. What you can do inside a computer is not normal. I know. I've seen it. What you do is magic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Neo shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not magic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it is, Neo. It is. How else would you describe what has been happening to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
He leans forward.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are trained in this world to accept only what is rational and logical. Have you ever wondered why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Neo shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As children, we do not separate the possible from the impossible which is why the younger a mind is the easier it is to free while a mind like yours can be very difficult.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Free from what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From the Matrix.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Neo locks at his eyes but only sees a reflection of himself.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want to know what it is, Neo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Neo swallows and nods his head.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's that feeling you have had all your life. That feeling that something was wrong with the world. You don't know what it is but it's there, like a splinter in your mind, driving you mad, driving you to me. But what is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
The LEATHER CREAKS as he leans back.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Matrix is everywhere, it's all around us, here even in this room. You can see it out your window, or on your television. You feel it when you go to work, or go to church or pay your taxes. It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What truth?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That you are a slave, Neo. That you, like everyone else, was born into bondage... ... kept inside a prison that you cannot smell, taste, or touch. A prison for your mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Outside, the WIND BATTERS a loose PANE of glass.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold out your hands.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
In Neo's right hand, Morpheus drops a red pill.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is your last chance. After this, there is no going back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
In his left, a blue pill.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You take the blue pill and the story ends. You wake in your bed and you believe whatever you want to believe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
The pills in his open hands are reflected in the glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You take the red pill and you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Neo feels the smooth skin of the capsules, with the moisture growing in his palms.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember that all I am offering is the truth. Nothing more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Neo opens his mouth and swallows the red pill. The Cheshire smile returns.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Follow me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
He leads Neo into the other room, which is cramped with high-tech equipment, glowing ash-bliie and electric green from the racks of monitors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trinity, Apoc and Cypher look up as they enter.
</DIRECTION>
<CYPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYPHER>
<TRINITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew he would.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINITY>
<DIRECTION>
Cypher saddles up to Morpheus, talking in a hushed tone away from, Neo.
</DIRECTION>
<CYPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morpheus, I know what you believe but I think this is a mistake. We're rushing him. He's old. I'm afraid he might pop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYPHER>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Haven't I always told you, Cypher, not to let fear control your life. Apoc, are we on-line?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Neo recognizes the large man from the El train.
</DIRECTION>
<APOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Almost.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APOC>
<DIRECTION>
He and Trinity are working quickly, hardwiring a complex system of monitors, modules and drives.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apoc? You wrote the Four Horsemen Virus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<APOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APOC>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neo, time is always against us. Will you take a seat there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
In the center of the room sits a chair. Near the chair is an old oval dressing mirror that is cracked.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I imagine you know sonething about virtual reality.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Neo sits and Trinity begins gently fixing white electrode disks to his head, arns, and the back of his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A little.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Essentially, it's a hardware system that uses an apparatus; headgear, gloves and whatever to make you feel that you are in a computer program.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If the virtual reality apparatus, as you called it, was wired to all of your senses and controlled them completely, would you be able to tell the difference between the virtual world and the real world?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You might not, no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you wouldn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Neo whispers to Trinity.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did all this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<DIRECTION>
She nods, placing a set of headphones over his ears. They are wired to an old hotel phone.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The pill you took is part of a trace program. It's going to make things feel a bit strange.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Distantly, through the ear phones, he hears Apoc POUNDING on a KEYBOARD. Sweat beads his face. His eyes blink and twitch when he notices the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wide-eyed he stares as it begins to heal itself, a webwork of cracks that slowly run together as though the mirror were becoming liquid.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<DIRECTION>
Cypher works with Apoc checking reams of phosphorescent data. Trinity monitors Neo's electric vital signs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neo reaches out to touch the mirror and his fingers disappear beneath the rippling surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quickly, he tries to pull his fingers out but the mirror stretches in long rubbery strands like mirrored-taffy stuck to his fingertips.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this? Mescaline?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just relax, Neo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
The strands thin like rubber cement as he pulls away, until the fragile wisps of mirror thread break.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the TINKLING of GLASS, shimmering snowflakes of electric-blinking mercury fall, hit the ground, and fade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at his hand; fingers distended into mirrored icicles that begin to melt rapidly, dripping, running like wax down his fingers, spreading across his palms where he sees his face reflected.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-oh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<TRINITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's going into replication.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINITY>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apoc?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<APOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APOC>
<DIRECTION>
Morpheus takes out a cellular phone and dials a number.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tank, we're going to need the signal soon. Stay calm, Neo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
The mirror gel seems to come to life, racing, crawling up his arns like hundreds of insects.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<DIRECTION>
The mirror creeps up his neck as Neo begins to panic, tipping his head as though he were sinking into the mirror, trying to keep his mouth up.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all over me --
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<DIRECTION>
Morpheus is right next to him, with the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<TRINITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got a fibrillation!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINITY>
<CYPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew it, I knew it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYPHER>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit! Apoc?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Streams of mercury run from Neo's nose.
</DIRECTION>
<APOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Targeting... almost there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</APOC>
<DIRECTION>
An ALARM, on Trinity's monitor ERUPTS.
</DIRECTION>
<TRINITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's going into arrest!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINITY>
<CYPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's gonna pop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYPHER>
<APOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lock! I got him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</APOC>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, Tank now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes tear with mirror, rolling up and closing as a high-pitched ELECTRIC SCREAM ERUPTS in the headphones --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a piercing SHRIEK like a computer calling to another computer --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neo's body arches in agony and we are pulled like we were pulled into the holes of the phone
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sucked into his SCREAM and swallowed by darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POWER PLANT - CLOSE ON MAN'S BODY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Floating in a womb-red amnion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His body spasms, fighting against the thick gelatin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Metal tubes, surreal versions of hospital tubes, obscure his face. Other lines like IVs are connected to limbs and cover his genitals.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is struggling desperately now. Air bubbles into the Jell-O but does not break the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pressing up, the surface distends, stretching like a red rubber coccon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unable to breathe, he fights wildly to stand, clawing at the thinning elastic shroud --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Until it ruptures, a hole widening around his mouth as he sucks for air. Tearing himself free, he emerges from the cell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is Neo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is bald and naked, his body slick with gelatin. Dizzy, nauseous, he waits for his vision to focus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is standing in an oval capsule of clear alloy filled with red gelatin, the surface of which has solidified like curdled milk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The IVs in his arms are plugged into outlets that appear to be grafted to his flesh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He feels the weight of another cable and reaches to the back of his head where he finds an enormous coaxial plugged and locked into the base of his skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to pull it out but it would be easier to pull off a finger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To either side he sees other tube-shaped pods filled with red gelatin; beneath the wax-like surface, pale and motionless, he sees other human beings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fanning out in a circle, there are more. All connected to a center core, each capsule like a red, dimly glowing petal attached to a black metal stem.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above him, level after, level, the stem rises seemingly forever. He moves to the foot of the capsule and looks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The image assaults his mind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Towers of glowing petals spiral up to incomprehensible heights, disappearing down into a dim murk like an underwater abyss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His sight is blurred and warped, exaggerating the intensity of the vision. The sound of the PLANT is like the sound of the ocean heard from inside the belly of Leviathan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below Neo, a petal detaches from the stem, bearing away the body of an old man like an automated barge even as a new pod rises up and plugs itself into the empty space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the new capsule, its surface more translucent and pinkish in color, Neo sees a small baby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From above, a machine drops directly in front of Neo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He swallows his scream as it seems to stare at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is almost insect-like in its design; beautiful housings of alloyed metal covering organic-like systems of hard and soft polymers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A black particle beam washes over Neo, he reacts in pain as the scanner seems to expose the nervous system wired to the coaxial cable at his cerebral cortex.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the back of the neck, the cable lock spins and opens, disengaging.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cable pulls itself free, a long clear plastic needle and cerebrum-chip slides from the anterior of Neols skull with an ooze of blood and spinal fluid. The other connective hoses snap free and snake away as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The back of the unit opens and a tremendous vacuum, like an airplane door opening, sucks the gelatin and then Neo into a black hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WASTE LINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pipe is a waste disposal system and Neo falls, sliding with the clot of gelatin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Banking through pipe spirals and elbows, flushing up through grease traps clogged with cily clunps of cellulite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neo begins to drown when he is suddenly snatched from the flow of waste.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The metallic cable then lifts, pulling him up into the belly of the futuristic flying nachine, hovering inside the sewer main line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOVERCRAFT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The metal harness opens and drops the half-conscious Neo onto the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Human hands and arms help him up as he finds himself looking straight at Morpheus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trinity and Apoc. And others, dressed in bizarre, high- tech combat gear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Morpheus smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome to the real world, Neo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Neo passes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We have no sense of time. We hear VOICES whispering.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>

Neo's eyes flutter open. We see Trinity's face above us, angelic in the fluorescent glow of a light stick.

FADE IN:

ANGLE ON NEO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens his eyes again, something tingling through him. He focuses and sees his body pierced with dozens of acupuncture-like needles wired to a strange device.
</DIRECTION>
<DOZER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He needs a lot of work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOZER>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.

Dozer and Morpheus are operating on Neo.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your muscles have atrophied. We're rebuilding them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Fluorescent light sticks burn unnaturally bright.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do my eyes hurt?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've never used them before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Morpheus takes his sunglasses off and puts them on Neo. Neo lays back.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rest, Neo. The answers are coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEO'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neo wakes up from a deep sleep, feeling better. He is wearing a black tank top and shorts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He begins to examine himself. There is a futuristic IV plugged into the jack in his forearm. He pulls it out, staring at the grafted outlet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He feels his bald head. His fingers find and explore the large outlet in the base of his skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as he starts to come unglued, Morpheus opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morpheus, what's happened to me? What is this place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More important than what is when?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You believe the year is 1997 when in fact it is much closer to 2197. I can't say for certain what year it is because we honestly do not know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
The wind is knocked from Neo's chest.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not possible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I promised you the truth, Neo, and the truth is that the world you were living in was a lie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll show you.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HOVERCRAFT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like a sleepwalker, Neo follows Morpheus through the ship.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is my ship, the Nebuchadnezzar. It's a hovercraft. Small like a submarine. It's dark. It's cramped and cold. But it's home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
They climb a ladder up to the main deck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIN DECK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone is there.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the main deck. You know most of my crew.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Trinity smiles and nods.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The ones you don't know. That's Mouse and Switch. The two big guys are Tank and Dozer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
The names and faces wash meaninglessly over Neo.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this, this is the Core. This is where we broadcast our pirate signal and hack into the Matrix.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
It is a swamp of bizarre electronic equipment. Vines of coaxial hang and snake to and from huge monolithic battery slabs, a black portable satellite dish and banks of little systems and computer monitors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the center of the web, there are six ectoskeleton chairs made of a poly-alloy frame and suspension harness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Near the circle of chairs is the control console and operator's station where the network is monitored.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help him, Trinity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Neo allows himself to be helped into one of the chairs.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you remember when I asked you about an apparatus that could turn a virtual reality into reality?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Neo nods.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's right here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
He touches Neo's head.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it's accessed here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Neo feels Morpheus guiding a coaxial line into the jack at the back of his neck. The cable has the same kind of cerebellum chip we saw inside the plant.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This will feel a little weird.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
There are several disturbing NOISES as he works the needle in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We MOVE IN as Neo's shoulders bunch and his face tightens into a grimace until a loud CLICK fires and his ears pop like when you equalize them underwater.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He relaxes, opening his eyes as we pull back to a feeling of weightlessness inside another place --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONSTRUCT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neo is standing in an empty, blank-white space.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the Construct.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Startled, Neo whips around and finds Morpheus now in the room with him.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is our loading program. We can load anything from clothes, to weapons, to training simulations. Anything we need.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Morpheus walks past Neo and when Neo turns he sees the two leather chairs from the hotel set up in front of a large-screen television.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Neo stands at the back of the chair as Morpheus sits.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right now, we're inside a computer program?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wild, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Neo's hands run over the cracked leather.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't real?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is real? How do you define real? If you're talking about your senses, what you feel, taste, smell, or see, then all you're talking about are electrical signals interpreted by your brain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up a remote control and clicks ON the TELEVISION. We drift through the Windy City circa 1996.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the Chicago you know. Chicago as it was at the end of the twentieth century. This Chicago exists only as part of a neural-interactive simulation that we call the Matrix.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
We GLIDE AT the television as he changes the channel.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have been living inside Baulliaurd's vision, inside the map, not the territory. This is Chicago as it exists today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
The sky is an endless sea of black and green bile. The earth, scorched and split like burnt flesh, spreads out beneath us as we ENTER the television.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'The desert of the real.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, we see the ruins of a future Chicago protruding from the wasteland like the blackened ribs of a long-dead corpse.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are, right now, miles below the earth's surface. The only place humans can survive outside the Matrix is underground.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Still MOVING, we TURN and find Neo and Morpheus; the chairs now sitting in the middle of the black desert. Dizzy, Neo holds onto the chair.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It started early in the twenty- first century, with the birth of artificial intelligence, a singular consciousness that spawned an entire race of machines.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
In his sunglasses, we see storm clouds gather.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At first all they wanted was to be treated as equals, entitled to the same human inalienable rights. Whatever they were given, it was not enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
In the circular window of the glasses, EXPLOSIONS light up a bloody battle field.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't know who struck first. Us or them. But sometime at the end of the twenty-first century the battle was joined.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
We MOVE INTO his glasses and the war surrounds us.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The war raged for generations and turned the face of our planet from green and blue to black and red.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
At last we see the Sentinels; killing machines that are at once terrifying and beautiful. They have an organic architecture like a microbiotic organism, that is perpetually in motion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sentinel cracks the body armor of a soldier, splitting open the soft, stearing meat inside.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It scorched and burned the sky. Without the sun, the machines sought out a new energy source to survive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
The Sentinel locks up, as heat lightning of black ink bursts against the sky, spreading into a permanent cloud of stain.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They discovered a new form of fusion. All that was required to initiate the reaction was a small electric charge. Throughout human history we have been dependent on machines to survive. Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
We return to the power plant that Neo escaped from where we see human beings looking almost blissful in their gelatin cocoons.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The human body generates more bio- electricity than a 120-volt battery and over 25,000 B.T.U.'s of body heat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Outside, spreading all around the power plant, beneath a breathing greenhouse, are the growing fields.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are, as an energy source, easily renewable and completely recyclable, the dead liquified and fed intravenously to the living.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Huge farm-like reapers are harvesting the crop.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All they needed to control this new battery was something to occupy our mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
We see inside a clear tubular husk. Floating in viscous fluid, there is a human fetus; its soft skull already growing around the brain-jack.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so they built a prison out of our past, wired it to our brains and turned us into slaves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
We PULL BACK to find the image is now on the television and we are again inside the white space of the Construct.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! I don't believe it! It's not possible!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't say that it would be easy, Neo. I just said that it would be the truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
The room without walls begins to spin.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop! Let me out! I want out!

INT. MAIN DECK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes snap open and he thrashes against the chair, trying to rip the cable from the back of his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get this thing out of me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<TRINITY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy, Neo. Easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRINITY>
<DIRECTION>
Dozer holds him while Trinity unlocks it. Once it's out, he tears away from them, falling as he trips free of the harness.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't touch me! Get away from me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<DIRECTION>
On his hands and knees, he reels as the world spins. Sweat pours off him as a pressure builds inside his skull as if his brian had been put into a centrifuge.
</DIRECTION>
<CYPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's going to pop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYPHER>
<DIRECTION>
Vomiting violently, Neo pitches forward and blacks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEO'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He blinks, regaining consciousness. The room is dark. Neo is stretched out on his bed.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't go back, can I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<DIRECTION>
Morpheus sitting like a shadow on a chair in the far corner.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. But if you could, would you really want to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Neo isn't sure of that answer.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel that I owe you an apology. There is a rule that we do not free a mind once it reaches a certain age. It is dangerous. They have trouble letting go.. Their mind turns against them. I've seen it happen. I broke the rule because I had to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
He stares into the darkness, confessing as much to himself as Neo.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When the Matrix was first built there was a man born inside that had the ability to change what he wanted, to remake the Matrix as he saw fit. It was this man that freed the first of us and taught us the secret of the war; control the Matrix and you control the future.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
He pauses.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When he died, the Oracle at the temple of Zion prophesied his return and envisioned an end to the war and freedom for our people. That is why there are those of us that have spent our entire lives searching the Matrix, looking for him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Neo can feel his eyes on him.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did what I did, because I believe we have been brought here for a reason, Neo. You are here to serve a purpose, just as I am here to serve mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you I don't believe in fate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<DIRECTION>
Morpheus smiles, leaning towards hin.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I do, Neo. I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
He stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get some rest. You're going to need it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>

	You will tonight. I guarantee it. I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.

He offers his hand and Neo shakes it. He notices that Tank doesn't have any jacks.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<TANK>
	<DIALOGUE>

<TANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn, I got to tell you I'm fairly excited to see what you are capable of. I mean if Morpheus is right and all. We're not supposed to talk.about any of that, but if you are, well then this is an exciting time. We got a lot to do so let's get to it.

Neo is plugged in, hanging in one of the suspension chairs.

	We're supposed to load all these operations programs first, but this is some major boring shit. Why don't we start something a little fun?

Tank smiles as he plops into his operator's chair. He begins flipping through a tall carousel loaded with micro discs.
</DIRECTION>
<TANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about sore combat training?

Neo reads the label on the disk.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>

	Jiujitsu? I'm going to learn jujitsu?

<DIRECTION>
Tank slides the disk into Neo's supplement drive.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<DIRECTION>
Smiling, Tank punches the "load" code.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His body jumps against the harness as his eyes clamp shut. The monitors kick wildly as his heart pounds, adrenaline surges, and his brain sizzles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An instant later his eyes snap open.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit!

The title bar reads: "Combat Series 10 of 12," file categories flashing beneath it: Savate, Jujitsu, Ken Po, Drunken Boxing...

Morpheus walks in.

Tank looks at his watch, rubs his eyes.

	Ten hours straight. He's a machine.

Neo's body spasms and relaxes as his eyes open, breath hissing from his lips. He looks like he just orgasmed.

He locks at Morpheus.

	This is incredible. I know Kung Fu.

	This is a sparring program, similar to the programmed reality of the Matrix. Consider this your first lesson.

</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
He assumes a fighting stance.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Attack me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Neo assumes a similar stance, cautiously circling until he gives a short cry and launches a furious attack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is like a Jackie Chan movie at high speed, fists and feet striking from every angle as Neo presses his attack --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But each and every blow is blocked by effortless speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIN DECK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While their minds battle in the programmed reality, the two bodies appear quite serene, suspended in the drive chairs.

Tank monitors their life systems noticing that Neo is wildly and chaotically lit up as opposed to the slow and steady rhythm of Morpheus.

	Good. Adaption. Improvisation. But your weakness isn't your technique.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Morpheus attacks him and it is like nothing we have seen. His feet and fists are everywhere taking Neo apart. For every blow Neo blocks, five more hit their marks until --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neo falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Panting, on his hands and knees, blood spits fror, his mouth speckling the white floor of the Dojo.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did I beat you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You -- You're too fast.

</NEO>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think my being faster, stronger has anything to do with my muscles in this place?
	</DIALOGUE>

Neo is frustrated, still unable to catch his breath.

The speed of the blows rises like a drum solo that seems impossible to sustain. Neo's face sheds its mask of calm with a scream.

<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel better.

<MORPHEUS>

	Good, good. Anger is a gift, Neo, but it's a heavy one.

Morpheus smiles.

<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tank, load the jump program.

<DIRECTION>
Neo straightens as the dojo DISSOLVES away like a curtain lifting, leaving the two men now standing on a building rooftop in a city skyline.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to learn to let go of that anger. You must let go of everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
A WIND HOWLS, whipping Morpheus' long coat to the side.
</DIRECTION>
<MORPHEUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must empty yourself to free your mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MORPHEUS>
<DIRECTION>
Morpheus spins, running hard at the edge of the rooftop. And jumps. He sails through the air, his coat billowing out behind him like a cape --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somersaults once and lands on the rooftop across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<DIRECTION>
Neo looks down at the street twenty floors below, then at Morpheus an impossible fifty feet away.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okie dokie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a deep breath.

<DIRECTION>
Summoning every ounce of strength in his legs, Neo launches himself into the air in a single maniacal shriek --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But comes up drastically short.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes widen as he plummets. Stories fly by, the ground rushing up at him, but as he hits --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ground gives way, stretchinp like a trapeze net.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He bounces and flips, slowly coming to a rest, flat on his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs, a bit unsure, wiping the wind-blown tears from his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Morpheus exits the building and helps him to his feet.

Neo's eyes open as Tank eases the plug out. He tries to move and groans, cradling his ribs.

While Tank helps Morpheus, Neo spits blood into his hand.

	Neo, I saved you some dinner --

</TRINITY>
<DIRECTION>
She sees him passed out on the bed. She sets the tray down and pulls the blanket over him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pauses, her face close to his, then inhales lightly, breathing in the scent of him, before slowly pulling away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It seems the moment she closes the door, he wakes with a start, unsure of where he is. After a moment, he gets out of bed.

The monitors are packed with bizarre codes and equations.

	You want a drink?

</CYPHER>
<DIRECTION>
He pours Neo a drink from a large plastic jug.
</DIRECTION>
<CYPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you, I feel for you, man. I really do. Most of us were still young, just punks, when Morpheus jacked us. But you, you had a real life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYPHER>
<DIRECTION>
Neo takes a sip and it almost kills him. Cypher pounds on his back.
</DIRECTION>
<CYPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good shit, huh? Dozer makes it. It's good for two things: degreasing engines and killing brain cells.
	</DIALOGUE>

Red-faced, Neo finally stops coughing.

Neo nods.

Neo shakes his head as Cypher fills his cup and laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<CYPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me give you a piece of advice. Between you and me, if Morpheus says you can fly, I wouldn't go jumping out any windows to find out if he's right. Understand?

Cypher raises his drink. Neo swallows another throat- scorching mouthful.

CHAMBER MUSIC and the ambiance of wealth soak the room as we watch a serrated knife saw through a thick, gorgeous steak.
</DIRECTION>
<CYPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what he said to me nine years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYPHER>
<DIRECTION>
The meat is so perfect, charred on the outside, oozing red juice from the inside, that it could be a dream.
</DIRECTION>
<CYPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The real world. Ha, what a joke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYPHER>
<DIRECTION>
We recognize the grating voice, the insidious laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<CYPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what real is? I'll tell you what real is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYPHER>
<DIRECTION>
A fork stabs the cube of meat and we FOLLOW it UP TO the face of Cypher.
</DIRECTION>
<CYPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Real is just another four-letter word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYPHER>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs, shoving the steak into his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The restaurant is located on the top floor of a Chicago skyscraper where the view is breathtaking and the menu has no prices.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting across from Cypher is Agent Smith.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGENT_SMITH>

Cypher chews the steak loudly, smacking it between his teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<CYPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmm, so, so fucking good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYPHER>
<DIRECTION>
Smith watches him shovel another hunk of meat into his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<CYPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I know that this steak doesn't exist. I know when I put it in my mouth, the Matrix is telling my brain that it is juicy and delicious. After nine years, do you know what I've realized?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYPHER>
<DIRECTION>
Pausing, he examines the meat skewered on his fork. He pops it in, eyes rolling up, savoring the tender beef melting in his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<CYPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ignorance is bliss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYPHER>
<AGENT_SMITH>

Morpheus walks back to the same door they entered, but it now leads into --

<DIRECTION>
INT. ROOM OF POTENTIALS (MATRIX) - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Neo enters and finally understands the attention given to his age. The Potentials are all little children.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room feels at once like a Buddhist temple and a kindergarten class. The children's heads are either shaved or thick with dreadlocks. Some are playing, others meditating or practicing their gift.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neo watches a little girl levitate wooden alphabet blocks. A skinny BOY holds a SPOON which sways like a blade of grass as he bends it with his rnind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neo crosses to him, sits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Boy smiles as Neo picks up a spoon and tries to imitate him. Despite his best efforts, Neo cannot make it bend.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOON_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your spoon does not bend because it is just that, a spoon. Mine bends because there is no spoon, just my mind.

Neo watches as it curls into a knot.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOON_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Link yourself to the spoon. Become the spoon and bend yourself.

Neo nods, again holding up his spoon.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no spoon. Right.

He concentrates. The spoon begins to bend just as the Priestess touches his shoulder.

INT. SHRINE (MATRIX) - DAY

Neo enters nervously. Beneath his feet is a path of the zodiac leading to marbled stairs that rise to a dais and a three-legged throne.

The throne is empty.

<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?

A DISTANT FEMALE VOICE calls to him and he follows it up the stairs. At the top of the dais, he smells something cooking.

Following the scent, he moves behind the pillars where he finds an open door.

It looks like a suburban tract house.

There is a lot of cozy furniture, a dining roon hutch filled with china, shelves and tables crowded with doilies, knick-knacks and ceramic brick-a-brack.

Guns and knives, like extensions of their bodies used with the same deadly precision as their feet and their fists.

Across the roof, the pilot inside the army helicopter watches the ferocious onslaught.

Agent Jones emerges.

Just as she drops the last Marine, Trinity sees what's coming.

Neo sees her, the fear in her face, and he knows what is behind him.

Screaming, he whirls, GUNS filling his hands with thought-speed.

Agent Jones still running, narrows the gap, the BULLETS coming faster until --

<DIRECTION>
Neo bent impossibly back, one hand on the ground as a spiraling gray ball shears open his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to scream as another digs a red groove across his thigh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has only time to look up, to see the barrel when Agent Jones, standing over him, pulls the TRIGGER the final time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK. Empty.

Neo rolls, reaching for another gun when around-house kick snaps his jaw. Agent Jones grabs the gun and levels it at Neo.

Over the RUSHING WATER and the ALARMS, Agent Smith hears a SOUND and understands the seriousness of the attack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to the wall of windows as the helicopter drops INTO VIEW --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neo is in the back bay, aiming the mounted .50 machine gun.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
The GUN jumps and BULLETS EXPLODE through the WINDOW in a cacophony of CRASHING GLASS --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the Agents go for their weapons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Neo is too close, the .50 CALIBER too fast and BULLETS are everywhere, perforating the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Agent Smith is hit first, his body jack-knifing back, blood arcing out with a sudden flash of light --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Agent Brown, his GUN still FIRING as his body falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And finally Agent Jones.

Neo stares at Morpheus, trying to will him into action.

Morpheus sits unmoving, his head still down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neo grabs the climbing rope just as marines burst into the adjoining room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He attaches only one end to his harness when they OPEN FIRE.

Quickly he swings the GUN, SPRAYING the other room, WINDOWS SHATTERING, FURNITURE EXPLODING, marines diving for cover.

Morpheus lifts his face into the room's rain. His eyes, still white, begin to blink, twitch, then close.
</DIRECTION>

And when he opens them, they are again dark and flashing with fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Agents knife into the room, FIRING even as Neo's BULLET TRAILS chase them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Morpheus strains at his handcuffs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Agents and the marines turn the tide, BLASTING LEAD, RICOCHETING, POCK-MARKING the COPTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIRING wildly, Neo turns to see Morpheus rising, snapping the handcuffs, starting for the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Agent Smith stops and sees Morpheus run past the open bedroom door.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT_SMITH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nooo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGENT_SMITH>
<DIRECTION>
He FIRES, sweeping across the sheetrocked wall in a perfect line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For an instant, we see the BULLETS SHRED, PUNCTURING the WALL, searing through the wet air with jet trails of chalk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And as Morpheus starts to dive for the window, a bullet buries itself in his leg --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Knocking him off balance.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He won't make it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEO>
<DIRECTION>
Morpheus lunges, out of control --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Neo spins, every move a whip crack --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Snapping the other rope-end onto a bolted bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Morpheus begins to fall when Neo hurls himself into the wide blue empty space --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flying for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rope snaking out behind him; an umbilical cord attached to a machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As their two bodies, set in motion, rushing at each other on a seemingly magnetic course until --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They collide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almost bouncing free of each other, arms, legs, scrambling, hands searching in furious desperation, finding hold and clinging.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Until the line ends, snapping taut, cracking their fragile embrace. Morpheus tumbles, legs flipping over, falling down --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ground deliriously distant --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Neo snatches hold of his mentor's still handcuffed wrist.

Trinity is already pulling the copter up and away.

Trinity throws the helicopter towards the roof of the nearest building.

Morpheus and Neo cling to one another as they and the machine above them begin to fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ENGINE GRINDS, the CHOPPING BLADES start to slow while --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Agents stand in the open shattered window, watching the helicopter disappear behind taller buildings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carried by its nomentum, Trinity guides the parabolic fall over the nearest roof where --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neo and Morpheus drop safely, rolling free as the rope goes slack. Neo gets to his feet, trying to detach himself but --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The helicopter is falling too fast, arcing over the roof like a setting sun --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The coils of slack snap taught --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yanking Neo off his feet, dragging him with ferocious speed towards the edge even as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trinity lunges for the back door, her gun in one hand, grabbing for the rope with the other --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neo flies like a skipping stone, hurtling straight AT us, when his feet hit the rain gutter --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fulcrum that levers him up just as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trinity FIRES, severing the cord from the HELICOPTER, falling free of it as it SMASHES, blades first into a glass skyscraper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holding onto the rope she swings, connected to Neo, who stands on the building's edge watching her arc beneath him as the HELICOPTER EXPLODES --

She bounces against a shatterproof window that spider- cracks out while FLAMES ERUPT behind her.

A metal gate is locked, the sign reading, "Station Closed." Neo looks around, takes out a GUN and BLOWS OFF the LOCK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the moist underground distance they hear the MUTED RING of a TELEPHONE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PHONE is RINGING inside a graffiti-covered booth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across from it, sitting hunched against the red concrete wall, is an OLD MAN. He stares at the RINGING PHONE, taking a final pull off his T-bird. No one is around. It continues to RING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Determined, he stands and walks to the booth. He is about to answer the phone, when Neo sees him.
</DIRECTION>
<NEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't!

The Old Man stops, Neo rushes at hin, gliding smoothly over the turnstiles.

<NEO>

The Old Man nods, turns and hurries deeper into the urban cave, disappearing into the shadows as Trinity and Morpheus arrive.

Morpheus gets in and answers the phone.

Lost in the shadow, the Old Man turns back and watches as Morpheus disappears, the phone dropping, dangling by its cord.

His eyes grow wide, glowing white in the dark.

Agent Smith stares, his face twisted with hate. He will never be free of the Matrix.

He starts to turn from the edge of the building when he suddenly hears it, his head whipping back around, staring --

Trinity hangs up the phone. She turns to Neo, standing close enough to kiss him.

</TRINITY>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls herself away and gets into the booth when something catches Neo's eye and he looks to where the Old Man had been.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hears him SCREAM and sees Agent Smith emerge as if formed by congealing darkness, charging with a fistful of metal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GUN FIRES, the BULLET flying at her, BURSTING through the plastic WINDOW just as --
</DIRECTION>

Trinity disappears.

The handset hanging in the air as the BULLET HITS, SHATTERING the EAR-PIECE.

GUN REPORT THUNDERS through the underground, both men BLASTING, moving at impossible speed.

For a blinking noment we enter BULLET-TIME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gun flash tongues curl from Neols gun, bullets float forward like a plane noving across the sky, cartridges cartwheel into space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An instant later they are nearly on top of each other, rolling up out of a move that is almost a mirrored reflection of the other --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Each jamming their gun tight to the other's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They freeze in a kind of embrace; Neo sweating, panting, Agent Smith machine-calm.

The smile falls. Agent Smith yanks his TRIGGER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Agent Smith's face warps with rage and he attacks, fist flying at furious speed, blows and counters, Neo retreating as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A knife-hand opens his forearm, and a kick sends him slamming back against a steel column.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stunned, he ducks just under a punch that crunches into the beam, STEEL CHUNKS EXPLODING like shrapnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him, Neo leaps into the air, delivering a neck- snapping reverse round-house. Agent Smith's glasses fly off and he glares at Neo; his eyes, ice blue.

He attacks with a vicious series of blows but the Agent seems to absorb them, waiting for his opening.

And this time Agent Smith's attack is too much, an unrelenting fury, fists pounding like jackhammers.

Agent Smith grabs hold of him, lifting him into the air, hurling him against the curved wall of the train tunnel, where he falls inches from the electrified third-rail.

<DIRECTION>
The Agent is about to jump down, and press his attack when he hears sonething. From deep in the tunnel, like an animal cry; a burst of high-speed METAL GRINDING against METAL.

Agent Smith grabs Neo in a choke-hold, forcing him to look down the tracks, the train's headlight burning a hole in the darkness.

There is another METAL SCREECH, MUCH LOUDER, closer, as Agent Smith tightens his hold. Neo is unable to breathe.

<AGENT_SMITH>

	Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.

The TRAIN ROARS at them, swallowing Agent Smith's words.

He is not ready to die.

Impossibly, he hurls himself straight up, smashing Smith against the concrete ceiling of the tunnel.

They fall as the sound and fury of the TRAIN EXPLODES INTO the station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neo back-flips up off the tracks just as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train barrels over Agent Smith.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neo stands, knees shaking, when the train slams on its emergency brake. With an ear-splitting SHRIEK of TORTURED RAILS, the train slows, part of it still in the station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neo turns, limping, starting to run, racing for the escalator --

As the train comes to a stop and the doors of the last car open; Agent Smith bursts out in furious pursuit, his glasses again intact.
