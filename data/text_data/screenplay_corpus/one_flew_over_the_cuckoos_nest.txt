:SC: EXT. WORK FARM - NIGHTFALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All we SEE is an ELEVATED SHOT of the distant mountains, rolling landscape and McMURPHY -- one cheek laid-open and crusted over with dried blood, his face and prison work clothes caked with dried sweat and dust -- as he sits on the very top of a water tower watching the last rays of sunlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long moment passes before McMurphy's attention is drawn elsewhere and he looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE SHOT - McMURPHY'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Far below, in the prison yard a MAN is SEEN hurrying acrcss the yard where he joins a group of men composed of armed prison guards, officials, and medics -- a stretcher, an ambulance, a fire truck and safety nets spread out at the base of the water tower. The man is seen talking to the officials, then a bullhorn is handed to him and they all look up at McMurphy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McMURPHY

<DIRECTION>
As he looks down at them, a searchlight is turned on him.

:SC: INT. MEN'S DORM - OREGON STATE HOSPITAL - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Strange HUMMING SOUNDS, CLANKING PIPES and HISSING RADIATORS as we see beds, with patients lying asleep, line two walls. The third wall is a heavy gauge steel grill, with a door that opens on to the day room. The door is open. On the far side of the day room, a long hallway with other doors opening into rooms: the latrine, washroom, tub room, mess hall, seclusion room, psychiatrist's office, visitors' room, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the day room, a glass enclosed nurses' station where TURKLE, a Negro night attendant, is seen preparing to go off duty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PANS the beds in the men's dorm. One man turns, another twists, a third lies as if dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PAN ENDS on BROMDEN, who lies still, eyes wide open, very alert. He reaches down, plucks a stale piece of gum from under the bed frame, puts it in his mouth and starts chewing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat, then Bromden carefully undoes the leather strap which binds him to the bed. He slips out of bed and quietly makes his way down the aisle, paying no attention to the other patients, some of who are beginning to stir awake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead, at the end of the hallway, the door opens and three Negro day attendants, WASHINGTON, WARREN and MILLER, dressed in white uniforms, enter and move down the hallway and disappear into a side room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bromden continues his silent journey towards the day room as Turkle emerges from the side door to the nurses' lounge, goes up the hallway as MISS PILBOW, the day nurse, comes in, passing Turkle on the way out. She crosses to the nurses' station and enters as Bromden reaches the day room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. DAY ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Bromden makes his way across the day room, past the nurses' station, unnoticed by Miss Pilbow who is busy preparing the day's medication.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bromden is sliding along the hallway wall, when he is suddenly cut off by a mop which THUDS against one side of his neck. A second mop yokes him on the other side. Bromden freezes. Terrified.

No sound as we SEE Big Nurse watch the last few patients file past the side door to the Nurses' Station where Miss Pilbow hands out little cups with pills. Washington stands by, checking to see each man takes his pills before filling their cups with orange juice. The last patient takes his pills and returns to his place in the Day Room. Miss Pilbow closes the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Satisfied that all is well, Big Nurse turns on an old 45 record player with a stack of records, then she settles down to her work as a SOFT, NOSTALGIC NUMBER from the '40's is HEARD OVER LOUDSPEAKER. CAMERA BEGINS SLOW PAN of the Day Room.

The patients, under the influence of drugs, have settled down for the day. HARDING is playing cards with MARTINI, CHESWICK and BILLY. SEFELT and FREDRICKSON are putting a jigsaw puzzle together in brotherly love. SORENSEN is off by himself, rubbing his hands clean. TABER, pencil in hand, sits pondering over a blank piece of paper. SCANLON paces back and forth. On the Chronics' side of the room, RUCKLY is turning a grimy photograph over in his hands. BANCINI sits wagging his head, mumbling over and over, "Tired, awful tired..." ELLIS stands against the wall, arms outstretched, hands nailed to the wall by imaginary nails.

Staff personnel are SEEN moving in and out of the main entrance where a state penitentiary car is parked.

A long beat, then McMurphy slowly emerges from the car. He's wearing handcuffs and dressed in faded jeans, flannel work shirt, leather jacket, black motorcycle cap, and heavy black boots.

McMurphy starts tossing packages of cigarettes into the mass of struggling bodies as Washington grabs McMurphy by the arm and tries to wheel him away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McMurphy shakes him off and throws a pack of cigarettes in Washington's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Washington goes after McMurphy, grabs him, and drives him against the wall, right next to Bromden, who watches as McMurphy shoves Washington away, goes into a crouch and starts circling Washington. Washington dances in and out, chipping away at McMurphy's face until McMurphy drives his fist square into Washington's white, starched chest, drawing him against the wall.

McMurphy moves in for the kill.

:SC: EXT. HALLWAY TO DISTURBANCE WARD - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as McMurphy, bruised from the fight, and Bromden, handcuffed to a special belt, wait while an aide unlocks the first of a double set of heavy security doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first door is locked, leaving McMurphy, Bromden, and the three aides crammed in the small space between the two doors while another aide opens the second door and McMurphy and Bromden step through, followed by the aides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. DISTURBANCE WARD - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the aide locks the door behind them, the other aides lead Bromden and McMurphy toward a bench, where they unshackle them.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to a bench)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDE>
<DIRECTION>
The three aides go down the hall, leaving McMurphy and Bromden who sit and look at their new surroundings. There is a man sitting next to them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McMURPHY'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The architecture is the same as the ward we left below, but it is the atmosphere that is different. A heaviness pervades all. Heavily sedated patients sit isolated from each other. Others stand shifting from one foot to the other, while others walk up and down the hallway, their locomotive powers not unlike that of Parkinson's Disease (caused by too much sedation).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, one patient gets up, speaking very angrily, shouting incoherently at no one; he crosses the hall and enters a side room. An aide goes in after him. A long beat, then the aide comes out with the patient and gently leads him back to his seat, talking softly to the man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Further down the hallway, a gurney is wheeled out of the east room with a patient lying on it, out cold; he is wheeled further down the hall to the men's dorms, where he is left to sleep it off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two aides come out of the EST room and head in McMurphy's direction, where one of the aides motions to the patient sitting next to McMurpby.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (approaching him very gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Joey... this isn't going to hurt you... good for you... make you feel better...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AIDE>
<DIRECTION>
The patient clings to the bench, terrified, weeping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The aides peel him off the bench and escort him down the hall to the EST room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As McMurphy watches the patient go, he takes out a package of gum. Takes a stick for himself and gives Bromden one. McMurphy turns back to his own thoughts.
</DIRECTION>
<BROMDEN>

McMurphy takes the bit in his teeth. The Doctor moves back to the head of the gurney and places the thongs on McMurphy's temples.

The Doctor nods to the six aides, who move in and gently place their hands, in a very professional manner, on McMurphy's knees, hips and shoulders. Once set, the Doctor turns to his controls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT OF McMURPHY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he looks around, not nearly as scared as he is mystified by the whole process, when suddenly, without warning, McMurphy is hit by the shock. His face is a contorted mask of surprise and pain. His whole body caught in a sudden spasm. A moment of rigidity, then McMurphy passes out and his body relaxes. Another moment, then a series of violent body spasms begin flowing down his body. Now the aides' function is very clear, as they press down, holding McMurphy firmly to the gurney, until the last spasm subsides.

McMURPHY'S POV - TURKLE AND ROSE

as the two of them cross out of the day room toward the hallway, Turkle suddenly turns and hurries back to McMurphy, takes the bottle of booze and hurries off clucking to himself.

McMURPHY'S POV - TURKLE AND ROSE

BACK TO McMURPHY

Satisfied, he crosses to the nurses' station, reaches in the open side-door window, opens the door and enters.

MUSIC OVER as the patients are queued up at the nurses' station where Candy is handing out cups full of whiskey, McMurphy backing her up, pouring the booze into the cups.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. NURSES' LOUNGE - NIGHT
