:SC: NINJA ASSASSIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON a Horimono Tattoo as it is being drawn into flesh. The ink is needled into the surface of the skin, raw and bloody, the needled brush tapped with the precision of ritual.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tattoo is in the style of a Kuniyoshi print: Miyamoto Musashi thrusting his spear into the writhing dragon. The image has beauty but retains the violence required to saturate flesh with art.

The skin canvas shifts uncomfortably with the needle- work.

A place of designer furniture, beautiful girls carrying towels, tea and cigarettes. Dozens of Yakuza look on as the process continues, sleeves rolled up or shirts off to expose the lavish tattoos that cover their torsos.

HOLLYWOOD, the young Yakuza member, is getting his first tattoo, a relatively small one on his back.

	The irezumi does not hide the skin, the tattoo reveals the nature of the man and illuminates the four noble professions in the Book of Five Rings: the Warrior, the Artist, the Merchant, and the farmer.

	There were many with him and they laughed like you laugh now. Then it came from the shadows and their laughter was drowned in blood. You cannot bargain with what is coming.

His Lieutenant laughs hard with him until the top of his head disappears, sliced off from his jaw up, leaving his tongue wagging in space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lights shatter around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chaos ensues. The panicked screams of the fleeing entourage co-mingle in chorus with gruesome death rattles of Hollywood's foot soldiers as one by one, they are eviscerated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a RUSH of movement, more felt than seen. The whistle of swords through the air. Cries and screams. Guns that fire suddenly and are just as suddenly stilled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STAY on the face of the Tattoo Master, barely visible in the thin trace of moonlight from a nearby window. Frozen. Immobile. As the killing continues around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then: silence, broken by the sound of heavy, desperate BREATHING, and a MATCH being struck by Hollywood who looks up --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and sees a dark figures standing before him. Everyone else is dead. Only he and the Tattoo Master remain. The figure regards him with still silence. For perhaps the first time in his life, Hollywood is terrified.

<DIRECTION>
Their answer is silence. Hollywood sees his guns nearby. With a desperate scream, he THROWS the match in the air as he DIVES for his guns, grabbing one in each hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a whistle of metal and suddenly his severed hands are tumbling gracefully through the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blade swings again, slicing through his body as if it were barely there, coming out the other side as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Hollywood's body erupts as it falls in two pieces, splattering the artist with blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The match touches the floor and goes out.

Silence. He waits for the death blow. It does not come. He finally forces himself to open his eyes.

The ninja is gone, having departed as silently as he came, leaving death and blood in his wake.

A roll of toilet paper drops into a cart. PULL BACK to REVEAL RAIZO, 20s, slim and sinewy, his expression distant, almost haunted. He considers the toothpaste options for a moment, then drops in one of those too. Moves on to food.

Turkish Muzak plays in the background, a Beatles song, "Helter Skelter" by way of Turkish musicians. Other SHOPPERS cruise past in their own private quests.

He smiles and nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They begin to fold, corner to corner, end to end. Silently. The fluorescent strobing above them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We sense a strange tension between them as we realize they are alone in the midnight cleaners. He looks at her. She smiles. The uneven strobing on either side of the Laundromat casts uneven shadows on her face... almost as though she had two faces. One light, one shadow. We EXTEND the silence for a long BEAT until he looks down at the sheet and says:
</DIRECTION>
<RAIZO>

	What clan are you from?

Her eyes REACT as suddenly a blade flashes from beneath the sheet, reaching for Raizo's throat.

He catches the blade in the sheet, twisting it in her grip. She fights for control.

A fury of slashes and the sheet is shredded.

All except for Raizo, who sets down his chopsticks. Willing himself not to be hungry.

FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE OZUNU HOUSE - NIGHTINGALE FLOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Young Raizo stands in the central chamber of the compound. The floor beneath his bare feet is made of thousands of carefully mitred pieces of gleaming wood laid down in an intricate pattern. They are not, however, glued down to the floor. The slightest wrong move will make them shift noisily.
</DIRECTION>

This is our first look at the Nightingale Floor.

	Suffering exists only because weakness exists.

He makes no sound.

He takes another step, and another. Each soft as a falling feather.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is a third of the way across the floor - his body gleaming with sweat - when he steps wrong and the floor sings beneath him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo stops, a flash of panic in his eyes. Then he subdues the emotion and obediently lifts the offending foot, holds it out as Ozunu rises and approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ozunu lays open Raizo's foot with a bamboo rod. Slashing blows that leave deep cuts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo's expression hardly changes. Ozunu returns to his place, and Raizo starts walking again, making no noise, and leaving no trace of his passage...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...except for a trail of small, bloody footprints.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE DORMITORY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same evening. Most of the children in this place sleep on mats in the same room. They are exhausted, silent, motionless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We FIND Raizo and though he makes no sound, his eyes show silent tears of pain, his feet still bleeding and bruised.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kiriko looks on from her mat for a long, silent BEAT, knowing the agony he is in. Then, as if coming to an inner decision, she reaches under her mat for a leaf into which a thick salve has been folded. She crosses the few feet to Raizo's mat and, as he watches in silent agony, she puts her finger to her lips, then kneels down --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and begins applying the salve to his feet. Within moments, we can see the pain leaving his eyes. Finishing quickly, she folds the remaining salve back into the leaf, exchanges a quick, furtive glance with Raizo, then heads back for her mat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lays there for a BEAT, confused as to whether his diminishing pain is a good thing. Then he turns to look at Kiriko, but she lays with her back to him, apparently asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He regards her silently for a moment, then rolls over himself to sleep as we come around to --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the other side of Kiriko, and see that she is very much awake, almost smiling. She closes her eyes.

The apartment is dark as Mika ENTERS and turns on the lights. She looks the place over, then goes room to room, turning on every light in the place. The practiced way she does it makes it clear she does this every night.

Satisfied she's alone, she goes into the bedroom to change.

	Historical evidence suggests that Ibn-Battuta's journey through the far east brought him into contact with what might be one of the oldest of the Nine Clans.

BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly the light in the bedroom hallway goes OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She freezes, and the world seems to freeze with her. She doesn't move, doesn't breathe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She forces herself to sit slowly up, reaching under her bed for a cricket bat. A car drives by outside. Could be nothing. Could be everything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Despite her fear, she edges toward the door. Slowly peers around it. The darkened hall is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a ticking sound, like someone tapping at a window. Could be a tree in the wind. Could be something else.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She moves slowly through her apartment. Every shadow could conceal unseen eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She comes to the end of the hall, where the overhead light is out. She flicks the switch on and off. Nothing. She reaches carefully toward the light bulb. Taps it. The bulb rattles, it's just burned out. She breathes a sigh of relief. Then she notices --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- that the living room window is open, the blinds gently swaying from the wind, tapping against the sash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She closes it and locks it. Looks to her desk, concerned. Did she leave the window open? Or is something going on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to her desk, anxious, to check on something. She opens a drawer, revealing a box of tampax. Pulls out the tampax to reveal a key... a place no guy would think to check.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She unlocks a drawer and takes out an unmarked DVD in a slim plastic case. Relieved, she starts to put it away...then stops. Is it the same DVD? She moves OS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOMENTS LATER... the TV is switched on, and an image begins to play, revealing a time coded security camera, recording an urban street corner in Japan. The tape is riddled with digital noise and artifacting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, slowly, the digital noise seems to coalesce, to grow shapes. The shadows come to life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then with incredible speed two dark figures start battling it out, their blades striking sparks that are still descending after they've slipped back into the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They emerge over and over, brief flashes of clarity like the perfect arc of a calligrapher's brush describing the wing of a bird. Fight. Retreat. Silence. Shadows. Sparks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mika hits the pause button and moves closer to the screen, examining the figures.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the figures is wearing a mask, but the face of the other combatant is revealed, albeit somewhat obscured by the dim light and digital noise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we PUSH IN, we see that it's Raizo. But she doesn't know that name yet.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...who are you?

</MIKA>

She stares at the fierce beauty of his face and touches the screen gently.

INT. ISTANBUL RAIZO'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on a bed of nails; sixteen penny nails arranged in perfect rows pointing up, the sharp tips catching the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we REVEAL Raizo his breathing is rhythmic and deep, but this is really the first time we have heard him sound like he is straining.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we continue to WIDEN, we discover the reason for this: he is doing handstand push-ups. On the nails. Over and over, with little apparent effort.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hard edges and lines of his body catch the light, like the tips of the nails, as we HEAR:

EXT. ISTANBUL - STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo walks down a street where repair work is being done. To keep cars from falling into the hole, they've covered the street with big steel plates. As the cars and trucks pass over the plates, they make a bump-thump sound. Bump-thump, bump-thump, bump-thump. We PUSH IN on Raizo under that sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK - EXT. ORPHANAGE BONSAI GARDEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Kiriko is working in the bonsai garden. Raizo watches her silently for a moment noticing that she is secretly loosening the wires, letting the branches ease back into their natural shape.

He whispers.

	Really? Let me see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRIKO>
<DIRECTION>
He hesitates, then approaches. Kneels down beside her. She reaches toward him. He flinches...a sword he can handle, but kindness has become something foreign...then allows her to undo the top button of his shirt. She presses her ear to his chest. Listens.

Then she gently whispers to it.

Raizo, is fighting with TAKESHI, a few years older, in a room lit by hundreds of hanging torches. Armed with katanas, the boys duck, dodge and weave around the burning obstacles as they fight.

They are both extremely agile, their bodies moving with the impossible flexibility of youth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kiriko watches along with the other members of the clan. If she feels anything as she watches the fight, we cannot tell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They perform a vicious series of combinations, then Takeshi's sword cracks against Raizo's head, opening a huge gash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo hits the ground hard, blood speckling the mats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Takeshi backs away as Ozunu steps in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As blood flows down the side of his face, Raizo looks like the young boy that he is. Pain throbs from the wound, and he begins to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<OZUNU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did Takeshi's blow hurt you? You think this is pain? You are mistaken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OZUNU>
<DIRECTION>
He gouges three fingers into the boy's stomach and twists something inside of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His screams smear into uncontrollable sobbing.

	That is true pain. You must learn to live with it.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kiriko is the last to turn away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIME CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Later. Night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo is still where we left him, a twisted knot of pain, his face stained with tears and crusted with snot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is trying to control his breath, at first without success. Then slowly, finally, it begins to ease. His hand, twisted into a kind of rigor mortis, slowly begins to relax, opening like a lotus flower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIME CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dawn breaks over the wall, as Ozunu returns to the dojo to find Raizo is sitting in a full lotus, completely calm, the wound already beginning to heal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ozunu shows a hint of a smile.

INT. ISTANBUL RAIZO'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shuriken blade grinds against a whetstone as Raizo sharpens the weapon with practiced grace...despite being blindfolded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sunlight is held back by vertical blinds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he finishes, he stands, a Rodin sculpted out of midnight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We realize there are wooden blocks placed around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In his palm, a single shuriken abruptly fans into many like a deck of cards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly his arm whips around as the shurikens crack and split the thick wooden targets.

He stands alone, still blindfolded.

Takeshi's sword slides from one position to another as Ozunu looks on.

Raizo, blindfolded, reacts to the sound, matching his posture a fraction of a second later.

Raizo gets up, slowly releasing the tension in his jaw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes his position again, and this time the stance is easy, his expression softer. This time, as Takeshi comes at him, everything becomes clear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The whistle of the blade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The zip of the leg sweep against the tatami mat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of his robe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Combined with Takeshi's unmistakable body odor Raizo has everything he needs to dodge, slip and counter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His chain strikes, wrapping an ankle, throwing a stunned Takeshi to the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kiriko tries to hide her smile.

Ozunu nods in appreciation.

Raizo nods back, as if he can see without eyes.

FLASHBACK - INT. ORPHANAGE DORMITORY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Young Raizo, still blindfolded is in bed. Trying to sleep, but it's impossible. Takeshi's snoring doesn't help.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns slightly towards Kiriko, as her chest rises and falls, her breath as rhythmic as and gentle as the lap of sea-water in a tidal pool. He begins to breathe in sync with her, perhaps in hopes it will relax him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, all the other sounds in the room go away, until only her breathing, and his, remains. There is the slight murmur of their hearts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she opens her eyes...and smiles at him because he cannot see her. But he hears her heart begin to beat faster and that brings a faint smile to his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They listen to each other's breathing growing heavier, the sound of their hearts beating faster and faster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her lips part as she makes the tiniest movement...tilting her pelvis up, rubbing her hips ever so slightly against the blanket-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's like tectonic plates shifting for Raizo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bump-thump, bump-thump, bump-thump their hearts growing louder and louder as they become-

Then, suddenly: darkness.

And sudden MOVEMENT in the shadows that LUNGES toward Alexei.

INT. ISTANBUL RAIZO'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo sits alone. Crossed-legged on the floor. Utterly still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's an ocean of sound swirling around him. The cacophony of Instanbul evening rush hour.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo starts to build a dam; auricular sandbags laid one by one, walling off the outside world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The traffic outside- horns, engines, squealing tires, rattling trucks chassis- all fade away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People shouting, singing. A couple next door making love. A baby wailing. Jackhammers pounding...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, the world fades away, until there is only one sound. Faint, familiar, but almost too quiet to hear...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo's heartbeat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He listens to it. Meditates on its simple rhythm...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Until a sound explodes in the room, it is a sound we haven't heard in his apartment-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rises slowly as the phone continues to ring. He answers it silently waiting for something-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The line clicks and goes dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ISTANBUL STREET SOUK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo walks through the crowded market. Shoppers, salesmen and tourists fill the narrow aisles between the stalls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIVE CHILDREN- who we see only from the back- run past. Shouting laughing. The last one jostles against Raizo as he goes by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo keeps walking, but he is holding an envelope in his hand. He slips it into his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ISTANBUL STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo opens the envelope as he crosses the street. There's a square of paper inside, and a photograph.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the paper is a street address in Berlin. The photograph is a close-up of a woman's face...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mika.
</DIRECTION>

INT. MIKA'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close on the box. It sits on her desk, calling as another box once called to Pandora.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside are a series of cataloged photographs taken in the style of 1970's archeologists (like those of the dead sea scrolls) of the lost chapter of Ibn-Battuta.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scrolls contain his 14th century Islamic writing and several sketches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is also a very rough map that suggests the location of The Orphanage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Images of the orphanage, of the children training and their ordeals, bloody combat, ritual bindings, beatings on the Nightingale floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a scroll that she unrolls revealing the lineage tree of the Nine Clans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Also in the box is a single VHS tape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pushes the tape into the player.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a recording of a surveillance camera staring at the front of the Sabatin house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man walks up to the house and rings's the bell. We cannot see his face. Sabatin opens the door. They exchange words. Sabatin seems wary but invites the man in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mika doesn't understand why this is significant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hits fast forward until she sees a flash as the man exits. She stops, rewinds and plays it again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he steps out of the shadow of the house, she sees his face-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is Raizo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is startled when someone pounds on the door. It seems like it might rattle off its hinges as she hurries to open it revealing-
</DIRECTION>

Maslow and he's not happy.

<DIRECTION>
Maslow starts to put it together.
</DIRECTION>
<MASLOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you requisitioned this by accident. You used my code which is why you didn't want to show me this. Which is also why they're tearing apart my office right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASLOW>
<MIKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry Ryan. You have to know I didn't mean for you to get in trouble... I just thought if this was real, if these clans were killing people, you know, it was our job to try to stop them.

<MASLOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very noble of you but I've got the feeling this isn't a slap-on-the wrist kinda consequence. Let me take this and try to make some sense of this shitstorm you started. In the meantime, you will not say anything to anybody. Capiche?

Suddenly she realizes she is not alone;
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zabranski is leaning against the door jam. He smiles.

He reaches across her desk.

	Agent Zabranski. Internal affairs. Need to ask you a couple of questions. You are Mika Coretti, yeah?

<ZABRANSKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Has Agent Maslow seemed different lately, in any way? Has he done or said anything that struck you as unusual?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZABRANSKI>
<MIKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No why. Has Agent Maslow done something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKA>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles in the way a piranha might smile if it could.
</DIRECTION>
<ZABRANSKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just routine. The agency cares about its field operatives. We monitor for signs of stress, fatigue, mental exhaustion. Agent Maslow has a serious case load. That much work can wear on a man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZABRANSKI>
<DIRECTION>
He leaves.

She gets up and closes her door. She grabs her phone and calls Maslow.

</MASLOW>
<JAMISON>

	Let me be clear, Agent Maslow. In the eyes of the law these materials do not exist. If so, than there is no case and if there is no case there is no reason for this conversation to continue.

	Come on Mika, how could he take something that didn't exist? He couldn't. Which means that I couldn't copy it either, and if I couldn't copy it than I can't be violating international laws and agreements by still having it.

He shakes his head and slips out the door.

EXT. MIKA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mika parks her car around the corner from the apartment building, gets out and starts down the street when she sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the apartment building and the one next door are dark. Candles and flashlights are visible in some of the apartment windows, a scattering of neighbors congregating outside. Mika approaches a NEIGHBOR.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKA>
<NEIGHBOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEIGHBOR>
<MIKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKA>
<NEIGHBOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Power's out. Us, the building behind us, that one across the street. Seems like every few months, boom, the lights out. I call, I complain, they listen...nothing gets done. So I sit out here, at least it's cool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEIGHBOR>
<DIRECTION>
Mika looks up at the building, scared but not ready to believe that ninjas are responsible for everything. She pulls a tiny LED flashlight out of her bag and starts into the building.
</DIRECTION>
<NEIGHBOR>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch your step.

</NEIGHBOR>
<MIKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not the first person to give me that advice today....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKA>
<DIRECTION>
And she continues into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MIKA'S APARTMENT BUILDING STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- where she climbs the steps, each creak adding to the possibility of attracting trouble. On the passing floors, we hear doors being opened and shut, footsteps, the distant murmur of voices. Could be nothing. Could be everything. She presses on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MIKA'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She opens the door to her apartment, shining the tiny light ahead of her. Shadows chase each other across the room as she swings the light one way, then another. There seems to be no one else in the place. But as she hurries into her home office, we see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shadow move behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she packs she begins to hear something, a tapping. The same sound she heard before. She pulls the gun from her purse. With the flashlight spearing the darkness, she goes to her office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again the window is open, the blinds gently blowing against the sash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is certain the window had been locked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now every shadow is alive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She rushes back to her bedroom aiming in every direction. Her flashlight finds her suitcase. On the top of her clothes she sees it: An envelope. Perfectly centered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Setting the gun down, she picks up the oragami-folded envelope. Opens it with a shaking finger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Black sand spills out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terror steals her breath. Behind her, a shadow tilts and reveals the eyes of a ninja.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before she can even move, a blade flashes from the darkness, heading for her neck-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another shadow blocks the blade, knocking Mika over the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sounds of a fight erupt all around her but the combatants are almost invisible in the surrounding darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her flashlight catches glimpses. Impossibly fast, lethal predators trying to kill each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She crawls towards the spilled contents of her suitcase, towards the gun. Another blow arcs for her and is again blocked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her hand finds the handle of the gun. She points into the dark, fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gun flash strobes the room, freezing the two ninjas in the blink of a flashbulb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They move towards her until a kick sends her gun flying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She can feel them fighting very close to her and when she finds them with her flashlight, a blade is struck deep-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blood erupts. One shadow falls to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other turns towards her. Her flashlight shakes as the ninja reaches up and removes his mask.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is Raizo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees in her eyes that she knows him.
</DIRECTION>
<RAIZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAIZO>
<DIRECTION>
She nods.

</MIKA>
<RAIZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAIZO>
<MIKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Nine. Nine clans. And they apparently have been supplying assassins to governments or anyone who happens to have one hundred pounds of gold lying around for the last thousand years. Give or take.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKA>
<DIRECTION>
He nods faintly. Then turns to his dead "Brother".
</DIRECTION>
<RAIZO>

	His name was Jin.

</RAIZO>
<MIKA>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MIKA>
<RAIZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was not born an "Assassin".

</RAIZO>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at the dead body.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...you're from his clan ?

</MIKA>
<DIRECTION>
His nod is almost imperceptible.

<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then...why did you stop him?

</MIKA>
<RAIZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The clans have three kinds of people! People with power. People with money. Or people hunting them.

He hears something she can't. She starts to speak, and he stops her with a gesture.

She looks for her gun.
</DIRECTION>
<RAIZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The gun won't help you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAIZO>
<MIKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have a lot of options okay. I once took a Tae Bo class, but that's the extent of my Kung Fu abilities.

She runs with the flashlight to a bureau. Inside is a black tablecloth. He pulls her shoes off.

INT. MIKA'S APARTMENT BUILDING STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leads her down through the stairwell of the large walk up. She follows him step by step.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he pulls her into the corner of a doorway. Wrapping the tablecloth around them, they melt into darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beneath the wrap, he puts his hand over her mouth and nose stopping her breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside after a long beat a ninja's foot silently glides past, climbing the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside he releases her nose. Before she can finish taking a breath he yanks her up and they quickly descend the remaining stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MIKA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dead ninja lies in a pool of blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shadows come alive and four dark figures emerge, born from the black-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hanta Kirra.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their leader drifts forward surveying the apartment, his dark eyes flashing that we recognize.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like snap-focus flashes taking in the myriad signs of the fight: the bullets in the wall, footprints, and shattered lights. One of the killers uses his sword to trace the line of a slashing cut in wall. Braille from the blow that Raizo used to cut the ninja.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He removes his mask and we see it's Takeshi.
</DIRECTION>
<TAKESHI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Raizo.

</TAKESHI>
<DIRECTION>
Another Ninja leans forward and tastes the air with his nose. Eyes closed. Like a dog getting the scent, his inhalation a long, low whisper in the silent room.

FLASHBACK - INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo is dressed in normal clothes his hair starting to grow back from the close shave he had in the Orphanage. He wears a silk blindfold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ozunu sits in the leather gloom of the stuffed upholstery.
</DIRECTION>
<OZUNU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may remove the blindfold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OZUNU>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo does so. Looking around at the lights of Osaka, a city he has never seen before.
</DIRECTION>
<OZUNU>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your entire life has brought you to this moment. Do not fail yourself. Do not fail your family.

<MR_OZUNU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is wearing a black and gold watch. Bring it to me.

</MR_OZUNU>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo nods again, then opens the door and steps out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FIVE STAR HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON the fat wrist of a large man as he strides across the lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to his entourage which includes several bodyguards and a few arm pieces.
</DIRECTION>
<KINGPIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait here. Gotta piss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KINGPIN>
<BODYGUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want me to come with you, boss?

</BODYGUARD>
<KINGPIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? So you can shake it for me? You some kind of secret faggot?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KINGPIN>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs and the arm pieces cluck on cue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He heads into the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FIVE STAR HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kingpin enters there is only one person in the bathroom-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo washing his hands. His eyes flash in the mirror, watching the Kingpin only after he has turned away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The enormous man steps into a stall. After a moment he begins to piss, moaning slightly as he does.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo hits the air dryer button. The sound fills the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A thin razor sharp blade flashes from his sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Kingpin continues to enjoy his piss but as we look at him we see the door behind him silently swing open, revealing Raizo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo stares at the back of the man's head. He can almost see his jugular beating beneath the thick folds of his neck-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But something prevents him from striking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dryer stops, the sound of the piss dribbling when the Kingpin suddenly looks back over his shoulder-
</DIRECTION>
<KINGPIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fuck-?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KINGPIN>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo strikes but the kingpin is able to deflect the blow which sinks into his enormous body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<KINGPIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<KINGPIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gonna take more than a knitting needle to fuck me up, boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KINGPIN>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo attacks and it is immediately apparent that this is not going to be easy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several ferocious blows that would have broken the neck of a smaller man, only seem to make the Kingpin madder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soon both are covered in blood, and gore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But it is not until Raizo slams the man's head against the lip of the urinal-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first time a font blood splashing up--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second time the porcelain shatters as the Kingpin's head opens, spilling black blood across the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOF - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is raining.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo, still wearing his bloody clothes, climbs up onto the roof, his clothes spattered with gore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He waits as the shadows around him come to life: Ozunu, Takeshi, and several other clan members surround him. All but Ozunu wear their masks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo extends his hand, revealing the black and gold watch, smeared with fresh blood. He offers it to Mr. Ozunu.
</DIRECTION>
<OZUNU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep it. It will remind you that every minute of your life is a gift that I have given you.

Ozunu smiles.

His eyes narrow.
</DIRECTION>
<OZUNU>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a strength inside you Raizo. You must use that strength, now to show me that you are truly Ozunu.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OZUNU>
<DIRECTION>
Several of the other ninjas step back. Revealing Takeshi. He pushes a small hooded figure forward.
</DIRECTION>
<OZUNU>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Weakness compels strength. Betrayal begets blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OZUNU>
<DIRECTION>
Takeshi yanks the hood off revealing a young girl. She is bloody, bound and gagged and for a flash-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo sees her as Kiriko.
</DIRECTION>
<OZUNU>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A daughter that turned her back on her family. She tried to run. Takeshi hunted her down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OZUNU>
<DIRECTION>
He unsheathes his blade, offering the hilt to Raizo.
</DIRECTION>
<OZUNU>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is the law of the Nine Clans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OZUNU>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo looks at the girl, her tears lost in the rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We cannot tell if Raizo is crying as he takes the blade-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He CRIES OUT, the light of madness in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He STRIKES, lashing out with the fury of a wild animal, at Ozunu --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- who bends back with impossible grace. But not far enough.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The point of Raizo's sword slashes across his face, opening an ugly wound that spills blood over his eye and mouth...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hasn't tasted his own blood in years, and the anger boils up in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<OZUNU>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OZUNU>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo meets their attack. Throwing himself into the fray as only a man who is no longer interested in living can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the ninjas are everywhere. They hurl shuriken at him by the handful, a storm of jagged steel racing for Raizo's flesh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo blocks some of the shuriken, misses many more. The shuriken strike muscles, tendons, flesh. He SWINGS around, still trying to attack, there are too many of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stumbles back towards the edge of the roof as Takeshi SWINGS what he believes will be the death blow as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Raizo half-falls, half-leaps backward, falling from the rooftop, tumbling through space, until he --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Splashes into the canal below-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bubbles dancing between the ribbons of blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR - NIGHT

Mika speeds along the autobahn.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well usually if someone introduces themselves it is a convention that the other person does likewise.

He considers her.

</DIRECTION>
<MIKA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it's okay with you, I'll try to fill in some of the blanks. You must have been taken by the Ozunu clan, trained to be an assassin, but something happened and you decided to opt out of the program. I don't imagine this went over so well and since they're after me for just peeking through the keyhole, they must be after you in a major way. But you are also after them or you wouldn't have bothered going to Sabatin. Which I figure means you're searching for the location of The Orphanage because that's obviously the only information Battatu's book would have that you wouldn't already know.
	</DIALOGUE>

He looks at her impressed.

She nods. He opens his door and slips out.

<DIRECTION>
She watches as he heads for the doors. He passes into the shadow of the building and disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She digs into her bag for the phone Maslow gave her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She TEXTS: 911. But situ stable. Guardian angel all in black. Need Battuta book soon. Will call. M

<RAIZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dry yourself with this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAIZO>
<DIRECTION>
He starts taking off his clothes. He does it quickly without any sense of awkwardness; the world where he came from makes little distinction between male and female. She's not from the same world, keeping herself as covered as possible with a tree branch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He jumps in the shower while she tries to dry herself off.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I'm just a researcher. I'm really not equipped to deal with this...

In the bedroom, Raizo is dressed in new clothes. He lights a cigarette as Mika come out struggling with the tightness of her new jeans.

The trunk pops open. Raizo tosses their bag of clothes under the lid of the tire compartment. Then closes the door.

Raizo is chained to the walls of a vault. Spread-eagled, double-locked, and lit from all sides so there are no shadows anywhere in the room.

Classic Berlin aesthetic. A modern office shoe-horned into an abandoned building: cubicles, computers and Aeron chairs amidst crumbling walls.

Maslow's team are hanging out there, thirty agents, a fairly competent and well-armed bunch. Maslow is inside the control room which is like a small construction trailer. Several different monitors have images of Raizo.

He moves to an upright bamboo box about the size of a coffin. Looking at --

He pulls a bamboo straw from his dark robe, then fills his mouth with water from a flask.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sticking the straw through the bamboo poles near her lips, he feeds her drop by drop, and in this way, separated by a cage they share a kind of kiss.

Her eyes part, ever so slightly, and she manages a smile.

But before it can continue its deadly cut, Maslow catches it in a bloody fist and fires into the shadows.

Raizo blocks a sword-thrust from Takeshi. Dodges around a hail of shuriken. Uses his chain to drive another Ninja back.

Takeshi rips free his left arm. Draws a short, angled blade and brings it slashing down at Raizo's neck...

Raizo blocks the knife with his elbow, twists, throws Takeshi twenty feet through the air. He recovers mid- flight like a cat and regains his balance.

From the darkness a ninja fires a dozen shuriken at him, and at least three of the spinning blades find their mark.

She twists the ignition and as the motor turns over--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car's headlights explode, shattered by projectiles that seem to materialize from the void.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mika screams throwing the car into gear--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Peeling out toward the down ramp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car fishtails down level after level through the oscillating light/dark of the dimly lit exit ramp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes twitch from mirror to mirror when she sees up ahead--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shadow hanging in the corner of the tunnel like a spider.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She ducks just as the front of the sedan is shredded by a squall of stars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sedan rebounds into the light. Its hood and windscreen looking as though it was gnawed on by a Great White.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mika cranks the wheel tearing around a dark bend as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Toom! Something lands on the roof of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above her she sees the distinct tips of the tiger claws that have punctured the metal exterior of the car just as- -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She passes under a light--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Revealing a crouching ninja staring right at her, through the sun roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His blade whips from its sheath but before he can strike--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She jams the barrel of the Glock between the two tips of one set of claws, right where his foot should be--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A scream is followed by a gout of blood that washes over the sunroof--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ninja's body tumbling off the back of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maslow's gnarled sedan bottoms out in a starburst of sparks as it corners into traffic.

Mika breathing heavy digs into her bag for her cell phone.

INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOFTOPS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo parkours across the roofs, the Hanta Kirra close behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shuriken sizzle past; some missing, some lashing open whip cuts across his flesh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WINGED VICTORY ROUNDABOUT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo pulls free the shuriken in his side. Drops them to the ground where they clatter back and forth like so much tossed change. He looks up at winged victory silhouetted against the moonlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And suddenly the ninja are on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo blocks and parries. Counterattacks with a reverse cut - and throws himself sideways as a truck comes roaring down at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The truck fills the screen with lights and horns and three tons of death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo cartwheels over the hood, forcing the Scarred Ninja to leap the other way, and as he turns --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Raizo comes down on him, slashing his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WINGED VICTORY ROUNDABOUT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fight is now two one against one, and one of them is Takeshi. Their swords crash back and forth, sending sparks flying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo is tired, already wounded by the shuriken...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a cry, he hurls a second Ninja back and spins to face Takeshi...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Too late. Takeshi's blade gets under his guard. Opens up Raizo's side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His sword is ripped free from his hand, rebounds off a speeding sedan and clatters to the ground thirty feet away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo stumbles backward. Life's blood dripping down and splattering on the concrete.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Takeshi raises his sword high. Smiles.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the end for you, brother.

</DIRECTION>
<MIKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Raizo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKA>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo gets into the car. Collapses into the seat, arms wrapped tight around the ugly wound in his side. She peels away before the others can stop her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mika carves a path through the traffic, driving as fast as she can. Eager to get more miles between them and the ninjas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo lets out a gasp as the car goes over a bump. His shirt is drenched with his own blood.

She goes to a tea kettle, pours water into the bowl. He reaches for it, and nearly collapses.

She helps him raise the cup to his lips. Tilts it and watches him drink. Takes the empty cup away from him.

He slumps over the counter like a child dropping into deepest sleep as --

There is a furious storm raging outside the thin screened walls.

Raizo is watching Kiriko who seems to be sleeping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a flash of lightning, her eyes open and she stares at him and he feels in hi heart what she is saying goodbye.

The flashing ends and as the thunder booms, she is gone, melting quietly into the shadows.

Kiriko looks out into the clan and finds Raizo. He can hear her heart pounding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Takeshi knows where she is looking as he prepares to strike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blood pounds in Raizo's ears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sword plunges into her heart. Raizo hears it die-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And feels his own heart stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bucket of water slaps Raizo awake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's bound to a pole in the middle of the courtyard by thick rope that bites into his flesh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ozunu stands before him, as well as the rest of the clan, down to the youngest of them. Watching silently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks the same as he has in the flashbacks - except that now an ugly scar runs diagonally across the length of his face. Trace of Raizo's blade from atop the building in Dubai.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he speaks, Ozunu is speaking for the benefit of the rest of the clan as to Raizo.
</DIRECTION>
<OZUNU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are Ozunu. Your life is meaningless compared to the survival of the Clan. This is our deepest truth. Because of it, we have endured for hundreds of years, and will endure for hundreds more.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your death will be remembered for a thousand years as a testament to the will and strength of the Ozunu Clan.

<DIRECTION>
One last gouge in Raizo's stomach sends a heaving shudder through him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Confident, victorious, Ozunu turns and walks a few steps away as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Raizo coughs up a bloody wad onto the clean floor.

Takeshi smiles at this, then looks more closely, seeing something amidst the bile...

<DIRECTION>
Ozunu looks down and sees a tiny steel cylinder. A single LED light blinking through the gore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He nudges it with his foot...and TIME SLOWS DOWN as he realizes what he's looking at. He slowly raises his eyes --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and meets Raizo's gaze as suddenly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- EXPLOSIONS rock the orphanage's centuries-old gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A reinforced military Humvee crashes through the cloud of splintering timber with a roar and an explosion of blinding lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Ozunu Clan scatters as the massive vehicle heaves into the courtyard, revealing behind it still more vehicles, all equipped with brilliant lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ninjas take to the shadows, trying to melt away, but the shadows are gone. There's no place for the ninjas to hide anymore. We FIND Mika and Maslow in one of the lead vehicles as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Takeshi draws his blade in a smooth arc, raising it over Raizo's helpless form.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maslow takes aim with his submachine gun and squeezes off a long burst.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Takeshi blocks some of the slugs with his sword and dodges the others. He slides into one of the few remaining shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the soldiers sees him making a break for it and fires an incendiary grenade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The explosion sends incandescent white phosphorous splashing through the courtyard, but Takeshi is gone. They prepare to fire another one when Maslow comes on the run.
</DIRECTION>
<MASLOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No more grenades, not until we get the children out!

But some parts of the orphanage are already on fire, the flames spreading through the ancient timbers.

The carnage continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maslow fires at the fleeing ninjas as Mika rushes for Raizo, pistol in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the MP's screams as a shuriken rips open his face as other Mps FIRE back at the ninja, tearing him apart with gunfire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mika makes it to Raizo's side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles at her as she saws through the rope with her knife.
</DIRECTION>
<RAIZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What took you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAIZO>
<MIKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You knew I'd come?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKA>
<RAIZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just because I was asleep doesn't mean I couldn't hear you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAIZO>
<DIRECTION>
Mika finishes with the rope. Raizo pulls free and reaches for a fallen ninja's sword and chain.
</DIRECTION>
<RAIZO>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I forgive you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAIZO>
<DIRECTION>
Mika looks back at the sound of GUNFIRE tearing apart another ninja. When she looks back --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Raizo is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ORPHANAGE KITCHEN/DINING/DORMITORY/DOJO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fires are ripping through the interior, leaping from bamboo furniture to paper shoji screens to polished wooden floors as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Raizo kicks down the burning wall of the empty dorm, the futons smoldering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo continues into the next hall to find --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Takeshi waiting for him. An apparition in the wavering blaze of heat, silhouetted against a wall of fire.
</DIRECTION>
<TAKESHI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, little brother, let us play like old times
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAKESHI>
<DIRECTION>
They spring at other. Meeting in the middle of the hallway as the flames dance around them...recalling the lanterns they used to fight through, in the days of their training.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their weapons ring out a frenzied drum roll of steel on steel. Neither giving an inch. Evenly matched in skill and ferocity. Locking together for a moment Takeshi smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<TAKESHI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No death tasted as sweet as hers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAKESHI>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo's back glistens orange in the firelight, sweat pouring as he strains, attacks, defends and attacks again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Takeshi jumps over them, twists mid-air and ducks low beneath Raizo's swinging chain as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Raizo stumbles back on the polished floor, blocking Takeshi's attack, but --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Takeshi catches his wrist in an iron grip. As he brings his sword around, Raizo gets a loop of chain around the blade and locks it tight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both men spin in their sudden embrace. Faces inches from each other.
</DIRECTION>
<TAKESHI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I watched you die when I pierced her heart. You have always been too weak to be Ozunu.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAKESHI>
<DIRECTION>
Takeshi's finger trips a hidden button on the sword.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blade retracts back through the handle and a yard of steel jolts out from the hilt of Takeshi's sword.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves to slam it into Raizo's side...but Raizo FLIPS over him, holding onto the hilt and as he lands he --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- DRIVES the steel into Takeshi's heart. He still stands for a BEAT, more by inertia than will, then slumps, dead, to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo stalks down the hall. One last task ahead of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ORPHANAGE OZUNU HOUSE NIGHTINGALE FLOOR/MASTERS ROOM/ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo walks across the Nightingale floor, his bloody footprints moving soundlessly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the shadows he hears Ozunu's voice
</DIRECTION>
<OZUNU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have not forgotten your training. You will always be mine, child.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OZUNU>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo stops, considers this, then continues; his footsteps now bringing every sound possible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ozunu steps out of the darkness, as though shrugging off a cloak of midnight.
</DIRECTION>
<OZUNU>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps this is the best way for you to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OZUNU>
<DIRECTION>
His blade rises as like a Cobra's hood, while the chain blade begins to spin.
</DIRECTION>
<RAIZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The breath I take after you are dead, will be the first of my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAIZO>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo unleashes all his fury: The chain cutting with the power of an enormous buzz saw--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hacking timbers in half--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carving scars in the floors and walls--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Braziers are thrown, fumes begin to spread but--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ozunu blocks or evades, absorbing the assault patiently
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Waiting for Raizo to tire, waiting for an opening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ORPHANAGE - COURTYARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A portion of the Orphanage's wall burns through. Mika spots Raizo through the flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ORPHANAGE OZUNU HOUSE ASSEMBLY ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo begins to weaken. An attack misses wrapping a beam and Ozunu has his opening-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His assault is ferocious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wounds begin opening like windows shears of blood billowing out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo retreats, his chain just blocking, catching, or deflecting the whirlwind attack until--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One sound cuts through the furious fight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Snap-zoom to Ozunu's ear as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hammer is cocked, a cylinder spinning into place.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Die you fuck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKA>
<DIRECTION>
She fires and Ozunu twists enough so that the bullet grazes him.
</DIRECTION>
<OZUNU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OZUNU>
<DIRECTION>
A scatter shot of shurikens send her diving to the floor. But the distraction gives Raizo his chance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blade whistles, the chain snaps and blood arcs out of Ozunu.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rage thunders the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mika gets back up and aims but--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ozunu seems to pull the shadows and smoke around him as he disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Raizo
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKA>
<DIRECTION>
She cannot see him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ozunu's attack hits Raizo with the force of a bomb burst, his blade shatters through Raizo's chain--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hurling him back, petals of blood fluttering from his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo tries to recover, his chain now in two pieces.
</DIRECTION>
<RAIZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mika! Run!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAIZO>
<MIKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is he? I can't see him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKA>
<RAIZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get away!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAIZO>
<DIRECTION>
Ozunu emerges from the smoke behind her, a wraith. His eyes are as black as the sockets of a skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She spins around but is too late.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ancient blade runs straight through her chest just as- -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo finds them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees Kiriko, the same blade taking her life and howls--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His pain a force of nature unleashed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chain blades crackle in the air-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dual cyclones that batter Ozunu's parrying blade which-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally shatters against Raizo's fury.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And with a final scream, Raizo lunges at his master, the whistling blades lazering through his body until he separates, pieces hanging in mid-air, like an unstitched rag doll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo throws down the blood slick blades and--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--hurries to Mika's side. He picks Mika up and walks through the falling timbers and blazing shards to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ORPHANAGE COURTYARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fighting is over now. All the combatant ninjas dead or long gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maslow sees Raizo emerge from the smoke and flames, carrying Mika in his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<MASLOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mika!

He runs to her side as Raizo lays her gently on the ground.

<RAIZO>

	</DIALOGUE>
</RAIZO>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo puts his hand on her chest. Closes his eyes. We can FEEL her heart-beat. Bump-thump. Bump-thump.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo opens his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<RAIZO>
<DIRECTION>

<MASLOW>

	How can you be sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASLOW>
<DIRECTION>
Raizo touches her face as she takes in a sudden breath. He smiles distantly.
</DIRECTION>
<RAIZO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her heart is special.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAIZO>
<MIKA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Medic! Over here now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKA>
<DIRECTION>
Several medics rush to them, Raizo gently laying her on the stretcher.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they immediately begin working on her, Raizo fades back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maslow remains at her side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes flutter open.
</DIRECTION>
<MASLOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is she going to be okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASLOW>
<MEDIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know...she's got a hole right through the middle of her heart...but shes not really bleeding, that badly...

<MASLOW>

We hear his heartbeat. Bump-thump Bump-thump.

As he stands on the edge of the wall.

In the next moment he is gone-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And finally, free.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
