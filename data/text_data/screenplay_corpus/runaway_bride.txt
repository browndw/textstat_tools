The wind rustles the endless field of corn, blows over the freshly mown meadow of soybeans, and magically sways a copse of trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a Fall after-noon. A SUDDEN POUNDING OF GALLOPING HOOVES breaks the peace and... A HORSE and RIDER burst between the rows of corn into the meadow. They are running for their lives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rider is a bride -- a beautiful woman dressed in a disheveled wedding gown, it's train tattered and flying like a knight's banner out behind her. This is MAGGIE CARPENTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The horse is frothing and wild-eyed, like the bride, who turns to look behind her in terror. The horse's labored breathing mingles with Maggie's panicked gasps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a WEDDING BOUQUET fly into a ditch as the horse thunders on. Maggie clings to the reins. She looks as though she is running from the devil himself.

INT. ELLIE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELLIE is that editor. Stylish and successful looking, she's about Ike's age. Ellie sits behind a big desk with a scowl on her pretty face. Her casual-looking husband, Fisher, sits nonchalantly on the arm of the couch. Ike enters as Ellie reads Maggie's letter.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>

(reading letter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Anyway, I'm just dropping you big city folk this little note to say that I have thought of a ritual sacrifice that would satisfy my current appetite: Ike Graham's column on a platter. Yours truly, Maggie Carpenter. P.S. -- I have inclosed a list of the gross factual misrepresentations in your article. There are fifteen."

	I left four messages. You don't return my calls.

</ELLIE>
<IKE>

<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Journalism lesson number one. If you fabricate your facts, you get fired.

</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie pushes USA Today lawyer's letter across the desk for him to read. Ike picks it up and skims the letter. His face is as impassive as stone.

<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lesson number two. Never work for your former spouse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not nothing to do with it. You cooked this story up and you know it.

<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't cook up a story. I had a source.

Ike gets up and stands near Ellie, making his point.

<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that's what makes you unemployed.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MAGGIE'S HOUSE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A train goes by. A modest clapboard house with a porch. Two entrances. A PAPERBOY tosses a paper onto the lawn in front of the house. The front door opens and Maggie appears fresh out of bed, wearing only a jacket and panties. Heedless of being seen this way, she scampers out to the sidewalk to pick up her delivered paper: USA Today. She tears off the plastic bag and rips into it, looking for her letter. She finds it. A smile on her face, then she scampers back into the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - THAT MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maggie skips back into her house which she shares with Father and Grandma. A cozy and eclectic place creatively furnished on a shoe-string. She rushes into: KITCHEN WHERE BOB KELLY, fiance #4, is packing cans into a backpack. Bob, 38, has a pleasant face and a body that is almost shockingly buff. He's wearing a T-shirt that reads: "Mountaineers Do It Against the Wall.", Maggie dances over, waving the paper and singing.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She canned him, she canned him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>

Bob test the weight of the backpack adding dehydrate food.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come here, Mag, and try this on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<DIRECTION>
Maggie puts the paper on the kitchen counter and starts to read aloud, paying no mind to Bob, who is sticking her arms through the straps of the backpack.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen: "Dear Ms. Carpenter, I apologize to you for this unfortunate matter. Ike Graham's column will no longer be appearing in this paper. Best of luck in you upcoming marriage!"
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Bob continues to hold up the weight of the backpack as he straps it onto Maggie's shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That-a-girl! You sacked him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(checking pack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the weight of the pack you're going to have to carry in the Himalayas. Tell me if it's too heavy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<DIRECTION>
Bob lets go and Maggie FALLS BACKWARD, disappearing behind the counter, and hitting the floor, with a THUD. Bob looks down at her. Maggie's voice rises from the floor behind the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a little... It's a little heavy... Help me, baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Bob has no answer. He reaches a hand down. He yelps as Maggie pulls him down on top of her, out of frame. We HEAR them giggle and kiss.
</DIRECTION>

INT. USA TODAY LOADING DOCK - ANOTHER DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fisher uses the dock for a photo shoot featuring men and women in evening and formal wear from Escada for G.Q. Fisher is not actually shooting the camera, but rather supervising it. Fisher claps his hands and calls the models to attention. Then he goes onto the stage and sets the models in their positions.

They stop walking.

	Okay, you were right. I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.

	Then you've got it. If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.

	"Paid vindication" That's what I call justice.

	Justice, yes. Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FISHER>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'll get my normal fee, right?

EXT. HALE MAIN STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ike exits his hotel as the Barber Shop Quartet finishes singing "Camptown Races."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He now walks down the charming main artery of the town, looking exactly like what he is: a cynical New York out of his element on sunny Main Street, USA. KIDS ride by on bikes, streaming balloons behind them. A balloon hits Ike on the face. As he crosses the street, he mutters into his tape recorder:

Cindy, the manicurist, does Mrs. Pressman's nails. Maggie sits on the floor next to Peggy's salon chair, fixing the base of a barber chair. She tightens a screw and looks up, satisfied. Cindy's dog is on the floor near Maggie.

During the Ike/Mrs. Pressman exchange, Maggie looks at Ike. There's something familiar about him. She looks over at Peggy and beckons her to a copy of Ike's column affixed to a mirror. A goatee and horns, have been scrawled on Ike's byline picture. He's been "devilized". Peggy coughs as she recognizes Ike in the newspaper clipping.

Maggie indicates column to Peggy. She looks over at the part of the shop used to wash and dye hair. There's a sink, stool and a cabinet affixed to the wall above sink, which holds various shampoos and hair dyes. Maggie gets an idea. Maggie and Peggy step forward toward Ike.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>

	Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash? You know, get all that city grit out of it.

Ike peeks out from under his towel as Maggie continues.

<MAGGIE>

	I'm inside the church. Everyone I know is there, only they're not really them. They're like Frankenstein monsters, but without the bolts coming out of their necks. It's all very "Night of the Living Dead". And here's the creepiest part -- I look down at my dress and it's red. I mean, I have no idea what it means. Red's not my color!

Ike stares at his hair in total confusion. With icy calm, Ike rises from his chair and primps the end of his hair as if giving it the finishing touches. Then he sees his defaced newspaper clipping and all becomes clear. He picks up the article and shows it to everyone. Ike does a slow burn.

Now we see Maggie come down the aisle, then walk past the altar. We see Maggie move away another aisle and out of the church. SHOCKED WEDDING GUESTS rise in horror, as she runs from this first wedding. She drags the train boy up the second aisle as she leaves. Ike hangs up. He gets up to pick up the remote and then sits back down to watch.

We see the Carpenter's backyard. It is Gill and Maggie's wedding day. The yard is crowded with a MIXTURE of Hells Angels-types, Deadheads and townspeople. The "altar" is a band platform against the back fence.

Gill is waiting on the platform with a rock combo playing Grateful Dead-type music. He makes an introductory speech.

Maggie steps out onto the back porch. She's beautiful in a hippie-type wedding ensemble. She walks with her father to a trampoline. We can see her tattoo. She jumps on the trampoline, then dives into the crowd. They watch her and body surf her over their heads to the back fence.

As she hits the stage, she looks at Peggy and Gill, then decides to go. She jumps off the stage and runs up to a passing GUY on a dirt bike. She jumps on and turns and waves as she rides away.

As Maggie rides down the aisle, suddenly the horse whinnies!

Maggie has kicked it in the shins. It rears and bolts, galloping off with the bride. Ike FREEZE FRAMES the tape on an image of Maggie, hair blowing. Although she is panic-stricken, her soul seems to shine through in tat single frame. As Ike stares at her, the smirk fades from his face. He just looks at her, allowing himself to see her expression, her eyes. He can't help it.

Various High School SPORTS TEAMS practice. Maggie strides across the football field, a scowl on her face. A few HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYERS job past Maggie, doing laps. A boy, KENDALL, calls out to her affectionately as she passes. One of them, DENNIS, slows his pace to run alongside Maggie.
</DIRECTION>
<DENNIS>
<DIRECTION>
(playful)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maggie, don't marry Coach! Marry me. I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENNIS>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're jail bait, Dennis. Go away. Run your laps. Go. Go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Dennis runs on as Maggie continues toward her goal: Bob and Ike, standing together on the other side of the field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON BOB AND IKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're both standing on the blocking sled. Wave after wave of VARSITY FOOTBALL PLAYERS ram into the sled and drive it across the field with both Ike and Bob on top of it. Ike is munching on one of the cinnamon rolls as Bob pushes the KIDS.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drive! Drive! From your hips, get low, get low, get low. Next!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<DIRECTION>
Ike smiles broadly atop of the sled as he sees Maggie approaching, looking mighty peeved. He nudges Bob and points to Maggie. Bob lights up at the sight of her.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good job, gentlemen... Special teams.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<DIRECTION>
The football players move away from the sled. Bob moves to Maggie, leaves Ike alone.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (to Maggie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, honey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<DIRECTION>
Bob kisses and embraces Maggie. She doesn't see Ike immediately, then:
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating Ike)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is he up to now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ike just came by to check out the team.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And talk about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<DIRECTION>
Ike grins and shows Maggie the notes in his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just bragging about how great you are. I'm the luckiest man alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<DIRECTION>
Bob grabs Maggie around the waist and smooches her adoringly. Maggie scowls at Ike. He nods, all charm.
</DIRECTION>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- I've got to get moving -- lot of work to do today! I'll see you two love-birds later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<DIRECTION>
Ike leaves. Bob calls after him.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you at the wedding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bet ya, Coach.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<DIRECTION>
Maggie is aghast. She stares at Bob. Ike joins in behind a line of peppy cheerleaders.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At the wedding? You invite him? Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure I do. But the bet defense is a good offense, right? You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't understand this guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let him come to the wedding. You're not running, right? Say it. "I'm not..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(irritably)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not running.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right? All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got news for you. No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Bob gives Maggie a big hug.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's that homemade sunshine?
	</DIALOGUE>

Bob blows his whistle, then puts Maggie on the football sled.

Maggie screams as the boys push her down the football field.

INT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH/CHURCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maggie kneels, hands folded reverently. The booth's grate opens before her.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. My last confession was... ahh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to recall.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Anyway, I have sort of a technical question here. I've been having -- bad thoughts. I mean, really bad thoughts ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of an impure nature?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- like -- I'm having a problem with that whole turn-the-other-cheek concept. I want revenge. I want to destroy this guy's life, career, everything. On the sin scale, how big is that? I mean, can I "Hail Mary" my way out of it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Child, any sin in one's heart is...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(impatient)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The name's Maggie. It wasn't this side of ten years ago that you had your tongue down my throat. So don't call me "child", Brian. It annoys me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<PRIEST_BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now don't get upset.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST_BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Brian closes the confessional window and exits
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(still inside the booth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brian, open up. Don't ignore me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Brian leans into her confessional. She steps out to join him.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not even Catholic, Maggie -- you really shouldn't come to confession.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
He's a nice looking and gentle man. They regard each other for a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I'm just so stressed out about that slime-ball reporter being in town. I jus had to come warn you he might show up here and start asking you all kinds of ridiculous questions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Brian moves away. Maggie follows and sits in a nearby pew.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, he only asked me one ridiculous question. The rest weren't so bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(sliding along the pew)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? You talked to him! Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, yes, I'm sure I only did you good, Maggie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did he ask?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
A woman, MRS. MURPHY, rushes in.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MURPHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father, am I too late?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MURPHY>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<MRS_MURPHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It won't take long. Jus two venials.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MURPHY>
<DIRECTION>
The woman goes into the confessional booth to wait.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only respectful things. What did we have in common back then... What kind of music did you like... Did you ruin my life when you left me standing at the altar...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what did you say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could I be angry at you when clearly what has happened to me is as God intended?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(relieved)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good one! Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It happens to be how I feel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Brian sits next to Maggie.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God... Of course. I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brian -- I've got to go. The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God bless you, Maggie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to rush out, then stops herself.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, wait, my purse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
She moves to the confessional, knocks, then speaks to Mrs. Murphy.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, sorry, forgot my purse. Good luck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Maggie closes the booth curtain and turns to Brian.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait -- what was the ridiculous question he asked?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Brian smiles mischievously.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wanted to know how you used to like your eggs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Weird. Like after all those years you would remem--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to go, then stops in her tracks as she hears:
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Scrambled, with salt, pepper and dill. Same as me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Maggie looks at Brian. Suddenly, she remembers too.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(tenderly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be. But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
And she scampers out. Brian goes back into the confessional.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GILL'S GARAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maggie drives up to an old brick firehouse that is now an auto garage. The faded sign reads: "Gill's Garage".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GILL'S GARAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maggie rushes inside and looks around. No one is in sight. Several cars, including a yellow jeep-like car up on a hydraulic lift, are in the funky garage.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gill? Lydia? Gill?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
A CRASH, coming from the nearby back room, we hear loud muttering in Spanish, then out stumbles GILL CHAVEZ, 34, wearing a grease- stained Grateful Dead tie-dyed T-shirt. He grins triumphantly, worshipfully cradling a CASSETTE TAPE in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<GILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey -- I found it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILL>
<DIRECTION>
Maggie regards her former fiance with patient warmth.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Found what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Gill looks up and gives Maggie a fond, hazy smile.
</DIRECTION>
<GILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mags! Hey, look -- The tape from the Radio City Music Hall concert -- Remember that night I as trying to get Jerry to let me sit in on "Ripple"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILL>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls out the cassette from its case. It's broken. The tape is dangling from the cassette.
</DIRECTION>
<GILL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (disappointed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'll play it for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILL>
<DIRECTION>
Gill picks up an electric GUITAR and starts to play.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(shouts over the music)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Gill -- There's this reporter who's ben making my life a living hell ... If he comes by here, don't talk to him. And whatever yo do....
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(crosses to Gill)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Don't show him that picture of me at the concert in San Francisco --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a loud CHUCKLING emanates from the car overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Maggie stops Gill from playing. She shoots her ex an angry glare and moves a lever on the shop wall. With a HUM, the car descends.
</DIRECTION>
<GILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We went to San Francisco twice. Remember one time we had a flat tire... Which picture?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILL>
<DIRECTION>
As the hydraulic lift slows, the car is lowered, revealing Ike sitting in the driver's seat. He has been enjoying the photograph he's holding.
</DIRECTION>
<IKE>
<DIRECTION>
(feigning shock)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Imagine! Maggie Carpenter topless in a public arena.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(checks photo again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I see there was a chill in the air.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<DIRECTION>
Maggie swipes for the photo, but Ike is faster at pulling it away.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<DIRECTION>
Gill takes off his guitar and sets it down.
</DIRECTION>
<GILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ike bet me fifty bucks you don't still have it, Mags. I said "You're on, man! Maggie loved that thing!" And I could really use fifty bucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILL>
<DIRECTION>
Maggie is conspicuously silent.
</DIRECTION>
<GILL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (looking worried)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mags?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILL>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not gonna show you guys anything. I am a soon-to-be-married woman. Now give me that photograph.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Maggie seethes.
</DIRECTION>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, I would love to give this to you. Just give us one quick gander at that rose, and, I'll gladly hand it over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to grab the photo again. Ike pulls it away.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. Here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Maggie quickly turns around and pulls down the back of her shirt, revealing the top of her back and a pristine expanse of skin. No tattoo.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (turning back around)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Satisfied?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Completely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<DIRECTION>
Gill is still trying to grasp the meaning of this.
</DIRECTION>
<GILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maggie? You got it removed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILL>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gill, I'll go ya double or nothing if was a stick-on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<GILL>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Maggie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILL>
<MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(admitting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm really, really afraid of needles... It doesn't make me a bad person.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ike laughs. Maggie looks at him with rage. Gill dramatically pulls down the front of his t-shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<GILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILL>
<DIRECTION>
There it is on Gill's chest: the rose tattoo. Maggie sighs, pained. Gill shows it to Ike. Ike looks at the tattoo. He shakes his head at Maggie.
</DIRECTION>
<IKE>
<DIRECTION>
(sincerely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, look, man. I think the man is heartbroken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is not!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Maggie moves the lever on the wall again, sending Ike back up to the ceiling in the car. She grabs the photo from Ike and exits.
</DIRECTION>
<GILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILL>
<DIRECTION>
Gill grabs his guitar and sits.
</DIRECTION>
<GILL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Ike, what would Jerry do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILL>
<DIRECTION>
The hydraulic lift stops moving. Ike leans out.
</DIRECTION>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jerry. He'd play. He'd play... Jerry would play his heart out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<DIRECTION>
Ike sings and taps along in tempo on the side of the car as Gill sings and plays "Ripple".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOTEL PORCH - NEXT DAY, SATURDAY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Maggie drives into town with Peggy, they see Ike on porch with SHERIFF, POLICE CHIEF and MAIL MAN, all playing instruments as a blues band. Ike is not bad on slide guitar. They all like Ike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maggie "CHUFFAS" with Peggy and moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - LATER THAT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The slow, loopy pitch of a softball. A bat connects.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A big wholesome man, CORY, runs for first base. He just beats out the throw. Bob, acting as umpire, yells, "Safe!" Happy, Cory turns to the stands and waves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maggie and Peggy, cheering loudly. Peggy tries to whoop harder than Maggie, but that would be tough. From firs base, Cory waves back to them. The two women sit back down and Maggie takes back up with their conversation. Maggie is still al steamed up.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, he's on base. Can we talk about my life now? -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah. He's totally out to get me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<PEGGY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what reason? Some personal satisfaction?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEGGY>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<PEGGY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's probably because you got him fired.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEGGY>
<MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(sarcastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ya think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<PEGGY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look! Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEGGY>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cory as he runs for second base and with a slide beats the throw for the force out. The women jump and cheer -- Maggie, again, the most boisterous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dennis recognizes Ike as he walks up. Dennis tells Ike that he is going to marry Maggie some day and shows Ike where Maggie is sitting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maggie spots Ike as they sit back down. She groans.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There he is. Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<PEGGY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEGGY>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Over there. Ten o'clock. He's talking to our little Dennis. Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<PEGGY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He looks better with that stuff out of his hair. He's an attractive man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEGGY>
<DIRECTION>
Ike finds Maggie in the crowd and leaves Dennis.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd say you've been in the sun too long. You handle him, okay? I could use five minutes off from that creep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Before Peggy can protest, Maggie climbs down off the bleachers and goes and stands near the dugout near the rest of Cory's team.
</DIRECTION>
<PEGGY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, that's fine. I can do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEGGY>
<DIRECTION>
Ike comes up to Peggy.
</DIRECTION>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Peggy Phleming, "not the ice-skater".
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<DIRECTION>
Ike indicates the seat next to Peggy.

<PEGGY>
<DIRECTION>
(protesting weakly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Maggie's seat...

</PEGGY>
<DIRECTION>
Ike sits down comfortably.
</DIRECTION>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... And this is Maggie's beer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<DIRECTION>
He starts drinking it. ON THE FIELD, Cory is getting ready to steal third.
</DIRECTION>
<IKE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That your husband out there? Cory Phleming, a local radio announcer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<PEGGY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEGGY>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not yet. I had a phlemless morning. I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<PEGGY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEGGY>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That must have made you proud.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<DIRECTION>
Peggy takes a small sip off her soda.
</DIRECTION>
<PEGGY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was going with Maggie back then.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was never one of her... I mean, they were never going to get... They just dated for a while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEGGY>
<DIRECTION>
Cory dives in for third and makes it. The crowd goes wild. Peggy yells and jumps in.
</DIRECTION>
<PEGGY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good job, honey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEGGY>
<DIRECTION>
But Maggie's whoop sails out above it all. Cory waves. But not at Peggy. He directs his delight at Maggie, who jumps up and down by the dugout.

Ike looks between Cory, Maggie and finally, Peggy. Peggy jerks her waving hand back down to her side and sits down. Ike pretends not to have noticed. The two watch as Maggie and Cory smile at each other.

<DIRECTION>
Next BATTER hits one to deep left field and it lands in the grave yard. Cory scores, greeted by Maggie. Ike and Peggy watch as Cory and Maggie belly-bump and high-five each other in celebration of Cory's play. No looks at Peggy. Ike keeps an empathetic silence, seeing that Peggy is truly hurt.

Suddenly, Peggy stands, pushes past him and runs down the steps. Maggie looks up just in time to catch Peggy's exit. Ike pulls his tape recorder out of his pocket and starts speaking into it.

Maggie shoots Ike an accusing look, walks up to him in the bleachers and sits next to him.

	You misinterpret everything. We've all been friends our whole lives. But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.

	Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it. The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.

Maggie lets herself in the modest room and turns on the lights on. She spots on audio cassette on the desk near the door. She holds the cassette up to the light to read the hand-written label. It says "Miles Davis" on it. She pockets the tape. She walks to the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAGGIE'S POV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ike has placed post-its on a framed picture, using the frame as a bulletin board. Post-it notes lay out the information he has gathered under headings and subheadings. Parents "Mother" deceased, subheaded by "Walter" and there is one for "Brian", "Gill", and "Bob". Maggie smiles and shakes her head. She rips one post-it down and reads it to herself.
</DIRECTION>

THE SOUND OF A KEY IN THE DOOR makes Maggie jump. She flees to the bathroom, and shuts and locks the door. Just as Ike enters, he sniffs and looks around the room, instantly knowing something is up. He sees all his notes gone and a glimpse of Maggie as she closes the bathroom door. Ike is steaming. A BUMP sounds from the bathroom. He goes over to the door and tries the handle. It's locked. He starts to pound on the door.
</DIRECTION>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, I know you're in there... You steal my research... You're messing with the first amendment now. Open up. Open up. You got no place to go.

Ike's wrong. Maggie is already trying to open the first bathroom window. It's stuck. She climbs over the bathtub, opens that window and starts to climb out.
</DIRECTION>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to have a very serious discussion with you as to why you're such a pain in the ass.

CLOSE ON: A CASSETTE PLAYER. We see the familiar handwritten label: "Miles Davis." "Kind of Blue" plays as Maggie listens in a chair, looking shell-shocked, surrounded by the post-its she stole from Ike's room. We see as she reads them: "Father, two- fisted drinker," "Peggy, best friend, but Peggy doesn't totally trust Maggie," "Bob" -- doesn't love him. Overwhelmed, she finishes reading the last note, leans back, puts her feet up on the table, deep in the mood of the melancholy music.

The CAMERA MOVES on the last note on the floor next to her chair. It reads: "SHOWS NO REMORSE".

Peggy moves to the salon mirror near Maggie with her cup of coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<PEGGY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.

	On anything male that moves? As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you". Very hard to compete with. Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.

	But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!

	Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up. Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.

Maggie looks ready to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<PEGGY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up. But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids. And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.

Maggie hands it to him.

Ike puts a shirt on as Maggie speaks.

	My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong. That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either. So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.

	So? Is that what you said to her?

	No. I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know. What do you think?"

Ike and Maggie drive in Maggie's truck. They pull up in front of a Bridal Shop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A spectacular dress fills the small window. It's beautiful, romantic, sexy. Maggie and Ike can be seen in the reflection.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.

INT. BRIDAL SHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is fairly large and prosperous, probably the place to go in the Tri-County area. A little FLOWER GIRL, 10, is being fitted on the pedestal in the middle of the room. A saleswoman, POLLY, has taken the flower girl under her wing. They are both under the expert eyes of a stern looking woman, MRS. WHITTENMEYER, the shop owner. Also, the girl's MOTHER is there watching.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	POLLY

</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
The flower girl sees Maggie and runs and hides behind Polly.
</DIRECTION>
<POLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Maggie. You'll have to excuse her, Maggie. Some of the children are afraid of you since you dragged that little boy up the aisle.

Maggie leads her to the front window.

<MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(happily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, I would like to get this dress.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>

She points to the dress. She smiles back to Mrs. Whittenmeyer, expecting her to share her joy. Mrs. Whittenmeyer darkens.

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The other one is only three hundred dollars.

</MRS_WHITTENMEYER>
<DIRECTION>
Maggie lowers her voice, hoping to lessen the humiliation of the moment.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this dress for sale?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<MRS_WHITTENMEYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It just seems like an awful lot of money to spend on one of your dresses, Maggie... You only wear them for about ten minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_WHITTENMEYER>
<DIRECTION>
Ike watches with regret as Maggie's child-like enthusiasm drains away, her happy mood crushed by the tactless assault of the shop owner. He's starting to see that it's no always easy being Maggie. There's a tremor in her voice.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that's a good point.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then, sitting)
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
She walks over to him.

<MRS_WHITTENMEYER>

(huffy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I've been here for thirty years.

<MRS_WHITTENMEYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a thousand dollars!

	Look, Aunt Bea, we're buying this beautiful dress and anything else she wants or I'm coming back here with a squirt gun filled with India ink.

<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Whittenmeyer wilts under Ike's fierce gaze. She turns to Maggie.

<MRS_WHITTENMEYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will he really do that?

Maggie gives her a look.

Ike sits as he hears Maggie's voice behind him.

<MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ike turns around. Maggie is standing on the pedestal, wearing the dress and looking unbelievably gorgeous. She is overwhelming to behold and Ike has to struggle to keep his face under control.
</DIRECTION>
<IKE>
<DIRECTION>
(stammering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look... uh... You look fine.

	Bob! I almost forgot! I have to meet Bob!

</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a great place -- a major hub of social life in Hale. The food is greasy and good, Mrs. Pressman is the waitress, and the CROWD the essence of what is wonderful about a small town. Bob, Maggie and Ike sit on the counter. Mrs. Pressman CHUFFS about the luau, then moves around the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Pressman, I think we're ready to order.

	What was that? I can't order my eggs without sarcasm?

</MAGGIE>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neutral corners you two. You're on the same team now. Any more fighting and it's fifteen minutes in the penalty box.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gently, to Ike)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maggie's the nicest person you'll ever meet. But she's always focusing out there. She's got to start focusing more in here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(taps his chest)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why she's had some -- whatever you want to call it -- problems in the past.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Maggie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what we're working on -- focus. Right, Maggie? Focus on Maggie. Focus on Bob.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<DIRECTION>
As Bob has been talking, Ike has been watching Maggie's face. The joy seems to have drained out of her.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>

Before Maggie can finish, Ike intercepts her.

INT. ATLANTIC HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDMA_JULIA>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to explain about the weddings. There are reasons why they didn't come off. Three weddings, no "I do's". You can't believe how much cake we were left with. I should weigh three hundred pounds. I don't think her father minded spending so much money on booze that nobody drank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDMA_JULIA>
<DIRECTION>
We hear Grandma as through the hotel doors, we see Maggie exit the diner. She gets a bag from inside the cab of her truck and comes inside the hotel where she finds Ike talking to Grandma, who is having tea with her friend, NETTA.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ike... Hi, Grandma.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<GRANDMA_JULIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right, cover your ears, Netta. It's not that she's afraid of the wedding, she's afraid of the wedding night. Innocent girls are terrified of "the one-eyed snake".
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(getting into it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, when I was a virgin bride, I took a knitting needle with me into the bed...

Ike winces.

<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, Grandma, I charmed the one- eyed snake awhile ago.

	Oh, yeah, I forgot. I'll tell you one thing, your grandpa didn't forget that wedding night.

<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I found this and didn't know if it was something interesting.

Maggie hands Ike a 30-year-old LP: Miles Davis' "Kind of Blue."
</DIRECTION>
<IKE>
<DIRECTION>
(excited)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis. This is "King of Blue"! This is the original recording. Hard to find in good condition. Where did you find this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
(casual)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was in the attic. It was jus sitting there gathering dust.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's valuable. Hang onto it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You take it.

</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
She steps outside, leaving Ike with the record.
</DIRECTION>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- I'm cleaning an attic. I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and walks back to the diner where Mrs. Pressman is outside watering plants. Ike looks after Maggie and then back down at the record in his hand. Somehow it makes him sad.

Ike drives through Hale gobbling french fries from the fast food bag in his lap. Ike passes THE INN HALE BAR, same dump of a tavern he talked to bartender at.

<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. THE INN HALE BAR -- DAY
</DIRECTION>

Ike approaches the window of the bar. There's a DRUNK MAN and a DOG sitting outside. Inside, we see two figures from the back, arms around each other. One is definitely Maggie. The other is definitely not Bob.

<MAGGIE>

(coaxing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon. Let's go.

	I haven't had any fun since you got your driver's license...

EXT. IKE'S CAR - COUNTRY ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Ike and Maggie stare forward. Both seem in melancholy moods. They're beginning to sense they're in trouble here. Suddenly, the car falters and jerks. It shows to a stop on the shoulder of the road. The car backfires and smokes.

<DIRECTION>
MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maggie leads Ike through a cornfield.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think there's only one right person for everybody?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ike chooses his words carefully.
</DIRECTION>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading. And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes it is. And it doesn't mean anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ike nods as they come to a wooden fence. She puts her hand on his shoulder. Ike puts his hands around her waits to give her a boost over the top. We see the flicker of misunderstanding cross Maggie's face at the initial contact. Neither of them moves -- forward or back, but the electricity is obvious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON: Ike. His conflicted feelings are apparent. With difficulty, Maggie straightens up and they both quickly remove their hands.

INTERCUT BETWEEN TWO LOCATIONS:

<DIRECTION>
Ike sits on his bed, on the phone, working and eating his breakfast. He's watching Maggie's wedding tape again. Fisher is cooking an elaborate breakfast. Ellie rushes around getting ready for work. He is on the phone to Ike.
</DIRECTION>
<FISHER>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FISHER>
<IKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>

The bar from the opening scene. GEORGE SWILLING, the same man Ike talked to before, is sitting on a stool, nursing his drink. He looks better. Ike enters. George looks up and recognizes Ike, who takes the bar stool next to him.

	Ah, can't stay away from her, can you? Like a moth to a flame.

</ELLIE>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... They're interesting guys. Each one of these guys has something going for him. I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest. One's a pretty good guitar player. And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...

Fisher doesn't like the sound of this. He glances at Ellie, who is looking very interested.

We hear Hawaiian music. We see a truck with GUESTS drive up and HULA DANCERS through barn slats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TROUT'S BARN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a small barn that's been converted into a luau with a bar. A BAND plays for two hula dancers. The Trouts had decorated it as a little slice of Hawaii. There are tiki lights, numerous rented plastic palm trees and fiberglass copies of Hawaiian statuary. Strings of colored lights crisscross the ceiling. It looks like a Hawaiian high school gym on prom night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maggie's family, Mrs. Trout and people we've already met, and more, are here, milling around wit tropical drinks garnished with umbrellas. Plastic leis abound and most people have managed to find their old Hawaiian shirts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we come in, the hula dancers finish their applause and Mrs. Trout announces. Hula dancers stop.

The couple enters. Bob is a goody bronzed god in his King Kamahamela outfit. Maggie is spectacular in her authentic looking Hawaiian Princess get-up. But her face reflects none of the festivities around her. Every now and then, she looks up and glances around for Ike, hating herself for it.

Ike watches their reaction. The silence is deafening. All the guests stare at Maggie. Mortified, she holds back tears.

	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had it under control. Now they feel sorry for me.

	Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Every one of those times I was being supportive. Something you won't understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Supportive? You weren't being supportive. You were being scared. Just like now. You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lost!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With the priest, you liked them scrambled. With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached. Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's called changing your mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that's called not having a mind of your own. What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon? You don't want to climb Annapuma.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes I do!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No you don't. You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem. You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say. Am I right?

He's laid her flat. Maggie can't speak.

</IKE>
<DIRECTION>
She fights back angry tears.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop. Stop it! I'm getting married on Sunday, and you're just trying to make me run! Why? Because you're a cynical, exploitative, mean-hearted creep who wouldn't know real love if it bit him in the armpit! And all you do is tear other people down and-and-and laugh at them, and criticize what they do, because you're too afraid to do anything yourself! I read your column. You never wrote one about you. I'm not the only one who's lost and you know it! Am I right? Well? Am I right?

IKE'SPOV: There are most of the TOWNSPEOPLE we've come to know, plus some NEW YORKERS for Ike, with little ponytails. Armani wire rims, Donna Karan bodysuits. There's a lot of smirking, checking out the hicks, forming their stories for cocktail hour. Elaine is in back all dressed in black, mourning Ike. Mrs. Trout approaches Ike.

Dennis closes the door behind him as he goes back into the chapel. Maggie has a moment alone. She looks at back door as possible escape route, then changes her mind. She signals the start of the wedding by knocking on the door.

INT. CHAPEL - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Immediately, Cory and Dennis open the doors for her entrance. All the guests stand as Maggie enter the chapel smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAGGIE'S POV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The aisle stretches before her into infinity. Faces goggle at her from every direction. The tiny figure of Ike stands like a beacon a long way off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She plunges forward with a sped-up hesitation step.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ike rocks imperceptibly, urging her on. Peggy and Cindy make little "come on" motions. It seems to be working. Maggie approaches rapidly. The CROWD has turned from skepticism to looks and noises of encouragement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON: MAGGIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But then her feet gradually begin to slow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fisher gives a little "darn, so close" look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Ike is too busy maintaining eye contact. His eyes urge Maggie closer -- loving her, willing her on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maggie stops her walk, gives Ike a teasing smile, and then resumes with her walk toward him. His face. Her face. His face. Her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her foot inches forward. The other follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sigh now rises from the GUESTS as Maggie closes in on Ike. He smiles at her. She smiles at him. She is almost there... She's there, smiling at Ike. The Pastor gestures to the guests to sit down. They do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ike sneezes. She looks down and imagines she sees the carpet splitting apart. And she bolts like a bat out of hell! In a flurry of white, she is halfway down the aisle before Ike knows what hits him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ike stands there dazed. For a second. Then she springs into action, charging after her.
</DIRECTION>
<IKE>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Block the doors!
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<DIRECTION>
Like a general, he points to Dennis and Cory in the back and sends them into action. The doors shut in Maggie's face. But she's a wild animal cornered. She moves to the side. The TOWNSPEOPLE stand so Ike can hurry through the pew. Ike climbs on the pews towards her as GUEST crowd the aisle, blocking his path. Like a gazelle, she leaps to the side aisle and scampers down and away. Fisher gets on his cell phone. Ike charges from one of the full pews, crosses the aisle and leaps across the pews near the staircase to cut her off. He grabs her veil and it comes off in his hands. Maggie disappears down the steps of the church basement. Ike fumble with the veil and jumps over the railing, landing on Dennis' toe. He follows down the stairs after her. Mrs. Pressman and Walter exchange bet money.

Maggie looks back once, tearful and regretful, and disappears inside the truck. The truck races off.

The PHOTOGRAPHERS turn their cameras on Ike, en masse. He is enveloped by a barrage of bright lights.

As the truck rounds the bend in the road and disappears, Ike stops and stares alone after the disappearing truck. A swarm of REPORTERS catch up to him, flashing pictures and asking questions. Another camera flashes and we cut to:

</WALTER>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid. I don't like it. Stop. You may not like having a daughter with problems. But guess what? I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time. I'll eat in my room.

</MAGGIE>

Maggie takes a plate and exits.

(after sitting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does it matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think so... When I was walking down the aisle? I was walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was. And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted. So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGGIE>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I did.

</DIRECTION>
<MAGGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand why you bring up the truck. Let me explain something. The fact is, you've seen me at my worst, most embarrassing, deviously plotting, potentially but not certifiably, psychotic state. And if you liked me then, I mean, now... I can't imagine...

Slowly, we see the twenty people come over the crest of the hill. They are all Maggie's family and friends, plus the old grooms. They are all paired in twos, like a love Noah's ark. We see others get the news.
