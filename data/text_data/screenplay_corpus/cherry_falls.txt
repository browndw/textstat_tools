A teenage boy's hand is under a teenage girl's shirt, gently massaging her breast. He pulls his hand out from under her shirt and places it on her bare knee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he starts to slide his hand up her leg, she grabs his hand and gently pulls it away. She places it back on her breast, sliding it under her shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We pull back. STACY and ROD, two healthy sixteen year olds, are passionately making out in the proverbial back seat of a big American car.
</DIRECTION>

Rod smiles seductively, kisses Stacy, and places his hand back on her knee. Once again, she stops him, this time just squeezing his hand tightly.

She hears the footsteps behind her and quickly turns around. She sees the silhouette of someone standing a few feet away.

EXT. SCHOOL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kids arrive at School. Everyone is freaked. The word spreads fast about Jody's attack. Many of the kids, like Sandy, have worn a little extra make-up or a little tighter jeans. There's a sexual electricity everywhere mixed in with a lot of fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The normal tribes are disbanding. What are forming in their place are sexual tribes. Today, at the high school, sexual history bands kids together. Not aesthetics, popularity, or wealth. Punkers chat with nerds, cheerleaders with potheads.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL

As Jody approaches the high school, she's still on the edge, given the attack of the night before as well as he dad's reaction to the picture. She hears a moan coming from behind some bushes. She stops and notices a Girl's shoe sticking out from under the bush. Worried it might be someone badly hurt, she cautiously starts toward it. Suddenly a couple of more feet pop out. Jody jumps back, frightened, but then realizes that it's just a couple of her classmates having sex in the bushes.

	People thought these guys had a right to rape her because she called them 'queers'?

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leonard starts to cut an 'I' next to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jody's face grimaces in pain. Blood drips to the ground. Her leg starts to shake.

	My mother said, after you and your three droogs raped her Brent, that people in town refused to let her use their bathrooms. Is that true? Did people really call her a slut and tell her 'you can't shit here'? She used to snarl that at me. That's all she really did, at least in my direction, was snarl.

<DIRECTION>
His girlfriend screams as Jimmy falls to the ground, dying.

INT. BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>

One kid does a back flip through a glass coffee table, exploding it, sending a shard of glass out his throat. Blood sprays across the ceiling like a lawn sprinkler.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the sea of legs, Leonard sees Jody's leg, the 'VIR' still freshly carved. He slashes his way towards Jody.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Half naked kids come streaming out of the house, it's a bizarre sight. Some of them stop and scream, noticing the deputy (his body has been hung upside down from a telephone pole, and disemboweled). The house is almost bursting as kids climb out the windows and appear from the back.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kids tumble on top of each other falling to the floor below as the staircase splinters. Hurt kids are everywhere as more and more get pushed over the edge. It's a disaster. Broken boned teenagers litter the floor like it were a battlefield.

Leonard stares at Jody for a moment, relaxing his grip, giving Kenny just the break he needs to dive for Leonard's arm, surprising him, knocking him over.
