He moves from the outer lobby into a fabulously decorated ballroom where a fashion show is taking place as a medical fundraiser. Doctors and their spouses, hospital brass and sponsors mingle. Women sit near the runway watching the models. Men talk by the bar. The room is packed.
</DIRECTION>

A banner over the rostrum says: "CHILDREN'S RESEARCH AND AID FOUNDATION"

ANGLE - KIMBLE'S TABLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A table for ten. Kimble and Helen introduce themselves to others at table ant sit across from each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimble sits between two doctors' wives. One, NOW EAU WIFE, mid-thirties, bedecked in jewels and loud dress, the other OLDER WIFE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen sits between their husbands who are trying to impress her with the details of their boring studies as CREDITS CONTINUE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUTTING WITH the fashion, catches of dialog and course changes, Kimble and Helen demonstrate an oft-used exchange of glances: Kimble, while gracious to his dinner partners, catches Helen's eye and makes smiling, subtle movements to his watch or a look to the door to indicate he's clearly ready to leave. On the receiving end, Helen, the gatekeeper of their social propriety, indicates with equal subtlety: "not yet."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we MOVE AROUND the table we hear:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Where's your husband on staff?" "My husband's an orthopod at Northwestern." "I'm working on a new technique..." "That's fascinating..." "That's quite a marvelous dress you're wearing." "Do you like it? My husband says it's a 'four-fracture number."' "Honey." (A look from her husband.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimble shares a look with Helen. He subtly motions to his watch: time go to, and mouths the word: "now." She shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<NOW_EAU_WIFE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>

Helen and Kimble absorb this comment without reaction, share a look. Helen mouths the word: "Now."

(to her dinner partners)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, I have to get my husband home.
	</DIALOGUE>

</HELEN>
<KIMBLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you...

He smiles to himself, seems to enjoy the compliment too much for Helen. Her smile becomes playful, mischievous.

	Uh, huh... most men in a tuxedo look like waiters...

Opens the door to large closet dressing room and turns on the light. Nothing. She starts to leave and decides to close one of the interior closet doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to slide the door closed when - wham!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hand reaches out and clutches her by the neck. Helen claws and scratches to get free and in her struggle her string of pearls bursts...

<DIRECTION>
UPSTAIRS HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimble moves slowly to the opened doorway. And just before he enters he sees a large form in the crack behind the door. Adrenal surge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimble slams the door back on the figure knocking the gun free. Before Kimble can move to it a forearm flattens him. The attacker immediately goes for the gun. Kimble grabs a leg and twists him down, the man's fingers hit the gun, sending it skittering across the hardwood floor of the landing and over the edge - three flights to the entry hall below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIRENS can be heard. Distant but APPROACHING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man kicks free and tries to flee. This time Kimble catches an arm and twists it at an unnatural angle. To his shock, the limb detaches between the shoulder and elbow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimble looks at the arm in his hands - it's hollow. Electrodes are visible inside - then to the man's unreadable face...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SIRENS are LOUDER...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before Kimble can recover, the One-Armed Man knocks Kimble down and grabs back his arm. He runs down the stairs.

PRISONER #3, a big man named COPELAND, wags his head between his knees. Something slides out of his shirt and CLANKS to the dimpled steel floor. It's a razor sharp plastic shank.

The train burrows to a stop.

Kimble is suddenly five feet taller, standing on an upheaval of earth, staring eyeball-to-eyeball with the train that nearly devoured him. He pants. Coughs on smoke. Then notices something in his hand.

<DIRECTION>
BIGGS. Swaggering Midwestern carnivore. Built like a brick shithouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENFRO. Bantam-rooster of a man, no more than 140 pounds fully-equipped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POOLE. Black woman. Nobody minds having her around during nut-cuttin' time.

NEWMAN, a scrub-faced G-5.

As a group they begin moving along the service road above the crash site. Derailed train cars are accortianed below them. They take in the elements of the crash and as they walk each begins to reveal their U.S. Marshal's credentials.

</TROOPER>
<DIRECTION>
Gerard follows his point to where TV lights illuminate the scene. He shakes his head - it doesn't please him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Renfro and Poole share a look, they seem to know what's about to happen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - OLD GUARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seated near a tree. A space blanket draped over his shoulders. He is surrounded by EMT personnel, and a YOUNG SHERIFF, clearly basking in the event. Television remote news crews are kept only slight back. Gerard appears in the b.g., listening.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... train was bearin' down on us, fast. I don't know how - it's still kind of hazy - but I grabbed him and pushed him out of the bus.

<DIRECTION>
The television lights widen to illuminate Gerard. He shields his eyes. The Sheriff opens a file and produces fax-photos of all four prisoners.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF>
<DIRECTION>
(to Old Guard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the record. These three dead. And this one...

He switches to a photo of Kimble.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh-uh. Don't think he made it.

Sheriff eyes the wreckage that could entomb a hundred prisoners, then files Kimble's fax-photo with the others.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You get some rest.

</SHERIFF>
<DIRECTION>
He pats the Guard on the shoulder and approaches Gerard.

Gerard finally touches eyeballs with the young Sheriff and we get our first taste of Gerard at close range.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut it down. Wyatt Earp is here to mop up for us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF>
<DIRECTION>
He slaps the file of fax-photos at Gerard on his way out. Just as Biggs, spotless, eases ino the group with Kimble's manacles. Behind Biggs we see Newman, covered in mud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing the leg irons, the Sheriff and his deputies pile to a stop. Now Gerard takes his run at Old Guard.
</DIRECTION>
<GERARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, ladies and gentlemen, step back and give this poor man some room.

</GERARD>
<DIRECTION>
Like an obedient dog the press backs off, they sense a change of story and command.

Gerard kneels down with Poole and Renfro in front of the Old Guard. The Sheriff hovers near.

<GERARD>

Gerard's large hand extends palm up at the Old Guard.

The Old Guard pats his pockets, comes up empty. He eyes the press hovering just out of earshot.

<GERARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Second chance.

Poole reopens the file of photos in front of the man.

He stops and looks into the TV lights and starts moving downtrack. The media and State Police move with him like Israelites behind Moses.

<GERARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and gentlemen... our fugitive's been on the run for ninety minutes. Average foot speed over uneven ground - barring injury is approximately four miles an hour, giving us a radius of six miles.

EXT. TRACKS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimble moves down train tracks. His jumpsuit is wet with blood from the gash. He pauses and checks the wound. He's going to need stitches.

Far down the tracks he sees glow of town lights. He keeps moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRESTLE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>

Kimble crosses a tressel, keeps running toward the direction of the lights.

A junk yard by railroad tracks and a road. Signs along the road show we're on the edge of town. One says: Hospital-1/2 mile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - TRACKS AND STREAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimble runs from a streak up to the railroad tracks. As he nears the junk yard and road he sees the hospital sign. He's close but he can't go into the hospital in his prison jumpsuit. He leans against a wrecked car and catches his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then a tow truck pulling a car on its hook, turns off the road and parks next to the tracks. Kimble ducks for cover behind the wrecked car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driver climbs out, dumps his coveralls in the front seat and closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves toward a house across the tracks, then forgets something and returns to the cab. He throws open the door and grabs lunch box off the seat - and we notice the coveralls missing from the seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the driver returns to the house we MOVE TO the opposite side of the car to find Kimble, ducked beneath the window, clutching the coveralls.

Weapons drawn, but held discreetly at their sides, three silhouettes enter. Drivers who hadn't heeded the Troopers' P.A. warnings take one look at Gerard and quickly climb back inside and lock their doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Biggs, Renfro and Poole fan out to the sides and give the middle to Gerard. The tunnel is quickly quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimble huddles at mid-tunnel. He's trapped. Drops to the ground beneath the truck. His heart pounding, brain clicking, fighting panic. Suddenly he realizes he's in water.

Running water.

INT. STORM DRAIN - FORKING CONDUIT - DAY

Kimble splashes blindly through ankle-deep sluice. He slows at forking tunnels to catch his breath and pick a direction. A DULL ROAR comes from somewhere - from everywhere. He whips off his jacket and slings it down a tunnel, then continues straight ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somewhere behind, lights probe splash-patterns on the conduit wall - telltale signs of Kimble's passing. The lights belong to...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scrabbling for purchase, he finally snags An overhead pipe. Gerard stabilizes. Sweeps his light to locate his Glock, lying down-tunnel. He eases toward it. But another hand gets there first.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Kimble. Face dark and desperate. Dangerous. Hand flexing on the pistol. They lock eyes for a beat.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KIMBLE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Water pours from the tunnel into the spillway of Barkley dam disappearing into a veil of mist below - a great cauldron of mists. No rocks. None visible at least.

A dishwasher buses a tub of dishes back to the kitchen. He stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A farmer sitting at a table stares at Kimble, Kimble looks away. A man at the pay phone seems to be staring at him. Is he calling the police? Everyone seems to be looking at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Someone stops in front of him. A young waitress serves him his soup. Where's the first waitress?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Takes a few sips of soup. Out of the corner of his eye he sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Older Waitress putting on her coat to leave. Is she going to report him? He fights the paranoia.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A NEWS REPORT on the TELEVISION gets his attention.

EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimble running down the road. Fields stretch out on both sides of the highway. Open land. From behind him we suddenly hear the sound of POLICE SIRENS. For a moment Kimble moves faster, then as the SIRENS COME CLOSER, his sprint drops to a jog... to a walk, until finally he stops and waits for the inevitable... But the flashing lights suddenly rip past him chasing a speeder. They weren't after him after all. Kimble looks at himself. He's shaking.

A moment later he is lit by headlights. A car pulls up next to him, passenger window rolls down...

It's empty. Gerard appears at the other (hallway) door to the bedroom.

HALLWAY

Gerard motions Newman on to the door to the bathroom and continues down the hall into the back bedroom where the woman continues SCREAMING. He ignores her. His feet move silently, heel-to-toe. He checks the bathroom as Newman opens his connecting door - empty - then moves on toward the doorway to the kitchen.

Gerard moves to the kitchen doorway. Running out of house. He braces himself swings into the kitchen - it too is empty. Suddenly Gerard gets the bad feeling he's passed his prey.

A shoe hits the floor. Copeland realizes his mistake too late. He turns back to the hallway and there is Gerard.

He never blinks. FIRES once killing Copeland instantly. The knife falls to the floor. Newman clutches his head, stunned but unhurt.

INT. KIMBLE'S BASEMENT ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Afternoon light comes in Kimble's basement windows. Sheets of Prosthetic Clinic patient material are spread over Kimble's bed, floor. Kimble searches through the documents, making notes. He studies photos of attachments. Cable attachments. Joints. Electronics. Pins. straps... looking for a key to the identity of the one-armed man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally he stops. He finds the flyer in his pocket, puts it on the bedside table and moves to sink. He wets a towel and covers his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Draws a cool damp breath. Lays back on bed amid the Prosthetic Clinic material.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK - FIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimble pulls the arm. It separates in the one-armed man's sleeve. Wrenches. Dis-articulates.

FLASHBACK - ONE-ARMED MAN

Reacts in pain. Again. (NOTE: We sense Kimble's mind returning to something. Getting closer to the key...)

Escaping the bedroom. We hear his FOOTSTEPS DOWN the STAIRS... a DOOR SLAM. FOOTSTEPS again.

He starts to open it but through the dirty window, he sees the back courtyard covered by more cops.

Kimble moves back toward the front. Unsure of his next move, he's sweating, preparing for the worst.
</DIRECTION>

He watches the TAC team charge the house but instead of charging through the basement door they move up the front steps and into the house overhead.

Overhead he hears the SCREAMING from the arresting cops.

Kimble descending. Doors open and close throughout the stairwell but the traffic is light...

INTERCUT WITH:

<DIRECTION>
GERARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Climbing the stairs. He reaches a landing - and skims shoulders with Kimble, who pivots past on his way down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amazingly, neither man reacts. Not yet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One flight above, Gerard's subconscious taps him on the shoulder and brings him to a dead stop. He leans over the stairwell railing to spy...
</DIRECTION>

Kimble spiraling downward. From this vantage, it could be any dark-haired man. But still...

People stop in confusion. Automatically, the exit doors begin closing. Biggs pushes his way off the elevator. Kimble breaks into a sprint for the door.

GERARD

<DIRECTION>
Bursts out the stairwell door after Kimble.

</GERARD>
<DIRECTION>
But there's only one way of stopping Kimble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KIMBLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enters the revolving doors as a big man enters from the outside. The big man sizes up the situation, realizes Kimble is fleeing and just before Kimble exits - yanks on the door - trapping him partially inside the revolving door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Other doors seal electronically. Biggs charges back, sees Gerard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimble fights the heavy glass door. The big man resists - but slowly the crack widens. Gerard bulls through the crowd, shoves a man out of his line of fire.
</DIRECTION>
<GERARD>

	Down. down. everybody down!

With adrenal effort, Kimble wrings his body through the opening...

Gerard. Charging the glass doors. Civilians suck marble and clear out of Gerard's line of fire on Kimble. Gerard takes aim.

Gerard FIRES seven times in two seconds.

Kimble goes down. SHOTS and SCREAMS ECHO around the lobby. A long beat, then Gerard rises. THROUGH GLASS studded with bullet holes, he sees...

Kimble rising... staring back. Equally astounded that he's alive. He runs free.
</DIRECTION>
<GERARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open the doors!

Gerard pounds against the doors. Sees cratering in the glass - and then sees flattened slugs all over the floor. It's bullet-proof glass. THROUGH the glass he sees Kimble rush across the street and disappear into the parade.
</DIRECTION>

Doors open and Gerard and his men follow.

But Kimble has disappeared into the parade celebrations outside. Blending in with the marchers.

The PHONE RINGS nine, ten times. As Kimble waits he looks down at his list of five. The only name remaining is Fredrick Sykes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down the street - it seems clear - then his focus shifts to a man carrying two coffees. He approaches a car parked along the curb. The passenger - a woman - leans across the seat and opens the door for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hands her a cup of coffee and as he starts to climb in, he shifts something on his hip - we see the butt of a handgun.

Kimble hangs up and leaves through the back door.

EXT. REAR OF SYKES' APARTMENT - MORNING

Kimble moves across the roof and drops to fire escape behind Sykes' apartment. He looks in the window, steps back to see if anyone is looking, then pulls his fist back into his sleeve and with one swift pop, BREAKS the GLASS.

A man with newspaper sits across the car reading. The headlines facing Kimble say: "KIMBLE IN CHICAGO". Kimble's booking photo stares back at him.

Kimble reacts to the headline, looks away as the man turns the pages.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man looks over the newspaper at Kimble, then goes back to reading. A moment later he folds the paper back to the front page.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man looks up from the paper and looks at Kimble again, then down.

Coolly the man folds the paper, tucks it under his arm, stands, looks through the car, then moves into one of the rear cars.

Kimble looks out the window - hoping desperately for his car to reach the station. He keeps his head turned until the man is gone.

Sykes is thrown to the floor - the gun slips from his grasp. Kimble moves for the gun as Sykes comes up, catches Kimble in the stomach, knocks him back. The fight carries on throughout the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimble reaches the gun first, lifts it in his left hand and aims at Sykes. Sykes sees the gun in Kimble's hand and almost smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SYKES Go ahead. You don't have it in you .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment Kimble almost fires, but instead he takes the gun in his right hand and whips it across Sykes' face. Then hits Sykes again and again with the butt of the gun, driving him down the length of the car, knocking him almost unconscious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimble tucks the gun in his belt and moves to the Transit Cop. He checks for a pulse - there is none. The Cop is dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kimble takes the handcuffs and keys from the case on the Cop's belt. He reaches for Sykes' wrist, drags him to the Cop and cuffs Sykes to the dead Cop.

He pockets the keys and grabs Sykes' hair, pulls his face off the floor.
