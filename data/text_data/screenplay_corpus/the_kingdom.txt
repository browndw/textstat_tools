<DIRECTION>
We're in a kindergarten classroom of 25 SIX YEAR OLDS. All sitting on the floor, legs crossed. Sitting in front of the kids is Little KEVIN FLEURY, flanked by his mom LYLA FLEURY and his dad RONALD FLEURY, in a dark suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Little Kevin has a large cardboard square with pictures from different stages of his life taped to it. He's telling the class about the photos.

We're TIGHT ON the pictures. TIGHT ON the young faces. TIGHT ON Fleury.

Fleury smiles, looks out at the class.

<RONALD_FLEURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sure can. That was December 4th and that was the day that we spent the whole day in the hospital waiting for this guy right here to come out of Kevin's mom's tummy. And we waited and waited but he wouldn't come and we kept waiting and finally the doctor said `OK...he's not gonna come out on his own so we got to go get him.' And well,

EXT. AN UNKNOWN ROOFTOP - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Muslim family sits together at a table under a tented- canopy: 32 year-old MAN nervously chewing on a toothpick, and his 8 and 15 year-old SONS. The 8yo leans his weight into an old MAN hunched and obscured by his grandson - this is his Grandfather. He gently rubs the Boy's head with an ancient left hand. The Boy finger-paints in Arabic script, right to left, getting paint on the table. Read the translation: There is no God but Allah.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Grandfather's face is down, obscured by his shumagh: the head-wrap worn by some Muslim men. Never a clear view of his face. His 32 year old Son and eldest Grandson sit next to them, the Son talking quietly on a cell phone, chewing that toothpick, eyes set on something in the distance: A Security Gate three hundred yards away, the entrance to some sort of compound. The Compound looks like a walled-off subdivision, most of which we can see from this high up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The landscape is foreign. Scrub desert. Ten miles beyond, on the horizon: the shimmer of a modern skyline. Surreal monolithic shapes made more so by the heat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Muted yells-claps-screams waft in from that Compound now... Catches the youngest Grandson's attention. Eyes lift up from his painting: the yells-claps-screams are coming from a softball game mostly visible behind the Compound's reinforced walls that extend a mile in each direction. Played on the only stretch of green grass visible from this vantage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COMPOUND MAIN ENTRANCE - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sounds from the softball game much louder now, just over the walls. Security perimeters two checkpoints deep before you get to the main gate. A maze of concrete Jersey-barriers to slow all entering vehicles: give machine-gun emplacements flanking the entrance plenty of time to shred those vehicles if need be. Middle-Eastern Police platoons. 500 lbs. lift- gates to dissuade any vehicle that just tries to ram through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERGEANT HAYTHAM: a lean, 27 year-old Middle-Eastern Policeman in-command of the Entrance. Sweats through his uniform. A late-model Range Rover with blacked-out windows queues up. All the windows roll down: just a single, portly White WOMAN behind the wheel, her INFANT CHILD in a car-seat in front. Two other Uniformed Officers mirror-scan the bottom of the Rover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A brief exchange, as Haytham checks his ID:
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you today, Sergeant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<HAYTHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sun is shining. Wind is blowing. How bad can I be doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAYTHAM>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like that, "Sun is shining..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
A tight smile from Haytham.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other Officers are checking the inside of the Rover now. They nod to Haytham, Haytham hands the ID back to her. Windows rolls up. Lift-gate goes up. Range Rover pulls away, navigating the zig-zag jersey barriers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COMPOUND - NEXT MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stay with the Range Rover as it moves deeper into the complex. Think middle-class Phoenix suburb circa 1960: stucco homes sandwiched between dormitory style apartment blocks, concrete and rock where grass should be.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Range Rover passes a tank with a caged SOLDIER on top sitting behind a fifty caliber GUN. A Police Land Cruiser parked in the middle of the road is the last of the security. Official markings, emergency lights in the grill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UNKNOWN ROOFTOP - SAME MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Son studies the compound through binoculars, while the youngest Grandson squints to study the softball game: Interest cut with jealousy. More muted cheers float. Behind and above him, his Grandfather's voice, rough as sand, to his 32 year-old Son, in Arabic:
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang up the phone. If they're not ready now, no words will change it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COMPOUND SOFTBALL DIAMOND - NEXT MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another Middle-Eastern POLICEMAN takes in the motley competition: half-smiling, half-smirking at a plump-pink White Man cheering on his plump-pink 9 year-old Son sliding into third.
</DIRECTION>
<WHITE_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GET DIRTY!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Safe. Clapping and Hoots. The PITCHER: an older White Man in his middle forties visibly frustrated. A 25 year-old African- American Batter steps to the plate now. Pitcher turns to his Fielders:
</DIRECTION>
<PITCHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	STEP IT UP NOW!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(back the Batter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ready for my knuckle-curve?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PITCHER>
<DIRECTION>
The Batter just stays focused as the Pitcher tosses a high- lob. Batter smacks the ball a mile high, deep to left. The teammates of the plump-pink Boy on third:
</DIRECTION>
<TEAMMATES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	TAG UP! WAIT `TIL SHE CATCHES IT-
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEAMMATES>
<PITCHER>
<DIRECTION>
(spins, points up at the ball)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-COMIN' HOME!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PITCHER>
<DIRECTION>
A 14 year-old Indian girl sprints underneath the fly-ball: sets up, catches it, juggles it, drops it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We pick up different families on the grass nearby: A young WOMAN helps her five year old DAUGHTER untangle a yo-yo. A black COUPLE doing a crossword puzzle together, the wife's head on her husband's lap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UNKNOWN ROOF TOP - SAME MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The muted reaction to the dropped ball. The whole Family, save the youngest Grandson, intently focused on two Officers walking up to that Police Land Cruiser parked in the middle of the road, well inside the compound: no blinks now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The youngest still enthralled by the softball game, the cheers, the running, the shorts and t-shirts. We see his Grandfather's left hand stop rubbing the Boy's head, and move to the Boy's temple, placed like a blinder so he can't see what's about to happen. In Arabic:
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't stop watching the game.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INSIDE THE COMPOUND WALLS - NEXT MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Noises from the softball game close again. Track these two Officers on foot walking toward the Police Land Cruiser ala shift change: nonchalant but quick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE LAND CRUISER - SAME MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Driver eyeing the two approaching Officers: something off about them. Uniforms wrinkled, one with a full beard. Driver turns to his Partner, in Arabic:
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a copy of the duty rost-
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
-POP-POP-POP before the Driver finishes. The Officers on foot rapid-firing 9MM pistols. The Driver and Passenger hit multiple times instantly, crumble lifeless in their seats before anyone has time to process the sounds, link them to an attack. The two firing `Officers' move low-fast like professionals: rip the fresh bodies from the Cruiser, jump in. The new Passenger rips an AR-15 rifle off the center console. The new Driver lays rubber into the Compound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UNKNOWN ROOF TOP - SAME MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The youngest Grandson wide-eyed, startled, watches as every member of the Security Details in and around the Compound go prairie dog: search with necks extended, eyes wide -- what the fuck was that? The Boy tries to turn his head away from the game to look for himself: Grandfather just pushes his head back to the game, voice harder now, in Arabic:
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said keep watching the game.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COMPOUND MAIN ENTRANCE - SAME MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Haytham instantly sprints toward another nearby Police Land Cruiser as most everyone else ducks. In Arabic:
</DIRECTION>
<SERGEANT_HAYTHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	LOCK DOWN!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGEANT_HAYTHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Then points at the Officer in the Driver's seat:

EXT. COMPOUND SOFTBALL DIAMOND - SAME MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Game forgotten. Parents up, screaming for loved ones, moving fast toward the parking lot. The Middle-Eastern Officer that has been watching the game hustles onto the field, next to the Pitcher, waves people toward him. Gathering but sporadic gun-fire in very near distance.
</DIRECTION>
<WATCHING_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
(accented English)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	COME TO ME! FOLLOW ME!

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The 14 year-old Indian Girl running in, more puzzled than scared: why is that Cop wearing a jacket in this heat?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Officer rips a yellow gun-shape from his jacket pocket. The Pitcher sees it, instinctively tries to rip it away from him. Gets a handful of collar, pulls as violently as he can, shreds the front of the Officer's coat: a white linen vest with a bulge in-front underneath the jacket...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UNKNOWN ROOF TOP - SAME MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The youngest grandson's wide-eyed face. Then we see the Grandfather's right-hand slide down the other side of his youngest Grandson's face, coming to rest on his other temple: making sure he's still watching the Softball diamond now. The Grandfather's right hand: missing an index and middle finger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COMPOUND SOFTBALL DIAMOND - SAME MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Panic. The Officer swings the yellow gun-shape, what we now realize is an electric drill crudely modified into something else, bashes the Pitcher's face with it. Those that had gathered have turned, are sprint-stumbling away...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Officer closes his eyes, depresses the drill trigger, vanishes before we comprehend the massive release of blue- black chaos, expanding in an ever-wider sphere. Immediate surroundings dissolve: players, parents, stands, cars, the light standards surrounding the field and parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CINDER-BLOCK CONCESSION STAND - SAME MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Located behind straight-a-way center field, at the nexus of four fields. We see it from profile as shock-wave and shrapnel blast the structure: another Officer hiding behind it staggers out now, sprawls ugly: balance fucked from a blown inner-ear. He also wears a jacket, and holds a modified yellow plastic power drill. Moves uneasy toward screams in the nearby parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SOFTBALL DIAMOND PARKING LOT - NEXT MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The off-balance Officer stops over a 30 year-old African- American woman pinned under a Toyota. She hyperventilates, her bare leg and open-toed sandal kick at air. The Officer's breathing calms: the sight of exposed skin as divine reassurance. CLOSE-UP: the vented rear of the drill as the 14.4 volt motor sparks blue. A second blue-black explosion that shreds the parking lot as cars smash into one another desperate to escape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ADJACENT STREET - NEXT MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Panicked women walking dogs. Frozen. A Police Land Cruiser with bullet-scarred windows roars around the corner. Stops near the women. They smile: cavalry to the rescue. Then a man with leans out the window with an AR-15: point-blank staccato. Tracers exit bodies, drill asphalt. The Land Cruiser rolls, spraying passing homes indiscriminate...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JACKED LAND CRUISER - NEXT MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tearing through the streets, Passenger firing at all signs of life. Sits back for a lightning-quick re-load. Leans back out -- before he can begin firing again-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COMPOUND STREET - SAME MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-another Police Land Cruiser from nowhere hammers their Driver's side. Vicious. The Passenger is launched out his window, head-first into the curb. Both vehicles smoke- screech. Momentary pause after the a massive collision.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Sergeant Haytham, 9MM in-hand, falls from the Second Land Cruiser. Stalks bloody to the Passenger side of the jacked Land Cruiser still slowly rolling backwards, leaking all it's vital fluids, it's snapped drive-shaft leaving a groove in the pavement. And Sergeant Haytham empties his clip into the interior while walking along side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Officer Haytham told to 'move,' rips himself from the Passenger's side of their vehicle, bleeding profusely, screaming something unintelligible into his handheld radio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UNKNOWN ROOF TOP - SAME MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just the youngest Grandson's horrified eyes: he had no choice but to see it all, carnage painted permanently. His face still held tight between his Grandfather's hands. In Arabic:
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER>

EXT. AL-RAHMAH HOUSING COMPOUND BLAST SITES - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shattered softball diamond and parking lot. Emergency lights swirl from everywhere. Acrid smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANCIS MANNER (FBI LEGAT, US Embassy) is giant. The kind of American that only grows in tiny southern hamlets. Military whitewalls, short-sleeves, khaki Dockers, a thick Casio G- shock, FBI credentials visible on a chain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hangs up his phone. Lifts his eyes: Hell from one side of the frame to the other. Saudi teams setting up portable lights that bathe the horror in industrial incandescent. Columns of black smoke. Fleets of emergency vehicles. 100 uniformed men. Another 200 in bio-suits combing the ball field, the parking lot. Fran has to do something/anything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Move through the horror with him now. His hands shake, his face already dirty with soot. Jumps in with a Saudi team pulling a half-burned WOMAN out of a smoldering Range Rover. She fights them, gouging Fran's face, trying to get back in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is the woman we met at the gate of the compound. She wants her baby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fran bloodied, just kind of steps away from the woman. Leaves the Saudi emergency team to fight with her. Backs away until he feels grass under his feet. The woman's screams reverberate. Fran just sits in the grass. Staring at the woman, her shattered soul. Forces himself to look away. Eyes come to rest on a child's baseball cap: ragged holes ringed with black stains: where blood dried on the blue felt.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fran. You gotta stand Big Man...

Fran turns to find REX BURR: 5'7" fireplug. A long silence. Fran points to the hat:
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCIS_MANNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rex, how old were you when your hat was that small?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCIS_MANNER>
<DIRECTION>
We watch tears well in Rex's eyes...
</DIRECTION>
<REX_BURR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gotta stand, Big Man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REX_BURR>
<DIRECTION>
Fran does. Wipes his hands on his pants. Slack-jaw hopeless. The first moments in what will be weeks of reverse- engineering the murders of unknown dozens. He and Rex step to a group of WALKING-WOUNDED. A NEIGHBOR doles out mugs of coffee. Most everyone from the compound is out, pondering the proximity. SAUDI emergency teams sprint past. Fran spits, settles in:
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCIS_MANNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need to get everyone back, then get all their-
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCIS_MANNER>
<DIRECTION>
SOMETHING HUGE EXPLODES over their shoulders, 50 yards away. The Attack's coup de grace: wait for people to lift up their heads, hit them again. Five times the size of the suicide bombs. Shreds emergency vehicles, nearby homes and apartment buildings. Kills Saudi rescuers by the bushel. Fran is crushed by a flying portable light standard. Rex is blown into the man handing out coffee. The walking wounded get decimated.
</DIRECTION>

Startling quiet in contrast. AGENTS cluster beneath 32-inch Televisions suspended from the ceiling. Tuned to Al-Jazeera, CNN, BBC, etc. Most eyes focus on the double-bloody scoops from CNN. Volume low:

<CNN_REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>

<BBC_REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...homes to thousands of Westerners and other non-Saudis who work in the Kingdom, there have been several attacks on these compounds in the last five years. As such, they have become very tight in terms of security, with both the Saudi National Guard and police taking command.

Fleury enters, steps to a podium, opens his folder. 50 Agents seated lecture hall-style. Steam from fifth, sixth cups of coffee. Plasma screens behind show still-images of the crime cribbed from Al-Jazeera.

Throughout the scene, Fleury constantly refers to a roster of his ERTs.
</DIRECTION>

	From the craters, looks like they used a High Explosive... possibly military grade: can't fit that much TNT into a vest. 20, 30 pounds of PETN: they got it. Semtex or C-4: they could get it. The third there, God knows...that crater looks like a plane dropped a 500-pounder...

ADAM LEAVITT. 34 years-old, sought-after Investigator. There's a constant, intense grind to this guy, a mind and mouth incapable of quiet. He paces around the room, then eagle-eyes the bomb images... starts surge-scrawling crude diagrams of the blast site on a piece of loose leaf. Feels more like nervous doodling than work. Not looking up from his drawing:

Another great question. Fleury looks over to AGENT #1 on his immediate right, an egg-head type with a big binder in front of him. Everyone's eyes follow. Agent #1 flips quickly through the binder, back-and-forth, searching. Fleury crosses his name off of his roster. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. At least the first parts of the attacks.

Fleury's P.O.V.: His open folder on the podium. A memo printed on Department of State letterhead. Pulls the memo, reads it aloud, calm laced with rage.
</DIRECTION>
<RONALD_FLEURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From the State Department, one hour ago: `We are in agreement with the Saudi security assessment that any additional American presence on Kingdom soil represents reckless risk.

INT. SAUDI NATIONAL GUARD PRISON - UNKNOWN TIME

COLONEL AL-GHAZI, Saudi Police, 45 years-old, mustache as thick as Sykes'. A firecracker-loud crack makes him flinch. He stands in the back of the room, not participating in the interrogation. Just observing. Clearly not happy about what he's observing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His POV: The Officer from the second Land Cruiser that rammed the fake and killed those inside, Sergeant Haytham. slab- cuffed and being worked over hard buy a couple of thick- fisted SAUDIS.. Silent tears roll off his cheek, left ear split ghastly. A MAN standing far right of him beats him: the firecracker sound again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Al-Ghazi looks away, biting his tongue. Obviously wants this over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In-charge of the interrogation: GENERAL ABDUL MALIK. He doesn't appear sadistic, but very determined to get the truth from Sergeant Haytham by any means necessary. Those distinctions blur easily. Malik gives a `hold-up' signal. The following exchange in Arabic:

<RONALD_FLEURY>

	Two suicide bombers. Rumors they were dressed as Saudi Police. We believe this is the work of Saudi terrorist named Abu Hamza.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONALD_FLEURY>

Young just stares at Fleury kind of odd like a kid staring at a mushroom flavored Popsicle.
</DIRECTION>
<GIDEON_YOUNG>

	Go on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIDEON_YOUNG>
<DIRECTION>
Fleury continues:
</DIRECTION>
<RONALD_FLEURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A Shooter crew served as distraction. After the initial attack there was a lull to allow Saudi Emergency Teams...and our own attaches...to collect. Then a secondary blast was triggered, aimed at those first responders. So they targeted families and rescuers with one attack.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(mildly sarcastic:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think that's a clear signal that their definition of `Enemy' is expanding.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You two digested the memo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIDEON_YOUNG>
<DIRECTION>
Stoic nods from each. Ellis Leach raises his hand, a tone that's worlds away from Young's.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIS_LEACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll go first if that's okay Maricella?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off her `yeah, sure' nod)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First, I'm sorry about Fran Manner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIS_LEACH>
<DIRECTION>
Gideon Young remembers, nods along solemnly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTOR_GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As we are about Rex Burr.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR_GRACE>
<ELLIS_LEACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I met with Prince Thamer at the Saudi embassy fifteen minutes after I heard this morning's news. After speaking with Thamer, I advised we withhold additional US personnel because a big part of the religious justification for these bombs is the presence of current US personnel. More boots on Saudi soil make an already combustible situation more so. I know that's not the answer you want, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIS_LEACH>
<DIRECTION>
Motions to Maricella: the floor is yours.
</DIRECTION>
<MARICELLA_CANAVESIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My two cents: The Saudis haven't asked for FBI help. Sounds like they've done just the opposite. If we force the issue, that could further anger an utterly important ally that shares a 1000-mile long border with Iraq.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARICELLA_CANAVESIO>
<GIDEON_YOUNG>
<DIRECTION>

	We would just like to be on record as saying we think we should go ASAP-

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not going to happen
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIDEON_YOUNG>

Young stands: we're done. Fleury's look: that's it? Young's already collecting his briefcase, jacket-
</DIRECTION>
<GIDEON_YOUNG>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (mock sincerity to the room:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-so as we present this to the public, let's - as best we can - try to view this through an FBI Agent's eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat...To Grace:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And please let me know if there's anything else we can do for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIDEON_YOUNG>
<DIRECTION>
Meeting seems over. Not quite. Fleury can't keep his mouth shut.
</DIRECTION>
<RONALD_FLEURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, how would you imagine it looks viewed through an FBI agents eyes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONALD_FLEURY>
<GIDEON_YOUNG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIDEON_YOUNG>
<RONALD_FLEURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm interested in how you think this situation is viewed through our eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONALD_FLEURY>
<DIRECTION>
Young, eyes on a Republican-gold Rolex, instantly perturbed the meeting isn't ending.
</DIRECTION>
<GIDEON_YOUNG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's some variation on vengeance... When one of your own is killed, Agents lose their analytical powers - kind of a greatest strength, greatest weakness thing...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIDEON_YOUNG>
<RONALD_FLEURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I wanted vengeance, I'd have whispered `Rex Burr' into Ellis's ear right when we walked in.

<MARICELLA_CANAVESIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the distinction?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARICELLA_CANAVESIO>
<RONALD_FLEURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To call this massacre an act of terrorism... that implies a specific political agenda. To me, these killings are so futile and unbalanced that they feel utterly sociopathic- more like Charles Manson than Osama Bin Laden...
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Fleury looks to Mayes. She clears her throat. Delivers the following with utter precision.
</DIRECTION>
<JANET_MAYES>
<DIRECTION>
(beat, fuck it: Go)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Al Qaeda lost the first phase of this war, so a new, zero-sum phase has begun: if you won't join us, we'll let loose the truly talented Murderers... Abu Hamza. He will kill so many of you that the resulting humiliation of the Saudi Royal Family will cause an exodus, a rebellion, both. Because the Royal Family simply cannot protect you or yours any longer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANET_MAYES>
<DIRECTION>
Fleury studies Janet with solid respect. He gives Janet a subtle nod: "Nice work."
</DIRECTION>
<RONALD_FLEURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When she says talented, she's not talking about the walking-bombs who can sneak past any and all security, nor the hi-jackers tough enough to take an airliner. We're talking about the Man who teaches them how...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONALD_FLEURY>
<JANET_MAYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--the operational commander who organizes, trains, plans, encourages. That is who we're fighting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANET_MAYES>
<RONALD_FLEURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we don't get inside Saudi Arabia within 36 hours, there is no chance we catch the killer responsible for Al-Rahmah. None.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONALD_FLEURY>
<ELLIS_LEACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. I believe it all. So doesn't your team in that country represent the kind of target one of these `Masters' would die for? Trade ten of their own for one of you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIS_LEACH>
<RONALD_FLEURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To not engage these criminals out of fear for our personal safety is just another way of saying `uncle.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONALD_FLEURY>
<DIRECTION>
Fleury takes another deep breath.
</DIRECTION>
<RONALD_FLEURY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll say it another way: Evidence starts to go cold after twenty four hours. If we can't get in now, we will not find the man or men responsible for this crime. We couldn't do it at Khobar; we couldn't do it in Yemen; we have barely scratched the surface in Iraq. And we are on verge of not doing it here. They are getting stronger, we are getting weaker. I just lost a very good friend and I would very much like to go and do my job.

	And then we bring the hammer down hard as hell: Bust Al Haramain - we got direct links from Riyadh - two wives donating ten million to three Arab-American cultural centers in Boston. Then what gets kind of not- funny is how some of that cash found its way to Jakarta and some Mosques that have these training camps built right next to them.

A tiny framed Saudi National flag in the middle of a wall: green with a white sword underlining script that reads: There is no God but Allah.

No other decoration. The none-too-muffled sounds of traffic: a lone window overlooking a four-lane boulevard. Then the Athan (call to prayer) for the Isha (last of the five daily prayers) trumps the traffic noise.

Sergeant Haytham enters, bandaged, blank, then a small smile crosses his face. An old man's weathered voice, in Arabic:

</OLD_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Haytham's P.O.V.: His FATHER, glass-frail, lying in a bed, a small TV nearby, on but soundless. Haytham goes into a routine: rolls out two prayer mats, steps to his Father, reaches down to pick him up. His Father readies himself -- stops everything when he sees the bandages up close, the black bruises with outer rings of purple covering 1/2 of his Son's cheek. Looks into his boy's eyes.

Al-Ghazi sits on pillows on the living room with his WIFE and three DAUGHTERS. A television is on, playing "MAN SAYARBAH AL MILIOUN" the Arabic "Who Wants To Be A Millionaire." Al- Ghazi's children are playing a game with peas, trying to guess which one of his hands Al-Ghazi is hiding the pea. When a girl guesses correctly, he eats a pea.

From outside, we hear the call to prayer. Al-Ghazi and his family all move to prayer mats in his living room.

INT. ONE ROOM APARTMENT - SAME

Haytham continues carrying his Father to the prayer mats. Gently sets him down, Kneels down himself, carefully rolls his Dad to his stomach. Then stands to help tuck his Father -- in obvious, great arthritic pain -- into a kneeling prayer position.

Kisses his father on the top of his head. And both pray.

Three-Suburban convoy turns up a driveway, waved past a guard post bristling with automatic weapons and into the circular drive of a massive, walled palace. Impersonal wealth. Two dozen SANG troops on security detail. Two Humvees equipped with anti-aircraft missiles parked 100 yards apart.

Colonel Al-Ghazi out of the middle Suburban. Frisked by SANG, rough: no love lost.

Al-Ghazi is passed to a silent, boundless staff holding serving platters jammed with cups of mint tea. A mammoth foyer.

PRINCE SA'AD BIN KHALED (Saudi Interior Ministry) steps out from a 20-foot high doorway: nebbish, thin, bloodshot eyes magnified by thick glasses. His hand over his stomach: Napoleon's ulcers. A quick wave to Al-Ghazi.

10' X 20' gold/glass desk over a 50' X 50' rug in a 100' X 100' marble room. Al-Ghazi greets the Prince formally: kiss the right shoulder near the clavicle. The Prince's tongue chalk-white for some reason. In Arabic:

The cargo door locks into place on Saudi tarmac. Fleury and the Team outside the plane now, bags dropped at their feet. 90 degrees even this late. Look-up: light washing over a small, formal Saudi military team in front of two caskets draped in American flags, and a small convoy of bullet-proof black Suburbans.

A truck 200 yards ahead in the middle of an abrupt U-turn. Over the median. Dust cloud. Heading back our way. Something big in the truck's bed.

<DIRECTION>
Al-Ghazi stanches an explosion. Haytham looks over at his Colonel: rarely ever seen him like this. Looks in the rear- view mirror to see Sykes, the man giving the Colonel fits. Sykes catches him looking back, gives him a quick wink into the mirror. TIGHT ON Haytham's face: the guilty little smile you give when someone takes your boss to task.

<COLONEL_AL_GHAZI>

	47 of my `brother-officers' were blown into hundreds of pieces that will take months to collect. 80,000 Officers total, across the country, at four uniforms apiece. Thousands of people who can sew forgeries. Apologies that I don't have definitive answers.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Good afternoon, Sir.

</DIRECTOR_GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
Young says nothing, just pulls a memo from his bag, clears his throat -- still no eye-contact -- reads aloud like a poor man's Orson Welles:

	`Sunlight is indeed the most powerful disinfectant. In that spirit I come before this Judiciary Committee with a painful admission.

<DIRECTION>
(beat)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Simply: I've lost all confidence in the FBI, especially it's uppermost echelon. Entrenched and outmoded, the Leadership has shown itself fearful of the pioneering thought this Committee and I have tried to imbue. It is thus an Agency at contretemps, hindering our every effort.' And by `Committee' I mean the fucking SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON TERROR...

Young finally makes eye contact: expecting something like fear, remorse, back-pedalling...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTOR_GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Senators? Then I'd change `outmoded' to `outdated,' `echelons' to `ranks' and what in God's name is `contretemps?' These guys aren't the best and brightest-

	<DIALOGUE>
	Westmoreland made all us Officers write our own obituaries during Tet, when it looked like the Cong were going to end it all right there. Once we clued-in that life was finite, the loss of it no longer scared us: the end comes no matter what, it's just a question of how you want to go out: on your feet or on your knees. After that, we went out and pulled triggers until barrels melted. And Vietnam lasted another seven years.

EXT. OUTSIDE AL-RAHMAH HOUSING COMPLEX - NIGHT, SAUDI TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The convoy brakes impossibly close to a checkpoint. Waved through perimeters staffed by SANG and Police. Fatigues, automatic rifles, peering at the tinted windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MIDDLE SUBURBAN - NEXT MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crew arrives at a crime-scene that spans the immediate horizon. White tents with SANG sitting under each. Industrial lights outline shattered buildings, idle heavy equipment, bombed-out automobiles. TIGHT ON MAYES looking out.
</DIRECTION>
<JANET_MAYES>

EXT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER - NEXT MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two more security perimeters of SANG surround the Community Center: blinding portable lights, heavy machine guns mounted in the backs of Humvees track the convoy as it comes to a stop: every troop on-guard. The Team tentatively exits: 100 pairs of glares from heavily-armed SANG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soldiers descend on the Teams' bags, paletts of equipment. Long leers at Janet: not so much `sexual' as `wary.' Janet goes for her own bag. Haytham goes for it at the same time. Their hands accidently touch. Haytham pulls back fast, embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<JANET_MAYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	EASY.

<DIRECTION>
Janet notices the nasty marks around Haytham's right ear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER - NEXT MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Florescent lights make it ugly. Haytham dumps duffel-bags by their bunks, SANG stack steel travel-boxes from the paletts inside. No windows, AC cranked to `coldest.' Americans sealed- in - in the name of comfort.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Janet's area made obvious with a floral partition. She immediately folds it, puts it into a corner. Haytham watches her undo his work.

Al-Ghazi and Haytham leave. The doors close behind them, then the sound of a key turning in a lock. The Americans look on, half-disbelief, half-comedy: locking us in.

EXT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER - 4:30 AM

Pre-dawn: Eight black suburbans parked on the side street: waiting. The doors of the first four open in-unison. 20 Arab, suited SECURITY GUARDS exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Al-Ghazi unlocks the door to the compound: the team stands dressed, waiting. CLOSE-UP: The Team steps out to see massive, organized security.

From one of the vehicles exits a middle aged AMERICAN - sweating a bit, hanging back, watching. This is US Deputy Chief of Mission, the Embassy's second-in-command: DAMON SCHMIDT.

Another 100 Security CONTRACTORS remain vigilant: SNIPERS on roof-tops, in machine-gun nests.

One of the inner-circle, without a word, takes off the FBI- emblazoned windbreaker worn by Leavitt and places it on a short-sleeved Janet. Careful not to touch skin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only then does Prince Bin Khaled approach. A lone PHOTOGRAPHER follows: snapping pictures. Different definitions of personal space: four inches separation as Bin Khaled greets each Team member in accented English. Janet last: the pictures suddenly stop. The Prince gives a little curtsy, no words, steps back to Fleury: the pictures re- start. Bin Khaled holds Fleury's hand sixth-grade boyfriend- style.

Hold on an empty 2' X 1' X 6" balsa wood box set on a dirty linoleum floor.

Ancient hands line the balsa wood box with bricks of putty- gray plastic explosive. We immediately notice the right hand is missing the index and middle fingers. The hands insert bright-red blasting caps into the explosives, lengths of detonating-wire emanating from each cap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another set of stronger, younger, in-tact hands gently pours a mixture into the box now. Ball bearings, children's jacks, marbles, razor blades, roofing nails. Everything malevolent densities and angles. Some pieces bounce out, run along the floor. The younger hands then start pressing/molding the pieces of soon-to-be shrapnel into the putty-gray plastic explosives.

Then the metallic swish of the all-weather net. Leavitt boxes out air for the non-existent rebound, grabs the ball, chest- passes it Great Santini-hard back to Janet who softly sucks in the pass. Playing in their cargo pants and hiking boots.

Fleury with Sykes still standing in the same spot. Looks up: Al-Ghazi coming into the building.

Fleury finally speaks, asking the most important question:
</DIRECTION>
<RONALD_FLEURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is in charge of the investigation then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONALD_FLEURY>
<DIRECTION>
Al-Ghazi points to a Man we've seen before, General Abdul- Malik. Haytham's Interrogator. He pours over a table 20 feet away: maps, blueprints, utility schematics spread before him.
</DIRECTION>
<COLONEL_AL_GHAZI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	General Abdul-Malik. He's given us permission to walk through each crime-scene.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLONEL_AL_GHAZI>
<RONALD_FLEURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To walk through? Are you kidding me?

<DIRECTION>
Beat. As Al-Ghazi stabilizes...
</DIRECTION>
<COLONEL_AL_GHAZI>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You will be permitted to walk through the crime scenes. When we have determined that it is safe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLONEL_AL_GHAZI>
<DIRECTION>
A stand off. Fleury eyes Al-Ghazi. Trying to figure this guy out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sees something that looks like a flash of embarrassment in Al- Ghazi's eyes: unable to perform his profession, relegated to Tour Guide. Leavitt begins taking notes. Haytham sees his notebook, snaps his fingers at Al-Ghazi who looks, nods: let him.
</DIRECTION>
<RONALD_FLEURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONALD_FLEURY>
<DIRECTION>
Fleury tight-grins. Looks off. In one of the apartments, he sees a PERSON looking down at them from behind a curtain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries a new tactic.

<AL_GHAZI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What witnesses?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AL_GHAZI>
<DIRECTION>
Al-Ghazi just stares at Fleury.
</DIRECTION>
<FLEURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm guessing there are a bunch of Americans, Brits... Australians? Someone must have seen something. I'm sure they're just dying to talk to you guys, seeing as how the killers were wearing your uniforms. That must be a real confidence booster for them.

Al-Ghazi silent, staring.

Al-Ghazi looks unsure. He was not expecting this.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIPON FAMILY HOME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fleury and Al-Ghazi walk up the front walk. Fleury noticing kids bikes, hockey gear, a comfortable easy chair covered in fur outside on the front porch, toy guns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RIPON FAMILY HOME - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fleury sits with the RIPONS: EARL (40s) JANINE, his wife (30s), and MADDY, Earl's mother (late 60s). Earl sits on an ugly couch, a plywood sheet right above their heads. Everyone uneasy save the CAT in Maddy's lap. Fleury waves off a bottle of water from Janine. Al-Ghazi hovers awkwardly by the front door.
</DIRECTION>

<RONALD_FLEURY>

Al-Ghazi sees Janine smile, squeeze Earl's hand tighter.

Fleury looks out the window towards the Jackson house.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. JACKSON HOME - SAME MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next door to the Ripons. Fleury knocks. Door opens: a sad MAN with black bags under dying eyes. Disgusted-resigned breath through a half-open mouth. Silver watch and Polo insignia... sees Al-Ghazi, eyes come alive, teeth grit.

Al-Ghazi quietly backs away, walks away. Fleury looks after him, turns back to Mr. Jackson who stares after Al-Ghazi: hate. Fleury unsure what to do next.

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To ask about two nights ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONALD_FLEURY>
<DIRECTION>
Fresh tears re-animate his face:
</DIRECTION>
<AARON_JACKSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When my wife's jaw was shot off in front of our sons? My sons who sat with her while she bled to death? Couldn't speak because she didn't have the bottom of her face and I wasn't home and my baby boys are destroyed for life and my five year- old had a box of band-aids in his hand when I finally got home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AARON_JACKSON>
<DIRECTION>
Silence outside of Mr. Jackson's sobbing. Fleury sick to his stomach. Desperate to let this man alone. No eye contact.
</DIRECTION>
<RONALD_FLEURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I won't pretend to know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONALD_FLEURY>

Aaron Jackson settles, wipes away tears, appreciates the honesty. Then bites back into his rage:
</DIRECTION>
<AARON_JACKSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill everyone that had something to do with this. Everyone related to them. Everyone who knew them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)

	<DIALOGUE>
	And all you'd be doing is their recruiting for them... It's an entire generation: not small and isolated like they say. But a generation that thinks what they did to my wife, to my children, is a "calling"...

</AARON_JACKSON>
<DIRECTION>
A child's scream from inside. Piercing. Scary. Jackson goes red, clenched fists, steps to Fleury who takes an instinctive step backward, guard-up. Jackson stops, spins back inside. A door slam that rattles the plywood sheet covering the shattered window. The screams become night terror shrieks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JACKSON HOME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LONG, SAD BEAT, as Fleury and Al-Ghazi stand alone in front of the Jackson house.

Slow nod from Al-Ghazi.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOMB SITE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The team tours the site.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they fan out. They walk casually, but focused through the first bomb site. An inquisitive Mayes, already peering into a mostly in-tact car, halfway out of its parking spot. Al-Ghazi and Haytham watch the Americans like mother-hens.
</DIRECTION>
<JANET_MAYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He or she almost made it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANET_MAYES>

Fleury steps, looks inside: blood and safety glass coat the seat. Janet points to keys in the ignition: still at the `on' position. Then the stick-shift, pulled to the back right: reverse. The shift-knob bloody...
</DIRECTION>
<JANET_MAYES>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (beat, quieter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<FLEURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what makes this a War.

Sykes notices something on the ground... he picks up a military detonator, discretely hands it over to Fleury. Fleury quietly pockets it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THIRD BLAST SITE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Structures 100 feet away look like they've been hit with a God-sized sawed-off. The crater: 25-feet wide, 7-feet deep. Blackened frames and bits of vehicles circle the crater. The bottom of the crater filled with water. A syphon-pump works overtime. No SANG Investigators around.
</DIRECTION>
<COLONEL_AL_GHAZI>

	</DIALOGUE>
</COLONEL_AL_GHAZI>
<DIRECTION>
Al-Ghazi points to a mass of black metal: looks like a fire truck the way a Jackson Pollock looks like the Mona Lisa. Leavitt and Grant stand back. Quiet:
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT_SYKES>
<DIRECTION>
(eyes on Fleury)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hole is the case. See, there's "evidence" down in that hole. You understand evidence? Little things that are "clues." Clues can be very helpful to a fella when he's trying to solve a crime.

<GRANT_SYKES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT_SYKES>
<DIRECTION>
Fleury is taking in the entire crime scene. He notices a four story building half a mile off the perimeter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He watches Al-Ghazi rip at a chunk of floorboard wedged into the mud, bag it himself, search for someone to give it too. Nobody. Sets it down. Stands, wipes his hands hard on his pants. Fleury could swear the dirt stains are intentional: trying to feel like he's doing something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERTED STREET, AL-RAHMAH - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Land Cruiser Haytham rammed - driver's side crushed, bullet holes, out-of-control skid-marks, asphalt scars from the snapped drive shaft...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fleury is moving around the scene, restaging the shoot out. Instantly lining up the angles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leavitt's taking digital snaps of the shattered Land Cruiser. Through the viewfinder: the caved-in door. Two snaps.

A SANG passes Adam, his gun aimed a touch high.

Fleury's thinking, looking into the car. Searching the horizon, he spots a distant apartment building providing a view of the crime scene.
</DIRECTION>
<FLEURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They got into the compound. Somehow...took control of this vehicle. I'm guessing they didn't politely ask whoever was in this car if they could take it for a little ride?

Fleury gets in the car, checking out ballistic shreds in the back of the passenger seat headrest.

Janet shoots free throws by herself.

<JANET_MAYES>

	This is the kind of radical circumstance that could have seriously upped Shaq's free throw percentages. Take a man. Ship him off to Riyadh. No phones, constant threat of death, no girls, no hip hop.

A set of stronger, younger, in-tact hands gently pours a mixture into a box now. Ball bearings, children's jacks, marbles, razor blades, roofing nails: everything malevolent densities and angles. Some pieces bounce out, run along the floor. The younger hands then start pressing/molding the pieces of soon-to-be shrapnel into the putty.

Our convoy pulls up in front of the apartment. They exit the vehicles. Our team stands surrounded by a 50-man security detail, rifle-stocks to shoulders. Double-time it - outside the walls now, hostile territory. Two-man sniper teams out front. Al-Ghazi ten steps ahead.

A SANG five car security CREW pulls up, tracking Fleury and company. A stand off between the two police forces.

<DIRECTION>
-Officer reaches down from nowhere and hammers Al-Ghazi open- handed as Al-Ghazi tries to step past. Collective shock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In that breath, Haytham punishes the Officer with a left- cross: knees buckle before he comprehends what hit him. Haytham's kick follows, catches the Officer in the sternum as he hits ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Al-Ghazi shakes it out, trades blows with the SANG second in- command.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leavitt moves, catches a rifle butt to the shoulder after two steps. Fleury aims, drills the Soldier that butted Leavitt: instant night-night. Another SANG steps up. Fleury throats him, knee caps him, and grabs his weapon before the dude hits the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fleury can obviously fight... all the above happens in four seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, a `knock-it-off' gunshot aimed at the sky pops one-foot from Janet's head. We hear what she hears: one half-second of the shot, then the big ring. On her knees immediately, hand over her ear. In response: heavy-caliber gunfire flies: group flinch-n-crouch. The warning shots from a .50-caliber mounted on a Humvee racing this way from Al-Rahmah: dust plumes from the speed. Members of the security detail and the Special Forces go Mexican stand-off.

Al-Ghazi the first to her, touching her hand to pull it away from the ear. A SANG nearby sees this: spits two inches from Al-Ghazi. Al-Ghazi leans to Janet's non-ringing side:

	<DIALOGUE>
	WHO FIRED?
	</DIALOGUE>

That Soldier's hand goes up sheepish. Two men out of the Humvee's backseat break him down, face first in the dirt: cuff him, lock him in the vehicle.

Al-Ghazi looks back down at Janet, at Leavitt's bruise, at the man Fleury knocked out. Angry. Impressed: fought alongside him. Haytham hasn't moved an inch, not even when the General came, chin raised to an entire platoon: say when.

Fleury finds a table with a view. Tabletop: holes and finger- paint stains. Al-Ghazi three feet away. Both look in the same direction: two Tigers being held back.

The Prince sits on a sea of pillows. There are several small flat screens playing business reports, CNN and Al-Jazeera.

Seen from behind the Prince: everyone but Leavitt standing next to faces we've never seen. The table holds six gold serving platters. Enough food to kill a famine, tended by a frenzy of servants.
</DIRECTION>

Sykes puts a hand over his cup to stop the constant tea re- fill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leavitt stands to the Prince's left, thick leather glove on his hand, a falcon perched on it. Leavitt holds it away from the rest of his body like he's already made peace with losing the arm. Servants hold three others close-by.

Pin-drop silence in response to Fleury murdering the Prince's "lite subjects," his attempt to extend the gilded circle-jerk by offering tours. Bin Khaled's face sinks to gray again after the excited pink of talking about his Falcons. His hand slowly moves back over his stomach: Napoleon's ulcers. As Fleury speaks, people unconsciously put their tea-cups down, look up at him with wide-eyes.

As the Prince walks out with Al-Ghazi, he signals another corps of servants to serve another round of cups: coffee. Dinner over. A servant takes the Falcon from Leavitt just as he was starting to smile at it.

INT. MOBILE FIELD MORGUE - NEXT MOMENT

The Muslim dead wrapped in white linen according to the Sunna. Western bodies lie separated from Arabs. A Saudi TECHNICIAN blankly hands Janet and Haytham lab coats to cut the cold. Three Police OFFICERS in the tent with them: Watching Janet.

Haytham is looking uncomfortable as if he is embarrassed to be seen with the American woman.

EXT. JACKSON HOME - LATER

Fleury knocks at Aaron Jackson's door. A pause, the peep hole darkens. A longer pause, then the door opens. Aaron Jackson doesn't look any better. Same shirt.

EXT. BLAST SITE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ten Police Investigators in the crater with Grant. Outside the crater: pieces of vehicles laid out outside: 1/2 of a door, 1/4 of a front axle, bits of engine. Five feet away from that: stacks of bagged evidence, two dozen evidence containers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sykes clambers out of the hole, streaks of re-animated mud where sweat streams out of his hairline, mad-dashing for his chin. A chunk of metal in one hand, something small in the other: a marble. He drops it in the appropriate cannister then steps to a chunk of metal: one half of an alternator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sykes stares down at the pieces of completely mangled metal. He studies a piece of twisted, half-melted iron. Thinking...

Inside the crater: water-level down to the ankles. Three Saudis dig around what looks to be one of the dualie-style back tires. Re-positioning to get a better grip, Sykes notices the top of what looks to be a sizeable, ragged hole, still mostly submerged. Pointing:
</DIRECTION>
<GRANT_SYKES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANT_SYKES>

Sykes slogs over. He drops to his knees, reaches his hand in, all the way to his shoulder, the side of his face to the water: void. Out of the crater, Sykes points to a Bobcat earth-mover, in Arabic:

Janet stands with the Saudi Pathologist. She prepares to take a fingerprint from a body. As the moves in to touch the Arab hand, one of the GUARDS unloads in her direction - a full guttural Arabic assault. No idea what he's saying, but it's obvious he's furious. Haytham starts firing back. This is an un-translated argument. We sense that the guard is doing more than expressing his displeasure regarding Janet. This seems to be personal. Janet's getting very nervous. A frightening display. Then, Haytham turns:
</DIRECTION>
<HAYTHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You cannot touch any Muslims.

Janet takes a breath as the Police hard-eye her.

Al-Ghazi keeps moving up and into what is definitely on Fleury's top ten list of the most bizarre places he's ever been.
</DIRECTION>

FLEURY'S POV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two rooms: First is some kind of snack/smoke/TV lounge. FILIPINOS serve drinks. Packs of young Saudi MEN drink Cokes, tea, coffee, and smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Odd Saudi talk shows mix with hip hop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind, another room: bigger, overflowing with stacks of mis- matched computers. Dozens of them. Dozens of Saudi TEENAGERS plugged in. Head-phoned and mic'd. All chain smoking, all fully plugged in to CALL OF DUTY (an American war game) on line. These kids play with rabid intensity, smoking and screaming and killing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Al-Ghazi moves through the crowd. A small middle aged SAUDI spots Al-Ghazi. They exchange words. Al-Ghazi waves Fleury to follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fleury does and follows Al-Ghazi through the computer room, into a back office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INTERNET CAFE - BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A middle aged Saudi: TALAL. He sits behind a cluttered desk. Art books and computers everywhere. He gets up and embraces Al-Ghazi.

Al-Ghazi then turns to face Fleury.

An oxygen tank. The kind used in ambulances. Nozzle assembly gone, burst in the explosion with a force that drove it several feet into solid ground.

Two black Suburbans roll around the corner: out-fitted with running boards and hand rails upon which a 12-man SWAT team rides: 3 on each rail, 2 vehicles. SWAT team: military fatigues, black hoods, Mp-5 close-quarter sub-machine guns. Flying down the cul-de-sac: Half-way down the street, one of the Snipers open fire: BOOM-BOOM-BOOM. That moment an RPG fires wide of the lead Suburban. Over Al-Ghazi's walkie- talkie, in Arabic:

The two SWAT-Teamers at the front of the running boards open up with their MP-5s one-handed: the front of the house puffs, bursts, disintegrates. Suburbans rip to a stop. SWAT off, move fast. Three toss flash grenades into and around the house. Massive flash-bangs. Six through the front door. Six sprinting around back. Loud AK-47 bursts from inside now...screams. Then an RPG fired inside: the rushing sound and yellow-white flash past two windows. A section of the far left wall of the house detonates from the inside out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More mechanical, silenced thwacks from the SWAT Mp-5s. Silence. Then voices from Al-Ghazi's walkie-talkie. Ambulances round the corner, fly toward the house:

The team enters, wide-eyed. Four men in civilian garb, all dead: multiple bullet wounds. An Officer with four 8 X 10 mug- shots, matching them to the dead faces, dropping mug-shots on respective chests. Once he's finished, a police photographer takes new pictures of each. At the far side of the House: engineers use 2x4s to support the wall hit with the RPG. All of it has the feel of standard Saudi operation procedure.

<DIRECTION>
Al-Ghazi and Fleury both looking back to the following Suburban now. Dropped back, sunglasses and blank faces staring back at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fleury looks to the overpass above - he sees a YOUNG MAN on a cell phone. As they pass, the kid runs to watch them from the other side.

Al-Ghazi gets to the CB radio, in Arabic:

</COLONEL_AL_GHAZI>
<DIRECTION>
-the trailing Suburban doesn't `tighten up.' It falls further back. Fleury instinctively turns, wide-eyed -- out the window: a small brown truck swerves out of the opposing lanes, flying across the desert median, aimed at the Convoy. Without hesitation Fleury reaches over Haytham, rips the steering-wheel right, nosing away from the approach...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAUDI HIGHWAY - SAME MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our Suburban on two wheels: The lead Suburban turns the same direction a twitch too late. The small brown truck detonates. The lead Suburban takes a massive fraction of the explosion broadside, essentially shielding our vehicle. Flame spits through the lead vehicle as it spins, flips onto its roof.

<DIRECTION>
The lead Suburban: tortoise on its back, engulfed, still sliding. Fleury's Suburban fish-tailing.

The Lead Suburban blows in-half now as the gas tank ruptures. A football-sized shard of metal explodes through our windshield-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OUR SUBURBAN - SAME MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- and smashes straight out the back, taking the rear cargo door with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shock of it causes Haytham to lose control in earnest now. The Suburban flips, barrel rolls. Violent pounding inside the vehicle. Motion stops: upside down, just the roar of the big Detroit V-8 red-lining, wheels spinning in air. Everyone dazed, border-line unconscious. Fleury's bell rung the worst, trying to function, get his bearings.
</DIRECTION>

Fleury touches Leavitt's face, can barely see through the gathering smoke that smells like oil.

Leavitt unbuckles his seat belt and smashes head first into the ceiling -- running FOOTFALLS approach, quick yell-yips in Arabic: commands?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Driver and three other Police Officers from the trailing Suburban. Smoke fills the interior now: thank God these Police Officers have ripped open a door: saviors. They grip Leavitt by his hair because it's the only thing they can grab.

Alarmed, Al-Ghazi begins to scramble for Leavitt.

Haytham gets a good look at the driver, recognizes him as the officer who shamed him at the compound on day one. Haytham moves to unbuckle.

Fleury's trying to claw towards Leavitt. Throwing upside down punches at the air. Unbuckles himself now.

EXT. HIGHWAY ATTACK AFTERMATH - NEXT MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leavitt's throwing punches as he's dragged with velocity to the trail Suburban, idling. Pistol-whipped viciously, repeatedly until they're able to kick him inside. Another Officer from the trailing vehicle steps up with an AK-47, pulls back the cocking mechanism, ready to spray the dazed occupants of our Suburban-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-the Officer's ankles and shins detonate. POP-POP-POP-POP from the driver's seat: Haytham. Screams from the would-be shooter at double volume. Haytham keeps firing as the Officer, hit multiple times, falls hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trailing Suburban hesitates, slams into our Suburban just as Fleury is getting out of the wreckage. Everybody else still inside, knocked silly. The trailing Suburban backs up quick. Fleury instinctively goes for his holster: empty for days now.
</DIRECTION>
<RONALD_FLEURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GUN!

</RONALD_FLEURY>
<DIRECTION>
Trailing Suburban accelerates away now, as Janet struggles out. Haytham's 9 MM in-hand racked open: empty. Fleury steps away from the now black smoke pouring from the vehicle -- in the passenger seat of the trail Suburban, he sees the Officer that checked passports at Prince Sultan Air Base.

Haytham's pulling shotguns, handguns, ammo from the flipped vehicle. Haytham pointing ahead, to the fading roster-tail. In Arabic:
</DIRECTION>
<SERGEANT_HAYTHAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're going to disappear...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGEANT_HAYTHAM>
<DIRECTION>
Desperate, Fleury looks in the direction of the fleeing Suburban: the rooster-tail it leaves getting smaller. Al- Ghazi nods, swings his head to thesnarled/wrecked highway traffic. PEOPLE hesitantly step toward uniforms they trust on instinct. Haytham dumps the pile of weapons at the Team's feet, re-loads his 9MM. Janet ties a half-assed tourniquet around Sykes' reminder of an arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Al-Ghazi steps toward the approaching crowd: they see his state, his gun, and turn back: panic starts to infect the larger mass, then the topper-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE from somewhere. Glass-dirt-metal bursts around us: this attack is still going.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fleury looks up: just the roof of an old Mercedes on the median, dirt kicked up behind them, running behind lines of stopped-wrecked traffic now. The barrel of a rifle held high out the window like a taunt. Accelerating for another opening to finish the job.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scared motorists devolve into terrified motorists. Many have abandoned their vehicles to sprint into the desert, the rest go smash-'em-up derby-folly: 50 panicked drivers aiming for the same spots. Fleury snatches an M4A1 from the stack dropped by Haytham, up to his shoulder, hustling toward the next break in traffic. The Mercedes is approaching at 80 MPH.

</COLONEL_AL_GHAZI>
<DIRECTION>
Fleury's view blocked by fleeing Saudis: just intermittent flashes of the Mercedes braking hard, massive dust cloud behind them, sliding toward the opening Fleury pre-sighted. Intermittent wild shots fired from the SUV, vaguely in our direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fleury flips a switch on the left side of the rifle, just forward of the handle: full-auto. Takes a deep, measured Sniper's breath, eases the stock snug aimpoint up to his right eye, and without hesitation lets loose the entire clip perfectly: one heartbeat before the Mercedes hits the gap. The right side of the Mercedes shreds just as it appears. Fleury's clip gone in a flash, yet more rounds still hit the Mercedes: Al-Ghazi four feet away, firing his own salvo from a knee. Something bright red pops against the driver's side window now, the Mercedes rip-slides to a stop. Commotion inside. Wild, half-aimed shots back at us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then it starts up again. Al-Ghazi bolts toward the line of stopped traffic. Searching for something big, empty, still running. Fleury right on his heels.

Startling silence comes sudden now as the fight moves elsewhere. Receding engines. Petering screams/shouts.

Haytham scanning as he drives: straining to see the plume from the second attacking vehicle way ahead, blending with other fleeing, scared motorists. We watch as the distant plume cuts hard left, at a high rate of speed... then DISAPPEARS.

INT. UNKNOWN ROOM - SAME MOMENT

The handle of large knife sticks from his waste band.

INT. LAND ROVER - NEXT MOMENT

Haytham searching for the turn-off: where the rooster-tail they were following cut left, died. At the last minute, he sees tire marks headed down an embankment into a decrepit, decaying apartment block neighborhood. Haytham cuts hard, fish-tails. Sykes' head SMASHES into the rear-side window, starring it.

Without hesitation Haytham pulls across the cramped street, surrounded by the same decaying buildings. Ahead: CIVILIANS huddled behind cars, poking heads out from behind shacks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A second passes: these people know where the attackers went. Al-Ghazi locks eyes with a little boy... he quickly-quietly just shakes his head no. In the back, Sykes has fallen on his back. He looks up through the window: sees a shape jet past on the top of the closest building -- three stories up: the little boy was nodding a warning-

What follows is fast, chaotic, eyes-closed combat:
</DIRECTION>

-big BOOM of close-in shells. As Haytham throws it in reverse and punches, the front of the Rover shreds. The windshield bursts. Engine dies: tachometer and speedometer needles bottom out instantly. Haytham and Al-Ghazi tuck into the dash. Fleury tries to get as close to the backseat floor panels as possible. Janet covers Sykes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Thump-Thump-Thump can be heard on the roof: A GRENADE thrown with too much arm by the guy Sykes spotted bounces off the roof and into the Land Cruiser.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frantic, Fleury swats it out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blast releases a massive airburst and bits of shrapnel into the vehicle, starring windows, rocking it: creak of shocks and struts. Fleury lifts up now, grabs the M-4: returns fire indiscriminately through the windows at any and all surrounding rooftops. That provides cover and reminds everyone in the car they're armed. Janet exits with a rifle: firing out the back door, more covering fire. Civilians who were ready to see a massacre scurry now that it's a fight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOF TOP - NEXT MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHOOTER: black-hood, black T-shirt, old-school red-white- black Air Jordans, snub-stock AK, an open, filthy North Face backpack at his feet holding spare clips, God knows what else.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shots from below keep him two feet away from the ledge, firing down in random sweeps, head turned like he's lighting a fire-cracker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see things from above, three stories down, a sweep of blindly-fired shells pop the asphalt inches from Fleury's head, soiling his face in black-top debris. But Fleury never stops firing back, his own head slightly turned, flinching on reflex. Air Jordan grabs another grenade just before he disintegrates: Fleury's three-feet away with the riot gun. Another rack and blast to make sure A.J. stays down for eternity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fleury spots and bull-charges a second SHOOTER: Ballistic Chicken, Fleury wins. A sound... Fleury spins, racking the riot gun, aims and FREEZES: 2 six year old BOYS stare from the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUWEIDI STREET - NEXT MOMENT

Haytham crouches in front of the Land Cruiser. Rocks thrown now from somewhere: KIDS peeking from behind shacks Palestinian-style. He's pelted in the side of the head.

Gunshots reverberating from outside. Echoes. The 32 year-old, hands shaking with nerves, screwing the camera into the tri- pod: set-up almost complete. The Passport Officer is posted at the door: head poking out, weapon up and ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can hear Arabic yells down what sounds like a hallway. Passport Officer barks something back.
</DIRECTION>

The Driver of the Trail Suburban squats, pinning Leavitt's head down with his knee, knife near a long, white expanse of neck. The Huge Man sits on Leavitt's stomach, keeping him in place. Leavitt trying to gasp for breath: eyes-wide panic.

Just as the 32 year-old nods yes, Leavitt explodes with his last bit of effort: kicks just enough to nudge the Camera, trying to knock it over.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fleury searching: I know that Fuck with the RPG is reloading, how do I kill him. Drops the bag off his shoulders, pulls a grenade out, fires it as hard as he can: 40 yards on the fly. Bounces just on the third floor landing-

Big flinch-tense on his part: rocket fires inside, roars down the hall, hits two feet in-front of the door Passport Officer has been peaking out of.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Massive, contained detonation. Passport Officer vanishes. The 32 year-old and his camera are blown through the Driver waiting to saw Leavitt's neck. Because Leavitt was held so tight to the floor, he escapes the worst of the blast. Still fucked up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leavitt's P.O.V.: ears roar with the ring, no sounds. 32 year- old and Driver lay in a heap on the floor. Huge Man's on his back, trying to get up. Leavitt breathes, rolls to the Driver and the boy: grabs driver's blade. Hand to hand war as Leavitt gets his payback. He does not stop.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNKNOWN ROOM - NEXT MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Huge Man ATTACKS Janet. Vicious hand to hand blows. Still tied, Leavitt does what he can, kicking at the attacker. Adrenaline morphs Janet from scared and out-sized to desperate and equally vicious. This is SAVING PRIVATE RYAN shit with Leavitt as the observer. He's no coward - he's doing everything he can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Huge Man overtakes Janet, slow-choking her... she's gasping, dying... Janet has a knife out and is shredding the big man's back right thigh and ass. BOTH SCREAMING. From nowhere, Fleury ends the fight with a butt-end baseball-swing of the shot gun to Huge Man's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Janet: fucked up, but alive.

</JANET_MAYES>
<DIRECTION>
Al-Ghazi follows Fleury into the room. Leaning to Janet, Fleury sees Leavitt, puts his hand on his head. Leavitt's somewhere else, tears in his eyes, just taking deep, measured breaths.
</DIRECTION>
<RONALD_FLEURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody OK?

</RONALD_FLEURY>

Slow nods from Leavitt and Janet as Fleury cuts Adam's ties.
</DIRECTION>
<FLEURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's at least three more of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLEURY>
<DIRECTION>
As Janet's eyes catch on something: a sheet/half-assed backdrop hung from the ceiling has been nearly pulled down - exposing a crude square cut out of the wall - a path into another Apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Janet points to the hole in the wall. This isn't over: a seven-year old GIRL peers out at her, shaking, tears in her eyes. Janet tries her best Motherly smile.
</DIRECTION>
<JANET_MAYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay Little One.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANET_MAYES>
<DIRECTION>
The little girl backs away. Janet gets up, steers Leavitt outside. Sits him down. Hands him a Glock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fleury and Al-Ghazi step through the hole. Janet follows. A blood trail snakes through Little One's room, out her door, and deeper into another apartment. Little girl long gone into the main part of the Apartment. Then, Arabic SCREAMS, the metal-crashing sound of automatic GUNFIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sirens overheard outside now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ATTACHED APARTMENT - NEXT MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hustle cautious into the apartment. Haytham stands in the room already: the muzzle of his AK still smoking, held on a man down. The other occupants of the room are a cowering FAMILY: KIDS and a couple of real OLD FOLKS, all terrified. A little boy cries by himself, huddled in a corner. The collateral damage of random violence. Janet quick scans the room. LOCKS EYES on the traumatized little boy, his innocence draining as she watches. Can't take her eyes away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON HAYTHAM:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taking this all in: The violence. The terror of this family, the defiance on the faces of these young souls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Al-Ghazi, post-game shakes, a tear running down his cheeks, spattered in blood, stares at Fleury. The man Haytham shot is not dead: ragged gasps. Fleury and Al-Ghazi lock eyes, then take in the tragedy of the room -- kids their children's age, never to be the same. Al-Ghazi to the room, In arabic:
</DIRECTION>
<COLONEL_AL_GHAZI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is everyone alright?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLONEL_AL_GHAZI>
<DIRECTION>
Silent stares from the Saudis. The little girl Janet saw earlier, eyes still on Janet, moves to her brother - he holds her tight, his eyes down. Janet kneels, heart-breaking, holds her hand out: I can help you little one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Little Girl holds a fist out to Janet, tears in her eyes: okay. Janet slowly crouches over to her, the older women's eyes on her, piercing.
</DIRECTION>

(CONT'D) (to the little girl, in Arabic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLONEL_AL_GHAZI>
<DIRECTION>
Little One trembles. One of the women in the corner calls to her in Arabic, sharp. Janet just strokes the back of her little bloody fist. Her little hand opens, shaking: this is a gift for you.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Janet's face ghost white: Little One is trying to give her a marble...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Al-Ghazi steps closer, sees the marble. Processes things. Immediately looks over at the huddled mass: THE GRANDFATHER staring right back at him. We now see the old man clearly. Al- Ghazi shaking, slowly steps to him, hands out...

Al-Ghazi rips Grandfather up now. The family screams. Al- Ghazi pulls the old man's hands from under his thobe: missing fingers. Bends at the knees to look the Old Man right in his eyes, lifts his chin with his hand.

<DIRECTION>
Al-Ghazi's chest explodes before we hear the booms: the 15 year-old Grandson, firing a cheap, nickel-plated 9MM. Everybody drops. The family huddles that much closer to the floor. Al-Ghazi falls back to the floor, pulling Grandfather with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fleury's standing stock still, out-of-body now: He can only see a teenager built like a river-reed, like his own Son... not a Murderer who just shot his friend. Quiet-sick:
</DIRECTION>
<RONALD_FLEURY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Don't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONALD_FLEURY>
<DIRECTION>
The 15 year-old steps to the doorway, pulls the trigger again: the cheap 9MM jams. Janet lifts up with her AK, aims it at the boy's chest.

...The teenager wiping his tears: so he can see clear enough to clear his jammed weapon. Half young boy, the other half something much more dangerous...Expert movements from his hands, racking back the slide, thumbing the still smoking shell from the ejector, letting the slide go, racking another round into the chamber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then... Fleury finally pulls his trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Utter Distortion as the old man reaches for the teenager's fallen hand gun. Janet, screaming, raises her gun towards the old man as Al-Ghazi shoots the old man in the chest. Sobbing, the little boy runs to his fallen grandfather. Janet, still screaming, covers the family. The Grandfather whispers something we cannot hear in the Little Boy's ear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON HAYTHAM taking it all in: the bleeding, dying teenager; his hysterical sister; Hamza choking, clutching for his grandson. CHAOS, CONFUSION, CONFLICT swirling in Haytham's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A platoon of SAUDI POLICE slowly enter the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Janet goes to the shot 15 year old, starts trying to stop the bleeding...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fleury reaching for the dying Al-Ghazi, cradling him. Tears spill as his eyes move from the dying boy to the old man, back down to Al-Ghazi.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fleury grasps Al-Ghazi's hand, as a Saudi man would.

Our crew watch from a deserted terminal as a C-130 touches down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Haytham enters: came to say good-bye. The team's first smiles -- collective. Fleury stares at Haytham...thinks about what he's seen the past few days...how he has come to admire this Kid. Haytham smiling, bandaged himself. Halting and awkward, he shakes Janet's hand.

INT. WASHINGTON FIELD OFFICE - CUBICLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fleury, Sykes, Leavitt and Janet sit around Janet's cubicle. Bandages, awkward silences, and 1000-yard stares. Subpoenas stacked on the corner of Janet's desk. Leavitt quiet, obviously fucked up.
