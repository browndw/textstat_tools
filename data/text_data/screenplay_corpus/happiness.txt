<ALLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I dunno, but whenever I see her I just want to...you know...I want to undress her, I want to tie her up and pump her pump pump pump till she screams bloody murder. And then I want to flip her ass over and pump her even more and so hard my dick shoots right through her and so that my come squirts out of her mouth... Not that I could ever actually...do that... Oh, if only she knew how I felt, how deep down I really cared for her, respected her, she would love me back. Maybe. But she hardly even knows I exist. I mean, she knows I exist – we are neighbors, we smile politely at each other... But I don't know how I could ever begin to really talk to her, what can I talk about? I have nothing to talk about. I'm boring. I know. I've been told before, so don't tell me it's not true. 'Cause it's a fact. I bore people. People look at me and they get bored. They listen to me and they zone out, bored... And for her to see how boring I am...no, no, no... It's better I say nothing... and hope... though right now, I have to say, if I were to suddenly jump out of my window, she wouldn't care. I mean, she'd care, of course, she'd care, I mean, she is human, but I mean she'd care the way you care about a stranger you read about in the paper that jumps in front of a running subway train, a stranger whose name you're never sure how to pronounce, if it's even printed. I'd be an anectode...maybe. But you know what I'm going to do? When I see her next time, as soon as I see her, I'm just going to tell her...tell her I find her...attractive. And that'll be that. Then...then we'll see...

He leans his head against the wall, listens to HELEN making love to somebody next door: "Oh, Helen! Helen! Helen!" etc. He removes his ear from the wall, sits on the bed, a phone book beside him.
</DIRECTION>

He starts flipping randomly through the phone book. He turns to a page. He dials a number from the book. No answer. He sighs. Tries to next number down. A man picks up. ALLEN hangs up immediately. He dials again. A beautiful-sounding WOMAN picks up.

That you'd end up alone, without a career or anything. Really, it's what we all thought. Mom, Dad, Helen...everyone... I'd always prayed we'd all be wrong, but you had always seemed to...doomed to failure. But now I see, it's not true. There is a glimmer of hope for you after all.

<TRISH>
	<DIALOGUE>

</TRISH>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's she doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<TRISH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God, I dunno, and frankly... I'm concerned. I mean, she's not like me. She doesn't "have it all." She pretends to be happy, but I can see right through her: she's miserable.

</TRISH>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you think that is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<TRISH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To be frank, I think she's lazy. She's not a go-getter, like me or Helen. And she's so picky. I gave Damien Ross her phone number, for what it's worth, and Joy sounded interested, naturally, but...I dunno. I'm afraid to have to say it, but truly it's what I believe: she'll always be alone.

	No.

<TRISH>

</TRISH>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. 'Cause you're so secretive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<TRISH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, maybe not as secretive as you.

<HELEN>

	Y'know, people were always putting New Jersey down. None of my friends can believe I live here. But that's because they don't get it: I'm living in a state of irony.

	Are you sure you don't wanna stay and have dinner with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<JOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I know how weird these things can be, but I've always had such faith in Trish's judgment that I thought why not. It's not like I've got some huge social life. I mean, I do have a social life. It's just not huge.

	<DIALOGUE>
	W-why are they going to strike?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOY>
<SUPERVISOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't tell you the half of it: the deceit, the corruption. The union wants to close down the school. They don't care about these poor immigrants. It's heartbreaking. Now I believe in unions, I'm sensitive to their needs, I cried at "The Grapes of Wrath", I sing to Woody Guthrie. But that was another time, another place. Today unions are just a new kind of corporation. It's tragic, but believe me, those teachers making sacrifices for the union, well, the union's not going to make any sacrifices for them. Those union leaders, they go home with pay-checks, the teachers end up with nothing. Now we need people who can be dedicated, who aren't in it just for the money. Because this job takes courage. Do you know what some of these refugees have endured? Concentration camps. And now their dream of coming to America is realized, and this union doesn't care. It's all about greed. Selfishness. Now Joy, can I count on you?
	</DIALOGUE>

	It was finished just a year and a half ago and they've really hardly spent any time here. Supposedly the third bathroom's never even been used. But I've flushed it, so I know it works.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANN>
<DIRECTION>
MONA stands by the windows, looking out.
</DIRECTION>
<ANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The views are spectacular, of course. But what's great is you can see the whole world and at the same time feel entirely alone. It's kind of a double bonus: you get the solitude you need for reflection and soul-searching and the thrill of being "top of the heap."
	</DIALOGUE>

MONA looks at a portrait of a couple hanging in the foyer. The husband has been torn out of it, just as he has been from all the other photographs lying around.

BORIS is silent. He stares off at her place.
</DIRECTION>
<BORIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why you not married?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORIS>
<JOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Boris. Life is different in America. Here a woman can – I know this is hard to understand – but a woman can fulfill her potential. There are opportunities here to do something, do good...really improve the world.

INT. JOY'S PLACE - NIGHT.

<DIRECTION>
Darkness. The sound of a key jiggling. A lock unbolted. Finally the door opens and they walk inside. JOY turns on the lights. An awkward pause.
</DIRECTION>
<JOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll turn on the kettle.

</JOY>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to the stove. Turning back she observes BORIS take off his shoes.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JOY>
<DIRECTION>
BORIS wanders around, observing. JOY feels a little uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<JOY>

</JOY>
<BORIS>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JOY>
<BORIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind songs?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I play.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORIS>
<DIRECTION>
BORIS begins playing and singing a song, perhaps an Olivia Newton-John love ballad. He sings with intense emotion. When he finishes, the kettle whistles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOY brings the teapot to the table and pours for herself and BORIS. BORIS comes to his place and drops a half dozen teaspoons of sugar into his tea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They sit and drink tea. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<JOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like to see my macrame collection?

<DIRECTION>
(BORIS looks confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, but that's Punky! I could never sell Punky. I could never sell any of this.

<BORIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do not be actress. Relax. Boris here.

Well, Pedro was different. Pedro never snickered. Of course, who was he to snicker? He wasn't exactly Tom Cruise. Still, he could have, and he didn't. Well, anyway, one night...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, isn't that nice and friendly, I thought. Thought I also thought, that's a little strange. I'm a little shy, you know, and also I had only one half-gallon. But he said, "Sure!" Well, then he sat down and started telling me about how he had no family, no friends... I started feeling really sorry for him...and I... Well, I guess I felt I shouldn't feel so superior.

</TRISH>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They don't know yet. They're still on vacation.

</BILLY>
<TRISH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, are they gonna be upset.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRISH>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, Ronald's gonna be upset when he finds out the test was cancelled.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Paley was absent also.

</BILLY>
<TRISH>
<DIRECTION>
(chuckles.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, gee!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRISH>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you call Ronald and tell him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but there was no answer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<TRISH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So was Mrs. Paley sick, then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRISH>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, everyone says she was just too strung out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<TRISH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now why do people say things like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRISH>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Cause she's a drug addict.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<TRISH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And how do you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRISH>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom. Everyone knows.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<TRISH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I didn't know. Did you know, Bill?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRISH>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's what everyone says: she's a junkie. And she's probably gonna be fired. It's really sad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<TRISH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if Mrs. Paley turns out, in fact, to be a junkie, then...she should be fired. Don't you think, Bill?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRISH>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Don't you think that's a little harsh? I mean, if it's not affecting her work...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<TRISH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, apparently it is. And no, in fact, I don't think it's a little harsh at all. I'm sorry, but when it comes to drug abuse...and children, my children... Uch, they should all be locked up and throw away the key. I'm serious. And Billy, I want you to know, if you ever even think of doing drugs, and end up dying in a hospital...I'd disown you. That's how strongly I feel. Now I know, Bill, I may sound harsh, but we're talking about our kids. Not to be too grandiose, but this is the future, the future of our country we're talking about, after all.

</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You take care of the kids.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
BILL returns to his guests. They all sit down. BILL is noticeably jittery.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. Now...um...you said something about Ronald Farber?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>

The DETECTIVE is nonplussed.

INT. BILL AND TRISH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRISH is asleep, but BILL is wide awake. He is terrified as he lies in bed, listening to the night sounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He thinks he hears footsteps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up and sees JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>

Holding TIMMY's hand, TRISH comes out the front door in her robe and slippers.

A schoolbus is waiting at the corner.

<DIRECTION>
(calling inside)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hurry up, Billy! The bus is here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRISH>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY rushes out after them, but is too late: the bus has already taken off. Defeated, TRISH, BILLY, and TIMMY turn back to the house, then suddenly stop and look: the words "Rapist" and "Pervert" have been spray-painted onto their housefront.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARK - DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is sunny and warm, the same park seen in Bill's dream earlier in the movie. Couples straight and gay walk hand in hand, families picnic, beautiful people sunbathe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILL observes the pleasant tranquility from atop a hill. But this time he gently approaches everyone and startrs hugging them. Many smiles and tears.

BILL laughs, the PSYCHIATRIST chuckles.

<PSYCHIATRIST>

<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>

ZHENIA abandons JOY at the door and goes back inside, muttering obscenities (in Russian).

	No, thank you. I don't think that's really...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOY>
<DIRECTION>
JOY suddenly notices her guitar lying against the wall opposite. When she turns back to BORIS he is shouting something in Russian at ZHENIA again. ZHENIA shouts something back, and a new quarrel begins. A baby cries somewhere o.s.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When things cool down ZHENIA brings over a tray with pastries and vodka.

</MONA>
<JOY>

<JOY>

	Don't, Mom. 'Cause the thing about family is...no matter how distant you are from each other, separated, estranged, divorced, whatever...no matter how little you can relate to each other...it doesn't matter: you're still family. You're not along... Ya see?
