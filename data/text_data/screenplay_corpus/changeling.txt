EXT. COLLINS HOME - PRE-DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small, pleasant house on a tree-lined street in Los Angeles circa 1928. 210 North Avenue 23. Not far from Dodger Stadium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERIMPOSE: LOS ANGELES, MARCH 9, 1928.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COLLINS HOME - CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM - PRE-DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Bakelite alarm clock hits 6:30 A.M. and RINGS. CHRISTINE COLLINS, thirties, attractive, rumpled, reaches INTO FRAME to shut it off. She sits up, rubs tiredly at her face, and moves OS, switching on a radio as she goes. Music fills the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She throws water on her face as the music continues. She looks at herself in the mirror as the light flickers overhead. She hits the wall offhandedly, something she does every day. The flickering stops. With a last look at the mirror, she smoothes back her hair and exits, switching off the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WALTER'S BEDROOM - LATER Dressed now, she flicks on the overhead light. WALTER COLLINS is nine years old, with light brown hair, though we don't see much of it or him, he's entangled in the sheets. It's important that we don't see him too clearly in most of the following scenes, but without drawing attention to that aspect.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter...time for school, honey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She sits on the edge of the bed, runs a hand through his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just ten more minutes --
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, champ. You can sleep in all you want tomorrow, that's what Saturdays are for. Now hurry up or your breakfast will get cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's cereal, it's supposed to be cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles, kisses him on the forehead, and exits. He sits on the edge of the bed, wavers, then falls back into bed again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PASADENA AVENUE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A street-car (known then as the Big Red) rumbles down the street in the gray light of morning, passing Ford Model A's and Hudsons and Nash four-door sedans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STREET-CAR - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christine sits on one of the benches, Walter's face buried in her lap, still half-asleep. She nudges him as they come to an intersection by a grade school. It's early enough that only a few other kids have arrived.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're here, sweetie. Come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She hands him a sack lunch and follows as he slouches toward the door. She watches from the curb as he heads toward the school. Some of the teachers lounging outside nod to her as Walter approaches, so she knows they're aware that he's there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She waves, then hurriedly gets back on the street-car as it rumbles away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - SWITCHBOARD ROOM - DAY Located on Grand Avenue downtown, the huge switchboard room is a maze of switching stations, tangles of wires and heavy wooden headsets...a roar of buzzers, bells, circuits opening and closing, and a hundred female operators speaking at once.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Supervisors on skates roll up and down the narrow lanes created by the banks of switching stations, going from one operator to another as needed. Christine is one of them. She turns at the SOUND of a bell struck twice, then rolls down the lane toward an OPERATOR frantically waving a pink sheet of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay Sandy, what's the prob--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
The mortified operator hands her the headset and stalks off.
</DIRECTION>
<OPERATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You deal with this one, I'm not going near it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OPERATOR>
<DIRECTION>
Christine struggles on the headset.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. No, I...I've never heard of anything like that before either. Guess there's a first time for everything, right? No, I'm afraid there's nothing we can do about people abusing the equipment or... themselves. I'm sorry. I --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She reacts to the phone being hung up hard at the other end as the floor manager, BEN HARRIS, 30s, approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_HARRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine, Mr. Harris...fine...just someone having a problem with a... with the connection.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_HARRIS>
<MR_HARRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell them to take the plug and shove it in and out a few times, that'll usually do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_HARRIS>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unfortunately that was part of the problem. If you'll excuse me....
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She roller-skates off toward another operator waving another pink sheet of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - LUNCH AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christine sits alone, eating a bag lunch and reading a thick telephone company manual. Working hard to advance herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then a bell rings: time to return to work. Other employees gather up their belongings and start inside. As Christine closes the book, her bookmark falls out. As she picks it up, we see that it's a child's drawing: her and Walter (with arrows indicating who is who) on a green hill, under an orange sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She touches the drawing and smiles as the bell rings again. She grabs her belongs and heads back inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SCHOOL - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christine waits outside the school as another bell rings, announcing the end of classes. Kids run outside, Walter among them. He folds in alongside as they start down the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, sport.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how was school?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. We learned about dinosaurs, and I got in a fight with Billy Mankowski.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He hit me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you hit him back?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. Rule number one: Never start a fight, but always finish it. So why did he hit you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I hit him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
She stops, looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait...you hit him first?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said my dad ran off because he didn't like me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your dad never even had a chance to meet you...so how could he not like you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why did he leave?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<DIRECTION>
Christine takes his hand, and they continue down the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, the same day you were born, something else arrived. It came in the mail, in a box just slightly bigger than you. You know what was in that box?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he shakes head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something called responsibility. Now, to some people, responsibility is fun, it's what you live your whole life for. Other people think it's the scariest thing in the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So he ran away because he was scared of what was in the box?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yup.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's dumb.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I thought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and crouches down in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter, I decided a long time ago that I would always tell you the truth, that I would treat you like a grown-up. I can't expect you to respect me unless I respect you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never lied to you. Your father leaving had nothing to do with you, and everything to do with what was in the responsibility box.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pinky-swear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pinky-swear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She takes his pinky in hers, gives a tug. He smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First one to the corner store gets ice cream!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs and tears off. She runs after him, letting him stay ahead of her the whole way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COLLINS HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walter is asleep on the floor, in front of the radio, which is playing the closing moments of Amos and Andy. Christine enters and turns off the radio. He stirs, looks up at her.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I miss Amos and Andy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid so, sport. Come on now, time for bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She picks him up and carries him up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are we still going to the movies tomorrow?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh. I hear there's a new Charlie Chaplin playing down at Grauman's, and a new serial called The Mysterious Airman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Nobody does. That's what makes him so mysterious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Am I too heavy for you to carry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not for years yet, Walter. Not for years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
And she disappears upstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COLLINS HOME - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just enough to bring us into
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COLLINS HOME - CHRISTINE'S BEDROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>

She's getting ready for the day and is almost out of the room when the phone rings. She hesitates, then picks it up.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Myrna? I know she could use the extra hours. Oh. No, it's just...I promised Walter I'd take him to the movies today. There has to be somebody else....
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, I...guess we can do it tomorrow. I'll get there as soon as I can. But just until four, okay? See you in a bit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She hangs up. She doesn't like this, but there's no way out of it. She straightens and heads out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COLLINS HOME - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A disappointed Walter sits on the couch as Christine puts things together quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a sandwich and milk in the icebox, and I've asked Mrs. Riley if her daughter can stop by in a couple of hours, just to --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can take care of myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course you can. She's coming by to check on the house, not you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She stops in front of him, kneels down to eye height.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tomorrow, we'll go to the movies. Then we'll ride the Big Red down to Santa Monica and walk on the pier. How's that? That okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. I'll be back before it gets dark.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not afraid of the dark. I'm not afraid of anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WALTER>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you're not, honey. That's how I raised you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(kisses his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be good. See you in a bit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She heads out, the screen door clattering shut behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COLLINS HOME - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She crosses the lawn and turns at the sidewalk, glancing back as Walter looks out at her from the window. She waves. He waves back. With one last look, she continues off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PACIFIC TELEPHONE COMPANY - SWITCHBOARD ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
If the place was hectic before, now it's even worse: lines buzzing, voices chattering, operators following Christine around with papers and question.
</DIRECTION>
<OPERATORS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got lines jammed from here to Ohio...he insists on talking to someone in charge...I've tried everything and the console's just dead...I need your signature here for a supply requisition....
	</DIALOGUE>
</OPERATORS>
<DIRECTION>
Christine glances up at the clock, 4:39. She's already late. But she does what's necessary.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, get me the Omaha routing station, see if we can put the calls through their switchers...and let's get that console running....
	</DIALOGUE>

She hurries off to take care of it all, the others following.

START on a clock which reads 5:20, then TILT DOWN as Christine comes out of the switchboard room, pulling on a sweater, ready to leave...as the floor manager steps out of his office.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_HARRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christine...good, I was hoping to catch you. I've been following your work reports, and I just want you to know that I'm very impressed.

She glances down the block. The street car is approaching, but she doesn't want to piss off her boss by running off.
</DIRECTION>

But the streetcar rumbles away before she can catch it. Frustrated, she glances at her watch and sighs resignedly.

Christine sits on the front bench, watching as the shadows lengthen, then pulls the bell. The car rumbles to a stop as she steps out onto the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - EARLY EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She passes a grocery store, where a clock reads 6:15, and continues past other houses on the pleasant, green street. We HEAR parents telling their kids to come in for dinner, radios playing music or radio dramas. Peaceful, charming. Christine smiles, turns the corner, looks to her house --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and it's dark, closed up. No lights on inside, no music or dramas on the radio. Dead silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christine pauses, then picks up her pace. No need to panic, he could be upstairs asleep, could be in the back of the house, where the lights wouldn't show.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to the front door. It's unlocked. She enters --

Nothing. She goes into

A little GIRL on a tricycle rolls past.

	Walter...? Walter....

<DIRECTION>
She starts walking again. Faster now. Looking around trees and porches, anywhere a nine-year-old boy might hide. She hears children playing. Laughing. She picks up her pace, homing in on the sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns the corner to find three children playing, none of them Walter. She looks down the ominously empty streets.

Her worry growing, she heads to the house. Faster now. Heels clicking on the hard sidewalk.

One operator holds up a pink request sheet. Christine starts toward her, but then the operator glances to another supervisor and hands it off. Knowing she has to do something about this, she turns to the room and, in a firm, clear voice, says:

INT. POLICE CAR - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the car door SLAMS and she and the boy sit side by side. The silence is in profound contrast to the madness of a moment earlier. An officer gets in they drive off, passing Jones and the Chief of Police, talking quietly off to one side.

Christine looks to the boy. He smiles at her.

INT. COLLINS HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

The only noise is the clock on the wall, ticking. Christine sits at one end of the table, "Walter" at the other. Studying him. He is finishing a sandwich, not meeting her gaze.

Carrying a pair of pajamas, Christine comes into the hall and stops in front of the bathroom door. Knocks.

	I'm not running away from anything, least of all my responsibilities. I'm even taking care of that boy because right now I'm all he has. What worries me is that you've stopped looking for Walter.

Christine is cooking dinner when the doorbell rings. She opens the door to find a police officer and DR. EARL W. TARR, sixties, mildly eccentric in appearance.

	Mrs. Collins? Dr. Earl W. Tarr. Captain Jones sent me. I consult with him from time to time on juvenile cases. May I come in?

<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh...yes, of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She steps aside, and Dr. Tarr enters, looking around.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you for coming. I'm surprised Captain Jones moved so quickly. I was starting to think he didn't believe me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DR_TARR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm here now, and we'll put all that to rights. Where is the boy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_TARR>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up as "Walter" comes downstairs. Noting that he said "the boy," not "your son," Christine looks relieved.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_TARR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah! There he is. A handsome young man. He has your eyes, doesn't he? And a little bit of the nose. Very fit, in spite of all his travails. A very resilient boy you've got here, Mrs. Collins.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As he bends down to look more closely at "Walter," Christine stiffens...she can't have heard that right.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doctor Tarr, I thought you were here to help me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DR_TARR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am. Captain Jones said the boy had gone through some extreme physical changes, and asked me to look in on him...to reassure you in this your time of motherly concern.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_TARR>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My "motherly concern" isn't for him because he's not my son.

	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DR_TARR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, well...hardly a mystery, Mrs. Collins. We've known for some time that trauma can affect the growth of children. Given the stress of the last four months his spine may have actually shrunk. It's uncommon, but within the realm of possibility.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_TARR>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the circumcision?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DR_TARR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very likely his abductor thought it appropriate. After all, circumcision is hygienically sound. Must have been quite traumatic at the time. No wonder he's submerged the memory.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_TARR>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, doctor --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DR_TARR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you can see, there's a perfectly sound medical explanation for all of this. But it's good for you to raise these questions. You should be apprised of all changes the lad went through during his absence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_TARR>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wouldn't I know whether or not he was my son? I'm his mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DR_TARR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which means you're in no position to be objective. You are looking through the prism of extreme emotion at a boy who has changed from what you remember. He isn't the same boy that left here, just as a boy who goes off to war and returns isn't the same anymore A mother's heart, driven by intuition and emotion rather than logic, sees these changes and rebels, insists that this cannot be your son. But that doesn't change the facts.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm willing to put my theory to the test of objectivity, Mrs. Collins... are you?

Before she can react, he takes Walter by the hand and leads him outside. Christine follows them out to --

<DIRECTION>
EXT. COLLINS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

-- as Dr. Tarr strides onward, the police officer and "Walter" walking alongside as Christine brings up the rear. A few houses down they come to a group of CHILDREN playing.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_TARR>

	Hello, children, my name is Dr. Earl W. Tarr. I'd like to ask you some questions.

<1ST_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mom says we're not supposed to talk to strangers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</1ST_KID>
<DR_TARR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good boy. Quite right. But as you see I'm with the police, so it's all right. Now, I'm sure you know Mrs. Collins here, and her son, Walter. How many of you recognize this young boy as Walter Collins?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_TARR>
<DIRECTION>
He looks from one child to the other. They don't reply. Either they don't recognize him, or they're intimidated.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_TARR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, now, no need to be afraid. Surely you knew Walter, and played with him? So which of you can identify Walter for me, for his mother, and for the police? This officer would want you to do the right thing as good young citizens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_TARR>
<DIRECTION>
The kids exchange a glance. It's clear they don't recognize the boy, but they're intimidated by the presence of Tarr and the police officer. A few reluctantly raise their hands. Another of them goes to "Walter," who is shorter than he is.
</DIRECTION>
<2ND_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter was as tall as me....
	</DIALOGUE>
</2ND_KID>
<DR_TARR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, precisely. He was as tall as you. Now he's not. He's lost a little height, you see. It's a thing called trauma. With luck, none of you will ever have to find out about it yourselves. So other than that, do you recognize this as your friend, Walter Collins?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_TARR>
<2ND_KID>

He heads off again, like some very tall, strange bird marching down the street. Christine exchanges a look with the kids, then heads off to follow.

Tarr, Christine, Mrs. Riley, the officer and "Walter" stand on the porch.

"Walter" is in bed, his back to the door, as Christine appears in the hallway. She steps into the room, sits on the bed.

He doesn't move. Her voice is soft, but firm.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was wrong to yell at you. You're still a child, and I think you don't really understand what you're doing, the hurt you're causing. Maybe this is all just some big game of pretend to you, but I need you to understand. Walter is...he's all I have, he's everything to me, and every day we lose because of this puts him further away from where I can help him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever the police think, whatever the world thinks, we know the truth, don't we? We both know you're not Walter. Getting you to admit that may be the only chance I have to straighten this out before it's too late. Maybe you're afraid of getting in trouble, that you're in too deep. But you're not. You don't have to tell me who you are, you just have to tell them who you're not. Just... tell them the truth.

	Lovely bit of phrasing, isn't it? Noticed since the return of the boy to his mother. Not only does it state clearly that you are the boy's mother, one could infer from this that you are somehow responsible for these changes...and that the police are concerned for the boy's welfare in your hands.

<DR_TARR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would say that the boy has either been coached or questioned to a point where he is largely confused about what happened to him those many months. It's possible that his mental lapse may be the result of a blow to the head or a sudden shock which brought about a possible cranial injury. I believe that this condition will pass soon. Until then, I recommend that the police department continue working with him, exposing him to whatever elements of his previous life as may help restore his memory.

(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She suffers from paranoia, delusions of persecution, and dislocation from reality. She may be a threat to herself or others. We recommend that she be conveyed to the psychopathic ward for treatment and observation until her senses can be restored.

She stops, noting the looks exchanged between the nurse and the matron. Her story sounds insane, even to her. She begins to realize the depth of her predicament.

INT. HALL - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wet hair plastered to her face, dressed in a hospital gown, Christine is led down a long hall by the Nurse. As she passes the closed doors, we HEAR women weeping, talking to themselves, crying out, screaming, beating on the walls. Fingers poke through narrow viewing slits in the doors.

The Nurse pulls out a key-ring and unlocks one of the doors.

	Inside.

CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
EXT. OLD ROAD - EARLY EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lone truck sits beside the road, hood open, steam coming from the radiator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GORDON NORTHCOTT, thirties, thin and angular, finishes working on the car as a police car approaches. The detective we saw earlier, Ybarra, is inside. He rolls down the window.
</DIRECTION>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Problem?

	Overheated, that's all. She'll be fine in a bit.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, could you give me a hand? I'm trying to find a place called the Northcott Ranch, up by Wineville.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<DIRECTION>
As he answers, Gordon moves casually to the back of the open truck to get a rag to wipe his hands. There is a GUN on the floor of the trunk. Gordon picks it up inside the rag.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Northcott Ranch...oh yeah. You're almost there. Follow this west for about two, three miles. Then the next right. That'll bring you right to it. Something going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just looking into a juvenile matter. Thanks for the help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<DIRECTION>
Ybarra drives away. As soon as he's out of sight, Gordon slams the hood, runs to the driver's side and starts the truck, still steaming. He drives off as fast as he can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NORTHCOTT RANCH - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long, low house, stonework and brick and wood, behind a large open area cluttered with junked cars. At the far end of the open area is a chicken coop, about fifteen feet long. Ybarra drives up in front of the house, gets out, looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<YBARRA>

Ybarra glances off to a rustling SOUND, and follows it to
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHICKEN COOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few chickens inside, held back by wire. An ax is nearby, its stained edge buried in an old wooden stump. A corner of the coop seems to have come down and been crudely repaired.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As suddenly someone runs across the dirt yard into the house, SLAMMING the door. Ybarra runs to the porch, tries the door. Locked from the inside. He pounds on the door.
</DIRECTION>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the police. I have a warrant for a minor named Sanford Clark. Open the door and stand aside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<DIRECTION>
No reply. He braces himself and KICKS open the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE - KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door BANGS against the wall. Flies buzz around the place. The kitchen is in shadows, but there's no question it's a mess. Ybarra moves cautiously through the kitchen. No sound except the wood creaking beneath his feet as he enters
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Old, musty, shadowed. The ticking of an old grandfather clock. There's no one in sight. Ybarra moves down the hall, glances into two adjoining rooms. Nothing. He continues into
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Curtains drawn, dark, cocooned against the outside world. Ybarra makes a circuit of the room, then STOPS at a creak of wood from a CLOSET. He moves toward it. Pauses. Reaches for the doorknob...as suddenly a clock CHIMES loudly and the closet explodes outward and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- SANFORD CLARK, 15, runs out. He slams into Ybarra, knocking him down. They go down in a tumble of limbs, wrestling on the floor as Sanford tries to escape.
</DIRECTION>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it! Stop it or I'll push your face through the floor!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Breathing hard, Sanford finally stops struggling. Ybarra cuffs Sanford's hands behind his back.
</DIRECTION>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On your feet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<DIRECTION>
Sanford stands, and as Ybarra leads him out, we PAN TO a mantle and a photo that shows Sanford Clark and a man we recognize as the one we saw by the road earlier: Gordon Northcott.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. YBARRA'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ybarra locks Sanford in the car, then climbs in the driver's side. He checks a cut on his face in the rear-view mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus...what the hell's wrong with you? Don't you know assaulting a cop is against the law?

	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Sanford starts laughing. It's a nearly hysterical laugh, half fear and half relief...Ybarra isn't there for the reasons he thought. Ybarra is puzzled by his reaction.
</DIRECTION>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't know Canada was that funny.

Ybarra puts the car into gear and drives off.

Christine is on top of the bed, eyes open, not having slept all night. She's staring at the woman on the next cot. THe woman is staring back at her. The second-hand on a clock behind protective chicken-wire passes 8:00 and a loud BELL goes off, announcing the start of the day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear doors being unlocked up and down the hall. Christine stands, pulls her hair back, and catches her reflection in the window: pale, drawn, smudged, and in a hospital gown... looking like someone who actually belongs in this place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and she steps into the hall as a NURSE passes.

Christine and the other patients sit at long tables. A few talk in quiet whispers, but most eat silently, staring vacantly ahead. Some have scars showing lobotomies or electro- convulsive (shock) therapy. It's a scary bunch. Christine isn't eating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another female patient, CAROL DEXTER, thirties, watches Christine then slides closer. A BEAT, then:
</DIRECTION>
<CAROL_DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should eat. Eating is normal. You got to do everything you can to look normal. That's the only chance you've got. Besides, you'll need the strength.

Christine is startled by the level-headedness of the advice from someone she assumed was probably nuts. Reluctantly, she begins eating the cold-looking oatmeal.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I'll just have to prove that I'm not insane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<CAROL_DEXTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? How? The more you try to act sane, the crazier you start to look. If you smile too much, you're delusional or stifling hysteria. If you don't smile, you're depressed. If you're neutral you're emotionally withdrawn and potentially catatonic.

</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon climbs into the truck and goes to shove his bag under the seat...when something metallic bangs underneath. He lifts out a short length of metal pipe.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry about that, pal. Just a little insurance. A couple of guys tried to hijack my truck a few years ago so they could run booze over the border. You can't be too safe, you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I surely do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon smiles, moves as if to hand the pipe back...and suddenly SLAMS it DOWN on the Driver's head...over and over and over. Blood splatters his face. Breathing hard, Gordon shoves the Driver out of the truck into the undergrowth then drives off.

INT. HOSPITAL - MENTAL WARD - HALLWAY - DAY

Wearing a bandage on one arm, Christine is escorted down the hall by one of the nurses. She's led into --

<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL - STEELE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- where DOCTOR JONATHAN STEELE stands as Christine enters. He's in his fifties, heavy-set, serious.
</DIRECTION>
<STEELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Collins...Dr. Jonathan Steele. Please, have a seat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEELE>
<DIRECTION>
The nurse leaves. Christine notes that there are three chairs in a row. Could be a test. She sits in the middle chair. Sits as straight as she can. Trying to look sane.
</DIRECTION>
<STEELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope your stay has been comfortable so far.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEELE>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<STEELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? I'd think it would be quite difficult at first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEELE>
<CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(catching herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it was. Difficult, I mean. But comfortable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
He makes a note of this. She grimaces. This isn't going well. He motions to the bandage on her arm.
</DIRECTION>
<STEELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see they took a blood test.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEELE>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wasserman Test. To check for syphilis. Apparently it can affect the mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<STEELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The idea that someone thinks you should be checked for syphilis...did that upset you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEELE>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Not at all. I'm sure it's... standard procedure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles a forced smile. Trying to appear level-headed.
</DIRECTION>
<STEELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Exactly. Standard procedure. We have to cover all bases, and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEELE>
<CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
(covering her bases)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But...at the same time...I imagine that it would be...would probably be upsetting to...some people that someone else might...suspect that of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	However inappropriate that might be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
She flashes another wan smile. He makes another note, picks up the report on his desk, glances it over.
</DIRECTION>
<STEELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	According to your file, you believe the police have substituted a fake boy for your son. Is that true?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEELE>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't say they substituted a fake boy, just...not the right boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They brought back the wrong boy. Not my son. He's still missing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
He starts pulling out papers from his file.
</DIRECTION>
<STEELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's strange...you see, I have here a newspaper article with a photo of you at the train station, welcoming your son home. That is you in the photo, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEELE>
<STEELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So at first he was your son, but now he's not your son.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Has this been going on for a long time? People...changing, becoming something other than what they are?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEELE>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People don't change, doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<STEELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't think people change?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEELE>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not what I --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<STEELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the police...they're not out to persecute you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEELE>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Of course not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<STEELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The police are here to protect us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEELE>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
He nods. She's trying to say what she thinks he wants to hear. It's a chess match that ends with:
</DIRECTION>
<STEELE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's odd, because according to the head nurse, when you were admitted you accused the police of conspiring to do this deliberately, to punish you. So either she and the interns are also conspiring against you...or you're changing your story.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you often have trouble telling reality from fantasy, Mrs. Collins?

He sits back. Christine's face tells the story.

It's raining. The Administrator enters with Detective Ybarra.
</DIRECTION>
<ADMINISTRATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry to bring you out in this weather, detective, but the boy has been quite insistent.
	</DIALOGUE>
<YBARRA>

	It's all right, I'll just see what he has to say so I can go home and get dry. Where is he?

	Room seven.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A single table, two chairs. Sanford sits quietly, nervously, as Ybarra hangs his wet coat up on a hook.
</DIRECTION>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's raining cats, dogs and democrats out there, so this better be worth it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<DIRECTION>
He sits across the table from Sanford, lights up a cigarette. Sanford's mouth works for a moment, but nothing comes out.
</DIRECTION>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<SANFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I -- this isn't easy, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANFORD>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<DIRECTION>
A long BEAT. Sanford composes himself, begins:
</DIRECTION>
<SANFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My cousin's Gordon Northcott. He owns the ranch where you found me. He let me live there in exchange for watching the place when he was gone, doing chores, stuff like that. Said I could stay on as long as I wanted to. I figured that also meant I could leave whenever I wanted to, but he wouldn't let me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANFORD>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you saying he held you prisoner?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sanford nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bull. When I got to the ranch you were running around free as a jaybird. Could've left any time you wanted. So what's this, some kind of story to cover why you were in the country illegally?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<SANFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...no, it's nothing like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANFORD>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I don't have time for --
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<SANFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me, please. He said --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANFORD>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? What did he --
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<SANFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said that if I tried to leave, he'd kill me! You don't understand, you don't know what he's like, what he...what we did...what he made me do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Sanford is in tears by now. Ybarra realizes that there's something real going on here, and backs off.
</DIRECTION>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, lets start at the beginning. What did he make you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<DIRECTION>
Sanford closes his eyes. Takes a long beat. Finally....
</DIRECTION>
<SANFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Him and me...me and Gordon, we...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat, softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...we killed some kids.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Ybarra freezes, the cigarette not moving in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<SANFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't mean to, I swear...he made me help him, said if I didn't he'd kill me, too. Please, you gotta help me...I'm scared...I don't want to go to Hell for killing kids.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANFORD>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kids?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<SANFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know...I never knew their names.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANFORD>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many kids?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SANFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All together?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<DIRECTION>
He thinks about it for a moment. The fact that he has to add them all up is almost as chilling as what follows next.
</DIRECTION>
<SANFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About...twenty, I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANFORD>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're lying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<SANFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's true, I swear!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANFORD>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty kids.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<SANFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...thereabouts...I kinda stopped counting after a while, and Gordon said one or two might've gotten away, but --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANFORD>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody can just up and kill twenty kids --
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<SANFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We did...yeah, we did that....
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANFORD>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<DIRECTION>
Sanford looks off, pauses, then, softly and slowly....
</DIRECTION>
<SANFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most times we'd bring back just one or two...sometimes as many as three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANFORD>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NORTHCOTT RANCH - FLASHBACK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon is at his truck, the same one we saw earlier, checking the engine as Sanford looks on nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<SANFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I always knew when he was getting ready 'cause he'd go through the car and clean it up, make sure the tires were good, the engine...he was always afraid something'd break down and we'd be caught.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon slams the hood shut, looks to Sanford. Smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A kid is walking down the street, playing idly, by himself, as the truck starts to approach from behind.
</DIRECTION>
<SANFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'd go a different direction every time, never hit the same part of town twice. Sometimes we'd go for hours, just driving around, until we found somebody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANFORD>
<DIRECTION>
The truck comes beside the kid and Gordon leans out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<SANFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'd use all kinds of different stories. Sometimes he'd say he had free tickets for the circus, or he was looking for a lost dog...that one worked real good. Other days --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANFORD>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you are, we've been looking for you like mad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH-IMAGE: to a different kid, a different street.
</DIRECTION>
<KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure thing. Your folks, they got in an accident. They sent us to find you. They're hurt real bad. The police took 'em to the hospital, but they didn't have time to come find you, so we said we'd do it. Now come on, hurry...we gotta get to the hospital, see your folks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH-IMAGE: Yet another kid, who hesitates, looks to Sanford.
</DIRECTION>
<SANFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A lot of kids won't get in a car alone with a stranger, but when he's got a kid there with him, that made it easier.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'd look to me, and figure if I was safe, they would be too. That's why he needed me, see?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SANFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay. Come on in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANFORD>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH-IMAGE: Back to the first kid, who takes one last BEAT, then gets into the car.
</DIRECTION>
<SANFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Every time they got in the truck, it was like I wanted to die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANFORD>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good boy! Now hold on, it's a long drive and we gotta fly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
And the truck heads off.
</DIRECTION>
<SANFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then, as soon as we got back to the ranch...they went in the coop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANFORD>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NORTHCOTT RANCH - CHICKEN COOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy, crying, is tossed into the chicken coop. There are two other boys there, also crying and screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<SANFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some days he'd do 'em right off. Other days, he'd wait, pick up a few more, keep 'em in the coop until he had like four or five, 'cause --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- 'cause he liked to hear 'em scream all at once. Like they were some kinda chorus. And then....

</SANFORD>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK IMAGES

<DIRECTION>
Gordon, eyes insane with blood lust, stumbles toward the coop.
</DIRECTION>
<SANFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and then....
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANFORD>
<DIRECTION>
The kids, screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sanford looking on, afraid to move, the single overhead light in the coop swinging wildly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon grabbing an ax. Raising it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On Sanford's eyes, terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ax begins to fall in SLOW MOTION and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE -- as the long ash at the end of Ybarra's cigarette, TUMBLES to the floor in SLOW MOTION, end over end, SHATTERING when it hits the floor and bringing us back to full speed.
</DIRECTION>
<SANFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes...sometimes he'd leave one or two of 'em alive...barely anyway...and tell me...finish 'em. Finish 'em...or I'll finish you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I did...I did...oh god...oh, sweet Jesus...I killed 'em...I killed 'em...I killed 'em....
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Then: silence, except for Sanford's sobbing. Ybarra realizes he hasn't been breathing. He tries to find his voice.
</DIRECTION>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These...uhm...these kids...do you think...if you saw them again, do you think you'd recognize them?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sanford nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to his coat and pulls out a batch of photos of missing kids bound with a rubber band. Hands it to Sanford.
</DIRECTION>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't updated these in a while, but still, it should be....
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just go through...and if you see any faces you recognize, put it on the table.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<DIRECTION>
Sanford takes the photos. Starts going through them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A photo, a face, goes down on the table. Then another. A third. With each photo slapped down the SLAP gets louder, BOOMING at us. Another photo. Another. Row after row. He's crying, sobbing, but still putting down photos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he SLAMS down the last one and half-falls, half-stumbles out of his chair, sobbing...goes to the corner of the room and slides down the wall until he's sitting in a fetal position, hands covering his face. Sobbing uncontrollably.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Numb, Ybarra goes to the table, picks up a photo. Looks at it. Turns it over to the name, then picks up another. Then a third. When he picks up the fourth photo and turns it over, he stops, staring at it.
</DIRECTION>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...shit....
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The name on the back of the photo is WALTER COLLINS.

	With all due respect, sir, I don't think so. You didn't see him, the kid's scared half out of his mind --

Just then a secretary sticks her head in the doorway.

<DIRECTION>
He's drawn to the window by the sound of voices. He peeks through the slats. Several dozen placard-carrying parishioners and members of the Women's Temperance League are standing in the street, beating drums and calling Christine's name.
</DIRECTION>
<JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus jumped down....

He realizes he's still on the phone.

	Ybarra? Listen. You're not to do anything except come back here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, department policy requires that all allegations of homicide have to be investigated. And these are kids, for chrissakes --

</YBARRA>
<JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Departmental policy is what I say it is, you got that? Now I'm ordering you to get your ass back here with that kid, you got that? You bring him here and you talk to no one, got it? Nobody!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<DIRECTION>
He slams the phone down. CUT BACK TO --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Ybarra in juvenile hall, agonizing over this. Finally, his voice resigned, he looks into the interrogation room.

	All right, let's go.

Then a pair of metal pincers, points covered in cloth, are pressed against her temples. A button is pushed...and her body goes RIGID as a jolt of electricity blasts through her body. (This was, remember, fairly common practice for violent behavior in the 1920s.)

<DAVIS>

	The Mayor wants this to go away. I want this to go away. The way you do that is to stop insisting that Walter Collins was not among those kids killed up at that goddamned ranch. Because if the boy you brought back isn't Walter Collins, and he's not dead up at that ranch, then where the hell is he? People will want to know why we haven't found him. Why we aren't we doing our job.

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But if, on the other hand, he is, or could be among those poor boys killed up in Wineville...then the inquiries stop. It's a momentary embarrassment that you'll have to live with...but better a short inconvenience than a lingering problem, wouldn't you say, Captain?

	The boy's been gone for nearly a year. If he was going to be found, it would've happened by now. Whether he was up at that ranch or not, the truth is he probably is dead somewhere. Better his mother accepts that now rather than later, don't you think?

But it wouldn't hurt to find out just who the fuck that kid is you brought back from De Kalb and why he did this, because the press bought into his bullshit same as we did.

Ybarra holds up a missing persons sheet.

	Checks out. The report was filed by his divorced mother, who lives in Clinton, Iowa with the boy's grandmother. Apparently he didn't like living with the old lady, she didn't let him get away with the stuff he usually got away with, and one day...he up and left.

	What about the man he showed up with at the diner?

</YBARRA>
<YBARRA>

	Just some drifter. The boy was hungry, ran into this guy who said he knew how to get some food and not have to pay for it. Only when they finished, he left the kid behind while he cut out. When the police picked him up, they started going through the wire reports about missing kids --

INT. ROWHOUSE - BATHROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon is toweling off his hair when he hears a car door slam shut. Then another. He peers out the window. Several Royal Canadian Mounted Police cars have pulled up along the street. Mounties are getting out, moving quietly toward the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bob quietly lets the Mounties in. They signal for Bob to get the hell out of there. Guns in hand, they climb the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly there's the SOUND of breaking glass from above. They race up the stairs to find the window broken, and Gordon fleeing across an adjoining rooftop.
</DIRECTION>
<MOUNTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go around the other side! Cut him off!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOUNTIE>
<DIRECTION>
The others take off as he and another Mountie climb through the broken window in pursuit of Northcott.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROWHOUSES - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon races up one rooftop, over the top, then leaps to the next one as, below, Mounties race to keep up with him, WHISTLES blowing furiously. He looks behind him to see the other two Mounties running rooftop to rooftop, coming fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon runs faster, going at angles to put more distance between himself and the police on the ground...and making increasingly more difficult and dangerous leaps from rooftop to rooftop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leaps across one chasm, barely makes it, keeps running. The rooftop Mounties follow. One of them makes the jump successfully, but the other falls short, plummeting to the ground three stories below. A leg snaps on impact. The first Mountie hesitates, looks down. The second one waves him on.
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_MOUNTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on! Get the bastard!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_MOUNTIE>
<DIRECTION>
He nods and continues the chase. Gordon runs for all he's worth. The Mountie keeps after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon makes another leap. The Mountie jumps...but he's short. He grabs onto a rain gutter. Gordon sees his situation, runs back, and STOMPS on the Mountie's hands, trying to get him to shake loose. The gutter starts to tear free --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- when a Mountie down below FIRES at Gordon, making him back off. The Mountie clinging to the gutter starts to fall, then grabs a nearby pipe and crawls up to the roof. Keeps coming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon keeps running...but comes to a chasm too wide to be jumped. He hesitates, starts to cut back in another direction --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- when the Mountie TACKLES him hard. The two go down in a tangle of limbs, fighting, punching, kicking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They SLIDE down the steeply angled roof and barely avoid going over the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With nowhere else to run, Gordon fights for all he's got, the punches from both coming fast and furious. Finally, the Mountie backs off just a bit --
</DIRECTION>
<MOUNTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Screw this...I'm too old for this fightin' shit....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOUNTIE>
<DIRECTION>
-- and DIVES at Gordon, taking them both off the edge of the two-story roof and DOWN into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- a garden below, CRASHING through carefully manicured flowers and trees to land with a THUD, the Mountie's impact cushioned by Gordon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the other Mounties come on the run, the first one staggers to his feet and yanks up a bruised, bleeding but otherwise intact Gordon. Looks at him nose-to-nose.
</DIRECTION>
<MOUNTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YOU...ARE UNDER...ARREST!

And he YANKS Gordon toward the other waiting officers.

	Gentlemen...gentlemen, please. As Mayor of Los Angeles, it is my duty to preserve the peace in our city, which has been disrupted by recent events in the case of Christine Collins. As a result, we have decided that Captain J. J. Jones of the Lincoln Heights Division is to be suspended from active duty, effective immediately.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the charge, Chief?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<CHIEF_DAVIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The charge is conduct unbecoming an officer, and using improper and abusive language toward Mrs. Collins. It further charges that he exceeded his authority as a police officer by incarcerating Mrs. Collins on the alleged charge of insanity without sufficient cause.

	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<MAYOR_CRYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've heard this, yes. But since one of the main purposes of such a hearing by the City Council would be to suspend Captain Jones, and since that action has now been taken, the question is moot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAYOR_CRYER>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which makes it look like the only reason Jones is being suspended is to head off the City Council investigation. Are you concerned that an outside investigation might go uncomfortably high up the food chain?

	Sorry to barge in so late, Mrs. Collins, but it took me a while to find the right people for the right job.

The same police car is there as Christine gets into a car with Briegleb and the two drive off. The other three men get into another car and follow. The police car in turn pulls away from the curb, following both cars. EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - BRIEGLEB'S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

He's aware that they're being followed, glancing in the rear view mirror to keep an eye on things. Looks over to Christine, smiles encouragingly. Looks ahead.

	Traffic's getting heavy. We'll go up Spring.

He turns. The other cars do the same. But the traffic here is even worse. Just then, Briegleb looks back in his rear view mirror to see --

<DIRECTION>
-- another police car pulling out of a driveway and cutting off the car with Christine's bodyguards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Briegleb turns quickly, trying to get ahead, but the street's too busy. He looks in the mirror to see that another police car glide into position two cars behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Traffic stops. Jammed. Briegleb is nervous, sensing the very real possibility of a hit being set up. The traffic is lined right up against parked cars on either side. Then there's a momentary break in traffic.

<BRIEGLEB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on.

</BRIEGLEB>
<DIRECTION>
They do. He glances back at the police car. The two inside start to open the doors, but they can't get them open, being right up against parked cars on one side and traffic on the other. They run the siren to clear traffic, but it's too late as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Christine and Briegleb hurry down the street on foot, Briegleb glancing behind them. The foot- and car-traffic is very heavy...we HEAR horns honking and, in the distance, something that could be the sound of lots of people.

The Salvation Army, the Women's Temperance Society, the Society for Justice, Catholic groups, Union groups and ordinary citizens carrying placards and signs that read WE SUPPORT CHRISTINE COLLINS and JUSTICE FOR MRS.

Dead silence, in marked contrast to the city council room. As she enters, she sees people sitting silently in the gallery...row after row of couples, mothers and fathers, some weeping softly. Some of them notice Christine's entrance and nod to her with sadness and a strange sense of common bond...they are all carrying the same grief.

As Christine looks on, Gordon Stewart Northcott is ushered into the courtroom for his initial plea. Some women break into tears at the sight of him. He first seems startled by the presence of so many, then he smiles. An audience.

As he takes his place beside his attorney, he looks down the room and meets the gaze of Christine Collins. Her face pales, as though slapped...but she doesn't look away.

	Hey...I saw you in the papers. You got a lot of moxie, standing up to the police like that.

<JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whether or not this was in fact the correct boy was not relevant to my decision. Throughout this period, she acted strangely. She was often cool, aloof and unemotional, especially when presented with the boy we located in De Kalb, and in our subsequent conversations. It was because of her disturbing behavior that I submitted her for observation to the psychopathic ward of Los Angeles County General Hospital.

	That's correct. There was no need to serve the warrant since she was at that time already in custody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<HAHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me see if I have this straight. A woman was thrown into the psychopathic ward without a warrant, because no warrant existed, and when it was finally written six days later, there was no need to sign it or go to a judge because she was already in the asylum! Is this correct, Captain?

A small crowd is assembled at the front of the station, where Chief Davis stands with the Boy who had been "Walter" as a train pulls up before them.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEF_DAVIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- so after much effort, we were able to identify this boy, who was has been responsible for so much recent trouble, as Arthur Hutchins of Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Between this, and the arrest of the man suspected of murdering the real Walter Collins, we have cleared up two of the biggest mysteries in the history of Los Angeles.

Just then, he turns as a Matron comes off the train with JANET HUTCHINS, middle thirties, the boy's mother.

	Ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to the boy's real mother, Mrs. Janet Hutchins.

</CHIEF_DAVIS>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to him and hugs him. "Walter" looks like he wishes he were somewhere on Mars. Davis moves closer to them to be in frame while the FLASHBULBS pop. She's in the same pose as they got Christine to take when she "accepted" her lost son.

	Gordon Stewart Northcott, you have been found guilty of murder, the penalty for which is death by hanging. There have been no stays or reprieves, therefore the execution will go forward as stipulated under the laws of the State of California. Do you have any last words?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WARDEN>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...nothing.

(to chaplain)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I kept clean after I confessed, reverend...just like I said I would.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
The chaplain nods silently as the warden looks to the guards, who begin to escort Northcott up the steps to the gallows.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will it...will it hurt?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(no reply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please...not so fast...don't make me walk so fast!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
They struggle with him now, pushing and carrying him up the last of the thirteen steps to the top. They tie his legs together, and cinch his arms tightly in place.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thirteen steps...thirteen steps... but I didn't touch all of 'em, you bastards...I didn't touch all of 'em!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
They start to slip a black felt mask over his head and secure the rope. He looks desperately to the witnesses.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A prayer! Please, somebody, say a prayer for me!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The mask goes on and is tightened into place. The executioner approaches the handle that will open the trap door. The warden looks to the clock...9:59. From beneath the hood we HEAR, in a terrified, shaking voice:
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Silent night...holy night...all is calm...all is bright...round yon virgin mother and child...holy infant so tender and mild --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
Just then the warden nods to the executioner who pulls the lever and the trap door JERKS OPEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Northcott FALLS through the door six feet then there's a SNAP...and the body bounces in SLOW MOTION at the end of the rope...as we HEAR the sound of his heart slowing...slowing...until it finally stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christine covers her eyes. There is no cheering in the witness room. Only the sound of weeping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAN QUENTIN - NIGHT

Slowly, the witnesses exit the prison. We find Christine among them. She nods good-night to some of them, including the Clays, then starts off on her own, heading into the night.

He nods, taking the rejection well. Starts off when:

<CHRISTINE>

Christine is ushered into a room with a long two-way mirror that looks out into an interview room. Mr. and Mrs. Clay are already there. In the other room is Detective Ybarra, and a young boy, DAVID, age 13. Mrs. Clay sees her, and they embrace.

Mr. Clay motions for them to shush. They turn their attention to the other room, where Ybarra looks up from making notes.

	All right, so after you got into the car, what happened next?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<DAVID>

</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NORTHCOTT RANCH - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

David is shoved into the chicken coop. Several other BOYS are already there, scared, crying. They lunge at the door, trying to get out, but it slams shut in their faces.

They scream, trying to get out. Gordon SLAMS an arm against the door, scaring them.

INT. CHICKEN COOP - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Two of the kids, Walter and Jeffrey, are sitting in a corner, talking quietly, urgently.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walter and Jeffrey were talking when everybody else was screaming. They were scared, same as the rest of us, but they weren't scared stupid. They kept checking around until they found a part of the coop where the chicken wire was all messed up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
They pull at the wiring. Part of the roof weakens and dust sifts down.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They figured we might be able to yank the chicken wire and bring down the corner, maybe make enough room to get out of there and run... but it would make an awful lot of noise and if it wasn't wide enough, we'd be stuck. It might even bring the whole place down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<WALTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We gotta try it!

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you want to go home? Don't you want to see your mom again?

The Winslow kids nod, and start crying. Jeffrey and Walter look to the rest.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anybody else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
David holds up his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Anybody who doesn't want to come, get over at that end in case this comes down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
The Winslow boys and two others scramble to the other end, too terrified to try and escape. Jeffrey, David and Walter go to the weakened corner of the coop.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When we get out, we split up, go in different directions, they can't catch all of us. Ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They nod, and get into position, each taking a part of the wire framework.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pull!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
They do so, pulling for all they're worth...struggling...the ceiling SHIFTS above them, dirt falling all over the place... they pull harder, the wire cutting into fingers, but still pulling...then suddenly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the corner FALLS AWAY, part of the roof starting to come down with it. The NOISE is substantial.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFFREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFFREY>
<DIRECTION>
They race out the opening, Jeffrey first, then Walter, then David...but just as the first two get clear --
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Walter turns to see David stuck in the wiring. LIGHTS go on around the ranch. He hesitates...then RUNS back to David, helps to untangle him. They HEAR a SHOTGUN blast, and FEET running their way.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hurry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Walter gets him untangled, and the two RACE away from the coop, running for all they're worth as a FLASHLIGHT hits first one, then the other. They RUN --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and David catches one last glimpse of Walter running, heading for the line of trees....
</DIRECTION>
<YBARRA>

	That's the last I saw of any of 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you don't know if either of the other two were captured?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. All I know is, if he hadn't come back for me...I don't think I ever would've gotten out of there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened after that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hid in the woods for two days, too scared to move, because I was sure they'd find me. I finally started walking, but every time a car came up I was afraid it was them. So I kept off the main roads until I saw a train stopped at a crossing, and I jumped in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't you tell anyone what had happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was afraid! I thought they'd come after me, or my folks...so I didn't tell anybody. I was on my own until I got a free meal from this lady, Mrs. Lansing. I told her I was an orphan, on my own. She said I could stay on, and...I did.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Every night, I'd wake up, thinking they were right outside my window. Then I heard the police talking on the radio about what happened at the ranch, and I thought, for sure I can't go back now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since I didn't tell anybody what happened, I was afraid they'd blame me for those kids being dead. So I just...stayed away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what made you come forward now, after all this time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<DIRECTION>
David looks away, his eyes tearing up. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I miss my mom...I miss my dad...I just...I just want to go home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
And it's all Mrs. Clay can take. Sobbing, she runs out of the viewing room and into the interview room, where she goes to her son and embraces him, holds him, the two crying into one another's arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christine and Ybarra watch as Mr. and Mrs. Clay lead their son into their car. As they drive off, Christine finally breaks the silence.
</DIRECTION>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still can't believe it. Five years, case closed, everyone thinks he's dead...and there he is. And he wouldn't be, if it wasn't for Walter.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your son did a brave thing, Mrs. Collins. You should be very proud of him.

<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't think he's still out there, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not? Three boys made a run for it that night, Detective. If one got out, maybe either or both of the others did too. Maybe Walter went through the same fears he did. Afraid to come home or identify himself, afraid he'd get into trouble, that people might think it was his fault. Either way, it gives me something I didn't have before tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<YBARRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YBARRA>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him...and smiles.

<DIRECTION>
She turns and walks off into the night, as we SUPERIMPOSE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon Stewart Northcott was hanged on October 2, 1935
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In exchange for his cooperation and a guilty plea, Sanford Wesley Clark was sentenced to the Whittier State School for Boys for five years. Upon being released in 1934, he returned home to Canada, and was never heard from again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Upon returning to duty after his suspension, Captain J. J. Jones was demoted to Lieutenant and subsequently sued by Christine Collins in civil court. He was found guilty and fined $10,800 (equal to $125,000 in 2006 dollars). He never paid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One year after the City Council recommended the removal of the Los Angeles Chief of Police, James E Davis resigned from office and was replaced by Roy E. Steckel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Davis reclaimed that office in 1933, where he created the Red Squad, notorious for attacking Communists and their offices, but was forced to resign a second time under a cloud of police corruption.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the aftermath of the City Council hearings, the criminal justice system in California was revised to prevent women from being incarcerated or institutionalized for the crime of disagreeing with a male police officer. Strict medical procedures were set in place to prevent future abuse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In November 1929, Los Angeles Mayor George E. Cryer was voted out of office after three terms. He was later found to have been the front man for the Crawford Organized Crime Syndicate, which ran prostitution and gambling rackets throughout Southern California.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For the rest of his life, Reverend Gustav A. Briegleb used his radio show to expose police misconduct and political corruption. He also published "The Layman's Handbook of Daniel."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The California community of Wineville, near Riverside, became synonymous with the infamous Northcott Murder Ranch. In order to shake free of the scandal, the residents changed its name to Mira Loma.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christine Collins never stopped searching for her son.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fate of Walter Collins remains a mystery. If he was able to escape the Northcott Ranch, he would be 86 years old today.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT: THE END
</DIRECTION>
