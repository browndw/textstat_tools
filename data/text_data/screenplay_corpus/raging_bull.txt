WE CATCH A GLIMPSE of young JAKE LAMOTTA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEN CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BARBIZON PLAZA THEATRE - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT (1964)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE LAMOTTA, wearing a tux, is shadow-boxing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are unsure of where he is -- he moves in and out of the shadows. At 42, he's overweight and out of shape, but the balls of his feet still pop up and down like they were on canvas and his tiny fists still jerk forward with short bursts of light. He is rehearsing a nightclub monologue.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. It's a thrill to be standing here talking to you wonderful people. In fact, it's a thrill to be standing! I haven't seen so many people since my last fight at Madison Square Garden. After that fight, a reporter asked me, 'Jake, where do you go from here?' I said, 'To a hospital!' I fought one hundred and six professional fights and still none of them bums figured out how to fight me -- they kept hitting me in the head! And that's why I'm here tonight...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(starts to sing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'When the fighter's not engaged in his employment, his employment, although he was Champ and quite the rage, he must go somewhere else to seek employment, seek employment. But a fighter's life is not a bowl of cherries, still I'd rather have an egg than a fist upon my face... That's Entertainment!'
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLEVELAND ARENA - NIGHT (1941)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bam! JIMMY REEVES, a fast, black middleweight, jabs LAMOTTA, 19 years old, in the face. JAKE staggers forward. No matter how hard LAMOTTA is hit, no matter how often, he always staggers forward -- like a bull. The bell sounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Battered, JAKE slumps on the stool in his corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's September, 1941. Europe and Asia are already at war. Young SOLDIERS, freshly recruited, dot the hostile audience -- each screaming at the FIGHTERS in the ring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, words are exchanged, a GIRL screams, and a SOLDIER and a CIVILIAN stand and start swinging.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND IN THE RING: JAKE LAMOTTA takes a swig of water and spits blood into the bucket his younger brother, JOEY, holds for him. TONY, his trainer, works the cuts.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't have to come to Cleveland to get beat by a "moulan yan," Jake!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's got you, Jake! You're outpointed! You're coming up for the tenth. You gotta knock him out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
The bell sounds for the tenth. JAKE pulls himself up and charges at REEVES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REEVES slides away, jabbing, punching, piling up points.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In JAKE's corner, JOEY stands and yells at JAKE:
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A grand apiece! We got a grand apiece on this, Jake! A fucking grand!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE suddenly corners REEVES and unleashes a desperate, wild alley-fighting attack. One ferocious punch after another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SPECTATORS go wild; everyone's up for the kill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REEVES staggers, then falls to the canvas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The REFEREE counts:
</DIRECTION>
<REFEREE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One, two, three, four...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REFEREE>
<DIRECTION>
The GAMBLERS call out new odds; ten to one for REEVES, the underdog. JOEY, excited, sees that time is running out and steps in front of the bell. He swings his arms, pretending not to realize he literally holds back the TIMER's arm for a few seconds. This gives JAKE more time for a knockout -- but not enough. JOEY is pushed back and the bell rings at the count of nine, ending the match.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Boos and cheers. The BETTORS scramble back to the BOOKIE to get their money.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE dances around the ring, kissing his gloves and thrusting them toward the CROWD. JOEY rushes out and hugs him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ANNOUNCER steps into the ring with the mike:
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and Gentlemen, the winner, under the rules of the Cleveland Boxing Commission, after ten rounds, by a decision -- Jimmy Reeves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
The ANNOUNCER holds up REEVES' arm as his corner tries to lift him off the canvas -- still out cold. TWO ATTENDANTS bring in a stretcher.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE is stunned. He still prances around, now trying to figure out what happened. He raises his arms in victory, and the FANS go crazy, cheering, ripping chairs out, fighting with the COPS, throwing bottles and junk into the ring. PEOPLE go into the ring.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jake)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't get out of the ring. You won the fight -- let him go out first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REEVES being placed on the stretcher.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ringside OFFICIAL signals the ORGANIST and she starts to play the "Star Spangled Banner." REEVES is carried out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only then do JOEY and TONY escort JAKE out of the ring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WEBSTER AVENUE AND 169TH ST., THE BRONX - NEXT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a rough neighborhood, inhabited primarily by welfare cases and street kids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the street, two young PUNKS, 13 or 14 years old, exchange words and start to fight. Their FRIENDS cheer them on. SALVY and JOEY turn the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Salvy, would I steer you wrong? Let's say that's the truck; it's full of cigarettes, right? Now, two o'clock this morning we move the truck from here to there,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he points; the CAMERA PANS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	take the cigarettes out, sell 'em, make some cash.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<SALVY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey but Joey, you're thinking nickels and dimes. The money's with your brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALVY>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want from my life, Salvy? He's my brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<SALVY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He ain't doin' the right thing. He's makin' beans compared to what he should be makin'. Can't you make him understand that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALVY>
<DIRECTION>
A COP goes over and starts to break up the fight.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
(to cop)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, leave the kids alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<SALVY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get lost.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(joking, he knows the Cop)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey kids, "A cop is a rat." Remember that, "A rat."
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALVY>
<DIRECTION>
The KIDS yell.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Cop)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Jimmy, here's a dollar for your trouble. There's some bums around the corner -- they need your help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep the dollar, Joey. Get yourself a new suit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's my new suit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(grabs his crotch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, don't get wise!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just kidding, take it easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No fuckin' sense of humor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
SALVY and JOEY continue to walk a little faster, giggling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAKE AND IRMA'S KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE, bandaged from the REEVES fight the night before, sits at the kitchen table (he's had a few glasses of wine) while his wife, IRMA, 19, cooks at the stove.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE gets up and pokes at the frying steak with a fork.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This looks done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<IRMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRMA>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It looks done. I'll take it the way it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<IRMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's your steak. You can't wait for it to be done. Here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRMA>
<DIRECTION>
She slams the steak onto his plate, and reaches back to the stove.
</DIRECTION>
<IRMA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's your carrots. You're in such a hurry. You can't wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRMA>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I can't wait. You know when I wait? When it's important to wait. It's not important to wait for no steak. It's important to wait for Reeves to leave the ring. It ain't important to wait for no steak! I won that fight. So, I stayed in the ring, and that way I made sure everybody knew it. I shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to eat the steak. He takes a drink of wine.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait! I'll wait. But let me tell you, if this steak was the middleweight championship, I'd show you how I'd wait. I'd eat it raw. I'd drink the blood. I'd eat it before it came out of the cow -- that's how I'd wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JAKE AND IRMA'S APARTMENT BUILDING/TENEMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SALVY and JOEY approach the building.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't convince him. He's got such a thick head, I'd like to crack it open myself. Believe me, my own brother. It's very hard. You don't have to convince me -- I know we should be with Tommy. You talk to him. He don't listen to nobody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<SALVY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I'm just tellin' you how Tommy feels. Jake is makin' it hard on himself. Tommy wants him with us. It's as simple as that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALVY>
<DIRECTION>
They stop at the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<SALVY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talk some sense into him, will ya? You're still his brother. If he ain't gonna listen to you, he ain't gonna listen to nobody!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALVY>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, I'll try. See you later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<SALVY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tomorrow, at the gym. Don't forget.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALVY>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right, the gym.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
SALVY leaves. JOEY goes into the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAKE AND IRMA'S KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY is knocking at the door. IRMA opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
(noticing Jake)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<IRMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's doing it again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRMA>
<JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
(goes to Jake)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter? You're drinking. You're eating like an animal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY sits next to JAKE at the kitchen table. JAKE has a drink in his hand, and tears on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<JAKE>

(gets up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing...

JAKE goes into the living room. IRMA looks at JOEY. JOEY follows JAKE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY walks up to JAKE.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, c'mon, what's the matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(privately, to Joey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ain't ever gonna fight Joe Louis, that's what's the matter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you talking about? He's a heavyweight. You're a middleweight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE holds out his scarred hands.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at these hands. These fuckin' hands. I was born with a girl's hands. And even if I put on enough weight to be a heavyweight, I'd be too slow to fight. No matter how big I get, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE pauses. IRMA watches from the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I'm sayin'. You shouldn't even think like that. It's crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tell you one thing. Ok, I'll never be big enough to fight Louis, but I know Joey, I know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Do me a favor.

<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hit me in the face.

</JAKE>
<JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
(after a pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to do what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You heard me, I said hit me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Jack. You had a few drinks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead. I ain't drunk. Take your best shot. On the jaw.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack, I got no gloves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<JAKE>

(grabs a nearby towel)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's your glove.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY wraps it around his fist. IRMA watches. JOEY hits JAKE with his right. JAKE holds fast.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead. Hit me. C'mon, don't worry about it. I want you to hit me with everything you got.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY hauls off and lands him a real belt. JAKE rolls with it and stands firm.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Again. Harder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY hits him again.

<JAKE>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY hits him again. JAKE holds fast. JAKE starts to walk away.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was that for? I know you can take punches. I can hit you from now to doomsday. What the fuck does that prove?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See that, I don't feel it. I can take it. I know I can take anybody.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. GLEASON'S GYM - NEXT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gleason's, a small gym and fight club, stands on 149th Street and 3rd Avenue above a small sandwich shop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Each day BOBBY GLEASON posts a small sign alongside the door listing the fighters who will be working out. JAKE's name is posted at the top; the other names are unmemorable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GLEASON'S - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gleason's has a single sparring ring and ten training bags. About a dozen managers train their fighters out at Gleason's. For 50 cents, spectators sit in the gallery and watch the workouts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE is sparring with JOEY in the ring. They've been working out for a while now. The bell rings ending the third round. JAKE prances about the ring waiting for the bell to sound again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment, SALVY, along with two other young "BUTTON" MEN (actually, they are very young -- about JOEY's age) enter the gym. They are well-dressed (over-coat, ties, suits, flashy rings, etc.). They say hello to some PEOPLE by the door. JAKE looks over and notices them. SALVY looks over to the ring.
</DIRECTION>
<SALVY>
<DIRECTION>
(waves)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Joey --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALVY>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY waves back.
</DIRECTION>
<SALVY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (waves again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jake, how you doin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALVY>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE nods to SALVY very cold. SALVY notices and can feel that he's not exactly wanted there by JAKE. JOEY notices the same and becomes a bit nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SALVY sits down near the ring but not as close as he'd like to. His two friends, FRANKIE and GUIDO, sit nearby also.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE goes to JOEY's corner.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you know they were coming up here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY doesn't answer.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Answer me when I talk to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, yeah. They just wanted to talk to you. So I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't ever bring those kids up here again! I'm working out, I'm killin' myself in here, and they walk around like they fuckin' own the neighborhood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
SALVY and the OTHERS see JOEY being chewed out by JAKE. They begin to feel unwelcome at the gym.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bell sounds. JAKE is more aggressive now as he corners JOEY. JAKE swings away with body punches. JOEY can't block them. SALVY and the OTHERS watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bell sounds again. With that, SALVY and the OTHERS start to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<SALVY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Joey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Joey, we better go. See you later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALVY>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY, dazed, turns to wave.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go 'head. Wave goodbye. They're your friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE watches them leave.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that hard-on, Salvy. Who's he think he is? I'm gonna let that fuckin' hard-on come up here and act like a big shot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you getting so hot about -- Tommy Como told him to come down here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I don't care about Tommy Como. I don't care about Jesus Christ on the fuckin' cross. I gotta give them a percentage of what I make! I'm in here breaking my ass, not them. Don't ever bring them up here again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't tell them to come. Tommy Como...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
The bell sounds again. JAKE hits JOEY a few more solid body punches. JOEY gets angry and fights back with a flurry of punches which have no effect on JAKE. JAKE laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, fight back. I got laid three times before I came up here this morning and I can still break your ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY fights back, but it's no use.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You cocksucker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE laughs. The two continue to swing it out, as SALVY watches unseen from the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHOREHAVEN POOL - DAY (1942-43)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Shorehaven Pool, spic-and-span in the summer sun is the closest thing to a country club in the Bronx. An eight foot fence stands between the pool and the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE, wearing slacks and a sportshirt, hangs out with the "BOYS" near the bar area. Older, "MADE" MEN play cards. A young FAN walks by and says:
</DIRECTION>
<FAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Jake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAN>
<DIRECTION>
At the opposite end of the pool where the GIRLS gossip, and sunbathe, JOEY swaps small talk with VICKIE, a school girl, about 15. VICKIE is a knockout.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SALVY, FRANKIE and JUNIOR are with VICKIE and her FRIENDS. They joke with JOEY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE watches SALVY and VICKIE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE'S P.O.V.: JOEY is talking (PAN) to VICKIE. VICKIE giggles. JOEY stands and walks over to JAKE.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(referring to Vickie)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's that?

	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm not afraid. Why? You wanna meet her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah --

</JAKE>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cause I'll go right over there and bring her here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go 'head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure you wanna meet her? Don't make me go over there, you change your mind and you make me look bad, cause she's really a knockout. She's 15, this kid -- a great piece of ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know? You know her that good?

INT. WEBSTER HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A neighborhood dance is in progress. A small BAND is playing while mainly OLDER COUPLES dance. There are TWO PRIESTS present. The younger people are divided into two groups -- the BOYS, who are dressed in suits and ties, and spend most of their time at the bar area -- and the GIRLS, who are in evening dresses, and spend most of their time dancing together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some of the more popular GIRLS are surrounded by "WISE-GUYS." There are tables near the dance floor with "set ups" (bottles of Scotch, rye, and a bucket of ice) on them. These tables are the "bases of operation" for different neighborhood groups, as if they were street corners.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE and JOEY are walking toward a table. VERA, a young neighborhood girl, blocks their way as she bends over to talk to some GUYS at a table. VERA's well-built, and knows it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY tries to move one way; VERA again blocks his way. This little game goes on for a few seconds, then:
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>

JOEY cups his hands and grabs VERA's breasts. VERA squeals, covers her breasts, and moves back. JOEY and JAKE walk past her. JOEY smiles.
</DIRECTION>

As they watch, WE SEE, from JAKE's POV:
</DIRECTION>

SALVY, FRANKIE, and JUNIOR show up at VICKIE's table. They are in overcoats and hats and don't sit down. They are obviously on their way to bigger things than a neighborhood dance -- and VICKIE and her GIRLFRIENDS are glad to go with them. They get up to leave.

JAKE is fighting SUGAR RAY ROBINSON. (It's their 2nd match.) WE SEE highlights of the fight: JAKE is fighting ferociously, but SUGAR RAY is a formidable opponent. AN ANNOUNCER'S VOICE gives a blow by blow description. JAKE takes a lot of punishment from SUGAR RAY -- until the 8th round. Then, JAKE nails SUGAR RAY with a savage left. JAKE chases SUGAR RAY and pounds him with a left and a right. SUGAR RAY gets in a right cross. They stand toe to toe, fighting. Then, JAKE lands a left to SUGAR RAY's stomach, and knocks him through the ropes. JAKE goes after SUGAR RAY, but the REFEREE stops him. SUGAR RAY gets back into the ring and sinks to one knee, while the REFEREE counts to 9. The bell sounds.

JAKE, wearing pleated dress slacks, sits on the edge of the bed examining his muscle tone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He studies his small fists. Squeezes each knuckle. Twists his wrists. Clenches. Unclenches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VICKIE steps out of the bathroom wearing a nightie and panties.
</DIRECTION>
<VICKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure we should be doing this?

	</DIALOGUE>
</VICKIE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE watches VICKIE approach him. He respects her as he would a shrine; he slowly removes her sheer nightie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His round hands caress her smooth skin. He glides his bruised knuckles across her shoulders, pride on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses his bruised knuckles sensuously, then his bruised face.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>

</VICKIE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go 'head. Do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls off his shorts. VICKIE is now getting excited. She kisses his chest and licks it.
</DIRECTION>
<VICKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like the gym smell.

</VICKIE>
<JAKE>

</JAKE>
<VICKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Jake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICKIE>
<DIRECTION>
She caresses his broad shoulders and runs her hand along his erection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE's lips are trembling. He quickly turns his back on VICKIE, goes into the bathroom, and gets a full glass of cold water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VICKIE watches as he puts his erection in the glass of cold water. She is shocked and surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't do it. I can't fool around. This Robinson, I gotta beat him again. I can't fool around. Don't come near me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE grabs her again and kisses her. Then, gently but firmly, he turns her around and pushes her out. (It's starting again, and he must stop it.) He goes back the bathroom and closes the door.
</DIRECTION>

INT. OLYMPIC STADIUM - DETROIT (FEB. 26, 1943)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is JAKE's rematch with SUGAR RAY (their 3rd fight). AN ANNOUNCER's VOICE gives a blow by blow description.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FOURTH ROUND: JAKE is in serious trouble. SUGAR RAY knocks him with a hard right, then a series of rights and lefts. JAKE is punched all the way across the ring, but stays in there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SEVENTH ROUND: JAKE, coming on strong, forces SUGAR RAY into his own corner, then lands a left hook to his chin. SUGAR RAY drops, and takes a nine count. This time, however, the blow does not have a crippling effect on SUGAR RAY; instead, he comes back and outboxes JAKE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIME CUT: THE ANNOUNCER calls out the decision: SUGAR RAY is the winner. JAKE is stunned. The CROWD boos so loud and for so long that THE ANNOUNCER is unable to introduce the fighters in the next bout.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They robbed us! Those fuckin' judges -- What the fuck fight were they watching? If I see them on the street, I'll break their heads. Decision Robinson, my fuckin' ass!

TONY goes to the door.

INT. BATHROOM NEAR THE DRESSING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE, now alone, goes into the bathroom. He looks in the bathroom mirror. After a pauseg, he touches his newly acquired bruises and bandages. He combs his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the beginning of an early Frank Sinatra song. This song carries over onto the following MONTAGE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MONTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This MONTAGE covers the period between 1943 and early 1947. It shows JAKE hard at work fighting all the tough guys he can. Each of the fights will be introduced by the corresponding title card from the "Big Fights" film showing a boxing glove with the fighters' names and the places of the fights superimposed on it. The actual fight images will be black and white newspaper photos JUMP CUT together to simulate real action. For example: In still #1 JAKE is about to land a punch on an OPPONENT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still #2, and the punch lands, distorting the OPPONENT's face, sweat spraying out everywhere. Live sound effects accompany these stills.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fight stills are INTERCUT with 16mm black and white home movies of JAKE, VICKIE, JOEY, etc. (to be shot in 16mm black and white).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It'll go something like this:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A) JAKE VS. FRITZIE ZIVIC at the Detroit Olympia (January 14, 1944)

New Jersey courthouse)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
E) JAKE VS. SUGAR RAY ROBINSON at Comiskey Park, Chicago (September 26, 1945)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
F) JAKE and VICKIE on vacation -- very loving. They are dancing, and he allows her to knock him into the pool. Then, JAKE gives VICKIE a present by the poolside. She opens the box and takes out a white garment and turban. She kisses JAKE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VICKIE dressed in the outfit. She looks very much like Lana Turner in "The Postman Always Rings Twice." She kisses JAKE. (1946)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
G) JAKE VS. JIMMY EDGAR at Detroit (The University of Detroit Stadium) (June 12, 1946)

INT. PELHAM PARKWAY HOUSE (1947)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE an early model, round screen television. Nearby an old radio. On it, Sinatra is finishing the song we heard in the preceding montage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE enters, and turns down the volume on the radio. WE SEE JAKE's living room; it is late forties modern.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY and VICKIE are seated around the coffee table, which is near the television. There are some remnants of a snack on the table. JAKE's TWO BOYS are playing nearby.

	I just weighed myself - I'm 161. No more deals like this Janiro bullshit. I didn't tell you to do it in the first place.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Jake, you're the one who said you could get down to 155! What did I do, pull it out of the fuckin' hat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(angry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sometimes you shouldn't listen to me! Now I don't know if I can make it down to 155. I'm having trouble making 160, and without telling me, you sign me for a fight at 155 pounds, and if I don't make 155, I forfeit $15,000! You're supposed to know what you're doin'. You're supposed to be a manager!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want the title shot?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This Janiro's an up-and-coming fighter, this kid you gotta knock out. Knockout this fuckin' kid! I'm telling you, this is your step towards getting a shot at the title. Listen to me: I'm telling you. You been killin' yourself for three years. There's nobody left -- they're afraid to fight you. This Janiro's up-and-coming. He don't know. Fuckin' tear him apart, wipe him out! What are you worried about? Your weight? Look, even if you lose they're gonna think you're weak; they're gonna think you're not the fighter you used to be. They'll match you with guys they were afraid to match you with before, and then you'll kill them and you'll get your title shot. And if you beat this kid Janiro, they gotta give you a shot at the title because there's nobody else. Either way you win and you do it on your own -- just like you want it. All right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<VICKIE>

	Joey's right. Janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking...

	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean, "good looking?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<VICKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...

JAKE glares at her.

VICKIE rounds up the kids and takes them into the kitchen. (MOVING SHOT).
</DIRECTION>

WE SEE VICKIE in the kitchen angrily throwing things around. We clearly see the tension as she cleans up, muttering to herself.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (turns to Joey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, manager. Everybody had their say around here. Now this is what I'm gonna say. I'm gonna get down to 155, and I'm gonna destroy this kid -- get my title shot. And don't ever bet 15 thousand without my sayso again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>

JAKE comes into the kitchen. He tries to make up with VICKIE. She plays hard-to-get. They begin to tease each other.

INT. COPACABANA LOUNGE - NIGHT (1947)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A COMEDIAN is in the middle of his act. JAKE, VICKIE, JOEY, and JANET sit at a nearby table. JANET, an attractive blonde, is are of JOEY's girlfriends; the moment you set eyes on her, you know this is not his wife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lounge is very crowded. The COMEDIAN interrupts his routine to point out that JAKE LAMOTTA is in the audience, and even tries a little harmless joking at JAKE's expense.
</DIRECTION>
<COMEDIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to point out a special guest we have with us tonight -- The Raging Bull, The Bronx Bull, Mr. Jake LaMotta.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
JAKE Smiles. They all drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SALVY, a little older, but still young-looking, and dressed even better than when we last saw him (flashy rings, etc.), comes over to their table. He walks around like he owns the fucking place. JAKE hates it.
</DIRECTION>
<SALVY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Joey. Jake, how you doin'? Vickie...

</SALVY>

They respond. JAKE is cold towards SALVY.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Jake. You know she's crazy about you.

He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOX connects: once, twice, three times. JAKE barely defends himself -- but he doesn't go down either.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CROWD starts to smell a fix. There are calls from the AUDIENCE.
</DIRECTION>
<CROWD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got your swimming trunks on, Jake? I hope they're paying you enough. Fake, fake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROWD>

JAKE's corner. JAKE is acting stunned. TONY, not aware of what's going on, is slapping JAKE.

	What's the matter with you? What's the matter with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
TIME CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sign reads "Round Four." JAKE is in the center of the ring taking a relentless pasting from FOX. JAKE's arms hang at waist level... FOX lands one blow after another. The stink of a fix permeates the arena.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE is furious that FOX can't deck him. He curses through his mouthpiece (as he absorbs blow after blow):
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hit me! Hit me! What's the matter with you, you motherfucker? Hit me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
Boos and catcalls echo through the Garden. This is not even a fight. The REFEREE, realizing this, steps in between FOX and LAMOTTA, waves his arms and signals that FOX is the winner by a technical knockout.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he does, JAKE spits his mouthpiece in disgust at FOX and struts back to his corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE, JOEY, and TONY are already on their way out of the arena as the REFEREE declares FOX the winner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COMO and the OTHERS, satisfied, get up to leave.

INT. JAKE'S DRESSING ROOM - MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As a REPORTER and a PHOTOGRAPHER come through the door, WE SEE and hear a commotion in the hall behind them. They rush in, look, and stop by the door. There is silence -- except for JAKE'S uncontrollable sobbing. The atmosphere is like that of funeral.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE is seated behind the rubbing table. He is still in his leopard-skin robe. His head hangs low as he sobs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PHOTOGRAPHER snaps a picture. The HANDLER motions to him to stop, and then goes and sits near the door. The REPORTER still stands near the doorway, seeming quite stunned by the scene he is witnessing, but nevertheless continuing to scribble away on his pad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY, standing near JAKE, has his back to everyone; his shoulders are shaking, his lips are tightly drawn. He cries soundlessly. TONY is pacing nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't fight anymore!

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did they have to stop it? Why did they have to stop it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
The REPORTER leans over to the HANDLER and whispers.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<HANDLER>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He must've been really hurt in the 2nd. He didn't answer me when I tried to tell him something in the corner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANDLER>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE, still buried in his robe, becomes aware of the hum of voices and shouts out:
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get everyone out of here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
The REPORTER and the PHOTOGRAPHER leave. JAKE continues to sob.

JAKE, out of reflex, sticks out his hands. As he does, JOEY feigns a hit and falls onto the floor -- "out cold." JAKE looks down at him.

JOEY pops to his feet.

I made an asshole of myself in the fuckin' Garden! All the newspaper writers make fun of me. I'm the bum of the year. All I want is a shot. Just a fuckin' shot. What do I gotta do? I'll do anything.

	Yeah, except fall down. That's right.

</JAKE>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, you don't wanna fall down, so now you gotta take a rest. So, you enjoy the suspension. 'Cause there's nothin' you can do about it. Let the Commissioner and the D.A. jerk you around. So you wait.

</JOEY>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ! Seven months! What am I gonna do for seven months? I'm gonna go crazy. How do I keep my strength? By that time I'll be too weak to win the title. And my weight? Forget about it -- I'm gonna blow up like a balloon. I ain't never gonna hold my weight down. Seven months! I don't know...

JAKE pushes her against the wall. The lamp falls. There is a loud crash. She tries to move away. He grabs her by the throat and pins her against the wall. She's gagging.

	Look at him, Jackie! You got at! The fuckin' championship! He's yours! Finish him off.

The small BAND plays a routine fanfare as JAKE steps onto the platform. He takes the mike with one hand and silences the BAND with the other. The applause dies out as he speaks:
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. It's a thrill to be standin' here talking to you wonderful people. In fact, it's a thrill to be standin'. I haven't seen so many people since my last fight at Madison Square Garden. After that fight a reporter asked me, "Jake, where do you go from here?" I said, "To a hospital."

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will somebody at the bar -- Linda? - get me a drink. I figure if I'm gonna work to drunks I might as well be one of 'em! I like this place. It's a family type club... every night I see a lot of fathers sitting out there with their young daughters! That's nice.

But if you play it right, once is enough." I shouldn't be drinkin' like this 'cause I'm tryin' to lose weight. I'm on this terrific diet -- I'm allowed to eat anything I want. As long as I don't swallow it! Well, I never had much luck with my weight. In fact, -- I never had much luck with anything -- until about a few years ago, when this happened --
	</DIALOGUE>

He indicates the blow-up behind him and waits for applause, of which there is some.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... thanks, I'm glad to see you remember. For those of you that don't... that's me takin' the title from Cerdan. You know, the tough thing about winnin' the title... the next thing you gotta do is have a rematch... just to show it wasn't no fluke. So what happens? Marcel Cerdan, a really great champ, after I beat him... he gets himself killed in that airplane crash... a pretty rotten break for him. That's why I don't like to fly. People say to me, "Look, Jake, when your time is up, your time is up." And I say, "Yeah, but suppose I'm on the plane and the pilot's time is up?" As good as Cerdan was, I could've taken him again. But I never got the chance to prove it wasn't no fluke. He got killed but he got to be what they call a legend. I don't know what's worse -- bein' a fluke or bein' a legend. -- That's the kinda luck I got. That's why I quit the ring and moved down here from New York. My wife said, "You gotta get outa this town, Jake." Come to think of it... the boxing commission said the same thing! But I don't miss New York. Give me Miami any day.

	We get along real great. We fight a little but I never really belted her on purpose. Once in a while I'm standin' there doin' little shadow-boxin' and she happens to walk right into the shadow... I can't help that. She says, "Whataya hittin' me for?" I says, "It's nothin'. It's only a love tap." She says, "It's a good thing you're not crazy about me!" -- I am crazy about her. I heard her talkin' to a friend on the phone and she was sayin', "After eleven years, I'm still in love with the same guy." -- If I ever find out who the bum is, I'll kill him! Women. You can't live with 'em, you can't live without 'em.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Is whispering nothing? Is leaning cheek to cheek? Is meeting noses? Kissing with inside lip? Stopping the career of laughter with a sign? -- A note infallible of breaking honesty -- horsing foot on foot? Skulking in corners? Wishing clocks more swift? Hours, minutes? Noon, midnight? and all eyes blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only, that would unseen be wicked? Is this nothing? Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing; The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing; My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings, if this be nothing." -- That's from something called "The Winter's Tale" -- Shakespeare! You all remember Shakespeare. He wrote all them famous plays one after the other, then he went into a big slump and he ain't done anything good in years. That speech is about jealousy -- jealousy's a bad thing. Jealousy bothers a lot of guys... take me... I almost killed my brother... I love him... he's my family... I mean, there's nothin' he wouldn't do for me. And that's the way we been goin' thru life -- doin' nothin' for each other! Anytime he got in trouble when we was kids, I got him out of it. You know, he used to steal little things when we was growin' up. But he was particular... only stole things that begin with an 'a' -- a watch, a car, a suit, a ring... But I was wrong... I shoulda never hit my brother. Afterwards, I was sorry. Now every time I need somethin' I gotta go shoppin' for it! A psychiatrist once told me, "When you hit your brother you're really hittin' your mother, but you can't admit it to yourself." He's really crazy. I woulda never hit my mother. I mean, only in self-defense!

The LAMOTTA-DAUTHUILLE middleweight championship is told through the eyes and words of the RINGSIDE ANNOUNCER. JAKE is not doing well.
</DIRECTION>
<RINGSIDE_ANNOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Ladies and gentlemen, I've sat in front of these microphones for over twenty years but this is the strangest championship bout I've ever seen. With two minutes to go in the final round, the champion, the mighty Bull from the Bronx, is just simply taking punch after punch from the challenger. Dauthuille scores a combination, then backpedals. LaMotta pursues him. One minute to go. Laurent DauthuiLlle, who has already beat Lamotta in a non-title bout, is about to fulfill a dream -- to bring the middleweight crown back to France.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINGSIDE_ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
In the ring, JAKE looks like he's on queer street. Bouncing off the ropes, opening his jaw to DAUTHUILLE. But DAUTHUILLE's punches lack strength. JAKM is playing possum.
</DIRECTION>
<RINGSIDE_ANNOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thirty seconds to go. The Bull starts to swing. LaMotta comes in for a brutal body combinaticn: one, two, three, four punches. LaMotta has landed a solid left hook to the Frenchman's jaw! Dauthuille seems confused. LaMotta is swinging wildly now: right, left, right, left! Dauthuille is backing off! Everyone is on their feet! I can hardly see, ladies and gentlemen. Dauthuille is on the ropes. LaMotta hits a right -- Dauthuille is down! Dauthuille is down! Referee Lou Handler is counting him out -- three, four, five -- if Dauthuille can stand, he'll win the decision -- eight, nine -- Dauthuille is on one knee -- ten! It's all over! With thirteen seconds left on the clock, Jake LaMotta has retained his middleweight championship in one of the most remarkable combacks in boxing! Dauthuille is standing now, confused. But the fight is over.

JAKE has an office above the lounge. Ever since VICKIE left, it's also been his apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is a mess. JAKE sends his laundry out when he runs out of clean clothes. Dirty socks, shorts and shirts are scattered randomly. Empty whiskey bottles on the desk, empty beer cans in the wastebasket.

INT. JAKE'S MIAMI HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE walks directly past VICKIE into the living room. VICKIE watches from a safe distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE removes his jewel-studded championship belt from the glass bookcase and carries it into the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the kitchen, he takes a hammer and screwdriver out of a drawer, places the belt on the counter top, and starts digging the jewels out of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VICKIE appears in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<VICKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICKIE>
<JAKE>

<VICKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!

	</DIALOGUE>
</VICKIE>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What friends?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE, frustrated by his task, turns the belt over and hammers at it. The jewels scatter across the counter top and floor. JAKE collects the jewels and puts them in his pockets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEWELRY SHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE stands at the counter of a small jewelry store. The JEWELER examines the stones.
</DIRECTION>
<JEWELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't you also wish to sell the Championship Belt, Mr. LaMotta?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEWELER>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it. Those are the jewels that were in the belt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JEWELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But where's the belt?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEWELER>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want the jewels or the belt?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<JEWELER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Both. These stones are worth about fifteen hudred dollars, but the belt of a champion is a very rare item. The belt with the stones untouched would have been worth near five thousand dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEWELER>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE seems to despair of the whole thing: the belt, the attempt to raise 10 g's, the vice case, his life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

INT. BARBIZON DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Same as Scene 1.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE, 42 years old, continues to rehearse. He is seated across from a mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So there I am in the can... and not the one that says "gentlemen" on the door. I'm talkin' about jail! Down south! I mean, jail up north is gotta be like summer camp compared to jail down in cracker country. And if you're a guy like me, you ain't got a chance in a place like that. Especially if you're Italian... you come from the Bronx... and you're an ex-champ. As soon as they saw me... soon as they heard me... I know I'm in trouble. To me, they got an accent, and to them, I got an accent! You gotta get the picture -- I'm big, I got small hands, I walk like I'm still in the ring... the balls of my feet pop up and down, you know... and whenever I get the chance, I read a lot. So naturally, takin' all this into consideration, they figure it adds up to one thing -- I'm queer! Now I didn't mind too much when they called me "Queer" or "Mr. Tough Guy" or "Yankee Punk"... But one day these screws got to me... I was workin' on the work gang, pickin' up some trees that were knocked down by a storm or somethin' and puttin' 'em on this truck. All of a sudden... one of the trees slipped and fell on me and pinned me to the ground. I'm lyin' there with a tree across my chest! This screw walks over, takin' his time, he looks down at me and says, "Well, Champ Pimp... you lyin' down on the job again?"! They got a great sense of humor when they're standin' there with a gun in their arms and you got a tree on your chest! So I look up at him and say, "Oh, this tree... it fell on me." And he says, "Oh, I'm sorry... If I'd have known, I would've yelled 'timber'" I said, "Hey, look... it hurts. I think maybe I broke somethin'!" He says, "Well, whaddaya know... Champ PImp's got himself a boo-boo." Then I got as stupid as him. I said, "If I'm Champ Pimp... how 'bout givin' me the money you made last night?"! Then another screw comes over and says, "This Yankee creep givin' you trouble?" -- What kind of trouble? What am I gonna do -- hit 'em with the tree? Now anybody else in their right mind would've said, "No sir, I wouldn't think of giving any of you gentlemen trouble... I just want to serve my time and get the hell out of here as soon as I can." That's anybody else. When I said it... it was a little different. "You stupid cracker... take your hands off me or I'll get up and kick your brains out -- but first you gotta bend over so I can find 'em!" Next thing I know I'm in the hole. Solitary confinement. All my life I had guys in my corner yellin' "Go get 'em, jake... kill 'em! You're the greatest." Now there's nobody rootin' for me. But it wasn't so bad. I learned things there. I learned how to scratch a calendar on the wall. I never knew how to do that before. Now I know. Monday is one scratch. Tuesday is two scratches. Wednesday is three scratches. And so on. Except for Sundays. Sundays is no scratches. Sundays rested.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE is led down a long corridor by TWO GUARDS. His hands and legs are manacled and chained.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GUARDS, redneck screws both, take special pleasure in working JAKE over.

INT. THE HOLE - DAY OR NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A thin slit provides the only light in JAKE's cell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rough cement walls are covered with obscure graffiti. The 8x8x8 room features only a cot and a toilet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is mostly darkness. Sounds are more tangible here than sights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE JAKE's body as it passes through the slit of light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE crouches into the corner away from the light. As WE SEE JAKE's face, the following MONTAGE images appear.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
R) Still in JAKE's corner: JOEY puts the mouthpiece in JAKE's mouth. (SLOW MOTION)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
S) JAKE wins over CERDAN. JOEY, overenthusiastic, hits JAKE on the back of the head a little too hard. JAKE gives JOEY a quick look, but JOEY just embraces him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
T) On a bed, a GIRL is going down on JOEY. The GIRL turns and looks up at JAKE. It's LINDA, the waitress from his club. JAKE stares.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
U) JAKE's fist hits LINDA's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
V) VICKIE playfully bends JAKE's hand back, pretending to break it.

JAKE is now smashing the wall with all his strength -- vicious body punches.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, why, why me? You took it away from me. They took everything away. What do they want from me? What the fuck do they want from me? I ain't bad. I ain't bad. I'm not that guy. I'm not that guy. I'm not a monster. I'm not an animal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE breaks his knuckles; the pain and blood are unbearable.

JAKE collapses to the concrete floor. His hands are smashed. He cries, then sobs.

</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Except here, gentlemen, with you bums. I call you "gentlemen"... but you know what you really are! You know, this place used to be pretty exclusive... now they got bouncers outside to throw the drunks in! My first night here I said to the boss, "Where's the toilet?" -- He said, "You're in it!" By the way, this engagement is just a stepping stone for me. If I do good here, I'm ready to get out of the business!

	OK, OK, I know what you're waitin' for -- and from the looks of you, you been waitin' for it for a long time. I had my own joint in Miami Beach once... it was too high-class for you guys... we had a 50-cent minimum charge just to keep out the riff-raff!

<JAKE>

DOLLY INTO A MEDIUM SHOT of JAKE waiting by the parking lot. He looks at the delicatessen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY finally comes out carrying a paper bag. Not noticing JAKE, he walks right past him to his car which is parked near the rear of the outdoor lot.
</DIRECTION>
<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Joey --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
JAKE walks towards JOEY with his hand outstretched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY looks at JAKE. Silence. JOEY turns his back and starts to get into his car.

<DIRECTION>
JAKE runs over to JOEY and grabs his shoulder.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

JAKE pulls too hard, causing JOEY to drop the paper bag to his feet. The containers of coffee and tea in the bag break open and splatter JOEY's pants legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY stares down at his pants, then up at JAKE. Suddenly, he belts JAKE with a left and a right to the jaw. JAKE is taken by surprise, and backs off to get his own hands up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY keeps pouring it on. JAKE drops his hands and takes it.
</DIRECTION>

JOEY stops in mid-punch and stares at JAKE. He can't figure it out.

JAKE nods and tries to smile, but starts to cry instead.

<JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More. Go ahead, Joey. I deserve it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAKE>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY pauses, then finally throws a very weak punch to JAKE's shoulder. He leaves his hand there -- then, uncurls his fist -- and finally puts his hand around JAKE's neck as tears start to fill his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY hugs JAKE close to him, crying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They hug each other, both crying. They don't say anything.

JAKE is alone preparing to go onstage. He rehearses.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I'm not a philosopher or anything like that but I been around a little and the way I look at it is -- We're, all of us, lookin' for the same thing: a shot at the title. No matter what you wanta be... you wanta shot at bein' the best. Well, I had mine and it'll always be in the record books... it don't make no difference what happens to me from here on in -- I got my shot and that's a fact. Some guys weren't that lucky... like the one Marlon Brando played in "On the Waterfront" -- an up and comer who's now a down and outer. You remember... there was this scene in the back of the car with his brother Charlie, a small-time racket guy, and it went somethin' like this -- "It wasn't him, Charlie. It was you. You 'member that night in the Garden you came down my dressing room and said. 'Kid, this ain't your night. We're going for the price on Wilson.' You 'member that? 'This ain't your night!' My night -- I coulda taken Wilson apart! So what happens? He gets the title shot outdoors on the ballpark, and what do I get? A one-way ticket to Palookaville. I never was no good after that night. It was like a peak you reach. Then it went downhill. It was you, Charlie. You was my brother, Charlie. You shoulda looked out for me a little bit. You shoulda taken care of me just a little bit so I wouldn't have to take them dives for the short end money... You don't understand! I coulda had class. I coulda been a contender. I coulda been somebody -- instead of a bum, which is what I am. Let's face it. It was you, Charlie."

A shadow goes by the frame; it's a STAGEHAND.

The shadow pops in again.

<STAGEHAND>

The shadow exits.

<JAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK.

<DIRECTION>
JAKE pauses, then starts to shadow-box in his dressing room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His breath comes in quick gasps. His feet pop up and down like they were on canvas. His tiny fists jerk forward with short bursts of light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still alive. Still a contender. A 42-year-old man fighting for his shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA DOLLIES into a FULL SHOT of his fists as they hit the empty air -- in and out of the frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This quote appears: (Music in)

"Verily, verily I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, He can not enter into the kingdom of heaven..."

<DIRECTION>
John 3-3.

<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA goes into DARKNESS.

THE END
