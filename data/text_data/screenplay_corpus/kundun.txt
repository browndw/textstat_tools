CLOSER on this caravan. We can make out eight or ten men, walking, and on horseback, dressed in heavy, brocade coats, and large woolen hats, black braids trailing down their backs. A yellow palanquin is carried by four large monks, wearing maroon robes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The caravan reaches the top of the mountain pass and turns - a sudden shift in direction - a switchback. The travelers head downhill.

Now, we see the mens's destination. A lake. An incredibly blue, circular lake, sunk between snow-dusted mountains. It is LHAMO I' LATSO - "the Oracle Lake" - and it shimmers in the sunlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the lake comes into view, a young man pushes back the curtain of the yellow palanquin and peers down at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man is dressed in royal robes. He is young, twenty four years old. His name is RETING RINPOCHE. He is the Regent of Tibet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The color of the lake changes - from brilliant turquoise, to a deep, murky, unfathomable darkness.

<DIRECTION>
Reting stares at the lake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water turns a light grey, and an image appears - obscure at first, then becoming more solid. A vision.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees a house - a small, stone, one-story, u-shaped house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house has a flat, tile roof and an unusual, wooden rain gutter, with windows outlined in black and a prayer flag in the courtyard. A spotted dog is in front of the house, barking, though we cannot hear him. The vision becomes completely clear, for an instant - clear enough to see the face of a young boy at the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on Reting Rinpoche. Looking. Searching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cut to: a portrait of a mountain: Kyeri - a majestic, glacier mountain - the "house mountain" of the village of Takster, Amdo Province, North Eastern Tibet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sound returns as the wind whistles around this jagged, mountain peak and then the view moves down, below the tree line, and into the rhododendron forest and the farmlands, until it comes to rest on a small, stone, u-shaped house. A house caught in the dawn's mist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on the face of a sleeping child: a boy, LHAMO DHONDRUP, age two and one-half years. He is dreaming. He is about to wake up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Today, his life will change.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We stay on the boy's face until, slowly, his eyes open - beautiful, dark, eyes.
</DIRECTION>

INT. TIBETAN PEASANT HOME, KITCHEN DAWN (1937)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MOTHER walks past the boy, her woolen skirt swaying in the rosy light. A seven year-old brother - LOBSANG SAMTEN - and a teenage sister - TSERING DOLMA - share Lhamo's kitchen mattress. Lhamo looks at them, and then he turns to see the heavy felt boots of his FATHER, as the man walks through the room and out the door. Lhamo finds the kind face of his MOTHER. She is looking at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COURTYARD DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy walks across the stone courtyard as we hear the sounds of this country morning: the snorting of horses, clucking of hens, a command from the Father as the man feeds the animals.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy scratches, he pees. He sees his Mother on the roof. She is a silhouette against the dawn, as she feeds cedar and yak chips into the incense burner - sending white, curly smoke up, to circle the prayer flag and its clusters of printed mantras.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We pull back as the spotted dog begins to bark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lhamo's house is the house in the vision.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a good day. There is cheese for breakfast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lhamo's Father sits on a cushion at the head of a low table. Fresh bread appears, yogurt, roasted barley (tsampa).

EXT. COURTYARD DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Father is leaving the yard with a short string of horses when there is a sudden commotion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CHINESE GOVERNOR is passing through this little village.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is a ferocious looking man, dressed in ornate brocade, his horse eguipped with tack that looks like armor. He is surrounded by a dozen Chinese soldiers, all on huge horses, ruling the road, kicking up mud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lhamo's Father stops. He holds still. He looks to the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mother is holding the children against her in the doorway. Quiet. Watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Governor and his entourage move on. When they are out of sight, Lhamo's Father makes his departure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Lhamo straddles the window sill, slapping his bottom as if he were a horse, shouting:

</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
A middle-aged man, the SERVANT, wearing heavy, ragged clothes and wrapped boots, enters the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lhamo slides over so that the man can sit on the platform beside him. The man picks up a few pebbles and drops them - he knows the game.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We recognize this servant. His name is KEUSTANG RINPOCHE. He is one of the monks we saw at the Oracle lake, the one with the mesmerizing eyes. Keustang Rinpoche is the Lama of Sera Monastery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lhamo sees a dark brown rosary around the Servant's neck and immediately pulls at the string of beads.
</DIRECTION>
<LHAMO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LHAMO>
<DIRECTION>
The Servant takes the rosary off and gives it to the boy. Lhamo hangs the string of beads around his own neck. The Servant makes a move to take back the rosary, but Lhamo resists.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Lhamo, no.
	</DIALOGUE>

Lhamo goes back to his game. The Mother hands the tired man a slice of bread and a steaming cup of tea. The man's hands are shaking. He cannot look the woman in the eye.

CLOSE on the small face of Lhamo as he looks down at the bed.

Lying on a piece of yellow silk are many objects. There are three of each type of object: three walking sticks, three drums, three silver pens, three eating bowls, three bells, three rosaries, three pairs of spectacles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lama of Sera - Keustang Rinpoche - hands Lhamo the rosary he had so coveted when the man first visited.
</DIRECTION>
<KEUSTANG_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is yours, you say. What else belongs to you?

<DIRECTION>
Lhamo considers the request, then climbs onto the bed to study the objects. The drum and the bell he chooses quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keustang Rinpoche watches the boy gather the items. He looks at the yellow silk and the boy's small, fine hands. He dares not look directly at the boy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lhamo picks up one walking stick - a lovely, bronze-handled one. He swings it around, but he finally rejects it in favor of a plain, iron-handled stick. He makes his own pile of these things, then looks at the Lama of Sera.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, those are yours.

But, Lhamo begins to cry, through the music, through the hugs of his brothers. As a result of Lhamo's tears, Lobsang begins to cry. Takster holds them both. The music continues.

<DIRECTION>
A golden head of a Buddha - a huge head - appears to be bursting through an archway at the end of a dark hallway.

Her husband does not know.

Lhamo wakes up. He is in a brilliant, green room.

<DIRECTION>
INT. STUDY ROOM, KUMBUM MONASTERY DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stern-looking Teacher from his dream is there, reading scripture, reciting:
</DIRECTION>
<TEACHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"May I be a bridge, a boat, a ship For all who wish to cross the water."
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEACHER>
<DIRECTION>
Lhamo looks down at the complicated words.
</DIRECTION>
<TEACHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you recite?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEACHER>
<DIRECTION>
The boy just waits, sad, lonely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Teacher offers Lhamo an apricot. Lhamo takes the fruit. The Monk pats the boy's head, gently, and Lhamo takes shelter in the kind man's massive robes. The view becomes sunlight through deep, maroon wool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DRELJAM DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
thamo and Lobsang sit inside a ïdreljam" - a rough palanquin, which is attached to two poles and carried between two mules. The vehicle rises and falls, pitches and twists as it is carried along the roadless, Tibetan plains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lhamo reaches forward and pulls back a curtain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TIBETAN PLATEAU DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy is traveling with a caravan. It is not, in fact, an enormous caravan, maybe fifty people, including: Lhamo's family, members of the search party, monks, Muslim traders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dreljam DRIVER looks over at Lhamo and signals that the boy should close the curtain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lhamo does so, only to lean across his brother to look out the other side of his tiny carriage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other side opens to a view of the great, empty land. A herd of deer grazes beside the travelers. Mountains rise in the distance. A flock of geese flies overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lhamo closes the curtain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DRELJAM DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lhamo elbows his brother. Lobsang elbows him back. The two begin to squabble.

<LOBSANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You! You think you are so big!

</LOBSANG>
<DIRECTION>
They hit and pinch until finally the movement of the carriage stops. The Driver reaches in through the open curtains and separates the boys, each to his own side of the dreljam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside his tiny carriage, young Lhamo now sits quiet and composed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMPSITE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cluster of fantastic, Tibetan tents are set up; white cotton tents, with sharp corners, peaked ceilings and elaborate, appliqued designs. Campfires glow, animals bed down, stars shine overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TIBETAN TENT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on a group of ancient, stern-faced MONKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on the baby-faced, Lhamo Dhondrup.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One Monk pulls a huge pair of scissors from his robes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lhamo makes a dive for the tent's door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TENT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing outside the tent is a BODYGUARD - a huge, burly man, wearing monk's robes. He turns to the boy. In one hand he holds a big stick. His face is distorted and deformed by a large tumor under one eye. It is a frightening sight. He looks like a monster to the child.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lhamo jumps back inside the tent. The Bodyguard closes the appliqued flap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DRELJAM DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lhamo has had a haircut. His Mother walks beside the carriage, holding his hand.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
By candlelight, Lhamo is transferred from the rugged, simple carriage, to one of exquisite, yellow silk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PALANQUIN JUST BEFORE DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lhamo peeks out of the silk curtain as he hears the arrival of many horses, many men. SOLDIERS - hundreds of Tibetan soldiers - surround the palanquin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLAINS, OUTSIDE LHASA DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The yellow palanquin is carried across a human border of Tibetan noblemen. These fantastic-looking men and women part, and drop to the ground in prostration, as the palanquin moves through their welcoming committee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PEACOCK TENT DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lhamo walks along a long, patterned carpet, looking up, at this lofty tent's stunning, blue silk, ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is led to a tall, wooden throne, and he is lifted, and then he climbs to the top. Lhamo settles in a cross-legged position on the brocade cushion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hundred of monks, abbots, noblemen, Nepalese, Bhutanese, Chinese, even a red-headed Englishman - they all bow to Lhamo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reting Rinpoche, the young Regent of Tibet, the man who saw this boy's face in his vision, stands below the throne. He addresses the crowd:
</DIRECTION>
<RETING_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chenrezi, the Buddha of compassion. The Wish Fulfilling Jewel. The Fourteenth Dalai Lama.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RETING_RINPOCHE>
<DIRECTION>
And the Regent turns, hikes up his gorgeous robes, and prostrates before the child.
</DIRECTION>
<RETING_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Long life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RETING_RINPOCHE>
<DIRECTION>
In the crowd stand Lhamo's Mother and Father and Lobsang Samten.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On their faces, we must see that they did not realize who their son, their brother, was believed to be.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
First the Mother, and then the Father, bow in front of their youngest child.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Long life.

We hear the sound of a great, Tibetan horn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear peels of childish laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE POTALA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lobsang and Lhamo skid, slide, skate down the endless, slippery hallways of this huge, labyrinthine monastery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three Monks scurry behind the boys, trying to keep up, trying to keep the young incarnate from slipping out of their sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They shout, in loud stage whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<MONKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kundun! Kundun!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONKS>
<DIRECTION>
The monks are no match for the little boys, who are quickly out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS THE POTALA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reting Rinpoche sits cross-legged on the floor of this brightly-painted, red room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across from him sits Lhamo, dressed in fine, yellow silk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
These are simple rooms, decorated with statues, deity scrolls and mandalas, an altar to Buddha. Behind a glass case are toys, mixed in with the Buddhist artifacts: dolls, puppets, balls, blocks, trains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reting Rinpoche is speaking.
</DIRECTION>
<RETING_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Centuries ago, a young boy was born. His name was Gedundrub. The night of his birth, robbers came to his home and his family fled hiding the baby in a cattle pen. When they returned the next day, the baby was safe. They found him guarded by a pair of black crows.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RETING_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was the first Dalai Lama.
	</DIALOGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Living Buddha of Compassion.

	Your job is simple. You are to love all living things. Just love them. Care for them. Have compassion for them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RETING_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"As long as any living thing draws breath, wherever he shall be, there in compassion, shall the Buddha appear, incarnate."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
At the curtain behind Lhamo, we notice the curly-toed shoes of a monk, a man who must be standing in the next room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the room immediately adjacent to this bedroom, we now see the three Monks who chased the young boy down the slippery halls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are the Dalai Lama's personal attendants - the MASTER OF THE RITUAL, the MASTER OF ThE KITCHEN, and the MASTER OF THE ROBE. (It is the Master of the Kitchen who stands directly behind the curtain.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The LORD CHAMBERLAIN is also there. He is a monk. A tall, angular man, with almost nordic features: large, round eyes, a yellowish mustache, sharp nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All of these men will become quite familiar to us, as will the man standing, listening, behind the attendants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is a sweeper, a man named NORBU THUNDRUP, age thirty. He is tall, and gangly, with a wispy beard and a pock-marked face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOM DAY

	I will tell your Lord Chamberlain you are ready to see him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ADJACENT ROOM DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Regent walks through this room on his way out. A passing look from Norbu lets us know that Reting Rinpoche is not well-liked.
</DIRECTION>
<RETING_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He will see you now.

The Lord Chamberlain bows to the boy and then unpacks his parcel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has a rolled, parchment document. He has a beautiful, carved, wooden box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lord Chamberlain points to the mural on the wall behind the boy. It is an elaborate, story-painting.

	Fifth Dalai Lama.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lord Chamberlain places the state seal in the young boy's hands and indicates that the boy should bring the heavy instrument down hard on the parchment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy does. The Lord Chamberlain scribbles a little something on a tab of attached paper, then bows to the boy.

INT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOM DUSK
</DIRECTION>

The view comes in the window and reveals the young Dalai Lama, sitting on the floor with Norbu Thundrup, the sweeper. Tenzin Gyatso has arranged a battlefield of soldiers - little men, made of colored-dough.
</DIRECTION>
<NORBU_THUNDRUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Norbu, Holiness. I will be good, you be bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORBU_THUNDRUP>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso is ferocious in his strategy, taking Norbu's men.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm on a big mountain and hitting at the bad men. And after the game, we're going to trade. You just stay over there, no, there!, Norbu, and I will shoot at you. I want your land. I take it. I am stronger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<NORBU_THUNDRUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am braver.

<NORBU_ThUNDRUP>

Tenzin touches the soft, bald, chin of Norbu.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soft.

<DIRECTION>
And then, Tenzin Gyatso tries to snap his fingers. He cannot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso stands at the window, watching, listening. His hands knead the colored dough into balls, ready to create the next army, the future battleground, as he recites, softly:
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"As long as all living draw breaths, there Buddha is."
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
Norbu Thundrup smiles as he polishes the floor, clearing it of tsampa dough.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GREAT HALL, THE POTALA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Great Hall in the Potala is the seat of Tibetan Government.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
These palace walls are hung with beautiful, old thangkas (silk embroideries or paintings), depicting the life of Buddha.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the hall sits the acting government: the YIGSTANG and the TSITANG - four monks, four laymen - all dressed in their appropriate simplicity and elaborateness. These men sit in two rows, facing one another. The senior monk and the senior layman sit a bit forward. They are the speakers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The senior LAYMAN is on his knees, speaking.
</DIRECTION>
<LAYMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe that the Regent is asking for too high a reward for his part in finding the Dalai Lama. Too much money, too much land.

	We note this. Now, the Chinese.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONK>
<DIRECTION>
There is audible expression of tension.
</DIRECTION>
<MONK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Allies wish to build a supply- road from India, crossing Tibet, as part of their war effort. The road would lead directly to China.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONK>
<DIRECTION>
The Layman gets to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<LAYMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We cannot allow it. Right now, we have a only a small Chinese mission in Lhasa, the first since the Thirteenth Dalai Lama threw them out in 1912. The road would increase the size of that mission. The Chinese would try to control our trade, as they did once before, control our contact with the outside world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAYMAN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lord Chamberlain touches the boy's shoulder and Tenzin Gyatso leaves his hiding place, as the speaker's voice fades away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the two walk down the hallway, Tenzin Gyatso spots an unusual wooden door. He lets the Lord Chamberlain get a little bit ahead of him, and then the boy tries the door. It is heavy. It almost opens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY LATER, DUSK

Tenzin Gyatso and his brother Lobsang are pulling at the heavy door. Behind them, in the distance, we hear:

<DIRECTION>
INT. STORAGE ROOM DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A treasure awaits them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It looks like Aladdin's cave - full of odd, European items.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are glittering music boxes, a porcelain sink, a gilded mirror, a lacquered rocking horse. There are hats, umbrellas and even a pair of lace-up, cordovan shoes. Tenzin Gyatso lifts a reel of film. There are piles of magazines and books. There is a stack of tires in the back corner. The boys uncover a train set and a good collection of lead soldiers. The Dalai Lama pockets a gold watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as the monks find their young charges and we hear them at the door, Tenzin sees something truly spectacular. It is a telescope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The monks enter the room as the young Dalai Lama reaches for this miracle.

<DIRECTION>
The Sweeper tucks the boy in as the Master of the Robe finishes his nightly preparations and with a pat and a smile, the two men leave the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mouse steals a bit of tsampa from the offerings placed on the altar before the Buddha.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso peeks out from under his covers and looks to see if those curly-toed shoes are visible under the partition. They are. The Master of the Kitchen is still near.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso pulls the golden pocket watch from under the covers. He pries and digs at the back of the watch until he succeeds in popping it open, revealing its miraculous insides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Tenzin Gyatso's eyelids grow heavy. The camera passes over his face, as his eyes close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy begins to speak, mumble, as he falls asleep:
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"I be an island for those who seek one, a lamp for light."
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
We find two scrolls; the first is PENDEN LHAMO, the special protectress of the Dalai Lama.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She rides her wild mule through a sea of blood - between rows of jagged mountains. Pointed fingers and spreading toes, her hair gone crazy, her fangs revealed - the details are incredible. A garland of freshly severed heads hangs around her body, snakes hold up her skirt, five skulls form ber crown.

Beside her, on the second scroll is MAHAKALA. He is the fierce representation of the Buddha of Compassion. Crows fly in the clouds to the left of the terrifying, black, six- armed figure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A skull rosary is held in the upper right arm, a Trident is held in the left hand. The deity wears a crown of five skulls. He has three eyes. He tramples an elephant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We might have been in a dream, as the camera finally moves back to find the peaceful1 protected face of the young Dalai Lama. Asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera moves across the mural devoted to the story of the Fifth Dalai Lama. It is a fantasy of green, with mountains and lakes and deities and monsters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We find the statue of Seventh Dalai Lama, sitting on his golden cushion, and we look, deep into the eyes of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama. Fantastic. Deeper. Deeper.

VIEW THROUGH AN EYEPIECE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the Dalai Lama place his young eye at the viewfinder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TERRACE, POTALA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Norbu Thundrup holds the boy steady.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And, a wondorous view of Lhasa is presented.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vendors hawk their goods to elegant ladies, wearing turquoise jewelry and carrying silken parasols. Animals are herded through town by young boys. Children play and squabble. A white wall is covered with cartoons, lampoons - political posters - picturing the Regent, perhaps, as a man holding too much power.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to go down there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<NORBU_THUNDRUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can only go with attendants and a big ceremony.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORBU_THUNDRUP>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to run down the street. I want to buy a toy. Eat from the shops.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You cannot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORBU_THUNDRUP>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to be a shepherd, taking those goats and cows out to the hillside.
	</DIALOGUE>

<NORBU_THUNDRUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you are not a shepherd, you are the Dalai Lama.

<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe in the next life, the world will not need a Dalai Lama.

<NORNU_ThUNDRUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would not know. Maybe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORNU_ThUNDRUP>
<DIRECTION>
The view travels and we see a prison yard. Shackled men share the yard with hairy, fat dogs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One man looks up and sees that the yard is under surveillance. Of course the men all know that this terrace belongs to the boy Dalai Lama.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the boy watches, first one poor, ragged man, then another prostrates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso pulls away from the telescope. He waves to the prisoners.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VALLEY OUTSIDE LHASA DAY (SUMMER, 1942)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy rides in his palanquin of yellow silk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is older now, seven or eight. He peers through the curtain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A grand procession carries the Dalai Lama from the Potala to his summer residence, the Norbulinka.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monks walk in procession, as do members of the aristocracy, wearing their finest gowns and jewelry, holding their finest parasols, and soldiers, wearing ancient uniforms. There are horses, banners and carriages. Bodyguards carry the Dalai Lama's possessions - wrapped in yellow silk. A band plays, "God Save the King."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a magnificent display, and along the side of the road, Tibetans prostrate in the presence of the boy, not daring to look at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE NORBULINKA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Establishing shot of this lovely park.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zt looks like a sweet, summer home compared to the looming expansiveness of the Potala. It is filled with deer and antelope, peacocks and nesting birds. An eccentric collection of trees grow here - some indigenous, some gifts - bearing flowers and fruit. There are fish ponds and even a Kyichu river tributary nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We find the young Dalai Lama standing by this tributary daring to put one foot on a slippery, stepping stone. An Attendant gently pulls him back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beyond the river, a herder leads a small group of braying sheep towards town. The boy watches. He listens to the herder's song.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GARDENS, NORBULINKA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama drops bits of food into a fish pond. He calls the huge, lazy fish to come eat.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Little ones first, only little ones.

The boy pushes the bigger ones away with a stick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. YELLOW WALL, NORBULINKA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso runs through an open gate in a mustard yellow wall (which separates the Dalai Lama's residence from the rest of the Norbulinka), and up the steps leading to a white, one story, home - his parent's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARENT'S HOME, NORBULINKA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A startling, blue room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The young Dalai Lama leans on the table where is Father sits eating pork rinds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lobsang is there, practicing his writing on a chalk board.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso grabs one pork rind, then another, then a third.
</DIRECTION>
<LOBSANG_SAMTEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Dalai Lama is not supposed to eat pork. It is not good for your brain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOBSANG_SAMTEN>
<DIRECTION>
The Father uses the grease from the roasted lamb on the table to caress his long mustache and twirl each side into a point.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama takes another, and then, suddenly, the boy reaches up and for no reason, he pulls on his Father's mustache, obviously hurting the man. The Father slaps the boy's hand, hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy sits back, and begins drawing imaginary letters on the tabletop with his slapped hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His Father reaches out and takes the hurt hand. He pulls the boy into his arms.

The Mother has been in the doorway, listening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso disengages from his Father's arms and goes to his Mother. Tenzin reaches into one of her large, apron pockets and finds nothing. Another. Nothing. He reaches into her sash and pulls out a special-looking sweet. She takes the boy's hand and leads him from the house.
</DIRECTION>
<LOBSANG>

<DIRECTION>
A string of old monks, stand, waiting for the naughty boy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ENTRANCE HALL, DALAI LAMA'S RESIDENCE, NORBULINKA, DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy runs up the stairs and towards the old men, but he stops and looks at a small cabinet standing, unobtrusively, in a corner. Tenzin Gyatso goes to the cabinet and rattles the locked door.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My teeth! My teeth are in here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
A monk takes the boy by the hand and leads him down a hallway.

	<DIALOGUE>
	My old teeth!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bell and a dorge are laid out on a small table. Tenzin Gyatso sits in front of this table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A monk is chanting in low, deep tones, in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama's teacher, TAKTRA RINPOCHE, sits on the floor. (Being the teacher, Taktra Rinpoche sits slightly higher than the Dalai Lama.) Taktra is an older man, in his sixties. He is stern, solid, no-nonsense.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taktra Rinpoche begins a prayer.
</DIRECTION>
<TAKTRA_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"I take refuge in the three jewels, The Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangra."
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAKTRA_RINPOCHE>
<DIRECTION>
But the boy leaps up from his table and goes to Taktra and hangs around his neck, shouting:
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You recite! You recite!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
Taktra gives the boy just the slightest of looks.
</DIRECTION>
<TAKTRA_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"I take refuge in the three jewels, The Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangra."
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAKTRA_RINPOCHE>

Tenzin Gyatso releases the Lama and goes back to his own table.
</DIRECTION>
<TAKTRA_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Until I attain enlightenment."
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAKTRA_RINPOCHE>
<DIRECTION>
Taktra Rinpoche has a small table with the same hand instruments in front of him. The teacher lifts the dorge, in a particular fashion, and rotates it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso lifts his dorge. Taktra's hands move to the boy's and show him the correct movement. It is tried again. Now, the bell is lifted and rung.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would like you to be my new Regent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
Taktra stops. He nods to the boy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the chanting continues, Taktra Rinpoche begins a weaving motion with his hands, delicate, beautiful, hypnotic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso copies the elder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are CLOSE on the boy's moving hands. The chanting becomes the voices of a hundred men, as we FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN: on the boy's hands, but they are a little larger - they are the hands of an eleven or twelve year-old boy - and the motion they carry out is on the verge of becoming extraordinarily beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DARK ROOM, POTALA EVENING (1944)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso sits alone, in a small, dark green, room. He is older. His robes have changed slightly, his manner is more refined, more dignified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is on a retreat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a soft knock at the door. The door is opened and food is placed inside the small room by bodiless hands. Tenzin Gyatso collects his food. He sips his tea and eats his tsampa, while reading from a long, narrow stack of scriptures. Thangkas of MILERAPA - the great Tibetan poet and teacher - hang on the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We notice the curly-toed shoes of the Master of the Kitchen, just visible beneath the wooden door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COURTYARD, THE POTALA NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy walks alone, moving to the rhythm of a memorization. His breath consolidates in the cold night air. The sky is brilliant with stars.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>

INT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, THE POTALA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
School is in session.

</DIRECTION>
<LING_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Four Noble Truths.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LING_RINPOCHE>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso, sitting cross legged on a cushion, responds.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Four Noble Truths, as taught by the Lord Sakyamuni Buddha are: The Truth of Suffering The Truth of the Cause of Suffering, The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering, the Truth of the Way which leads to the cessation of Suffering.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<LING_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I accept it. What is suffering?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LING_RINPOCHE>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	True suffering arises from contaminated actions and afflictions. Birth, illness, grief, old age, poverty, pain, death - these are surferings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<LING_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I accept it. What are the causes of suffering?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LING_RINPOCHE>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The causes of suffering arise from true sources. Attachment, desire, envy, hatred, greed, unkindness, wrong view and so forth - these are some causes of suffering.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
Now we CUT BACK to Ling Rinpoche, but he is standing, outside, in a courtyard. He asks another question, but he raises his right hand as he speaks, and lowers his left, completing the question with a clap of the hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COURTYARD, THE POTALA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a beautiful, blue-sky day. The Dalai Lama is learning "debate". High Lamas sit on tapestry pillows, under appliqued canopies, observing. Young monks can be seen, watching, from a greater distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lord Chamberlain sits to one side. Taktra Rinpoche, now Regent, is beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama sits on the ground at Ling's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<LING_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How does one progress from the realization of one Noble Truth to another?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(clap)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long silence from His Holiness. The Lamas wait on tender hooks. Finally, the boy says:
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We will have to think about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
There is laughter. Even Ling Rinpoche laughs and the boy erupts into his beautiful, free, easy laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to squeeze this brain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<LING_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Answer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(clap)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pause, and then:
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When one understands that he causes some of his own suffering, needlessly, then he looks for the causes in his own life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And when and he looks for those causes, when he investigates, then he is putting confidence in his own ability to eliminate the sources and end the suffering.
	</DIALOGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A wish to find a path to peace arises. For all beings desire happiness. All wish to find their purest selves.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Ling nods in approval.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks to the elders.
</DIRECTION>
<LING_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I accept it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LING_RINPOCHE>
<DIRECTION>
Taktra Rinpoche and the Lord Chamberlain are proud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAME COURTYARD DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso runs up a slant board and leaps off the edge - a big jump, a flying leap. He falls to the ground, then gets up, laughing, and runs up the board again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same old monks who watched him debate, watch him play.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lord Chamberlain and Taktra Rinpoche are among them. The Lord Chamberlain obviously loves watching his young charge play. The Regent is not so sure.
</DIRECTION>
<TAKTRA_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Careful! Careful!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAKTRA_RINPOCHE>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso shouts:

INT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, THE POTALA NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Nechung Oracle is the protective deity of Tibet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tonight, he is in full trance. It is an amazing sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The monk who is his medium spins and twirls, he wags his heavy headdress about. A round mirror glitters on his chest. Sweat pours from his brow, over his wildly grimacing face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Oracle spits at the government officials in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Horns blow, cymbals crash, incense burns. The Oracle nears the Dalai Lama and retreats from him. Finally, he whispers in the boy's ear.
</DIRECTION>
<ORACLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heed the warning of your predecessor. Or the war will end here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORACLE>
<DIRECTION>
And then, the Oracle gently straightens Tenzin Gyatso's yellow robes, before the trance ends and the Oracle falls into the arms of his attendants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wind whistles through the Potala's hallways and porticos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Master of the Kitchen is clearing away the dinner dishes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The view of the floor reveals that a "toy" war is being waged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a "Meccano" set, the young Dalai Lama has created what looks like an airplane, and a tank. These vehicles are manned by beautifully detailed lead soldiers - British World War One Field soldiers, French Legionaries and American Artillery men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Norbu Thundrup, is flying low with a tsampa~dough airplane. He drops little tsampa-dough bombs from his hand. He hits a tank and knocks down a few lead soldiers.

INT. GARDENS, NORBULINKA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His Holiness works on an old movie projector. A white- haired, CHINESE MONK works with him. The old Monk has very little patience. He bangs his hand on the table, and huffs and puffs as the two try again to fiddle with this and that. Tenzin Gyatso works diligently and calmly.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Patience is the first of the Six Perfections.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
The old Monk mutters something in Chinese. They thread a roll of dusty film into the reel and spin the wheel. The film breaks. The old monk bangs the table again. The work continues.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One day, we will get that automobile running.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
The monks slaps his head in horrid anticipation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DARK ROOM, NORBULINKA NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A movie begins, shown on a piece of cloth tacked to a wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a newsreel - footage from World War One. The trenches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy goes up to the cloth screen and touches it gently, playing with his own shadow as men dash from foxholes across a muddy, body strewn field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy steps back and stares at the horror of real war; men sleeping in the muddy foxholes, make-shift hospitals tend the dying. Youths - not much older than His Holiness - weep into their filthy, bloody hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Old Monk keeps his trembling hand on the noisy, hand- operated, projector.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso slowly sits, cross-legged, on the bare floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
War does not look good on film.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, NORBULINKA NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy sits alone, in front of his altar, praying. Meditating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALTAR ROOM, THE NORBULINKA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A black room, lit by butter lamps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taktra Rinpoche and Tenzin Gyatso sit opposite one another, cross-legged on the floor. Taktra is the teacher, he sits a bit higher.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is a shrine to Mahakala, the Dalai Lama's personal deity. Mahakala is present, in the form of a huge, golden statue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy has his head bent low to catch the Rinpoche's words. There is much gesturing, much murmuring. We might catch only a word or two.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An oral teaching is being passed on, a lineage teaching. It is sacred and secret.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UPPER COURTYARD, THE POTALA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on a thangka of Penden Lhamo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear monks debating. It is Ling Rinpoche answering, playing the student.
</DIRECTION>
<LING_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"To be born in a time when the Buddha has appeared. To be born in a time when the Buddha has taught. To be born when the teaching of Buddha is alive."

	</DIALOGUE>
</LING_RINPOCHE>
<DIRECTION>
The view widens now and we are under a softly billowing, appliqued canopy. Maybe fifty monks and lamas are present. This is an informal group.
</DIRECTION>
<QUESTIONER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How is human life precious?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUESTIONER>
<LING_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As a result of previous karma, you have obtained this human life. By means of this rebirth, through work and study, you can attain all everlasting happiness. In the words of Shantideva: "With the boat of this precious life, You can cross the waters of Samsara. How rare to find this boat!" "Oh, ignorant one, do not fall asleep now!"
	</DIALOGUE>
</LING_RINPOCHE>
<DIRECTION>
Shots ring out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men jump to their feet, and rush out from under the canopy. The Dalai Lama is right in front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More shots as the men stare out across the countryside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear murmurs of:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sera, Sera Monastery. Reting. Under arrest. The army is taking him right past Sera! Monastery! Those crazy monks! Have been threatening trouble. Reting tried to assassinate Taktra Rinpoche.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICES>
<DIRECTION>
We hear these snippets as the Dalai Lama runs from the group.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAYS, POTALA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is almost black inside this old building. The panting boy runs up and up and up several staircases.

Tenzin Gyatso runs down the hall and enters his red rooms.

EXT. DALAI LAMA'S TERRACE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso climbs up on a small, wooden platform, and mans his telescope.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the army, firing on Sera Monastery! Oh, no! Oh, no!

</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<NORBU_THUNDRUP>

	Reting Rinpoche has been arrested. He tried to overthrow Regent Taktra. Today, he is brought back to Lhasa by government officials. The monks at Sera Monastery have been on his side. Now, there is trouble between them and the army.

<LORD_CHAMBERLAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Thirteenth Dalai Lama's warning. He wrote to you, the year before he died. The year before you were born.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD_CHAMBERLAIN>
<DIRECTION>
The Lord Chamberlain walks to a far, sheltered end of the terrace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso slowly turns the telescope to see the prison yard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
View through the telescope; the yard is full of prisoners, listening to the shooting. One man sees the telescope aimed at the prison and prostrates. Then another, and another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso steps away from the telescope and turns to follow his Lord Chamberlain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OTHER SIDE OF TERRACE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lord Chamberlain opens a yellowing letter and begins to read. Tenzin Gyatso sits down beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<LORD_CHAMBERLAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"It may happen, that here in Tibet, religion and government will be attacked both from without and within. Unless we guard our own country..."
	</DIALOGUE>

CLOSE on the Lord Chamberlain. Today, he appears tired; the whites of his eyes appear enormous. His voice is quite beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<LORD_CHAMBERLAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"...it will now happen that the Dalai and Panchen Lamas, the Father and the Son, and all the revered holders of the faith, will disappear and become nameless."

Tenzin Gyatso unwinds the rosary from his wrist and begins thumbing the brown beads.
</DIRECTION>
<LORD_CHAMBERLAIN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	"All beings will be sunk in great hardship and overwhelming fear; the days and nights will drag on slowly in suffering."

INT. ADJACENT ROOM DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy climbs onto a cushion and sits - a head above his officials. He is tentative, unsure of form and procedure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is an awkward, formal silence. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Taktra Rinpoche, I understand there was an attempt on your life.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What is the danger from the Chinese, now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<KASHAG_MEMBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very complicated, Holiness. Let me tell you current news.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KASHAG_MEMBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Chinese have launched a deceptive campaign aimed at convincing the world that Tibet belongs to China.
	</DIALOGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We sent a mission to the Chinese National Conference. Our attendance was a grave mistake. The Tibetans were introduced as delegates from the "Chinese region of Tibet". We protested this reference and demanded a letter rebutting it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you receive the letter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<KASHAG_MEMBER>

	We did not.

<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Tibet, too, needs to define itself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<LORD_CHAMBERLAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. As a free country. But our attempts have proven futile. We continue to be badly outmaneuvered by the Chinese.
	</DIALOGUE>

<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can India help us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>

<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ask the Chinese mission to leave our country. Immediately.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>

A shocking suggestion.
</DIRECTION>
<LORD_CHAMBERLAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quite simple. Yes. Good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD_CHAMBERLAIN>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I shall send a letter to America, to the President, informing him of our problem.

INT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOM NIGHT

The Dalai Lama sits at his desk, writing a letter.

The radio is on. It is the BBC - with news of a Communist advantage in Kuomintang China.

Norbu Thundrup enters. The boy looks up.

	Listen to this, Norbu.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. DALAI LAMA'S TERRACE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso is alone. He has a little smelting arrangement built out on the terrace. He lays a lead soldier on the hot bottom of a heavy, metal bowl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on the soldier. It begins to melt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy has a pile of the soldiers. He drops a second one in the bowl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We bear the sounds of Lhasa - laughter, street songs - and we see the stars, hanging, it seems, just above the young boy's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NORBULINKA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The young Tenzin Gyatso bursts through the gate in the Yellow Wall and runs across the beautiful garden to his parents's home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARENTS'S HOME, NORBULINKA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A family gathering meets the boy's eye when he enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is his Mother, his oldest sister, Tsering Dolma, Lobsang Samten, a younger sister, Pema, baby brother Tendzin Chuta, and his oldest brother, Takster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We don't recognize these faces, of course, but the gathering is obviously familial.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only the boy's Father is missing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso goes to his Mother and lays his head in her lap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On an altar behind her, is a silver frame. In the frame is a picture of her husband.

DREAM SEQUENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HILLTOP DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The body of the Dalai Lama's Father lays on a flat boulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Incense smoke curls into the air. Prayer wheels are turned, hand drums are played - the burial men stand off to one side, their hatchets and knives in view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso is present. He is the boy we know, but beside him stands the four year-old boy, Lhamo, from the beginning of the movie, and on the other side of him stands the boy who will play the Dalai Lama in the next section of the film - a boy about fifteen or sixteen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso wraps his brown rosary around his left wrist. The beads catch the brilliant afternoon light. The sixteen year-old Dalai Lama wears the same colored rosary around his left wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cutters move in to the corpse, and as we hear them begin the work of dismembering the body, the view pans up to reveal the vultures circling overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The last person leaving the hilltop with is the Dalai Lama as an older man - not a character from this movie - but a man of about fifty years, wearing glasses, wearing the same robes, the same rosary. Little Lhamo walks beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

EXT. SKY OVER TIBET NIGHT

We hear a loud explosion, and then another and another and another. The sound begins to fade, but the blue-black, peaceful, star-filled sky is shattered by bright bursts of red and yellow and pink light.

<DIRECTION>
It is a frightening sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GARDEN, NORBULINKA DAWN (1950)

The still waters of the fish pond begin to move. The fish swim in nervous circles; the water laps over its stone banks.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. DALAI LAMA'S RESIDENCE DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The whole building shakes. Earthquake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One monk runs down the stairs, another monk runs up, both staring at a second floor window - a black-rimmed, glass window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A red cloth is pulled back and the window is opened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fifteen year-old Tenzin Gyatso looks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a terrible rumbling: the rumbling that accompanies an earthquake. Finally, slowly, the sound, and the movement subsides.
</DIRECTION>

CLOSE on Tenzin Gyatso. He lets the curtain fall.

INT. HALLWAY DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso looks at his advisor, and then, he closes the door as the demand for his enthronement continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks down the hall, past the door leading to the treasure room, alone now - an adult. He is wearing those European, lace-up shoes found in the treasure room so long ago. They are still too big for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRIBUTARY OF THE KYICHU RIVER, NORBULINKA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso and Taktra Rinpoche walk side by side along the waterway.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we agree that we are part of China, nothing else will matter. Not trade, not defense. We will be lost.

<TAKTRA_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would you do, Holiness?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAKTRA_RINPOCHE>
<DIRECTION>
The boy looks out over the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shepherds are leading their flock of sheep back toward town on the far side of the tributary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two men stand side by side, one so young, one seeming so old.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What should I do about my doubt, Teacher?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<TAKTRA_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is a difficult situation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAKTRA_RINPOCHE>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, my doubt. Why me? Am I Him?
	</DIALOGUE>

<TAKTRA_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doubt is an affliction. Reliquish it. Accept.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAKTRA_RINPOCHE>
<DIRECTION>
Pause.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe we must make no concesions to the Chinese. But, I am one voice. The Dalai Lama has always trusted in the forces of Buddha. Let us consult the protective deities.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
Taktra Rinpoche bows and leaves him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso stands alone by the river. The boy watches the herders, and before the young shepherds disappear from sight, the Dalai Lama turns and waves a hand behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two Bodyguards approach. We can not hear, but as the Dalai Lama walks away from us, down the river, one Bodyguard runs up river, shouting:
</DIRECTION>
<BODYGUARD>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We will buy them! We will buy them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODYGUARD>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALTAR ROOM, NORBULINKA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In this black room, under the protective view of the statue of Mahakala, a divine lottery is performed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso, the Regent Taktra Rinpoche, The Lord chamberlain, the Kashag, the Yigstang and the Tsitang are all present.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tsampa-dough balls are made, three of them, each containing a strip of parchment, bearing writing. The dough is shaped and weighed to see that each ball is equal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, the three balls are placed in a silver bowl and the bowl is spun. The balls whirl, race, and finally one leaps from the bowl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This ball is taken to the Dalai Lama and he makes a mark on it. The ball is returned to the bowl, the procedure is repeated, and a ball leaps again, almost immediately. This ball is presented and the Dalai Lama places his mark - next to the mark he just made. It is the same ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso makes the twelfth mark on the same ball, and the spinning begins again and then the thirteenth mark, and then the ball is broken open and the strip of parchment handed to the Regent.
</DIRECTION>
<TAKTRA_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We should not accept any conditions from the Chinese.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAKTRA_RINPOCHE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GARDENS, NORBULINKA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a paved area, adjacent to the Yellow Wall which marks the Dalai Lama's private grounds, the Opera Festival has begun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This festival involves performances by Tibetan singers, dancers and actors. It looks to be a joyous occasion; officials and their wives are dressed in their finest and sit before beautifully laid picnics. Children run here and there, amidst the monks and nomads, the swashbuckling Khambas from eastern Tibet (large people, with heavy braids wrapped in red cloth on top of their heads). There are westerners, Nepalese and Sikimese.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dancers - dressed in wild, colorful outfits - spin and leap in time to the eerie, Tibetan music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atop a low building on the Yellow Wall, stands an elaborate enclosure - draped in yellow silk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama sits inside it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ENCLOSURE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso is alone in this little room; his arms rest on a window ledge as he stares down at the festival taking place below him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GARDENS DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bit more of the dancers and the people enjoying themselves - all from the isolated point of view of the Dalai Lama.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We recognize a few characters: Keustang Rinpoche. His Holiness's Mother with her younger children, the favorite sweeper, Norbu Thundrup - dressed in a fine hat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But a distant figure becomes apparent - he is a MESSENGER - he is running, through the crowds, toward the Yellow Wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We stay on this desperate little figure as he draws closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ENCLOSURE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy is watching the Messenger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GARDENS DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back to that messenger as he works his way, ever closer to the building which holds the Dalai Lama aloft, and then we lose sight of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ENCLOSURE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso leans back in his seat. The yellow silk curtain that his elbows have held open now fall closed and we hear the heavy footsteps of the runner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A knock.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAKTRA_RINPOCHE>
<DIRECTION>
The Regent is next door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy climbs up on a chest and peeks through a tiny window in the wall which separates this enclosure from the Regent's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taktra Rinpoche reads a telegram. His aging face becomes quite grave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Regent leaves his side of the enclosure.
</DIRECTION>
<REGENT>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

EXT. GARDENS, NORBULINKA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back to a new group of performers - satirists, dressed as high lamas and monks - even as the Nechung Oracle - lampooning the rulers. The crowd roars with laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, NORBULINKA DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lord Chamberlain stands with the teenage Dalai Lama. The room is a violent red in the sunset.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso has cleared off his table, he is creating a three-dimensional battlefield as his Lord Chamberlain explains the situation. Tenzin Gyatso uses papers, books, little statues to bring a physical life to the words we hear.
</DIRECTION>
<LORD_CHAMBERLAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They crossed the river, Holiness. They have invaded in six locations, Chando Province, Kham, eastern Tibet.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What is the size of our army, now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<LORD_CHAMBERLAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eight thousand, five hundred, soldiers and officers. We have recently requested mortars, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition from India. We have several hundred in the area.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD_CHAMBERLAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Little statues are placed facing what stands-in for the river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lord Chamberlain helps the boy to create this panorama.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Has anyone died?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<LORD_CHMBERLAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The radio contact said one officer had died. Then he said, "The Chinese soldiers - they are coming." And then, the radio went dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD_CHMBERLAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso lifts one statue, a small, golden Buddha, from the display. He cradles the Buddha in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One man. A man has died. One man is too many.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, NORBULINKA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In beautiful sunlight, the painted cabinets of this room glisten. Rainbows of color play on the glass windows. The Dalai Lama sits at a low table, a pack of colored pencils, or pastels, spread out around him. He is teaching his little brother to draw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Together, little hand in bigger hand, they draw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama's Mother sits in a side chair, watching her sons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The little boy screams with laughter as the brothers draw a yak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GARDENS, NORBULINKA NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A movie is being shown - outside - on a makeshift screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is "Henry the Fourth".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a treat for the sweepers, and gardeners and servants. children sit on the grass, mesmerized by this incredible vision.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso sits beside Heinrich Harrer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy rubs his eyes wearily. He appears distracted. This line is spoken by an actor:
</DIRECTION>
<ACTOR_IN_MOVIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Heavy lies the head, that wears the crown."
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACTOR_IN_MOVIE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on Tenzin Gyatso.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD BEHIND NORBULINKA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama sits behind the wheel of a 1927 Austin. He is a lousy driver - a boy who never commanded a wheeled vehicle in all of his young life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Attendants sit in the back seat, holding on for dear life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear Tenzin Gyatso's wonderful, deep laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOM, THE POTALA NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso is listening to Peking Radio. Norbu Thundrup is with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy tinkers with a clock as he listens - he is swiftly becoming a master tinkerer.
</DIRECTION>
<RADIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"This week, the People's Liberation Army crossed the Drichu River east of Chamdo and began the peaceful liberation of Tibet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RADIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tibet is in the hands of imperialist enemies of the people. The Dalai Lama, a foolish reminder of an illiterate past, is the figure head of this autonomous region of China. Accept our help, Tibet! The people shall be free!"

<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do the people say, Norbu?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
Norbu is not shy in his report.
</DIRECTION>
<NORBU_THUNDRUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tibetan officials have retreated from Chamdo. They are scared and running. The Chinese strategy has destroyed the heart of our defense forces. Chamdo falls, several other villages are lost. You know what happens. The road to Lhasa will be wide open.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORBU_THUNDRUP>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso listens carefully to the man.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Nechung Oracle spins in his trance. Horns blow, cymbals clash, the Oracle spurts sounds as lamas chant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, the Oracle approaches the boy, stands beside him, like a lieutenant, a comrade, and says:
</DIRECTION>
<ORACLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"His time has come."
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORACLE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TERRACE, THE POTALA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama is reading - Tibet's appeal to the United Nations.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"To the members of the United Nations:
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The attention of the world is riveted on Korea where aggression is being resisted by an international force. Similar happenings in remote Tibet are passing without notice. The problem is not of Tibet's own making but is largely the outcome of unthwarted Chinese ambition to bring weaker nations on her periphery within her active domination."
	</DIALOGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is very good. Quite strong.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Lord Chamberlain and the four members of the Kashag agree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy continues:
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Tibetans have for long lived a cloistered life in their mountain fastness, remote and aloof..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
In the background, we see monks on top of a wall, long horns in front of them. The blowing begins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a courtyard below, a debating session is in progress. We hear the shouts and the claps and watch the beautiful body movements of the questioners. Laughter fills the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below that, the small capital of Tibet - the mysterious city, the forbidden city of Lhasa - carries on, for now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, THE POTALA NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A monk - an abbot, in fact - sits beside Tenzin Gyatso.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is Takster Rinpoche, the Dalai Lama's oldest brother.
</DIRECTION>
<TAKSTER_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was never alone. Two Chinese were with me every minute of the day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAKSTER_RINPOCHE>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso plays with a box of those special sweets which comes from his mother.
</DIRECTION>
<TAKSTER_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Their talk is always of liberation and helpfulness. They put their words like honey on a knife, but if you lick the honey, you will bleed.
	</DIALOGUE>

Takster Rinpoche begins to say something, but holds back.

	Tell me.

</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<TAKSTER_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They think they have convinced me. They think I am on their side. They have allowed me to leave Kumbum and come to Lhasa believing that I will try to turn you to their ways. If I do not succeed, I am to eliminate you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAKSTER_RINPOCHE>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>

	I do.

	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<TAKSTER_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Chinese have one goal. The complete dissolution of our nation. The destruction of our culture. There is no room for Buddha in their world.

	Our only hope is to fight.

The Dalai Lama enters the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy goes to a small table where a document is unrolled before him.

Tenzin Gyatso lifts the gold seal of power and affixes it to the document.

<DIRECTION>
Norbu is there, watching.

INT. HALLS OF THE POTALA PRE-DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso walks down this dark hall. The three attendants are with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TEMPLE DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is very dark green. Butter lamps highlight certain faces - members of the Kashag, noblemen, the tutors, an Englishman, Nepalese, Bhutanese, Tibetan Muslims - but the darkness conceals the great number of people present.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the unmistakable Tibetan horns and cymbals. We hear the chanting of monks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy is handed a Golden Wheel, symbolizing the assumption of temporal power.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At one moment, the Lamas all put on their yellow hats - a color that peeks at us out of this dark room. And we hear a voice:
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
(VO)
</DIRECTION>

	We shall send delegations to America, India, Nepal and Great Britain, in hope that these countries will intervene on our behalf.

Tenzin Gyatso is packing. We hear whispers in the adjacent room as the Masters of the Robe and the Ritual organize belongings into piles: rolled thangkas, precious manuscripts, maroon robes, a few english books, the radio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy finds a few golden coins in a drawer and slips them into his robes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso adds a package of tools, an atlas, the photo of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama, the European shoes. Then, he goes to the terrace.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy does not need a footstool anymore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He glides the telescope across the countryside, catching sight of the young herders leading their sheep back into town. He picks up a corner of the market place and the hub- bub of the end of the day. Wall posters show Tibetan soldiers fleeing the Red Army.

And then, he aims his view-finder at the prison yard.

It is empty. The prisoners are gone.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso - dressed in the warm, woolen chuba of a layman - keeps his back against the wall. Norbu is beside him, carrying a flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Bodyguard comes for them, and then, the Dalai Lama is outside the Potala walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. POTALA NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The small group walks down a rocky path. A grey horse is waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso is helped onto the horse. Norbu sees that he is comfortable, and then, the flashlight goes out. Norbu fiddles with it. Tenzin Gyatso takes the torch and tries get it working again. The Guard mounts his horse. It is time to go. The horses snort, their breath consolidating the cold night air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso cannot speak. He tries, but he cannot. Norbu takes the flashlight.
</DIRECTION>

The horse is turned and the Dalai Lama is led away to join the soldiers at the foot of the path.

Tenzin Gyatso turns once, to see his friend. The night is dark. Norbu has become invisible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cold and moonless night, lit only by the millions of stars that shine over Tibet. The caravan - made up of noblemen, monks, family mambers and over two hundred soldiers (armed with rifles, machine guns and field artillery) - journeys out of Lhasa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on the Dalai Lama: riding the shepherd's path.

INT. ALTAR ROOM NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The shrine of Mahakala. Butter lamps cast their eerie glow on the black walls as the boy presents a white, silk scarf, a kata - a traditional token of leaving and return.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT ENTRANCE WAY, NORBULINKA NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso is about to leave the residence when he stops, and looks at the small cabinet in the corner. He goes to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door is still locked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on the boy. Suddenly, he knows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches a hand behind the cabinet. The hand comes back to him with a key.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso opens the cabinet doors. Several drawers are revealed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy opens one. Empty. Another. Empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Bodyguard says, from the stairs:
</DIRECTION>
<BODYGUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We must go, Holiness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODYGUARD>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
Another drawer. Empty. And then, success.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a small drawer, there is something, wrapped in red velvet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy opens it, with shaking hands. Teeth. False teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso releases a sharp laugh, he has been holding his breath. He wraps up the teeth and puts them back, but behind the teeth is something more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A rolled, white silk scarf, a kata.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso takes the scarf. He unrolls it. Something falls on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tiny, lead soldier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso lifts the soldier. It is a Ghurka. An Indian soldier.
</DIRECTION>
<BODYGUARD>

<DIRECTION>
Coracles - skin boats - are loaded with bundles and people and pushed off the banks and into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Horses, donkeys and yaks must swim across.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso is helped into a boat. The rowers, wrapped in heavy wool and sheepskin, their arms bare, push off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy is sprayed with water. He is bumped about. He is freezing cold. He floats away from Lhasa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The caravan journeys through a narrow mountain pass. The flags of Tibet and of the Dalai Lama are carried by mounted soldiers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, monks come running from the surrounding mountain trails, shrieking, wailing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They run to lamas, grabbing at their robes, clutching, crying out:
</DIRECTION>
<MONKS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do not let him go! We beg of you, do not take him from us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONKS>
<DIRECTION>
One monk clutches for an instant at the layman's wrapping on Tenzin Gyatso - but he does not recognize him as the Dalai Lama
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy tenderly embraces this distraught figure, but the monk drops away from him and clings to the shy, sweet presence of Ling Rinpoche.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama is quickly and quietly surrounded by soldiers - discreetly, so as not to give away his identity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ling Rinpoche speaks to a group.
</DIRECTION>
<LING_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He goes for a short time, until the danger can be determined. He will not leave Tibet. He will return.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LING_RINPOCHE>
<DIRECTION>
The pain on these monks's faces, in their voices, is tragic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso is overwhelmed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees before him a line of prostrate monks - but they are not bowing to him, they are laying down in the pass, trying to block the way of the caravan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ling Rinpoche goes to these men and gently helps them to their feet.
</DIRECTION>
<LING_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He will return. The Precious One will not abandon you.

INT. TENT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama lies awake in his camp bed. He cannot sleep. He rises and walks to the tent flap. He opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TENT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Bodyguard is posted. He turns to the Dalai Lama.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We recognize him. He is the Bodyguard from that first caravan trip so long ago: a huge monk with a big stick - the guard who stood outside the old monks's tent. The man with the deformed face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy is not frightened this time.
</DIRECTION>

<BODYGUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holiness, this has come for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BODYGUARD>
<DIRECTION>
The Bodyguard hands the boy a parcel. Tenzin Gyatso unwraps it. His flashlight. It works.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pause, and then Tenzin Gyatso sits in front of the thangka of Penden Lhamo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reads from the scripture pages laid out on the low table. He reads by flashlight.

	This little brother was terribly sweet. When he died, my mother was so sad. A lama said to her, before the little brother was laid out for burial, take a bit of butter and rub a spot on his skin. He will come back to you, you will see. So, my mother did this, and a few years later, a new boy was born.

	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
The General does. So does the Dalai Lama. The other two Chinese remain standing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso is quiet, reserved. Awkward.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL_CHIANG_CHIN_WU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you heard the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_CHIANG_CHIN_WU>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<GENERAL_CHIANG_CHIN_WU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a copy for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_CHIANG_CHIN_WU>
<DIRECTION>
A document is produced. We notice that the General is wearing a gold rolex watch. The Dalai Lama notices, too. A member of the Kashag takes the document.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL_CHIANG_CHIN_WU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We come in genuine friendship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_CHIANG_CHIN_WU>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on the Dalai Lama.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He makes no response.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL_CHIANG_CHIN_WU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am certain you wish to return to Lhasa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_CHIANG_CHIN_WU>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso remains silent.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL_CHIANG_CHIN_WU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have plans to return soon, Dalai Lama?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_CHIANG_CHIN_WU>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<GENERAL_CHIANG_CHIN_WU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. Our first request is that you allow us to build a road. You have no roads in Tibet. We can discuss the plans in Lhasa. When you return.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_CHIANG_CHIN_WU>
<DIRECTION>
No response.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL_CHIANG_WU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. We leave now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_CHIANG_WU>
<DIRECTION>
The General rises as the boy remains seated. With a moment of awkward silence, the Chinese depart.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me see the agreement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
It is handed to him. He opens to the last page and looks at the impression made by the state seal.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Counterfeit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
He closes the document and hands it back to the official.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TERRACE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy watches the delegation leave the hilltop station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taktra Rinpoche and the Lord Chamberlain are with him.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought he would be some kind of monster, even with horns growing out of his head. But, he is only a man, just an ordinary human being, like myself. Life is always a lesson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again, an informal meeting is in session.
</DIRECTION>
<KASHAG_MEMBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Prime Ministers, support the proposal that you return to Lhasa. On the opposite hand, some officials urge you not to return. They believe you should leave now, for India.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KASHAG_MEMBER>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I were to go into exile, could we expect any serious assistance, from India, suppose?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<LORD_CHANBERLAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is unlikely. America, perhaps. There is great anti-communist feeling in America.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD_CHANBERLAIN>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At this point, the most likely result of a foreign pact is war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<LORD_CHAABERLAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Chinese would see such a pact as an open declaration of war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD_CHAABERLAIN>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tibet, at war? No. China is close, America is far away. After countless people die, China would still, always, be close. We will work with what we have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<KASHAG_MEMBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And as for your own safety, Holiness?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KASHAG_MEMBER>
<DIRECTION>
A pause.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am scared.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<LORD_CHAMBERLAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall we consult the protective deities, Holiness?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD_CHAMBERLAIN>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My first and foremost duty is to protect my people. I feel sure of this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And, things change. Maybe not right away, maybe not soon. But I believe this - things will change.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The boy snaps his fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Impermanence. Our own short lifetimes are not the only valid consideration.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I shall return.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso is asleep. We have not seen him this still, this peaceful, in a long time. He sleeps in the "Buddha~ pose" - on his right side9 his head resting in his right hand. The wall behind him is white.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We begin to hear the unique Tibetan music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DREAM SEQUENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso rides a grey mule across the empty, mysterious landscape of Tibet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy is back in his own home in Amdo province.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But, he is not the baby he was when he left there, he is sixteen. His family is together, but they are all the sizes and ages they were at the beginning of the story. Tenzin Gyatso is very happy, sitting on the raised platform in the kitchen, playing a game with pebbles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taktra Rinpoche - the aged Taktra - enters and sits down beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<TAKTRA_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you will not feel badly about all the things of childhood you missed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAKTRA_RINPOCHE>
<DIRECTION>
The boy does not speak, just looks, kindly, at the man.
</DIRECTION>
<TAKTRA_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You lost so much. I am sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAKTRA_RINPOCHE>
<DIRECTION>
The boy shakes his head "no".
</DIRECTION>
<TAKTRA_RINPOCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, Kundun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAKTRA_RINPOCHE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, another man speaks;
</DIRECTION>
<NORBU_THUNDRUP>
<DIRECTION>
(OC)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, Kundun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORBU_THUNDRUP>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso turns his head to see his best friend.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
(he only mouths it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
And now, the Dalai Lama's Father is seen in a corner of the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, Kundun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
(silent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
The boy turns to the sweeper once more, holds out his hand, and mouths:
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Norbu!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
Reverse on Norbu, fading away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DREAM SEQUENCE ENDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso eyes burst open. He is awake. He is older. Twenty. But, there is something ageless about him, now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DALAI LAMA'S ROOM, THE POTALA PRE-DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy begins this day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is in his old room at the Potala, in Lhasa. The green mural of the Fifth Dalai Lama is behind him. He has risen. from the red-curtained bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Masters of the Kitchen and the Robe arrive and begin their preparations for the day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A NEW SWEEPER works in the adjacent room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun rises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE POTALA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like a painting, the beautiful monastery fills the screen with its white walls and red roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shouting is heard.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL_CHIANG>
<DIRECTION>
(OC)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate meeting here, this tribute to the past! I demand a less formal meeting place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_CHIANG>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on the red, bulging face of General Chiang.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GREAT HALL, THE POTALA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the General hang fantastic thangkas of the Fifth Dalai Lama.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL_CHIANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not a foreigner! I refuse to be treated like one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_CHIANG>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama is shaken by this violent behavior. He adjusts his new eye glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see here thangkas of the Fifth Dalai Lama, the founder of our government. It is tradition at formal meetings for these thangkas to be hung.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<GENERAL_CHIANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Superstitions. Tibet is part of a modern nation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_CHIANG>
<DIRECTION>
The General sits.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL_CHIANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want the songs stopped.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_CHIANG>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Songs? What songs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
A slight smile.
</DIRECTION>
<PRIME_MINISTER_LUKHANGWA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Street songs about the General. Reference to his gold watch. He is right, they are quite insulting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIME_MINISTER_LUKHANGWA>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no authority to ban singing in my country.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<GENERAL_CHIANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must also do something about the public meetings. I see this, memorandum circulating, with Tibetan grievances.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_CHIANG>
<LUKHANGWA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have cracked a man's skull and that crack has not healed. It is too soon to expect him to be your friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKHANGWA>
<GENERAL_CHIANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are simply respecting the terms of the Seventeen Point Agreement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_CHIANG>
<LUKHANGWA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you, General?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKHANGWA>
<GENERAL_CHIANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We want 2,000 more tons of barley distributed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_CHIANG>
<LUKHANGWA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Impossible! You will bring famine down on the people of Tibet with these insatiable demands! More food, the best land for your soldiers to camp.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKHANGWA>
<GENERAL_CHIANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The People's Liberation Army pays for all food and lodging.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_CHIANG>
<LUKHANGWA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So far, they do. But, the quantity, it does not exist. You will have to re- evaluate your needs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKHANGWA>
<DIRECTION>
The men glare at one another.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL_CHIANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much tea do you drink, Prime Minister?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_CHIANG>
<LUKHANGWA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It depends on the quality. And, that it be Indian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKHANGWA>
<DIRECTION>
The General leaps to his feet and is about to strike the Prime Minister.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama runs between then. He holds the General back.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKHANGWA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why is it necessary for the Chinese to keep so many soldiers in Lhasa?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKHANGWA>
<GENERAL_CHIANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To protect. To serve you. Chairman Mao wants you to feel that China belongs to you now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_CHIANG>
<LUKHANGWA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chairman Mao can keep China. Just give us back Tibet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKHANGWA>
<DIRECTION>
The General backs away and brings himself under control.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL_CHIANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Plans for absorbing the Tibetan army into the People's Army will soon be finalized.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_CHIANG>
<LUKHANGWA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will not approve it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKHANGWA>
<GENERAL_CHIANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then, we will begin with replacing the Tibetan flag with the flag of the Motherland.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_CHIANG>
<LUKHANGWA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And we will begin with tearing it down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKHANGWA>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso stands between these furious men. He raises a hand, silently requesting peace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TERRACE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the sound of martial drums and trumpets and tubas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama is at his telescope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three thousand PLA soldiers march along the shepherds's trail. They march behind huge, red banners of Mao Tse-tung and Chu-te.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This time, the soldiers do look like monsters. Their faces are grey - coated with Tibetan dust. Their peaked hats look vaguely like horns, their tattered, khaki uniforms like rough hide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monks line the trail, whipping at the soldiers with their long, maroon robes. Women and children spit at the Chinese, clap at them, hoping to chase this evil away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, THE POTALA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Prime Ministers, Lukhangwa and Lobsang Tashi, submit their resignations to His Holiness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy takes the roll of parchment from them.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am so sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<LUKHANGWA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It must be done. We can no longer meet with the Chinese, they refuse us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKHANGWA>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the sounds of those Chinese tubas and trumpets. We hear trucks.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I accept your resignations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<LOBSANG_TASHI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you chosen your new Prime Ministers, Holiness?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOBSANG_TASHI>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There will be no new Prime Ministers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<LUKHANGWA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will face great difficulties, Holiness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKHANGWA>
<DIRECTION>
The boy affixes his small piece of parchment to the document and makes a mark on it.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They have taken away our silence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KYICHU RIVER DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama, with much pomp and ceremony, walks down a white carpet and steps into a coracle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entourage includes: the Lord Chamberlain, the Kashag, His Holiness's Mother and youngest Brother, tutors and attendants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hundred monks stand, chanting, on the far bank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLAINS OF TIBET DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Fourteenth Dalai Lama rides in a Chinese jeep. Dust surrounds him. A yellow silk umbrella shades him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see that a road is under construction - a road into Lhasa. The first road in Tibet. The Dalai Llama is travelling in the opposite direction. He is leaving his country, traveling on rugged, flattened earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BARREN COUNTRYSIDE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The way is tougher here - the Dalai Lama is on mule back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHINESE BORDER TOWN, SHINGANG DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a different land. There are rice paddies and water buffalo. The altitude and barrenness of Tibet have been replaced by greener pastures, jagged mountaintops and Chinese natives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AIRPLANE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso gets his ride in an airplane - an antique. It is bumpy and noisy. He sits on an un-upholstered, steel frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama travels by train.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN STATION DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train pulls into the station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are hundreds of people awaiting the arrival of the Dalai Lama - hundreds of "China pictorial", red-cheeked, Chinese communists; men, women and children, waving little red flags.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso steps off the train and there is a roar of approval. Song breaks out - the People's Republic National Anthem.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The young man is overwhelmed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We begin to sense that something is wrong, something is artificial. The people's presence is demanded here today. This is a forced display of regard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GREAT HALL OF THE PEOPLE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama, and his retinue sit in this Great Hall, decorated with a portrait of Chairman Mao.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Great Helmsman himself is speaking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mao Tse Tung's presence is charismatic. His delivery is powerful - simple, yet firm. He is spellbinding.
</DIRECTION>
<MAO_TSE_TUNG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The mission of China is to bring progress to Tibet. Develop its natural resources. Help its people develop democracy. We welcome you, Tibet, back to the Motherland!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAO_TSE_TUNG>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DALAI LAMA'S ROOM, CHINESE GUEST HOUSE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso snoops around this room. He opens drawers, cabinets, just as a child would. He finds odd little pieces of ceramics, pens, paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves to the bathroom, runs a bath. Hot water. Electricity. This is the modern world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAO'S OFFICE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama sits beside Chairman Mao as a horde of photographers flash bulbs in their faces. Mao offers His Holiness a plate of Chinese delicacies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We notice that Mao's clothes are shabby and old. (His suit is always a shade lighter than everyone else's grey-drab). His cuffs are frayed, his collar is worn. But, his shoes, are beautifully polished.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has exquisite, delicate hands and his skin is shinny.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Later, Chairman Mao and the Dalai Lama sit across from one another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso takes notes as Mao speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<MAO_TSE_TUNG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am so glad that Tibet has come back to the Motherland.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAO_TSE_TUNG>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso quietly sips his tea.
</DIRECTION>
<MAO_TSE_TUNG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the Tibetans trust and good nature.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAO_TSE_TUNG>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<MAO_TSE_TUNG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is too early to implement all the clauses of the Seventeen Point Agreement. We will establish a Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet. The pace of reform must meet with the desires of the Tibetan people. Changes must be made slowly, as you, yourself, judge necessary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAO_TSE_TUNG>
<DIRECTION>
Mao speaks and moves very slowly. He pants and wheezes. He appears to be sick. Tenzin Gyatso takes notes.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<MAO_TSE_TUNG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country. A a wonderful history. Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAO_TSE_TUNG>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso writes in his notebook.
</DIRECTION>
<MAO_TSE_TUNG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAO_TSE_TUNG>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<MAO_TSE_TUNG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have a sweet. Made in my home province. The kind my mother used to make.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAO_TSE_TUNG>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama accepts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GARDEN, GUEST HOUSE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso does physical exercise with a few Chinese Bodyguards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GARDEN, GUEST HOUSE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso studies with Ling Rinpoche. The Lord Chamberlain sits with them.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"If moral discipline is learned from the beginning, one possesses the root for achieving higher rebirth. A staircase for achieving liberation. An antidote eliminating misery and sorrow. Without discipline there is no method."
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
Pause.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am thinking of becoming a Communist Party Member. I like what I see of Marxism. It is based on equality and justice for all. I believe Chairman Mao wishes the best for our people. Our path must be non-violence. Co-operation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
The Lord Chamberlain simply looks at the young man. He has nothing to say.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAO'S OFFICE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a knock and Tenzin Gyatso is led into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mao is at his desk, working late, smoking heavily.
</DIRECTION>
<MAO_TSE_TUNG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, Dalai Lama, thank you for coming so late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAO_TSE_TUNG>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I leave tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<MAO_TSE_TUNG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I am aware. How has your time in China been?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAO_TSE_TUNG>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso sits. He takes out his book and pen, ready to take notes.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have been greatly impressed by your accomplishments. Industrial progress. Great efficiency. Your people are capable and courteous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<MAO_TSE_TUNG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a lot to learn about organization. How to draw out people's opinions. How to make key decisions. Train your young Tibetans. When I make contact with you, I want to reach you through a Tibetan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAO_TSE_TUNG>
<DALAI_LAMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Always.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DALAI_LAMA>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso records Mao's words.
</DIRECTION>
<MAO_TSE_TUNG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your attitude is good, you know. I understand you well. But you need to learn this: religion is poison. It undermines the race and it retards the progress of the people. Tibet has been poisoned by religion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAO_TSE_TUNG>
<DIRECTION>
The boy cannot look up. He is in shock. We see the last words he writes:
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Religion is poison."
	</DIALOGUE>
<MAO_TSE_TUNG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, let me walk you to your car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAO_TSE_TUNG>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso slowly gets to his feet. We must see on his face that he realizes it has all been lies. All the kind words and promises, it must all be lies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is unable to raise his face to Mao's. All he sees before him are those shinny shoes, those exquisitely shaped, glistening hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAO'S OFFICE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside this building, a black car is waiting. It is bitterly cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mao - wearing no hat, no coat, and coughing - opens the door for the boy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama shakes the man's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MAO_TSE_TUNG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take care of your health.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAO_TSE_TUNG>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso gets into the car and Mao slams the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the car drives away, Tenzin Gyatso turns to see the Chairman, still standing in the cold, still waving goodbye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, Tenzin Gyatso looks straight ahead and says:
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He will betray us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
The view pulls back. The Lord Chamberlain sits beside the young man.
</DIRECTION>
<LORD_CHAMBEPIAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you ever doubt it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD_CHAMBEPIAIN>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had relinquished doubt.
	</DIALOGUE>

EXT. TENZIN GYATSO'S HOUSE IN AMDO DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama and members of his retinue stand in front of his old house in the village of Taktser, Amdo Province.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The young man smiles as he enters the courtyard. He pauses to look at the prayer flag, flapping in the breeze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A family of relatives inhabits the house. They bow to His Holiness as the young man makes his way to the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso steps into the kitchen - he might have to bend his head under the low ceiling. He laughs his wonderful laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Immediately, a woman approaches with a cup of tea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the hand of a Chinese official reaches out, takes the tea and returns it to her. It is not permitted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman looks confused. Tenzin Gyatso is humiliated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group has gathered outside the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso goes toward them as they prostrate. When they have finished, he reaches out his hands to take theirs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He says to one old woman:
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you happy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
The OLD WOMAN says, with tears in her eyes:
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am very happy and prosperous under the guidance of the Chinese Communist Party and chairman Mao Tse Tung.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLD_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
It is a horrifying announcement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama touches her head. She weeps and clutches his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The young man looks up, over her head, to Kyeri, the protectress mountain of this small village.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear loudspeakers, blaring, in the background - trumpeting propaganda about Chairman Mao and the People's Liberation Army.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tibetan horns blow. It sounds like a warning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on a newspaper. It is a Chinese newspaper and the picture on the front page shows a row of severed, Tibetan heads.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso puts the paper down. He removes his glasses and turns to his advisor - the grand Lord Chamberlain.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ask them to stop, to lay down their guns.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<LORD_CHAMBERLAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Khamba's gun is his most prized possession. I admire them so. They face a modern, well equipped army, and still, they fight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD_CHAMBERLAIN>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama rubs his face with his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<LORD_CHAMBERLAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Land reform is underway in Amdo. The large estates are being confiscated and redistributed. Landlords are being punished.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD_CHAMBERLAIN>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A beggar can be called a landlord if he disapproves of the Chinese.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
The men are silent. We hear the constant sound of trucks and cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lord Chamberlain is notably pausing.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have always asked for plain information. Just the truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<LORD_CHAMBERLAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Communists put their guns in the hands of the Khamba children and force the child to kill the parent. They have dropped bombs on the monastery of Lithang in Kham. It has been destroyed. Women and children, trying to escape from the fighting, have been shot with machine guns, fired from airplanes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD_CHAMBERLAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Again, silence.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The pursuit of non-violence. Very difficult.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<LORD_CHAMBERLAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Non-violence means co-operation when it is possible. Resistance, when it is not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD_CHAMBERLAIN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TERRACE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His Holiness walks to the terrace. He aims the telescope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below him he sees a new Lhasa - a Lhasa full of trucks and Chinese soldiers. A traffic island stands in the center of an intersection. The town walls are white-washed. The political posters are gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS, THE NORBULINKA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small group sits waiting on red velvet chairs: the Dalai Lama, the Lord Chamberlain and the Kashag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
General Chiang enters the room. He finds a chair and pours himself a cup of tea. We cannot help but notice - he is armed.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL_CHIANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have decided that no drastic changes will take place in Tibet for six years. This should make you happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_CHIANG>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL_CHIANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It seems a revolt has broken out in the east. We have decided that the Tibetan army must be used against the Khamba guerrillas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_CHIANG>
<DIRECTION>
The General sips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama answers.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will not approve it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
The General looks up, surprised. It took a great deal of courage for the young man to answer back, so determinedly.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have bombed on peaceful people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<GENERAL_CHIANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We must deal with these reactionaries!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_CHIANG>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. We are peace loving people. I am afraid we cannot trust you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
The General sputters:
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL_CHIANG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are here to heal the people of Tibet. You need reform. You have no sense of what is good for your people. We are here to liberate you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_CHIANG>
<DIRECTION>
Now, the boy finds his voice.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I burn here, but I am not suppose to let the smoke show. Yes, we need reform. The monasteries. Communications. Schools. But we want change for Tibet, as Tibet needs it, not for China.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
The General starts to speak but Tenzin Gyatso keeps talking.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buddha is our physician, General, he will heal us. Comapssion and enlightnement will set us free. You can not liberate me I can only liberate myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
The General leaves the room.
</DIRECTION>
<LORD_CHAMBERLAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They will take Lhasa next.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD_CHAMBERLAIN>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The people will not allow it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRAYER ROOM, NORBULINKA NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Nechung Oracle is in full swing. It is an especially vivid and violent spin he is in. The headdress whips this way and that, and finally he says:
</DIRECTION>
<NECHUNG_ORACLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where there is no crossing a big river, no fords, no shallows, where the only hope is a boat, and there is no boat... I will put a boat, Kundun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NECHUNG_ORACLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The wish-Fulfilling Jewel will shine from the West.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
It is a strange and confusing prophecy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./ INT. NORBULINKA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few random views of the Norbulinka:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wandering deer and peacocks. The fish pond and its inhabitants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over these pictures we hear words:
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
(OC)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"I rejoice in the Awakening of the Buddhas, and also in the spiritual levels of their Sons."
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
The projection room. The full sheep pen. The parents's home.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
(OC)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"And with gladness I rejoice in the ocean of virtue from developing an awakening mind that wishes all beings to be happy..."
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
The Yellow Wall. The Dalai Lama's red room.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
(OC)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"As well as in the deeds that bring them benefit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
And now, we hear the voices of a great many people, reciting:
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO AND_OTHERS>
<DIRECTION>
(OC)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"With folded hands I beseech the Buddhas of all directions. To shine the lamp of Dharma For all bewildered in the gloom of misery."
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO AND_OTHERS>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GARDENS, NORBULINKA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the midst of war, there is beauty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama performs the Kalachakra ceremony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a beautiful, ornate, colorful ceremony. A prayer for world peace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso sits on a platform of cushions, above the heads of the abbots and lamas and tutors, above the heads of the Tibetan noblemen, and nomads and Khambas and pesants from all corners of the land who attend the ceremony.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO_AND_OTHERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"With folded hands I beseech the Conquerors who wish to pass away, to please remain for countless aeons And not to leave the world in darkness."
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO_AND_OTHERS>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama proceeds with the ceremony. He handles and blesses sacred objects, he lifts his bell and dorge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rice is passed among the people. Rice is thrown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Tibetan chant is sung.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beside His Holiness is a large, yellow silk pagoda.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The view moves inside the pagoda as the chanting continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PAGODA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a mandala - a beautiful, intricate, sand-painting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The home of Kalachakra.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
(OC)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Thus by the virtue collected Through all that I have done, May the pain of every living creature be completely cleared away."
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
The whole screen becomes this mandala as the chanting an cymbals and deep resonating sounds of the song continue and then, a hand comes into the mandala and begins to sweep it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pull back to see that the hand belongs to Tenzin Gyatso.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso collects the ground particles of Tibetan quartz and rock. He destroys the painstakingly lovely sand painting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chanting becomes louder and louder and it mixes with the sound of the river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KYICHU RIVER DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso pours the sand into the river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We watch the river take color and the mandala floats away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This view is overlapped by one of extreme horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DREAM SEQUENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lovely Norbulinka garden, the park where opera pageants and Kalachakra ceremonies take place, is now, a killing field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hundreds of dead, slaughtered monks, lie on the blood- drenched ground, under the peach and pear trees. Chinese soldiers move amongst the monks, turning over the dead bodies, searching those silent faces. The Solder we see is carrying a photo of His Holiness. They are searching for the Dalai Lama.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a nightmare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear crying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DREAM SEQUENCE ENDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso wakes up. Shaking, crying, he is alone, in the dark. He can barely catch his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The screen goes black.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on an invitation:
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His Holiness, the Dalai Lama of Tibet, is invited to attend a Dance Recital at the newly erected, Great Hall of the Liberation Army.

	10 March, 1959.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE POTALA DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A last view of the great monastery.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chinese, GO! Chinese, GO! Chinese, GO!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMEN_AND_MEN>
<DIRECTION>
The young man looks around at the peaceful premises. People we know - uembers of the Kashag, attendants, tutors, the Dalai Lama's Mother, sweepers - appear in the garden, one by one, all listening to the sounds of a uob gathering outside the walls of the Norbulinka.

The Dalai Lama enters his Mother's home.

It is very guiet here. The young man looks at the family photographs on the blue walls, the needlework on the table, the seven copper bowls in front of the statue of Buddha.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>

(OC)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you come to tell me we are leaving Lhasa?

	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You decide.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
He says, softly:
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tibet has never been part of China. We are different races. We are different cultures. We need change, we know that. But we could do it alone. We were just about to do it alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
The young man fills the last bowl with water.

The Kashag is present, as are fifty leaders of the opposition - rough, tired men.

<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I fear that there will be great bloodshed if you cannot convince the people to disperse and go home. I am safe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<FIRST_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holiness, the Chinese tried to entice you to their garrison with out protection of bodyguard. Even now, they urge you to come to them for safety. They are bringing more troops and guns and artillery into Lhasa. There are three airplanes waiting outside Lhasa. What do they wait for? They are planning to kill the Dalai Lama. Don't you see?

INT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Nechung Oracle is brought in. The monk quiets himself and readies himself for the trance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama waits. Again, alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, the trance comes on, the heavy headdress is placed on the monk's head, the attendants leave the room and then, the Oracle speaks.
</DIRECTION>

	Stay. I tell you to stay.

Tenzin Gyatso steps forward, out of the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<LORD_CHAMBERLAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Chinese are planning to attack the crowd and shell the Norbulinka. You are asked to indicate on a map where you will be so that the artillery men will not mistakenly aim at you.

The Dalai Lama walks down the outdoor stairs.

INT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The young man is studying with Ling Rinpoche. Books of scripture are stacked in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, there is a tremendous, loud explosion, and then, another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso gets up and runs to the window he looked out of the day of the earthquake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GARDENS, NORBULINKA DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is shouting and chaos. The Chinese have begun shelling the Norbulinka. The north wall and the grounds directly in front of it are on fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DALAI LAMA'S ROOM DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This time the Oracle is in the room first. He is surrounded by his attendants and the members of the Kashag, the Lord Chamberlain, Ling Rinpoche and various tutors and lamas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tension is thick. Finally, the Dalai Lama enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso sits. He waits. The trance begins, the headdress is set upon the medium's head and the Oracle begins to dance, and then, he begins to shout:
</DIRECTION>
<ORACLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go! Go! Tonight!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORACLE>
<DIRECTION>
The Oracle staggers forward, snatches up some paper and a pen and begins to draw a map, a route, out of Lhasa. He keeps repeating:
</DIRECTION>
<ORACLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go! Tonight! Go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ORACLE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on the map - drawn with a shaking, sweating hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see mountains, and a pass, and the names of towns along the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso rises and goes to the Oracle. He looks down at the map. The Oracle hands the Dalai Lama the map and faints as his frightened attendants rush to loosen the strap of the headdress before the poor man chokes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DALAI LAMA'S PRIVATE ROOMS DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy sits at the table, writing. We can hear the crowd, shouting, outside the Norbulinka walls. We see just a few words of the letter:
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please do not resist.
	</DIALOGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take refuge on the far side of the river.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

INT. ALTAR ROOM NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chapel of Mahakala.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are reminded of secret, sacred moments, from long ago.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso opens the heavy, creaking door. The Dalai Lama is in disguise. He is wearing the clothes of a Khamba guerrilla - dark, woolen chuba and tall black boots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Monks sit on the floor, chanting. One monk stands by a large urn, ladling out butter for the lamps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso goes to the front of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A monk begins to play the cymbals. Another puts the Tibetan horn to his lips and blows a long, mournful note.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama lays a white silk scarf - a kata - over the shoulders of this imposing statue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, he sits for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the weak light, in the black room, Tenzin Gyatso is lost among the other praying monks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HALLWAY OF RESIDENCE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama walks down the hall. He says to a sweeper:
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>

	Dim the lights.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
and then he bow bends down, to pat a dog.

CLOSE on the little cabinet in the corner of the entrance hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso's hands open the doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The young man pulls open the drawer which contains the false teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso pulls a rolled kata from his coat. He tucks the lead soldier of an Indian Ghurka into the center of the scarf. He places the bundle in the drawer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, he adds something. A sweet. The kind his Mother makes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He closes the drawer, and locks it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hides the key, again, behind the small, unobtrusive cabinet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RESIDENCE, STAIRS NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a soldier on either side of him, the Dalai Lama descends the staircase.

</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
The boy returns to the front steps.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see a safe return.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
The soldiers wait.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now. I am ready.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso places the scroll over one shoulder. A soldier lays a rifle over the other one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GARDENS, NORBULINKA NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three men walk quietly through the empty gardens. We hear the sounds of the crowd grow louder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WALL NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The soldiers pause, look to His Holiness. Tenzin Gyatso removes his glasses, puts them in his bag, then nods - and the soldiers open the gate.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Move aside, tour of inspection, move aside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<DIRECTION>
Of course, we see only a fraction of the crowd - angry men and women.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man steps beside His Holiness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso looks up - face to face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is the Khamba bodyguard, the monk who guarded him so many times. The man with the horrible face.
</DIRECTION>
<KHAMBA_BODYGUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Move aside, let us through. Move aside!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KHAMBA_BODYGUARD>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama is between the soldiers, shouldering his own gun. The Bodyguard falls in behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The little group makes its way through the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRIBUTARY OF ThE KYICHU RIVER NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the same place where the little Tenzin Gyatso tentatively tested one rock, the escape party crosses on the slippery, stepping stones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The small party makes its way across a bit of countryside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People are camped here - Khambas, farmers, nomads. The Dalai Lama crosses to safety - unnoticed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KYICHU RIVER NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coracles await.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama climbs in, the Lord Chmaberlian sits beside him. The soldiers push off. The Khamba Bodyguard stands on the bank, alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Every splash of the oars sounds like it could wake the dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso looks back. He puts on his glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees camp fires and the glow of torches. He hears echoed voices.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up. He sees the stars and the moon and that incomparable Tibetan sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees mountains.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have always loved mountains.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
He is handed a steaming cup of tea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then, a cloud passes over the moon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On horse back, the party makes its way up a mountain pass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are more members now - Tenzin Gyatso has joined those who left ahead of him - members of the Kashag, tutors, his Mother, his Brother.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is tough going. The ground seems like quick sand with every step a struggle. When the horses have disappeared from sight, a sand storm arises, wiping away their tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The party passes above an encampment of Chinese soldiers. They are not seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The party travels through the emptiness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His Holiness walks beside his horse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He joins other members of the group standing on a ridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso picks up a rock and throws it over the side.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Right will be victorious."
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
And now, the others do the same. The Lord Chamberlain says:
</DIRECTION>
<LORD_CHAMBERLAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"The Gods will be avenged!"
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORD_CHAMBERLAIN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TIBET DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama sits before a low table set up on this desolate border.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A document is before him.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I repudiate the Seventeen Point Agreement
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
With a slap of the State Seal of Tibet, this is done.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lord Chamberlain removes this document and replaces it with another.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I constitute the Government of Tibet, the only legal authority in the land.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
The seal comes down hard once more. It is done.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BORDER DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sick and tired Tenzin Gyatso makes the last leg of his trip on the back of a black yak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before him, through the light rain, we see a small bamboo arch erected in the middle of nowhere. Six Indian GHURKAS, wearing floppy, jungle hats and heavy, British boots, stand at attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dalai Lama, on his black yak, passes under this babboo gateway as the Indian Soldiers raise their guns in salute.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An Indian soldier goes to the yak and helps the sick man from his mount.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso stands, barely able to hold himself on his feet. His hand rests on the yak's back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Indian soldier steps closer and, knowing he is breaking protocol, he whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With all respect, may I ask? Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<DIRECTION>
The young man smiles at the Soldier - a man who looks like the lead soldier come alive.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you see before you is a man. A simple monk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you the Lord Buddha?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<DIRECTION>
Pause.
</DIRECTION>
<TENZIN_GYATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I am a reflection, like the moon, on water. When you see me, and I try to be a good man, see yourself
	</DIALOGUE>
</TENZIN_GYATSO>
<DIRECTION>
INT. A ROOM IN INDIA, FOOT OF THE HIMALAYAS DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tenzin Gyatso unpacks. He is dressed in maroon robes, his arms bare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He places some books on a table next to his tinkering equipment. He lifts a heavy parcel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TERRACE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on the young man's beautiful hands as he sets up his telescope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tripod is erect. The body is attached. The eyepiece is adjusted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then, this boy, this man, this simple monk, aims, to takes a look, at a bigger world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a black screen, a card reads:
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Dalai Lama has not yet returned to Tibet.
	</DIALOGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He hopes one day to make the journey.
	</DIALOGUE>
