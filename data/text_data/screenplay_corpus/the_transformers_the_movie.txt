FOLLOW Hot Rod up and over a roadway leading around the perimeter of Autobot City which becomes visible the instant Hot Rod clears the rim of a hill. As they travel, we SHOULD also be getting a sense of what Autobot City is all about. (DESIGN NOTE: Autobot City looks like a federal energy project gone mad. Here, the Autobots are trying to exploit every known means of getting energy. The mountain is covered with solar panels, windmills spin in the valley, oil derricks pump, and not far away a hydroelectric dam catches millions of volts. Near all of these various things are energon compressors, which turn the raw energy into energon cubes. IN THE BACKGROUND of these scenes, we should see various panel truck-type Autobots cruise up in auto mode to stacks of this energon, convert to humanoid mode, load up their vans, then convert to Auto mode again and drive the Energon into Autobot City. In short, it should be clear that the purpose of Autobot City is to harvest energy.

A distraught Ultra Magnus nods, reaches out with free hand and points his forefinger at Optimus Prime's chest.

The bright light, which emanates from the perfect crystal, seems to blind everybody and washes all color out of the shot. Then, slowly, Ultra Magnus moves it into his own chest, closes the door, and the light is gone, save for a momentary, and extremely powerful glow from his eyes.

<HOT_ROD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the end of the road, Galvatron. With that, he picks up the Decepticon and throws him through...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOT_ROD>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UNICRON - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Unicron's side...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE DARK CAVERN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hot Rod, bathed in the glow of the matrix. Sticks his hand in the way we saw Galvatron and Ultra Magnus try earlier. There is no shock. Then, like pulling the pin on a hand grenade, he unleashes the spiritual equivalent of a bomb!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ASSORTED SHOTS - INVASION OF THE MATRIX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The matrix rips through Unicron's body, blowing up wires causing floods and generally causing havoc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SPACE - THE BATTLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unicron suddenly lets out a scream and lets go of the Junkion ship, sending it hurtling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE JUNKION SHIP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It tumbles through space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AUTOBOTS AND JUNKIONS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(THEY SCREAM WITH EXHILARATION)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON UNICRON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, he starts tearing into his body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unicron writhes in space, tearing himself apart, ripping off a leg, and sending out sparks like a roman candle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CORRIDOR WHERE KUP ET.AL ARE TRAPPED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are overrun by the antibodies. One takes a whopper bite out of Springer's chest.
</DIRECTION>
<SPRINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm almost out of energy. Suddenly, he looks up and sees one of the creatures explode above
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPRINGER>
<DIRECTION>
HIM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then another explodes, then another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPRINGER'S POV - A WALL OF ANTIBODIES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, every antibody in the wall begins exploding, and through the carnage, we see Bumblebee, Spike, Daniel, Cliffjumper and Jazz.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE BATTLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The last of the antibodies is blown away, and Kup, Arcee and Springer sit up amidst a pile of antibody bodies.
</DIRECTION>
<SPRINGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I call the nick of time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPRINGER>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON ALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, an entire wall vanishes as Unicron's hand tears at things.
</DIRECTION>
<JAZZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's burn rubber!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAZZ>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They transform. The humans jump in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CHASE - TRACKING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They race up the tunnel, one step ahead of Unicron's hand which shoots after them, pulling apart what we know must be pieces of his brain... Then, they reach what seems like a dead end. In fact, it is the back side of Unicron's good eye. The hand comes in after them!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE DOWN THE CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An unbelievably fast and powerful robot races towards the Autobots. When it gets there, we realize that it is Rodimus Prime.
</DIRECTION>
<KUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew you had potential, lad!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KUP>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON RODIMUS PRIME
</DIRECTION>
<RODIMUS_PRIME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Autobots, transform and roll out. Rodimus Prime transforms into truck mode as the other Autobots also transform. Daniel and Spike jump into him. Then, in a continuous line, he shoots off, the other Autobots racing behind him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODIMUS_PRIME>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UNICRON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rodimus Prime shoots out the second eye... Followed by the others.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON UNICRON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An arm and a leg dangle uselessly as the Autobot essence spreads throughout the body, blowing circuits. Suddenly, Unicron lets out a loud agonized ROAR. SPARKS seem to shoot out of every part of his body. Then, he spins in space like some kind of a fireworks display, shooting off sparks. And then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We get the big visual explosion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SPACE - MUCH LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unicron's head orbits Cybertron. PAN to Cybertron where and PUSH IN on Rodimus Prime, Arcee, Kup, Springer, Ultra Magnus, Wreck-Gar, Daniel, Perceptor, Blaster and Spike watch construction being done on Cybertron below.
</DIRECTION>
<RODIMUS_PRIME>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let this mark the end of the Cybertronian wars as we move forward to a new age of peace and happiness....
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODIMUS_PRIME>
<ALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Until all are one!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALL>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
