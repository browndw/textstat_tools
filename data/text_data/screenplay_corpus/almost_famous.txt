:SC: FADE IN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A close-shot of a yellow legal tablet. A young hand comes into frame, holding a pencil. For a few moments, we hear only the soft scratching of pencil on paper, as credits are written in a series of dissolves. The hand carefully erases and corrects an error or two along the way. And then the sound of an old friend... the warm crackle of a vinyl record... as we now hear Alvin and the Chipmunks' "Christmas Song."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lone palm tree rises up into a yellow afternoon sky. Behind it, the sparkling blue of the Pacific Ocean and the city of San Diego. A dry, hot Southern California day. Even the wind is lazy, and a little bored.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD SHOPPING CENTER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Santa Claus wears shorts and sandals, ringing a bell as he collects for the Salvation Army. This is Christmas in the Southland. No snow, no winter wonderland. Just a pleasantly thick heat and an unchanging season, as music continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Turning the corner, walking into frame is ELAINE MILLER, 35. She is a tall woman, consumed by the fevered conversation she's
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Having with her pale young son WILLIAM, late pre-teens. They stand apart from the other shoppers. All around them is the highly-charged salesmanship of the season... silver glittering fake Christmas trees. She hurries her son through the commercial juggernaut, continuing their lively intellectual conversation, when something stops her. A Workman is affixing letters to a store-front. He has already placed the MERRY... now he's finishing the XMAS. Elaine is strong, but always pleasant, always clear about her purpose in this life.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, I'm a teacher. There is no word in The English Language -- "Xmas." It's either Merry Christmas... or Happy Holidays.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
The Workman nods thanks, with faux appreciation, as Mom turns away. The Workman shares a look with William, who shrugs - that's my Mom.

EXT. MINI-TRACT CONDO COMPLEX -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is the new professional-class. It's a mini-condo community. Rows of Spanish-styled three-bedroom houses with common walls. Move in on one of these homes, the one without Christmas lights. At the door is a furtive 15 year-old Girl. She checks her cheek, straightens her hair. She hides something under her coat, and gathers the proper nonchalance to enter. Music fades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We now hear the dialogue between this lively Mother and her son, as she cooks a pan full of soy-based health-food cutlets. The meal simmers unappetizingly in the pan. Across the kitchen we see William. He's a great listener, with a calm and curious face that takes everything in.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>

<DIRECTION>
(thoughtful pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just like Nixon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
William nods, intrigued. He has a good disposition. The world of knowledge engages him, and he loves what it brings out in his Mom. There is a small clatter at the front door, as the girl we've just seen enters, barely brushing some chimes. She silently curses herself.
</DIRECTION>

</ELAINE>
<ANITA_S_VOICE>

</ANITA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Mom moves to the living room to greet William's sister. William peers into the next room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's almost to her bedroom down the hall when mom catches her. We now discover ANITA, 16, up-close. She is an alluring young Natalie Wood, with a suspicious and sunny smile.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure? I'm making soy cutlets.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
The words "soy cutlets" sends a small shiver through the girl.
</DIRECTION>
<ANITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine. Already ate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANITA>
<DIRECTION>
William stands in the doorway now, watching, monitoring, as Mom moves closer to his sister. She sees something curious about her daughter.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. You've been kissing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<ANITA>

	No I haven't.

</ELAINE>
<ANITA>
<DIRECTION>
(boldly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't tell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANITA>
<DIRECTION>
Mom steps closer and examines the lips even more carefully. To her, everything is a quest for knowledge.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not only can I tell, I know who it is. It's Darryl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Anita is stunned silent. She turns slightly to look at herself in a hall mirror, searching for clues, implicating herself immediately.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what have you got under your coat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
This is the booty Anita didn't want to give up. Mom picks at the corner of an album cover now visible under her jacket. She withdraws the album. It's Simon and Garfunkel's Bookends.
</DIRECTION>
<ANITA>
<DIRECTION>
(busted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's unfair that we can't listen to our music!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANITA>
<ELAINE>

(weary of the issue)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, it's all about drugs and promiscuous sex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<ANITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Simon and Garfunkel is poetry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANITA>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes it's poetry. It's the poetry of drugs and promiscuous sex. Look at the picture on the cover...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON BOOKENDS ALBUM COVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mom's fingers at the edges. We examine the insolent faces on Richard Avedon's classic album cover. Even Simon and Garfunkle look guilty under her scholarly inspection.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Bacon. Eggs, bologna, rock and roll, motorcycles.

Nearby, William squirms as he watches the gently escalating conversation. Anita glances at her brother. He silently urges her to downshift. She can't.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Then it was celebrating Christmas on a day in September When you knew it wouldn't be "commercialized."

These are the words that sting Mom most.

(immediately, can't help it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, clearly, "no" is a word Darryl doesn't hear much.
	</DIALOGUE>

Anita gasps. Ever the peacemaker, William weighs in. Nearby is a poster - "No More War."
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>

William looks vaguely confused.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweetheart, don't be a drama queen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Anita takes a breath and then out of her mouth comes the strangled-sounding words of a kid swearing at her parent for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<ANITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Feck you! All of you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANITA>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Anita runs down the hall to her room. Elaine turns to William, relating to him more as a fellow parent than a child.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, there it is. Your sister using the "f" word.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. The letter "u"...

</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Shot moves in on the kid, as we hear the opening strains of The Moody Blues' "Nights in White Satin."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCHOOL DANCE/GYMNASIUM BATHROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Music continues. Shot moves along a row of very mature-looking male teenagers, examining themselves in the bathroom mirror. There's the kid with a very mature-looking moustache, the kid proudly sporting full-blown hormonal acne (he slaps on some Hai Karate), the guy to whom puberty has already delivered the face of an adult, complete with long jutting sideburns... and then a blank space at the mirror, as the shot moves down, down, down to find William. He is so much younger, without a zit in sight. Puberty is so very distant on his horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DANCE -- NIGHT -- UNDER-CRANKED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Song continues as we see William's perspective of these much- older looking kids. Girls now are visible, and they are even more mature than the boys we've just seen. They flirt and glow, arms trailing across the shoulders of the boys. Whispering in each other's ears, none of them looking down. It's a troubling experience, to be this close to the alluring world of older teenagers... and to be so invisible to them.

<VOICE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you really in our grade?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
William turns to see tall, adenoidal TIM TOBIN. The most mature looking kid we've seen yet, he challenges William in a loud theatrical tone. It is a voice right out of Guys and Dolls, which incidentally is the school play in which Tobin had just starred. William answers in a respectful voice. He is desperate for acceptance.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<TOBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey guys! Check it out! William doesn't have any pubes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOBIN>
<DIRECTION>
Others now begin to gather around, examining William. He has never been more naked.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How old are you man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY_1>
<TOBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not a man, he's a little baby kid. He Doesn't even get zits yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOBIN>
<GUY_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come you don't have any hair down there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY_2>
<TOBIN>
<DIRECTION>
(in loud, funny voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are your pubes???!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOBIN>
<DIRECTION>
Their voices echo off the tiled walls. Now everyone is watching the hairless William. He is confused by their meanness.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Where are your pubes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY_2>
<DIRECTION>
All eyes are on him, waiting for a response. The kid's mental wheels turn frantically. And from somewhere comes an attitude, a swagger, and somehow the perfect line arrives from what could only be a merciful deity.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
(cool, dismissive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had 'em. I shaved 'em off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
It is a new persona for the kid -- the witty guy. And it works. Guy #2 cracks up, then others. William's new accuser is suddenly surrounded by the impressed gales of laughter of these older boys. Others turn away, on to other things. Tobin stares at William, and then also turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FAMILY CAR -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William jumps into the backseat of the white Ford Country Sedan station wagon, carrying books. ("See ya pubes!") Mom continues driving William and Anita home from school.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put on your seatbelt. I don't want you flying through the windshield.

Anita examines her own un-fastened seatbelt, which Mom hasn't noticed.

Mom pulls over, and stares straight ahead with deep irritation.

</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
A heavy quiet. She and his sister ignore him, as they now debate the subject with each other.

	You lied to him! You make such a big deal about the truth and you lied!
	</DIALOGUE>

He looks at his body, the information affects him physically. New sounds come from way down deep inside. Mom now begins speed-rapping, trying to stem the leak. She starts the car.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you skipped fifth grade. There's too much padding In the grades. I taught elementary school. 5th grade - unnecessary. Nothing happens in the 5th grade. All Teachers know it, no one talks about it.

Anita reaches out to her brother. With the compassion of a saint, she offers this:

	Honey, I know you were expecting puberty. You're just going to have to shine it on for a while.

Deeply embarrassed, William shrinks down in the seat. Mom monitors his face constantly. She is raw and sincere... and yes, inspiring:
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who needs a "crowd?" You're unique. You're two years ahead of everybody. Take those extra years and do what you want. Go to Europe for a year! Take a look around, see what you like! Follow your dream! You'll still be the youngest lawyer in the country. Your own great grandfather practiced law until he was 93. Your dad was so proud of you. He knew you were a pronominally accelerated child.

INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM -- DAY

William finishes the last of many candy bars. A mound of wrappers sit just below the mirror. He examines his face hopefully for zits. Nothing coming. We begin to hear Simon and Garfunkel's "America."

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

Anita stands in the living room. The song continues playing on the stereo.

EXT. FRONT LAWN -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William watches sadly. Anita's good-looking boyfriend DARRYL, a dead ringer for young Stephen Stills, loads her suitcases into a large turqouise Chevy. The suitcases are adorned with plastic stick-on flowers. All coolness is leaving William's life. Mom watches nearby, worried and helpless. (Their house is more austere, less "fun" than the other front lawns.)
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take good care of her in San Francisco, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Darryl gives the kid a sub-human look. He's invisible, too young to converse with.

<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can she leave such a loving family?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Anita turns and heads towards them. She focuses on William, placing her hands on his young shoulders. Her face is very close to him now, as she delivers this sage prediction of the future.
</DIRECTION>
<ANITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One day you'll be cool.

Anita looks back at the receding American Gothic-image of her mother and brother. Sister waves to brother. She feels for him. Music now shifts to The Who's "Sparks."

<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William locks the door. He reaches under his bed. It's a black leatherette travel bag, with tartan design. He unzips the bag -- it's filled with albums. He flips through the amazing, subversive cache of music. Cream's Wheels of Fire... the seminal Bob Dylan bootleg Great White Wonder... the Rolling Stones' Get Yer Ya Ya's Out... The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds... Abraxas by Santana... Jethro Tull's Stand Up... The Mother's of Invention's We're Only In It For The Money... Led Zeppelin... Crosby, Stills and Nash... Miles Davis' Bitches Brew... and The Who's Tommy... with a note taped to it.

DETAIL SHOT OF NOTEBOOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A blue school notebook, with ballpoint pen renderings of the names of groups like the Who and Led Zeppelin, complete with carefully drawn thunderbolts. Also, the name LESTER BANGS.

<DIRECTION>
INT. JOURNALISM CLASS -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William, now 15, sits in class with book, Adventures in Journalism. His hair is shoulder-length. A dedicated teacher, PATRICIA DEEGAN, walks the aisles. Music continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOOD MACHINES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William presses the food machine button, pulls an orange from a vending container. He still looks younger than most of the students... and these days, especially the girls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LUNCH COURT -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William sits apart from all the others, under a tree. He reads intently, happily, as he eats the orange. It's a copy of Creem Magazine. Music continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON PHOTOS IN MAGAZINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera moves across the photos, catching the expressions and fashions of the rock heroes of the day. Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull, eyes wide and hair flying as he plays flute. Neil Young, enigmatic with perfectly patched Levis. The Southern Rock Royalty of The Allman Brothers Band, posing and laughing in front of massive stacks of amps. Marc Bolan of T. Rex, his ringlet-hair backlit by stage lights. David Bowie in skin-tight Japanese one- piece attire, onstage with The Spiders From Mars. Pete Townsend of the Who, slashing windmill-style at his guitar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drift down to a by-line - by Lester Bangs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William walks through the parking lot after school. Everybody now congregates around the new arrival of their lives - their own cars. Arms suddenly clap William on the back, friendly faces smile strangely, laughing. He takes a few steps and looks up to see... a school official is hurriedly removing something from the high-school marquee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIGH-SCHOOL MARQUEE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
which reads: WILLIAM MILLER IS TOO YOUNG TO DRIVE (OR FUCK)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All are laughing. He laughs with them, and turns as his face goes slack. He shrugs, marches on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOWNTOWN SAN DIEGO RADIO STATION -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The song we've been listening to is ripped off the turntable by a highly-active man in a red promotional t-shirt proclaiming the greatness of The Guess Who. He is a ferocious, lumbering, music- driven presence, and he fills this small radio studio to the very brim. This is LESTER BANGS, 25, the rarely-seen God of a then new art-form -- Rock Journalism. A Disc-jockey with long- long hair watches helplessly. William views all this through a glass window. He stands on the corner of a downtown side street, halfway up a steep incline. He is the only person on the streets this early Saturday morning. Reveal that he is watching a live radio show, audible to us through the small p.a. speaker overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DISC_JOCKEY>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. RADIO STATION -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William watches intently. Bangs thuds the needle onto a copy of Raw Power. We're rewarded with a blast of Iggy and the Stooges' "Search and Destroy." A closer shot on William now watching the whirlwind of anarchy inside. Lester does an Iggy Pop impression, acting out a story for the d.j. that we cannot hear, never noticing the kid soaking in everything from the other side of this double-glass window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RADIO STATION -- DAY -- LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bangs walks with William on this sharply inclined San Diego street. It's early, the streets are silent. Bangs is about fifteen beer pounds overweight. His jeans are loose, his paleness and messy moustache an emblem of the long days and nights spent writing. In there somewhere is a good-looking guy. His hands are thrust deeply into his pockets, and he takes big sweeping steps.
</DIRECTION>
<BANGS>

<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. At least I'm here for that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Bangs looks at the much smaller kid, shaking his head. It's too late for newcomers. But if the kid's age is an issue, he doesn't mention it. Like a machine-gun:

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but if Bowie's doing Lou, and Lou's Doing Bowie, Lou's still doing Lou.

</WILLIAM>
<BANGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smart kid. I used to do speed and sometimes Nyquil and stay up all night writing and writing, like 25 pages of dribble about, you know, the Guess Who, or Coltrane, just to write, you know, with the music blasting...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANGS>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too. The writing part...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment, the serious demeanor dissolves and the oddest thing happens. Bangs laughs. It's an odd and charming laugh, the kind a tough guy keeps well-hidden. It surprised the kid, who smiles back. Bangs stops at the corner, and offers a pleasant but very final nod of the head.
</DIRECTION>
<BANGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, alright. It's been nice to meet you. I'll see you around. Keep sending me your stuff.

WIDE SHOT - SOLITUDE

But neither have anywhere to go on this early downtown morning. They stand for a beat, hands in pockets, on this deserted street. They are alone together, there's nobody else in sight.

<DIRECTION>
INT. DINER -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William listens intently as Lester eat a sandwich. His face is an open book filling with words.
</DIRECTION>
<BANGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- so anyway, you're from San Diego and that's good. Because once you go to L.A., you're gonna have friends like crazy but they'll be fake friends, they're gonna try to corrupt you. The publicists! The bands! You got an honest face, they're gonna tell you everything. But you CANNOT make friends with the rock stars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANGS>
<DIRECTION>
The kid takes out a green collegiate notebook and gestures -- can I make a note? Bangs nods.
</DIRECTION>
<BANGS>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Cannot make friends with the rock stars.

	That's what's important. If you're a rock journalist, a true journalist -- first you will never get paid much. But you will get free records from the record company.

The kid's eyes widen. Bangs, in direct conflict with his brutal writing style, is looking suspiciously like a compassionate softie.
</DIRECTION>
<BANGS>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And they'll buy you drinks, you'll meet girls... they'll try to fly you places for free.... offer you drugs... I know. It sounds great. But they are not your friends. These are people who want you to write sanctimonious stories about the genius of the rock stars and they will ruin rock and roll and strangle everything we love about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANGS>
<DIRECTION>
Privately, William thrills. We. Our. It all sounds great to him. He listens to the grouping of the words, every one of them. He madly scribbles.

	<DIALOGUE>
	... Industry... of... cool...

</WILLIAM>
<BANGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's what they want! And it's happening right now. I'm telling you, you're coming along at a very dangerous time for rock and roll. The war is over. They won. 99% of what passes for rock now... SILENCE is much more compelling. It's over. I think you should turn around and go back and be... a lawyer or something... but I can see from your face that you won't. I can pay you thirty-five bucks. Gimme a thousand words on Black Sabbath.

Bangs reaches across the table, and William watches as he scribbles his number on the back of the kid's green collegiate notebook. The notebook has just become valuable. They sit together, listening to the beautiful and compelling silence.

INT. FAMILY CAR -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mom drives William to the San Diego Sports Arena. She looks out the window at the adrenalized concert-goers. She feels protective not just of her son, but an entire generation. William goes over his questions for Black Sabbath.

	Look at this. An entire generation of Cinderellas and there's no slipper coming.

He unhooks his seatbelt, stuffs his questions into an orange canvas shoulder-bag and exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elaine watches her son disappearing into the stony rock-concert crowd. It's a windy night. Everything about this image troubles her. She fights with herself, and then uses the family whistle immediately. He turns.

Fifteen concert-goers turn around instinctively, at the sound of a Mother, and then identify William as the object of her concern. All around him, we hear:

He winces, nods and moves forward. Music echoes from the open windows of many other cars.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAN DIEGO SPORTS ARENA BACKSTAGE RAMP -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kid tromps down the steep incline leading to a small steel backstage arena door. He rings the buzzer. The door wheezes open to reveal the keeper of the San Diego Sports Arena's backstage list. Famous to all those who attempt to enter, this is SCOTTY. He is a wiry, humorless man for whom powerlessness is the theme of his life -- except for those few hours he controls the list. Scotty is only forty but everything about him screams that he's an angry sixty.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. I'm William Miller and I'm here from Creem Magazine to interview the band Black Sabbath.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Scotty, immediately suspicious, moves to a nearby podium and snaps through three clipboard pages. He moves back to the door and grabs the handle.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not on the list.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTY>
<DIRECTION>
He shuts the door with finality. The kid stands silently for a moment. He looks over his shoulder, at two chattering Groupies watching his dilemma from the top of the ramp. They look at him sympathetically, but he turns away. William rings the buzzer again, withdrawing a copy of Creem from his bag. The door opens.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I'm a journalist, and here's a copy of the magazine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
The magazine hangs in mid-air.

<SCOTTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not on the list. Go to the top of the ramp with the girls!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTY>
<DIRECTION>
Slam. William stands there for a moment. Unsure of what to do next, he looks back to the top of the ramp. Rejected by him just moments earlier, the groupies now feign disinterest. Bracing himself, William rings again. The door opens slowly this time. Scotty stands peering at him.

EXT. TOP OF SPORTS ARENA RAMP -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William inches into the realm of the girls at the top of the ramp. The wind whips. It's just him, and two Groupies in their evening best. They now pretend to barely notice the young journalist who has been banished to stand with them. Chattering excitedly, with sophistication far beyond her 17 years, is ESTRELLA. She sports long unruly black hair. Her partner hangs in the shadows, adjusting shoes. Estrella turns to the kid with great disinterest.

Estrella stares at him. Moving into the parking lot light, introducing herself, is a luminous girl in a green faux-fur trimmed coat. This is PENNY LANE. There is an inviting warmth and real interest in the way she asks:

Shot drifts off him and picks up, out of the darkness, another breathless girl teetering on tall shoes. She is in the vicinity of 16. Her black hair is cropped short and died red, just like the cover of Bowie's Aladdin Sane. She is POLEXIA, the voluptuous one, from Riverside.

A very odd look on his face, William now cranes for a discreet look. What's in that purse?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAM -- THE BACKSTAGE DOOR OPENS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out steps SAPPHIRE, 19, a tall girl with taller platforms. Heavy eye-makeup. Her accent is Texan, with odd traces of English. In one hand is a half-drained bottle of champagne. In the other, a fistful of backstage passes.

The girls scream and happily head down the ramp to Sapphire. Penny looks back and grabs William with a well-placed arm hooked around his. He joins the clacking sea of legs moving down the ramp. Sapphire slaps passes on the girls. As Scotty (The Keeper of the Backstage List) watches, Penny now slips William forward for a pass.

<DIRECTION>
Sadly, they leave him behind. The thundering arena sound of the collecting crowd, the p.a. system blasting Yes' "Roundabout"... purposeful roadies carrying guitar cases... the glimpse of backstage rock and roll... everything he wants to be a part of is on the other side of this door. And then it shuts. He stands alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the top of the ramp, a tour bus unloads. It reads -- STILLWATER TOUR 73. Moving loudly out of the bus is the opening band. This is Stillwater. Four road-weary band members, and their road manager. Voices booming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUSSELL HAMMOND, 27, presses the buzzer with the nose of his guitar-case. It's obvious from moment one. This is the star of the band, the charismatic one. He's tired. They're late. William recognizes him instantly, as the guitarist stretches. The buzzer goes unanswered. The kid is invisible to him, as the others now arrive behind Russell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tour/band manager DICK ROSWELL, 27, follows, loudly banging on the steel door. He has the flaxen-haired look of a former hippie, but he carries the emblem of a real pro -- the newest silver Halliburton briefcase covered with backstage passes. His direction is always - forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let us in, we're Stillwater! We're on the show!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<DIRECTION>
William is surrounded by them now. They stand together under the single lightbulb, familiar faces, a live-action album cover. JEFF BEBE the singer, his shiny black hair hanging in sheets around his head. ED VALLENCOURT the quiet drummer, his long arms hanging limply at his sides. His is a face made for the background. LARRY TURNER the compact bass-player. Dick now kicks at the door with his foot, as William produces a copy of Creem Magazine.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
(to Dick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, I'm a journalist. I write for Creem Magazine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Once again, the magazine hangs there. He can't give it away.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The enemy! A rock writer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
(struggling forward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to interview you or someone from the band.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DICK>
<DIRECTION>
(busy, running behind)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry but could you please fuck off?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<DIRECTION>
William blinks a little, takes it in stride. Russell sizes him up, moving in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Okay. I could do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys never listened to our records. You're all just frustrated musicians. Do you know what your magazine SAID about us? What was it - "the singer's incessant cater walling distracts From an assault with no clear purpose."
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(in background)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was Rolling Stone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Okay. Fuck off anyway. We play for fans, not critics.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Stung, William shrugs. It's been a terrible night, but at least thrillingly so.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Russell. Jeff. Ed. Larry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(can't help it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really love your band. I think the song "Fever Dog" is a big step forward for you guys. I think you guys producing it yourselves, instead of Glyn Johns, was the right thing to do. And the guitar sound was incendiary.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gestures with fist)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Way to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and leaves, beginning his long trek back up the ramp. Russell looks at the others. That kind of love is hard to give up.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
(good humored, yelling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well don't stop there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, come back here!! Keep going!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
They wave him back, as the backstage door opens again. The kid moves back down the ramp. They herd him in with them, through the door. Scotty quickly spots the kid and squares off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Russell notes the kid's swirling emotional state, shoves him forward.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not this one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTY>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's with us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<SCOTTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not with you. He's not with them. He's not on the list. He's not coming in. And this is my arena. And furthermore -
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTY>
<DIRECTION>
Russel craves the confrontation and moves forward closer to Scotty.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTY>

INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The band moves quickly down the hallway, with William moving to keep up. A young and grizzled red-haired roadie, RED DOG, catches them on the way. The band swarms around him.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Red Dog!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<RED_DOG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're playing here tomorrow night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED_DOG>
<JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
(aside, to the kid)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Red Dog, the Allman Brothers Band's number one roadie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Russel clamps an arm around Red Dog's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How're the guys?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<RED_DOG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Havin a ball, man. When we have a party, we have an Allman Brothers Band party. Everybody boogies. Everybody gets off. It's family, man. We all got These now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(flashes new mushroom tattoo on forearm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll see you guys in Boston, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(specifically to Russell)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dicky and Gregg send you their love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED_DOG>
<DIRECTION>
Camera catches flash of envy on the face of Jeff Bebe, as Stillwater sweeps forward into a small dressing room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dressing room activity swirls around him, as William simply listens. He holds a small microphone. His stoic look gives away little of the full body rush he's experiencing. As the other band members drift across frame, Russell Hammond, a true rock and roll believer, speaks as he straps on his guitar and gets ready for the show. To the kid, every word is reckless gem.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and it's okay, because rock and roll is a LIFESTYLE... and a way of thinking and it's not about money and "popularity!"
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some money would be nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff sprays some shaving cream into his palm, and rubs it into his scalp - poor man's mousse.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	- but it's a voice that says here I am... and FUCK YOU if you can't understand me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Russell smooths the strings of his guitar with a small cloth from his guitar case. The kid notices all these close-up details of rock.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And one of those people is gonna save the world and that means that ROCK AND ROLL CAN SAVE THE WORLD -- all of us together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
The kid's eyes dance. He checks to make sure he's getting the recording. He listens intently.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the chicks are great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we didn't do it for that! We are here because we needed to fuckin be here, not just 'cause we needed to away from Troy, Michigan, WHICH WE DID... but what it all comes down to is that thing. The Indefinable Thing, when people catch something from your music, the thing you put into it. I'm talking about... what am I talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
(elegantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The buzz?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	THE BUZZ! And the chicks, the whatever, is an off-shoot of THE BUZZ. And like -- you saying you liked "Fever Dog?" That is the fucking buzz, man. All we get are these fucking old-ass interviewers who don't understand, don't LISTEN, don't appreciate why we are here, which is the fuckin' BUZZ.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
William nods, holds his microphone steady. Russell tunes his guitar, ripping through unamplified guitar licks as he speaks. Jeff hustles to reclaim his own connection to the interviewer.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The next album will be even better. More texture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But... it's not what you put in, is it? It's what you leave out. Listen to... listen to Marvin Gaye...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Russell's face grows rapturous as he discusses this piece of music.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A song like "What's Going On." That single "woo" at the end of the second verse - you know that woo - that single "woo."
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
(proudly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know that, "woo."
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
(he does it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what you remember. The silly things, the little things... there's only one, and it makes the song. It's what you leave out. That's rock and roll.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
William nods, says nothing, keeps the microphone pointed. Activity surrounds him.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
(impressed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We used to talk more about this stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. See, this is maybe the most honest we've ever been in an interview because you know our music. You're the first press guy we've made friends with. We don't normally talk like this to them. And you're supposed to be The Enemy! What are you - 18?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you go. Still young enough to be honest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DICK>
<DIRECTION>
(walkie talkie crackling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten minutes 'till showtime, anyone who isn't in the band -- out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<DIRECTION>
Russell takes a last swig of beer. A roadie whisks his guitar away.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All this luggage is going to L.A.!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<DIRECTION>
William is swept out in the chaos of the pre-show ritual, past the pile of luggage by the door. It's a colorful heap of suitcases, featuring colorful laminated band tags, each with a number.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BACKSTAGE STEPS -- NIGHT -- MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William sits on the backstage steps, writing feverishly in his notebook. Behind him, two steps higher, Penny Lane scoots into place.
</DIRECTION>
<PENNY_LANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I found you a pass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENNY_LANE>
<WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
(amped, distracted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. I got in with Stillwater.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as he writes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The guitarist, Russel Hammond, he just thoroughly opened up. He is by far the best and most honest interview I've ever done.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've only done two, but you know. He's number one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<PENNY_LANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're learning. They're much more fun on the way up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENNY_LANE>
<DIRECTION>
William nods, still scribbling. She eases down into place on the step next to him. Her proximity cause him to look at her, his eyebrows rising. She smooths them down with two single fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<PENNY_LANE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How old are you?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm 15.

<PENNY_LANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to know how old I really am?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENNY_LANE>
<WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
(immediately)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
She looks upstairs, soaking in the sound of another band tuning up. Music is her religion.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you get started in all this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<PENNY_LANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a long story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENNY_LANE>
<WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
(quick study)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<PENNY_LANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We live in the same city. We should be friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENNY_LANE>
<DIRECTION>
She takes his backstage pass form his shirt and puts it on his thigh - the cooler location. Nearby, the dressing room door opens, and the Stillwater exits. Excitement level rises as they mass in the hallway with instruments. We hear the amped voice of Russell growing nearer.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Enemy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
He approaches, as William stands. Penny watches, hanging out of Russell's eyesight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing in the supercharged hallway, the kid is anxious to introduce his new friends.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Russell, this is Penny Lane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<PENNY_LANE>
<DIRECTION>
(stepping into view)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pleasure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENNY_LANE>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Penny Lane? Like the song, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<PENNY_LANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have we met?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENNY_LANE>
<DIRECTION>
THEY SHAKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And do not let go, for too long. There is history in their shake. Their eyes tell all. Shot takes us to William, who puts two and two together. It isn't hard. They clearly know each other. Well.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I guess you've... you've met.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Penny Lane! God's gift to rock and roll!! You're back!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(privately)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marc Bolan. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<DIRECTION>
Other band members pass, adjusting clothes for show time, waiting in the hallway... and now singing the Beatles song "Penny Lane."
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(noting kid's shyness)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Both of you.

</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
House lights go down. Cheers rise. Dick's flashlight dances on the ground just in front of them, guiding their way in the dark to the stage steps.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	- get in the huddle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Russell pulls William into the band's huddle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT LOOKING UP AT THEM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their band ritual, psyching together, arms on each other's shoulders in a circle. They sing a dew lines of the classic "Train Kept A-Rollin'" (or "Go See Cal" from the Cal Worthington ad) They all touch feet, and then break, heading for the stage. Russell directs Penny to his side of the stage. The kid follows. Plugging in, still in darkness, Russell hits a practice chord -- thwack. He steps on effects pedal. Applause. (Adlib onstage private patter, between members, goading each other -- the stuff no audience ever hears) Twenty feet away, Dick prepares to address the crowd from the darkened stage. It is his favorite moment of the evening, the highlight of his job.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From Troy, Michigan. Please welcome --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(importantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stillwater.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<DIRECTION>
Light hits the stage, and the band launches into their opening song, "If You Say Nothing." Audience response is strong. Shot lingers on the face of William as he soaks in the most undeniably exciting moment of any concert, the first thirty seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff the singer grabs the microphone and launches into some vocal pyrotechnics. Russell looks over to Penny and William, at stage right, grinning, pretending to trip on his cord, an elegant show-off move of a musician who is now where he belongs... before seriously stepping forward for the first guitar lead of the night. The kid looks over to see Penny watching Russell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT -- LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cases are shut and rolled toward the trucks. Stillwater heads for their bus. Jeff the singer says goodbye to Estrella Starr, like a sailor leaving port. Russell lingers behind, saying goodbye to William, loading his own equipment. Black Sabbath passes with entourage, heading to the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
(privately)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. You want to come up to L.A., we'll be at the "Riot House" all week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"The Riot House?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<RUSSELL>

</RUSSELL>
<WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
(attempting cool)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
All the while, just over the kid's shoulder, Russell scans the backstage crowd of hangers-on. Looking perhaps for Penny Lane.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's blow this burg!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<RUSSELL>

	I got it. No problem. Long story. Alright! I gotta go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Elsewhere in the arena, Black Sabbath is performing "Sweet Leaf." The kid could care less. He has bonded with Stillwater. He heads for the door. Penny walks with him. He's loving it. They pass a still-scowling Scotty, flashing passes, as they exit out into the ramp area.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. SPORTS ARENA -- NIGHT

Penny takes out an eyeliner pencil, writes her number on the back of his green notebook.

They stand in the night air. The parking lot is largely silent now, save for the thudding bass sounds of Black Sabbath. In the distance, we hear Elaine's insistent whistle.

In the distance, we hear the family whistle growing louder.

<PENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a plan. You've got to call me.

He nods cooly. He waits until she turns, and the sprints through the parking lot, to the distant family whistle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TAPE RECORDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William's fingers work the clunky keys, pressing rewind. We hear a snippet of the intense and lively Stillwater interview, full of overlapping and barely discernible voices. Meticulously, he untangles the voices, especially Russell's, as he transcribes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WILLIAM'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The work of a journalist, as William sits at his Smith-Corona Galaxis. There is a knock at the window, and William scoots back in his chair to see a familiar face. It is Darryl, his sister's old boyfriend. William opens the window.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Darryl.

</WILLIAM>
<DARRYL>

	Cool. Alright.

</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
William nods and continues his work, self-consciously, as Darryl sits on his bed and soaks in the memories of the room. A long moment passes. Darryl pats his thighs, and rises.

William slips on corduroy jacket, over a tie-dyed shirt. Well, it's definitely a look. Mom appears more nervous than her son.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>

They move to the door, and he steadies her, as if to remind her she's not going. He opens the door. She's a wreck, and she knows it.

He opens the door. Neil Young. "Sugar Mountain." Watching him leave is always a killer. She's not getting any better at it either. She folds her arms tightly across her chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WILLIAM'S HOUSE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Penny waist by her car, down the hill, sporting a different more elegant look. She cups her hands and yells up to him. He hikes down the hill, squishing down the water plants, almost falling, the first time we've seen him happy in his own skin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD -- LATER NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miss Penny Lane's yellow Vega makes the big swing onto Sunset Boulevard. She sings along to the obscure words of Led Zeppelin's "Dancing Days." William takes it all in from the passenger seat. Huge billboards advertise not cigarettes or beer, but albums. It's a wondrous piece of geography for any rock fan. Shot moves in as William, watches, takes it all in. He moves his head outside the window to see fully. Her windshield is cracked along the side.

	The Continental Hyatt House. Also known as The Riot House.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Every band stays here, all the ones that matter. The Who. Zeppelin. Alice. Bowie. English bands. American bands. We all know each other. Twenty- four hour room service. Like us, they were outsiders. They were so outside, they're inside, and insiders never even knew it, because they're outsiders and they are inside a place outsiders will never be. And why are we even talking about it? If you're really an insider, you're never gonna say it. You know what I mean?

EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neil Young and Crazy Horse's "Cinnamon Girl" ricochets across the Strip. It's blasting from cars tuned into KMET. Penny now wears her green faux-fur trimmed coat. She grabs William's hand, steadying her hat at the same time. They dart across the busy street. She stumbles a little on her platforms. He steadies his taller date. They are a good team as they pass one of several humming tour busses parked out front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HYATT HOUSE LOBBY -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Penny blasts into the Continental Hyatt House, William on her arm. The lobby of this bastion of seventies rock is more alive than most clubs. It's a swirling mass of Roadies carrying Halliburton briefcases plastered with tour stickers, mingling Rockers, and more than a few Groupies with lower-ambitions and taller-platforms than Penny Lane. The feeling is communal, illicit, intoxicating. The secret community of rock. Penny attracts a hailstorm of friends and comrades.

She hugs him like a long-lost friend, knocking the air out of him. And now overlapping this action, appears Superfan RIC NUNEZ, 14. His eyes are forever moist, but he's oddly formal and never feels worthy of the rockers he idolizes. Tonight he wears a custom homemade t-shirt with iron-on block letters. It features the four Led Zeppelin symbols and the words: "TO BE A ROCK AND NOT TO ROLL." A felt-tip pen is still in his quivering hand. Nunez walks with them, backpedaling as he says:

INT. HALLWAY/RUSSELL'S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William, Polexia and an ambivalent Penny walk the hallway, looking for the room. William looks in the passing open doors, each one a different window into another world.
</DIRECTION>
<PENNY_LANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Time to put on the lampshade.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENNY_LANE>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead, the door to their smallish hotel room is open. Inside, a band party in full swing. A clunky early-model boom box segues from James Brown's "Make It Funky" to Led Zeppelin's "Gallows Pole." Russell Hammond is the center of this party, jabbing out the chords, playing along on guitar. Much singing echoes all around. It's a hotel-room Hootenanny, and all members of the band are present. Penny Lane takes a breath and enters, with arms extended and pointing in opposite directions. She does a flawless stewardess imitation, with proper hand gestures, to a loud party ovation.

The ice machine makes new cubes with a grinding noise. Penny puts ice in her glass. Behind her, Russell moves into frame, hands delicately riding the sides of her body. A motorcycle roars by, just outside the door, as Penny moves away from Russell's exploring hands.

The hallways are crowded, as William looks at the closed door of the ice room. He leans against the wall, alone now. Trying to look like he belongs. Behind him, most of the band has disappeared into other rooms, leaving only hangers-on in their places.

INT. ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Music. We pan across cubicles bustling with laid-back fervor. These are the San Francisco-based main offices of Rolling Stone Magazine. We have arrived for the waning days that this magazine could still be called, with a straight-face, an "underground" publication. Their mounting success crowds the edges of every frame. Camera catches the Annie Leibowitz portraits that hang on the walls -- Lennon, Jagger, Rod Stewart, James Taylor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We find editor BEN FONG-TORRES, 29, in his cramped cubicle. Sitting nearby is curly-haired and mustachioed Star Staff writer, DAVID FELTON, 32, who smokes his cigarettes with a long holder. Felton reads one of William's articles, chuckling.

INT. LESTER BANGS HOME -- LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The great Lester Bangs stands in the promotional album-clogged bedroom of his Birmingham, Michigan, home/office at Creem Magazine. There is nothing in frame that does not deal with music. In the background, a scratchy and chaotic Coltrane record.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elaine arrives to find William, Mrs. Deegan and Darryl awaiting her in the living room. It's a 1973-style intervention. They wear sunny, compassionate smiles.

Mrs. Deegan produces a copy, and places it on Elaine's lap. It sits there like the plague.

	I wish to disprove the prevailing false belief that rock music is based on drugs and sex. True, perhaps at one time... but rock music is different now. It is now performed by hard-working intellectuals, with... with blazing intellectual pursuits, and I am going to play for you a piece of music designed to show you that my thesis is correct.

Mom stifles a cough. William nods to Darryl, who reverentially drops the needle with a thud. Mom is trapped, as we listen to silent static... and then... the opening notes of Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven." William gives his Mother the album cover's inner-sleeve with lyrics.

INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER AFTERNOON

Mom's face remains stoic to the bitter end. ("... and she's buying the Stairway to Heaven.") The song ends. Silence. All look to Elaine. They wait on her response. We hear the turntable arm return to its cradle.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I supposed to say? You say it's Tolkien, fine. They sound like nice kids. Is it meant to elevate humanity? "Sure, let's elevate humanity. After we sell you drugs and sex." All I have is my honesty. That's what I believe, and that's what I know.

INT. STILLWATER TOUR BUS -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An empty Heineken beer bottle rolls up and down the aisle, taking us to William. William picks up the bottle and places it in the seat back pocket in front of him. He has joined the circus, and the feeling of being here is a lot more lonely and forbidding than he expected. The bus struggles to make it up the hill, back rows shuddering loudly, as music continues.

INT. BUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William strains for a look at Russell five rows up. He plays slide guitar, working out a part. Next to Russell is Penny Lane. Penny raises an early-model Polaroid camera and - flash - takes a picture of a nearby sleeping Jeff Bebe.
</DIRECTION>
<PENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotcha.

Jeff grumbles from the depths of a hangover. Penny stuffs the shot in her pocket. William watches, his private heart pounds. Polexia appears and sits next to him, noticing his shyness.

</POLEXIA>
<DIRECTION>
Challenged, William rises and approaches Russell. He fixes the charismatic guitarist in his sights. Shot takes him down the aisle to the jamming star guitarist. He crouches in the aisle and talks to Russell who immediately seems moody. His mood is in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Russell. Do you think we might be able to find some time to talk when we get to Phoenix? I want to interview everyone separately... and I felt we'd start with you and me.

Nearby, Jeff now listens in, feeling immediately jealous.

	No no no. Don't put that in Rolling Stone. My bio says I graduated. We'll come up with something better later. Just enjoy the ride.

Russell eyes the notebook suspiciously before turning away. Penny notices William's discomfort, laughing warmly, all while grabbing a Coke and giving one to nearby bassist Larry.
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you know I was thirsty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He didn't even realize he was thirsty, but he is. He nods thanks to Penny, the perfect road companion for all. And then Penny gives the other Coke, her Coke, to William. He accepts it too, and starts back to his seat. He's been blown off, and he knows it, but before he exits Penny grabs his arm and whispers in his ear:
</DIRECTION>
<PENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I may need to stay in your room tonight. Russell's in a bad mood. He's very Bob Dylan in Don't Look Back today. He's trying to write.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENNY>

William nods cooly -- they are comrades -- and returns to his seat. A large joint passes in front of him, across him, to Polexia, as everyone cheers Doris the Bus rumbling up another hill.

A wall of pot smoke is exhaled, right into his face. It surrounds him like a cloud. The bus shudders, as Russell continues playing slide up ahead.

Several hours later on this ride. Outside, night and desert. Inside, a few cigarettes, a joint of two glow in the darkness of the bus. The end of the Led Zeppelin classic "Whole Lotta Love" plays from the bus stereo, full blast. Everybody is free and anonymous in the dark. They sing at full-volume. William looks out the window in wonder.

John Bonham's drums thunder through the bus, everybody still singing as they dip down into the city ahead, Phoenix. William watches the living documentary around him. He writes furiously in the green notebook, scribbling in the dark, trying to steady his writing on the bumpy bus. Behind him, someone is beating along to the song on his seat. He never want to leave this world.

INT. ARIZONA RAMADA INN LOBBY -- NIGHT

All enter the lobby like warriors, in a pack. The hotel chairs are spotted with curious hangers-on, decked out and lounging. Dick is already stationed, as always, at the front desk. The sad state of hotel service grates on a road dog like Dick. He is forever teaching others their jobs.

William cooly takes the folded message, doesn't look at it, and tries to pretend this embarrassing moment didn't happen. Jeff exchanges a look with Russell. Nearby, the walking commotion arrives, clacking through the lobby. It's Sapphire. Last night's clothes are now today's. She holds a travel case, and hanger with some odd blouses.

He looks harmless, but he does represent the magazine that trashed Eric Clapton, broke up Cream, ripped Led Zeppelin, and wrote that lame story about the Allman Brothers Band that bummed Duane out before he died. Don't forget the Rules. This little shit is the Enemy. He writes what he sees.

Penny speaks confidentially to him. If she is slightly bossy, it is only because she's good at logistics, emotional and otherwise.

(to Sapphire and Polexia)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just have to remember... these guys are jealous, insecure, talented, egocentric, and manipulative geniuses... they're lead-singers. They can say "I love you" to 20,000 people... but any fewer is a real problem.

Penny squeezes him. He feels cool... but the girl he really wanted to stay in his room now joins Russell, disappearing into the elevator. He looks down at the message in his hand, and opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It reads: DON'T TAKE DRUGS! He snaps it closed quickly, before anyone can see.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RUSSELL's ROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Russell plays acoustic guitar, a notebook cradled on his lap. Trying to write. It's coming slowly. Shot moves off him, past a flickering television, onto Penny who silently and intently watches Russell as if he's a rare and beautiful bird. He looks over at her - she turns away quickly. He goes back to work. Tries to catch her watching him again. She turns away just in time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WILLIAM'S HOTEL ROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stillwater's "Fever Dog" plays from the t.v. radio. William on the bed, a thick local phone book on his lap. His hotel room. He watches self-consciously as the girls go about the ritual of inhabiting a room on the road. Sapphire flutters a paisley scarf over the room lamp. Polexia puts a towel along the crack of the door, blows out the glowing embers on too- many sticks of incense, and moves to the phone. Estrella has joined them as well, complete with a bag full of shoes. Instantly, we have atmosphere and not much room left in this, the smallest room in the hotel. William thumbs through the phone book with fascination.

<WILLIAM>

They nod. It's a good plan.

EXT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT

The hanging sign on the door reads: DO NOT DISTURB. William knocks on Russell's door. A maid pushes up against him with her cart, which now blocks the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SHOULD I COME BY LATER?

A group of golf conventioneers are now trapped behind the maid cart. They ease past William as he negotiates with Russell through the door.

We hear Penny's giggle. Then the door opens, and it's Penny looking ravishing. In the background, Russell sits shirtless at the table. He playfully pelts the kid with crumpled up wads of hotel stationery.
</DIRECTION>
<PENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. Some to the radio interview.

She shuts the door quickly. It hurts a little. He picks up the wadded pieces of paper, stuffs them in his pocket. He leaves the door and helps himself to some soap and pencils and matches from the nearby maid's cart. Then he returns to Russell's door. He can't help but listen to the muffled sounds of laughter, just for a moment, escalating. He flips the sign over: HOUSEKEEPING PLEASE ENTER - CLEAN ROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OUTER RADIO STATION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Humble Pie. "Thirty Days in the Hole." Russell and band enter the radio station, passing through the now-empty front office. As always, Russell sets the tone. He's feeling good. Stillwater takes over -- they feel mighty, like the Beetles, as they climb across chairs, rearrange wall hangings and gold records and head down the small hallway to the control room interview. Rolling with the flow are William and Penny in her green coat. He tries to distance himself from her -- still a little stung by the earlier hallway rebuff -- but she will have none of it. She privately shares every great passing moment with him. He tries not to succumb to these charms. It's hard. Music segues to Stillwater's own "Fever Dog."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RADIO CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stillwater's own record spins, and it sounds good to everyone in this room. Russell takes a seat near the open mike. Jeff Bebe is quick to take the other seat, arranging himself to be just as close to the microphone as Russell. William watches all as he sits at the dark back of this control booth. Stillwater sits with late-night progressive disc-jockey QUINCE ALLEN, 25.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quince takes a long hit from a joint and does not pass it. The entire Stillwater band is now collected in the studio and ready for the interview. William can't avoid looking at Penny Lane, who looks great tonight. She catches him, and he barely looks away in time. Polexia, newly reconciled with Jeff, notices. The very mellow disc-jockey eases up to the microphone, as the finale of "Fever Dog" is just ending.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCE_ALLEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The guitar of Russell Hammond. "Fever Dog"... The band is Stillwater.

The band scoots closer to the microphone, ready to talk. Quince continues, looking meaningfully at the band. They are waiting... eager for a chance to speak.

	How'd you get together?
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCE>
<DIRECTION>
As Jeff eagerly speaks, Quince lowers his head and listens... feels... the words of his guests.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... not to get into a "me" thing... this is Jeff talking... but I did start the band, some time, actually, ago. This is back when we were the Jeff Bebe band, and I placed an ad in a magazine called Peaches looking for a guitarist and Russell Hammond answered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>

Quince nods, head bowed, swaying slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peaches.
	</DIALOGUE>
</QUINCE>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff watches Quince's head lower. It's hard to know when to talk with Quince. The depth of his mellowness is tough to get in rhythm with.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think he was a gift from God, actually. Nobody plays like Russell Hammond.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<RUSSELL>

He instantly realizes he's slipped, on the air.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Ooops. Better hit the delay button.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
All eyes turn to Quince, whose head stays down, grooving to some inner beat. He says nothing. The band looks at each other. We become increasingly aware that Quince may now be asleep. Long silence. William shares an amazed look with Penny. Quince is definitely asleep. Russell leans forward and continues talking quietly, with hilarious sincerity.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay - we're talking now, right? Why the fuck do you wait until and interview in Arizona to say something nice about me. Why don't you say it to my fucking face sometime? Because I tell you every time I think you nailed something.

	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<DIRECTION>
Penny covers her mouth as offers a look of absurdity to William. He offers one back, as laughs are stifled throughout the room. William shares a look. Quince is still deeply asleep, as the usually quiet tony leans forward to speak.
</DIRECTION>
<TONY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Feces.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
He cracks himself up, silently. Quince snaps awake, fully in- stride.
</DIRECTION>
<QUINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The dong is called "Love Thing." Your mind is Starting to take effect. They're all here to see you swallow fire. You scream soundlessly... on the Night Circus. It's Quince, with Stillwater.

"Love Thing" takes over, as Quince swivels in the chair.

Adrenalized laughter. The whole band is crammed into a medium- sized rental car. Penny half on William's lap, half on Russell's.

The phone is ringing. Estrella emerges from the bathroom with no make-up and a t-shirt. She picks up the phone. Across the room, Sapphire signs for room service. Now she is far too made-up. The t.v. radio plays Free's "Fire and Water" in the b.g.

	You should be really proud of him. 'Cause I know guys... and I'll bet you do too. And he respects women, and he likes women, and let's just pause and appreciate a man like that.

INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT

Russell and William sit in two large red-leatherette seats in the hotel lobby. William shuffles through many pages of questions written in small script. His tape recorder microphone sits balanced on the chair.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that you're starting to be successful, you had twenty-six years to write your first Album... and you'll have maybe four months for the second. Do you worry that the pressure of the business will get in the way of the original joy of making your music? Or -

Russell blinks. The all-consuming issues of his life are right in front of him.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOTEL POOL AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Russell walks the outskirts of the pool area with William. William follows him through the sliding glass door to his room, facing the pool. Russell grabs his guitar. They stand for a moment, unheard by the others, and regard the living portrait twenty yards in front of them. The off-limits after-hours pool area has been overtaken by the Stillwater tour members. Jeff Bebe sits in a chair nearby. Dick laughs at a joke. Always the life of the party, Penny Lane dispenses stolen towels from a maid cart. And she is the first to slip into the pool for some after-hours, against-the-rules swimming. Effortlessly, she turns a collection of people into a party. They regard her, well out of earshot of the others.

</WILLIAM>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. I trust you. I'm going to lay this right on you. Just make us look cool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will quote you warmly and accurately.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I'm worried about. See - some of us have girlfriends back home. Some of us have wives. And... some of the people you meet on the road are really amazing people...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
They both watch Penny Lane, sparkling, fresh from the pool. She places hotel furniture into the shallow end and inviting all, even other curious hotel guests, to join them in the pool.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like you. And some of the things that happen are good for just a few people to know about - as opposed to, say, a million people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Dawn is breaking for William.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ohhhh. Oh. Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, you're dangerous. Most people are just waiting to talk, but you listen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So your question you asked me. I think about It every fucking night. The "business." I hate it!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I grew up with these guys, okay? I can't play all that I can play, I'm past these musicians, do you understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The more popular we get, the more I can't walk on them, the bigger their houses get, the more pressure... you forget, man. You forget what it was like to be real, to be a fan. You can hear it in a lot of bands who've been successful - it doesn't sound like music anymore. It sounds like... like lifestyle maintenance.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly confessional)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used to be able to hear the sounds of the world. Everything, to me, used to sound like music. Everything. Now I don't hear it. You know what I'm trying to say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
(ruefully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, it feels good to say this stuff out loud. But what am I doing? I'm telling secrets to the one guy you don't tell secrets to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
(feeling included)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that's okay. We'll do the interview tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is good. So there's the "friend" and then there's the "interview guy."
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So tonight it's "friend".... and when we wake up tomorrow - "interview guy." We'll figure it out as we go, buddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey - for whatever it's worth - you guys are really good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Russell laughs at the kid's easy naivete. He hands his guitar to the kid, and joins the party. William watches, part of the crowd... somehow feeling a little compromised. He doesn't care. Penny gestures for him to join them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUN STADIUM - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William interviews Larry in the seats of the empty arena. On stage, Ed soundchecks his drums.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How would you describe your role in Stillwater? What is the chemical that you add to the chemistry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<LARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm the bass-player.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
(pressing for some poetry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. And when you take that away... what would be missing? Stylistically? What chemical?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(not getting it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The bass?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Larry doesn't give him much.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUN STADIUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's raining. The pre-show huddle breaks up, William a part of them. Penny Lane adjusts Larry's look. She takes the scarf from around his neck and ties it around his leg. He looks instantly better. William watches in the darkness as Dick takes the microphone. The best part of his day has arrived. In his important voice:
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening Phoenix.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(applause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From Troy, Michigan. Please welcome, Stillwater.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<DIRECTION>
Lights come up, as the band launches into "Fever Dog." Jeff begins singing. Russell reaches to adjust the microphone for a back-up vocal and is hit with something unexpected.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sharp electrical shock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's just a slight pop in the loud din of music, but within a moment something is clearly wrong. Russell holds onto the microphone stand with a surprised look, conducting high-voltage for two seconds and then he snaps his hand off the metal. His face is white, he takes off his guitar and walks off-stage, collapsing a couple steps later.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dick is waving wildly for the band to board the bus, which has been pulled up into the backstage area. He guides a sagging Russell, assisted by Penny Lane, into the bus.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get in, get in!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<DIRECTION>
William boards the bus, as the extremely agitated PROMOTER arrives to confront Dick.
</DIRECTION>
<PROMOTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you the manager of this band?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROMOTER>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That, and more. Get in!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<PROMOTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't even play a full set!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROMOTER>
<DIRECTION>
Dick whirls and unleashes an anger we've not yet seen, gesturing with the silver briefcase that does not leave his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your shoddy stage set-up almost killed our guitarist!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<PROMOTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You trashed the dressing room - you didn't play your thirty-five minutes. You didn't fulfill your contract -
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROMOTER>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody in! Get in the bus!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<PROMOTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll report you to every promoter in the country! I'm gonna talk to Frank Barcelona!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROMOTER>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YOU DON'T FUCK WITH MY BAND'S SAFETY!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<PROMOTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you have a good lawyer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROMOTER>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I AM A LAWYER!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<DIRECTION>
He swings into the bus, as the bus revs.
</DIRECTION>
<PROMOTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	LOCK THE GATE ON 'EM!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROMOTER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUS -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Russell sits, pale, next to Penny at the front of the bus. He examines his singed hand, shaking it a little to emphasize the positivity of her words.
</DIRECTION>
<PENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. It's happened to all the greats. Thank God you didn't hold the mike stand with both hands, you'd still be holding it. This is a good thing. It's a good, good, good thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENNY>
<DIRECTION>
William sits nearby, watching Russell, making notes out of eye- sight of others. The ever-wary Jeff, unseen by William, cranes to see that he's writing in his notebook.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dick swings into the seat across from Russell. The bus door shuts, as the promoter is still yelling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doris is slow to gain speed, as Estrella appears, running alongside. She knocks on the window next to William.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTRELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I forgot to tell you! Your mom says to call home immediately. She says she knows what's going on!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(receding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you guys in Topeka! I'll catch a ride with Sabbath!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTRELLA>
<DIRECTION>
William nods with embarrassment, waves to her, as the bus races toward the now closing gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
<DIRECTION>
(casually, to Russell)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wanna buy a gate?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<DIRECTION>
Before Russell can answer - BASH. Doris barrels through the steel-gate, snapping it like a chopstick to great cheers inside this bus.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just bought a gate.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the bus)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon Doris!! Get us out of town!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<DIRECTION>
The bus struggles up a slight incline, everybody rooting for Doris, as she eases out of the parking lot and onto a thoroughfare.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did it feel like to be electrocuted?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It burns. It feels like a dose of lead shooting through your body... and then you see God, and he says, "How bad do you want to be legendary?" And god damnit. I let go.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shaky grin as all laugh warmly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rock and roll.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff watches this charisma with thinly veiled envy. The kid scribbles in his notebook. We hear Led Zeppelin's "That's the Way."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUS - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Song continues. Almost everybody is asleep. William takes the camera and snaps a Polaroid of a sleeping Penny. She wakes up.
</DIRECTION>
<PENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give that to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENNY>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs for it, they have a brief play-fight. He grabs some other Polaroids from her pocket. He hustles to the back of the bus, pockets the photo, and settles down to watch the passing landscapes. She chases him down the aisle. Music continues as she sits down next to him. Out the window, a long-distance running team of Girls keeps pace with the bus for a bit. They wave. Penny watches them over sunglasses, waves briefly to the real world.
</DIRECTION>
<PENNY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (breathing heavy, owning the world)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When we go to Morocco, I think we should wear completely different clothes, and be completely different people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENNY>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What will our names be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
She snaps a Polaroid of a nearby sleeping Silent Ed, pockets the Polaroid. She regards Russell up ahead, also sleeping. Her attention has already wandered from Morocco.
</DIRECTION>
<PENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think of Russell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENNY>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<PENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're coming to Cleveland, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENNY>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cleveland, Ohio? Oh no no no. I gotta get my interview with Russell before Greenville. And you've got to help me. Okay? Friends... remember?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Penny is still watching Russell.
</DIRECTION>
<PENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should give him a break. There are real problems in the band. Off the record.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Gravely noting the word "problems", the kid joins Penny in watching Russell, who is splayed haphazardly, sleeping restlessly up ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What problems?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<PENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. I got it. I think your name should be Spencer, and mine will be Jane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENNY>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't keep up with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<PENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENNY>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your real name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him briefly. She puts her arm around him. It's intoxicating, but he doesn't quite know how to act. With her free hand, she gestures with a hanger. As they regard Russell sleeping nearby:
</DIRECTION>
<PENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's the thing about Russell. He's my last project. I only do this for a very few people. And I think we should do it together - he is almost great. We've got to take him there. You and me - we can do it. Deal? Because the other guys are good - but he could be great. He's my last project.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENNY>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her. She imitates his face back to him.
</DIRECTION>
<PENNY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all happening.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENNY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOPEKA ARENA BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William sits interviewing Silent Ed by some equipment cases.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you love about music?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Ed looks at him thoughtfully. It is an eloquent moment. He thinks. He shrugs. The kid tumbles with more questions. These interviews are not going well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William, looking concerned over the state of his interviews, walks into the backstage bathroom. He makes a few surreptitious notes in his notebook before noticing that Jeff is standing there, clearly just finishing a quick hit of cocaine offered by a Local Hanger-On. Seeing the kid, he immediately hides the coke spoon.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
William pretends he sees nothing as he turns to the urinal, and shot stays on Jeff, who looks a little high and a little worried.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BACKSTAGE PAY PHONE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William is on the pay phone with his Mother. The show booms in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. I know. I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. Mom. Mom... Mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stillwater on-stage. A great show. Russell on fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BACKSTAGE PAY PHONE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William on the phone. Estrella leans on him, fixing her shoe.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right now -- Topeka. Then Greenville. Then home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
He winces slightly, holds the phone away from his ear for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry I didn't call yesterday! It's not like you can just carry a phone around with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELAINE'S SCHOOL OFFICE -- AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mom sits in her school office, a miniature version of her home - a fortress in which she is surrounded by books. The sun is going down. She can't resist a sentimental moment.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess I just miss you, and I don't understand why I've driven both my kids so far away from me. By all practical rules don't I get you for three more years?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
He is touched by her vulnerability, more visible now than ever, as music continues in b.g.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was I not fun?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BACKSTAGE PAY PHONE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William has his finger in his ear. The din if Stillwater's set now blots out all other noise. It is not the time to answer this question.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I missed the last thing you said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Mom takes a pause.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I LOVE YOU.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Penny now enters, watching.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHAT?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
(angry, louder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I MISS YOU AND I LOVE YOU!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
William now notices Penny standing nearby, picking at a salad from a paper dish. Looking at her, he lets loose with what he believes is a private confession.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I LOVE YOU!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Penny smiles knowingly, collecting his affection like another backstage pass, and turns away. Camera stays on William. He is suddenly and deeply embarrassed. He's just told her that he loves her and she knows it. He hangs up, traumatized.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOPEKA DRESSING ROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Russell's hair is slicked with sweat from a show just finished. He is shirtless with a towel around his shoulders. Luggage for the next city is stacked by the door.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fire away. I'm ready. I'm on the "You" Train. Take me there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
The kid plugs in his microphone. Russell listens as he springs his first question.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have to be depressed to write a sad song? Do you have to be in love to write a love song? Is a song better if it really happened to you? Like, "If You Say Nothing"... where did you write that and how did it come about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Russell admires the many questions. Says nothing. He looks at his hand, thinks.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When did you get so professional?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
In the background, Penny Lane irons Silent Ed's shirt. Grinning, she cuffs his shoulder. To the shirtless silent drummer, waiting for his shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<PENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm almost done with my shirt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Ed watches her appreciatively, drumming silently on a rubber pad. Penny kisses Russell, who swings her onto his lap. In the corner, Jeff watches them all with a vague feeling of being underappreciated. And now Dick enters with a large cardboard box.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Russell, your dad showed up again. And on a lighter note.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(importantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen. Your first t-shirts have arrived.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<DIRECTION>
There is an immediate buzz in the room, as Dick yanks open the box filled with new white t-shirts. He untangles the first fresh shirt, and displays it proudly. A silent beat as all examine it - their first t-shirt. Faces fall. Ed stops drumming. There has been a mistake. It is a fuzzy band photo with the group name emblazoned below. Only Russell, who stand out front, is colored- in and emphasized on the shirt. He turns away, making a noise. Jeff stares at the t-shirt. He's just about in tears. There is a long silence and then... Ed resumes drumming on the rubber pad.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the record company's mistake. And they will pay. Shirts gone, band happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<DIRECTION>
He drops the offending shirt into the trash, as if it were contaminated, and exits with the box. William watches as the two men, Russell and Jeff, move to opposite sides of the room. Russell puts on a shirt, so does Jeff. The vibe is thick. Russel turns to see Jeff staring at him.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we just skip the vibe and go straight to us laughing about this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
(bitterly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
(trying for a joke)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I can see by your face - you want to get into this -
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you tell? I'm just one of the out-of-focus guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here we go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
William watches as Russell fishes the t-shirt out of the trash.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here. Take it. You LOVE this shirt - it lets you say everything you want to say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it speaks pretty loudly to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a t-shirt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Russell turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm always gonna tell you the truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you doing coke again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah. All the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
The kid looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is big stuff, man. From the very beginning -- we said -- I'm the front man and you're the guitarist with mystique. That's the dynamic we agreed on -- Page, Plant... Mick, Keith. But somehow it's all turning around. We have got to control what's happening to us. There's a responsibility here -
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, but didn't we all get into this to avoid responsibility?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing, on shirt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this is the slow-moving train of compromise that will kill us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Russell makes a disgusted noise. Penny Lane exits discreetly, looking back at William.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't say anymore with a writer here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can trust him, you can say whatever you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
(eyes suddenly moist)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I works as hard or harder than anybody on that stage. You know what I do - I connect. I get people off. I look for the guy who isn't getting off, and I make him get off.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, that you can print.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(continues to Russell)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And yet, why do I always end up feeling like I'm a joke to you? I feel nothing but love for you. We're a family.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at the t-shirt and starts to cry. Embarrassed, he grows angrier.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to pretend this isn't going to be a very big band. Well it is. You call yourself a leader of this band, but your direction allowed the t-shirt, when you allowed Dick to manage us, 'cause he's your friend... don't you see? The t-shirt is everything. It's everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it my turn? Because I think we should, for once, say what we really mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, this is the part where you quit -
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
(stiffening)
</DIRECTION>

William watches as Russell slugs from a Jack Daniels bottle. They sit in the bedroom of a mindblown fan, 17 year-old AARON. He has long frizzy brown hair, tied in a spray behind him. Many from the neighborhood are now pouring into the home.

It's getting lighter. Cars line the street. And now, finally turning the corner, is Doris the Bus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN -- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William watches the effects of personal charisma. Wet partygoers surround Russell, bottle of Jack Daniels still in hand, wrapped in towels. Now a bond has passes between them, all of them. Algae drips from the corner of Russell's face and neck.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for saving my life. I won't hold it against you.

<DIRECTION>
Frustrated but feeling important, William hands him some of Russell's wet clothes. William deftly retrieves Russell's shoes and smoothly plucks the guitarist's sunglasses from the partygoer who also wears his belt. They move to the door in a pack. We hear the beginning of Elton John's "Tiny Dancer." Dick faces the crowd and addresses them in his "important" stage voice.

INT. TOUR BUS -- MORNING - 5 AM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Tiny Dancer" continues on the bus stereo. Russell sits up front, swathed in a large robe, alone and silent. The others have given him a wide berth. He feels silly, and they know it, and he hates that they know it, which makes him feel foolish. He sits silently. William watches him from four rows back, next to Penny. She kisses the top of his forehead, a hero's welcome. He yawns. The song's vocal begins. There is only more silence. Then, after a beat, we hear a voice or two, fighting the quiet and singing along. Then others... waking up... joining in. Then Jeff. Russell hears them and starts to sing along too, louder now, without turning around. It's a voice everyone wants to hear. Like it or not, this is his family.

Estrella and Polexia kiss each other playfully. William looks confused. Across the room, Penny laughs, turns up the TV, blows him a kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Penny's eyes. Across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes.

<DIRECTION>
His sexual awakening may be downtime amusement for them, but to him it's an embarrassingly intense moment he shares only with Penny Lane -- across the room. She turns away, smiling, disappears into the next room.

<DIRECTION>
William is awake. Sunlight floods in from the corners of the window-shades. He is surrounded by the fallen cavalry of the night before... Sapphire and Polexia. The phone rings, and Sapphire instantly snaps it up, still asleep. Lost in her dreams, she offers the sexiest hello ever.

INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Circles have sprouted up under William's eyes. The orange bag strapped over his shoulder, he lugs a huge bag of laundry. He consults room list. A variety of noises and smells drift from the band rooms. He sees Room Service arrive at Dick's door, and it's Estrella who opens the door. (Dick in the background.) She smiles sweetly to William -- good morning -- as the door shuts.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>

	Houdini... Houdini...

</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
He arrives at Russell's door. Two exclamation points have been Sharpie-markered to the words Do Not Disturb on the sign is gaffer-taped to his door. He looks through the crack, at the bottom of the door. Carefully and politely, he knocks. Instantly:
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GO AWAY!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Pissed, the kid flips off the door. He sits down on a chair directly across from the room. Push in on William, who is more pent-up than ever. He tries hard not to cry, taking gulps of air as a maid cart swishes past, revealing... he's failed. He cries.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE UP FROM DARKNESS

A super-energized Russell Hammond looks into William's sleepy face. William's eyes open. His own sleepy face is evident in Russell's sunglasses. The bag of laundry is still at his feet.

He begins rubbing the kid's shoulders. He's waking up. There's Penny, also rubbing his shoulders. It is degrading... and somehow cool too.

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

Night. Doris rocks toward Cleveland on a muggy summer night. The windows of passing houses offer rich Edward Hopper glimpses of lives and people William will never meet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WILLIAM'S BUS BUNK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William watches from his bus bunk at the back, head on elbow. Looking up, he sees the rhythmic motion of bodies on the mattress above him, as music continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William gets up, nods hello to the Roadie and his Date on the bunk above. He moves down the aisle... to the seats near the front. A sleeping Russell sits upright, hugging his guitar. Penny asleep next to him, Polaroid in her hand of... Russell sleeping. The kid moves on. He sits with the Bus Driver, whose CB crackles with chatter from other tour buses headed to Cleveland.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

EXT. DOWNTOWN CLEVELAND - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like a slow-moving shark, Doris pulls into empty downtown Cleveland. The streets are empty. They pass the Agoura Ballroom, where a man with a long stick arranges the letters Stillwater on the marquee. Applause in the bus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SWINGO'S CELEBRITY INN - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Russell and band enter like warriors, in a pack. William sags with the heavy bags in hand and over his shoulder. Here, in the middle of the midwest, is an explosive rock mecca, just as promised. The feeling of belonging invades all those in this lobby. Fans and other touring rockers mingle together. Outside in the real world, everyone else is going to work.
</DIRECTION>
<FAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Bowie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAN>
<DIRECTION>
The lobby ignites, as William stands near Penny and Russell. Bowie races from a limousine through the lobby and into the elevators. He is shrouded by a jacket. Just the top of his electric red hair travels the lobby, as he's hustled by security man Dennis in the elevator. And out of the chaos comes...

Jeff Bebe and Polexia smash against the wall of the Swingo's hotel room, making love.

Dick squats at the front of the stage, and talks to a few fans in the front row of this crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BACKSTAGE CLEVELAND PAY PHONE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wild Cleveland crowd in the building. The cities on this tour are getting bigger, and so are the audiences. And there is a whiff of business now too. Men in satin tour jackets and some Disc-jockey types cruise the backstage. A Hysterical Fan is led screaming to the nearby medic room. Few even react - it's Cleveland - as the shot finds William, tired and yawning, on the backstage pay phone. He is absolutely ready for the worst.
</DIRECTION>

ON THE HUDDLE
</DIRECTION>

William with the band. He yawns, as the band breaks. Cleveland awaits. We follow Dick, who guides the band onto the stage platform, still in darkness. Already, stomping and applause is mounting. Russell turns to William before taking the stage:

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANDHELD ON RUSSELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Who is in the middle of playing, as he smoothly whips off his guitar, and uses the instrument to send a Frenetic fan back into the crowd. He slips back under the strap, laughing. More stage climbers spring up where that fan came from, and Russell now watches as Jeff Bebe dodges a fan and comes over to Russell to lean on him. Russell turns to share the moment with Penny, dancing with arms in the air at the side of the stage.

William nods, exhausted, as Dick opens the door. In walks a small general of a man in a baseball t-shirt, well-trimmed beard and bowl cut. He holds the super-new Halliburton briefcase. He is DENNIS HOPE, 25. A man from the midwest, with a vision of the future of rock and roll. Already in his head are all the things that will come to pass. Higher ticket prices. Merchandising deals. Greater distribution and accounting of album sales. He shrugs hello to the band.

Hope appreciates the lack of small talk. He strides the room with the joyful enthusiasm of a kid who wants to build a fort. Russell watches, dismissive, holding his guitar.
</DIRECTION>
<DENNIS_HOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Respectfully. We all have our roots. I believe in bands holding onto their roots. But those roots need to be augmented. I'm gonna tell you the truth - I may enrage some and enthrall others. I don't really give a fuck. Your manager here needs a manager. Example. If you hadn't run out on the contract in Phoenix, you could have sued over Russell's hand... but you left, negating the contract, forfeiting the deposit, and you effectively traveled a long way to pay that promoter... to electrocute you.

Now he's reaching them. Their slackened roar-weary faces stare back at the young dynamo.

(casually)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No no. You don't understand. I'll think about it. I'm not auditioning. I came here to decide whether I want to represent you. So I'll stand outside for a moment, and think about whether I want to stay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENNIS_HOPE>
<DIRECTION>
He leaves the room with a pleasant shrug. Stunned silence. William watches their body language. No one wants to talk first. Their faces read as -- who was that guy, and how can we talk him into staying?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PLANE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William watches as the band stands inside the new plane. Dennis Hope looks on.

	<DIALOGUE>
	This is too much.
	</DIALOGUE>

William watches as Russell reclines. Russell grabs Penny, and she falls into the seat next to him. We hear the loud oncoming sound of the plane in flight, as Dennis cooly asks for Penny's seat.

<DENNIS_HOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you mind?

</DENNIS_HOPE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRIVATE AIRPORT -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doris the bus stays behind in the parking lot, abandoned near a field. The new plane lifts off in the background, as the bus sits alone, as if crying steel tears. Bus Banner reads simply: CLEVELAND. Reprise ending of Whole Lotta Love.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PLANE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girls sit on the jumper seats at the back of the plane, with William.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOSTON HOTEL ROOM HALLWAY -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William trudges the hallway with tape-recorder and notebook, trolling for Russell. He passes Boston travelogue posters on the walls. A few room doors are open, he looks for any sign of the guitarist. William veers into Dick's room, where a poker game full of Roadies is in progress. The room is thick with exotic smoke. They are a bunch of road-hardened snobs, smoking cigars and other items, famous to themselves, listening not to rock and roll... but Sarah Vaughn.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyone seen Russell?

	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_WHEEL>
<DIRECTION>
Grumbling roadies continue playing. Like an old pro, the kid turns down a Cola-can hash-pipe. This hand is down to Dick, and a roadie named REG from Humble Pie.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Side proposition. For fifty dollars and a case of Heineken, I will put into the pot... three Lovely Ladies, Including the famous Penny Lane... the Band-Aids, who need to exit our tour before New York...

<REG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, so we owe you fifty dollars and a case of Heineken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REG>
<DIRECTION>
Embarrassed, Russell notices the kids face. He leans over, and speaks confidentially to him.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. Nobody's feelings are getting hurt here. She already knows Leslie's coming To New York tomorrow. They all understand. This is the Circus. Everybody's trying not to go home. Nobody's saying goodbye.

INT. BACKSTAGE TRAILER/DRESSING ROOM -- AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William and Penny sit on opposite ends of a blue locker-room bench. It's a small dressing room, crowded with roadies, guitars and men in stages of half-dress. Piles of luggage headed for New York sit by the door. The door suddenly opens and Dick arrives with champagne and a cake decorated with a sparkler. It is placed in Penny's lap. It reads: Unforgettable Penny... Age Unknown. Boston, 1973. They gather now as the cake sits before a surprised and enchanted Penny Lane.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy Birthday from us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<DIRECTION>
William watches her face as she reads the message on the cake. It hasn't sunk in yet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Russell produces a piece of hotel stationery. He reads a poem.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So Penny our friend has gained another year. But long ago, she threw it in gear. She rocked the south The East and West. Could you please get off this endless tour Where we're Black Sabbath's fucking special guest?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>

	She says she's retired Though we've heard that before. She chose us... And in Penny Lane we trust She is a fan of this band. Much more so than us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
William watches her face. Still enchanted, she hands out slices of the cake.
</DIRECTION>
<DENNIS_HOPE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the point)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry the plane isn't bigger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENNIS_HOPE>
<DIRECTION>
It hits her. She looks at William for a clue. His truthful face does not look away. Now she knows. She turns to the others -- the plane isn't bigger? Shot moves in on Penny as she blinks just a little, cutting into the cake, still mugging for everybody, covering it all with a layer of sweet giddy laughter. Shot comes to rest behind her, her head turning to connect with band members. Each of them look away, nobody maintaining eye contact with her except the one she now doesn't look at. William. She blows out the candles, vamping Marilyn Monroe-style, and sucks off the frosting seductively, to cheers. Russell watches, as we push in on Penny. She notices all the luggage is gone, only her two cases remain by the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONCORD PAVILLION BACKSTAGE -- EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William exits a backstage Portosan. Penny catches him by the grilling area where catering is preparing for the outdoor event. Their laminated passes swing from around their necks. Thuding in the distance, Stillwater plays for a cheering outdoor crowd. The sound of summer insects in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<PENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it wasn't a birthday party, it was a farewell.

<PENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. You should be happy for me. You don't know what he says to me in private. Maybe it is love. As much as it can be with someone who --

Russell and band spill out of limo. The New York cluster of hardcore Stillwater fans wait outside. They hold collector's sleeves covering albums to be autographed, and fresh magic markers in hand. William in tow crawls out of the limo last. Dick goes to work, pulling luggage from the trunk. A serious- looking Fan (LENNY) approaches Russell with an autograph card.

William studies Leslie, everyone saying hello to her, everyone knowing the subtext. Nobody saying a word. William pulls his heavy bag out of the back of the limousine. The bag breaks, and the contents spill out onto the New York sidewalk. Bars of soap, ashtrays, hotel keys, crumpled paper, the contraband t-shirt, "Do Not Disturb" signs, notes, towels and thick telephone books from every city.

INT. MAX'S KANSAS CITY -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The famous hub of New York rock and roll. A strong whiff of decadence mixes with youthful naivete. Not a hippie in sight. William walks through, looking for familiar faces. Overhead we hear Stillwater. "If You Say Nothing." The party is filled with scenesters, long silver-haired glamsters, some British journalists, and many hunched young skinny bodies in leather jackets. Russell grabs him by the arm.

INT. GIRL'S BATHROOM - NIGHT - SAME TIME

INT. BACKROOM -- NIGHT

William sits with the band. Over Jeff's head, Penny hangs nearby, at the outskirts, drinking and dancing. They share a look, feigning casualty.

Stunned and overwhelmed, the band waits a beat, lets it sink in... and goes wild. Russell, stunned too, looks at the kid. It's big news. Jeff stands immediately, eyes moist, glass raised.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
And now Leslie has confirmation. A symphony of looks, as Dick gets to his feet and moves to confront Penny. Penny Lane's eyes fill and she runs out. Russell stands... and sees William also stand. William turns and follows her. Russell stands watching, and does not leave. We hear Elton John's "Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters."

	If something should happen. I love all of you. I don't think we have to do the secrets thing.

<DIRECTION>
The plane shakes. Now lightening strikes very close. A flashing wall of electricity rolls through the plane and evaporates with a burning smell still in the air. In the darkness:
</DIRECTION>
<DENNIS_HOPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I once hit a man in Dearborn, Michigan. A hit-and-run. I hit him and kept on going. I don't know if he's alive or dead, but I'm sorry.

The plane wildly rises, and falls. It stops for a moment. A strange smooth patch.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you all too, and you're my family. Especially since Marna left me. But if I ever took an extra dollar or two, here and there, it was because I knew I'd earned it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I slept with Marna, Dick.

	I also slept with Leslie, when you were fighting.

</JEFF>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You... slept with Jeff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<LESLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but it didn't count. It was the summer we decided to be free of all rules.

</LARRY>
<JEFF>

Bam. The plane is pulling sideways, and dropping altitude.

	Don't be self-righteous, Russell, not now. You were sleeping with Penny, that groupie. Last summer, and up until yesterday. Why don't you tell Leslie THAT?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Russell tries to get up and attack him. The force keeps him in his seat. He yells. Loud.
</DIRECTION>
<DENNIS>
<DIRECTION>
(freaking out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I quit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENNIS>
<DIRECTION>
The turbulence worsens. William finds his mouth saying emotional words he cannot control.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"That groupie?" She was a Band-Aid. All she did was love your band. And you all -- you used her, all of you. You used her and threw her away. She almost died last night, while you were with Bob Dylan. You're always talking about the fans, the fans, the fans. She was your biggest fan and you threw her away. And if you can't see that, that's your biggest problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Russell and Jeff stare at each other. The plane is rocking very very hard. Leslie is crying.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
They all turn to the silent drummer. (It's his first spoken dialogue of the movie.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The plane pops out from below the clouds. Sunshine spikes through the embattled windows of the plane, as they float downwards to the city of Tupelo, Mississippi. A very very uneasy silence fills the plane. No one can look at each other. Out bursts the Co-Pilot, giddy with victory.
</DIRECTION>
<CO_PILOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God above, WE'RE ALIVE!! WE'RE ALIVE!! WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CO_PILOT>
<DIRECTION>
Shot of all the occupants, ending with Russell. Suddenly, the alternative seems far more attractive. We hear Rod Stewart's "Jo's Lament" as music plays over their still-shocked faces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUPELO AIRPORT CORRIDOR -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Music continues, as they walk together like ghosts in a long and very pregnant silence, ignoring the kid. Everything is different now. The kid peels off and throws up in a dumpster. We continue with the band, unhappily moving forward. William hustles back to catch up. They ignore him. There are much bigger thoughts in play. No one wants to speak.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I think we can build on this new honesty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Boom. Russell attacks him, and they're pulled apart. The band continues moving forward, arriving at a fork in the airport terminals. William stops. This is where he must part company. He stands at the mouth of the next terminal, as the band continues, unaware he's split off. He watches their backs, they've forgotten him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Russell turns, sensing something missing. William. All now stop and turn. Still shell-shocked, they summon a pre- occupied but heartfelt goodbye. William waves. Music continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON AIRPLANE DEPARTURE SCHEDULE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William's finger finds San Francisco.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAB -- SAN FRANCISCO -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kid checks the address as he arrives at the MJB Building, and its next-door neighbor, the San Francisco headquarters of Rolling Stone Magazine. He still wears the same clothes from last night in New York.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROLLING STONE MAGAZINE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William arrives at the front desk, gets the once-over from a friendly RECEPTIONIST, a paragon of new cool.
</DIRECTION>
<RECEPTIONIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave your package at the desk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RECEPTIONIST>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not a messenger. I'm one of your writers. William Miller.

</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
He is zombie-tired, with heavy duffel case and his orange bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROLLING STONE OFFICES -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William walks down the center aisle. Editors and writers look at him, standing at the front of their cubicles to see this exhausted 15 year-old writer. At the end of the aisle, like a human finish line, stand Ben Fong-Torres.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're William Miller?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
The secret emerges not with a bang but with a slight and tired nod of the head.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(putting it all together)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Ben leads him into the office of Jann Wenner, the editor- publisher.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JANN WENNER'S OFFICE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William sits. Editors are feverishly discussing the next issue. The big concerns of a national magazine are in the air. Everyone is focused and quick. The conversation is machine- gun like. Jann Werner turns to the kid.
</DIRECTION>
<JANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't run this piece.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANN>
<DIRECTION>
The kid's eyes travel to his story -- a stack of fuzzy-looking sheets on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You obviously saw more than you wrote about. After eight days on the road with these guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DAVID_FELTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't anything happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID_FELTON>
<JANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And where are you in this piece? What did you want to write? Because this reads like what they wanted you to write.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANN>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to your highly-touted think piece on limitations of a middle- level Band in the face of success?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
William sits speechless. It's sinking in. Failure. Conversation continues at a fast pace:
</DIRECTION>

	We can push up Chet's Who cover -
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANN>
<FACT_CHECKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good 'cause it's going to take me three days to get through this research. It's all handwritten, on little slips. Plus, they all refer to woman as "chicks." I mean, as a woman I have a problem with that. I know it's a side issue.

INT. BIG OFFICE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William sits in the "big" office. It's a small white tank. After all the sound and fury, there is only the hum of a large electric typewriter. His research, transcripts and some band photos sit nearby. He takes a bite of a candy bar, a sip of coffee. He looks at the phone.

Crazy jazz is playing. Lester Bangs on the phone.

	I know. Even when I though I was, I knew I wasn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<LESTER_BANGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's because we are uncool! And while women will always be a problem for guys like us, most of the great art in the world is about that very problem. Good-looking people have no spine! Their art never lasts! They get the girls, but we're smarter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER_BANGS>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can really see that now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<LESTER_BANGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, great art is about conflict and pain and guilt and longing and love disguised as sex, and sex disguised as love... and let's face it, you got a big head start.

	Yeah.

The girls still circle Russell nearby. He's unaware.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You believe these new girls? None of 'em take birth control, and they eat all the steak.

She looks sadly at her plate of vegetables. An ever-sharp mind in last night's clothes, she commands Russell's respect.
</DIRECTION>
<SAPPHIRE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They don't even know what it id to be a fan! To blindly love some silly piece of music... or some band so much that it hurts... please, they're all just after the money. Shoo --

	Is Penny okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<SAPPHIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Quaalude Incident. Yeah, it wasn't pretty. She could have died. I always warned her about letting too many guys fall in love with her. I guess I was wrong.

<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On of 'em saved her life.

Russell nods.

<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's finally over with Leslie. I'm going to call her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<SAPPHIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let her retire.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he doesn't respond)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to lock her up in a house in Michigan? Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he doesn't respond)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Write her a song someday. She deserves it. Something about that girl brought out the best in a lot of...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks around backstage)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... pretty average people. She deserves it...

Russell stares into his crew meal, nodding a little.
</DIRECTION>
<SAPPHIRE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (forward thinking)

	<DIALOGUE>
	... because something tells me twenty years from now, we'll remember her... and not much else.

<DIRECTION>
Russell smiles to himself, knows it's true. Dick passes, placing hands on Russell's shoulders, massaging a little.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have a good vacation. I hope the band stays together. Before it all went down the shitter, it was starting to get really good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<DIRECTION>
Dick claps Russell on the back, and moves on. He turns to Sapphire.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going to blame myself. I do make people happy. They just shouldn't get to know me... 'cause it appears to spoil everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<SAPPHIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be so easy on yourself.

INT. SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William moves like a zombie through the airport, and collapses in a seat. He sits still in the crowded flow of human traffic. A cluster of Flight Attendants pass. One stops, a stylish young woman wearing a tall bubble-shaped PSA hat with swirling colors.
</DIRECTION>
<ANITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	William?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANITA>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her. He feels like he's on Mars, and she looks like a Martian.

	You guys, I'll deadhead back later. I think I'm needed.

Anita looks in her brother's face.
</DIRECTION>
<ANITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look awful, but that's great. You're living your life! You're finally free of... her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANITA>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<ANITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. I'll take off work. Let's have an adventure together. You and me, finally. Anywhere you want to go. Anywhere in the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANITA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WILLIAM'S HOME -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William whistles the family whistle. Sister and brother trudge up the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<ANITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is not my idea of a good time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANITA>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just get me to my bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<ANITA>
<DIRECTION>
(resigned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll deal with her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANITA>
<DIRECTION>
William whistles again. Mom meets them at the door. She looks at her trashed son who has finally come home. For the first time, she hugs Anita first, and it's not lost on Anita.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a clumsy neck-hug, neither wanting to commit. The kid passes to his Mother's left, with suitcase, intentionally nudging her into his sister. Anita takes this as an aggressive act of love, and hugs her mother back. Tears stream down Mom's face. Their cheeks touch. Mom pulls away, and sees her own tears on Anita's face. Thinking that she's also crying, she grabs a tissue for them both.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELAINE'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kid stands in the hallway listening, shaking his head, poised to enter his room, unseen by them.
</DIRECTION>
<ANITA>
<DIRECTION>
(so worried)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are we going to do about him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANITA>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Whatever happened to him, I just wish it could have happened to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<ANITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The magazine killed his story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANITA>
<DIRECTION>
Now they really hug, Anita gulping back real tears. William watches them bonding over the oddest thing - his failure. William goes into the bedroom, the final three feet to sleep, and shuts the door. A hand places a hotel sign on the door - DO NOT DISTURB. Slight push in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He collapses with all his clothes on, almost instantly asleep. His walls, just as he left them, boast a pantheon of rock heroes... with a very lonely Abraham Lincoln (or Atticus Finch) in the center.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROLLING STONE OFFICES -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator doors ding open, and out walks Russell Hammond. The Secretary has just finished answering the phone, "Straight Arrow Publishers." She puts the caller on hold.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, I'm Russel Hammond.

INT. EDITORIAL OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Russell stands with the editors, observing the fine portraits on the walls. He's behind enemy lines, and he knows it. Everything in the room fascinates him.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care what happens. I don't care if you put us on the cover. But you sent us a kid and... and he was a fan. And we all made friends with him - absolutely, to get a good story. But then we actually liked him. We thought he's... show us our lives in some mythic way and I guess... we're not mythic. We panicked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<JANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You denied most of the story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANN>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, here's the problem with the truth. It's too true -
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we appreciate the visit. The last time an artist came here, it was Buddy Miles and he punched me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not punching anybody. I am personally, as of 2 pm yesterday, on a voyage of self-reinvention. This is about William Miller.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(counting off fingers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He lives with us, he lost his virginity, he saw us at our worst, appreciated our best, he saved two lives, including mine... he smuggled about a half-pound of pot into Boston, and we never even told him -
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Nearby, David Felton looks at another editor, raising an eyebrow.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- we told him too much, we told him everything... He almost died with us over Tupelo... if the band survives him, it'll be a miracle... but you know, he tried to keep up, and that's a journalist to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<JANN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's too late. We're going with a different cover.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANN>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
(immediately)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
But Russell looks around at the numerous portraits if dead legendary rock stars, fixing on the one photo closest to all of them, a very vulnerable-looking Janis Joplin. A second thought.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You tell me it's too late. But I could go back to my hotel room and... and O.D. tonight and something tells me you'd find a way to put me on the cover of the next issue. Am I right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at their faces. They cannot disagree.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm learning the game.

	We fucked up. We made friends with him.

</RUSSELL>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next time we'll all be more professional.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe so.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat, an odd thought)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But God forbid, the day comes when selling yourself is as important as the music you make.

(rueful, to Hendrix on the wall)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You might have died at the right time, my friend.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Russell stands outside, a traveling man with no where to go. Oddly, and in a way that surprises him, the world begins to speak to him again... little noises everywhere, turning into a music of its own. It's a beautiful and compelling "silence." He thrusts his hands deep in his pockets, and takes a breath of life. His head filling again with the music of the world, he begins to walk down the street. Very naturally, and quite randomly, he is noticed by young passersby. They can't help it. He looks like a star. They can't quite figure out who it is, but it's someone, and they begin to follow him down the street. Unbeknownst to him as he walks along, deep in thought, a small crowd begins to form... following him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BREAKFAST TABLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A quiet kitchen. Anita has been cooking. A substantial breakfast has been placed on the table. Sausage, orange juice... and now Anita sets down a plate of pancakes, with syrup and butter, in front of her mother. William watches his mother facing an old enemy - white sugar.
</DIRECTION>
<ANITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're called pancakes. Who knows when we'll be together again. Splurge. It's what most people call breakfast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANITA>

Mom looks at her children, and takes a breath.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I went through your records. And I found a song to play for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to the stereo and puts on a record. The two children eye each other - what's coming next? (Song to be chosen) The two kids eye each other again. Self-consciously avoiding their gaze, Mom sits and toys with her breakfast. It's a song she clearly wants them to hear. It's a song from the heart. They look at her, amazed. Elaine looks up, regards her family. Somehow they're back at this table. They continue eating breakfast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SIDEWALK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bam. A bundle of bound Rolling Stone Magazines lands on the newsstand pavement with a thud. Someone reaches in to cut the cord, as the magazines puff up into view. It's the new issue, with Russell Hammond on the cover. The title: Stillwater Runs Deep. Just another stack of magazines waiting to be places in the racks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Music segues to Led Zeppelin's "Four Sticks." Penny Lane's sleeping Polaroid shots of our characters, featuring a few self-portraits.

THE END
