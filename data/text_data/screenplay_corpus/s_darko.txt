EXT. WHEAT FIELD - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAMANTHA DARKO (18) opens her eyes. She squints as the summer sun shrinks her pupils to pinhole size. She sits up slowly, looks around... and finds herself in midst of an endless wheat field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is pretty and demure. Her coppery hair flows past her shoulders. Disoriented, she stands and gazes at the infinite golden shimmer. Amber waves of grain. Patches of forest in the distance. It's quiet. Serene. Beautiful...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles, and starts walking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARKANSAS HIGHWAY 40 - MORNING
</DIRECTION>

She emerges at the shoulder of a rural stretch of highway in Arkansas. Adjacent to her position, on the other side of the deserted lanes, is a TRUCK STOP.

EXT. TRUCK STOP - MORNING

<DIRECTION>
Amongst the TRACTOR-TRAILERS parked in the back lot is a white, late-80s model CHEVROLET CELEBRITY. Sam makes her way across the asphalt toward the vehicle...

INT. COREY'S CHEVROLET - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COREY RICHARDSON (18) is asleep, curled up in the reclined driver's seat of the car. She awakens when Sam gets in on the passenger side and slams the door shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey has the look of a typical rebellious teen: dyed hair, piercings, a little grungy. She rubs the sleep from her eyes, greeting the new day with something less than enthusiasm. She finds a soft pack of CIGARETTES and lights one.
</DIRECTION>

Corey adjusts her seat. She takes a long drag and chokes, then spits out the window. She starts the car...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. COREY'S CHEVROLET/HIGHWAY 40, VARIOUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey's car cruises along the flat, open road. She cranks up the VOLUME on the car's CASSETTE DECK, nodding her head to early-90s ALT. ROCK (suggestion: Into Dust, by Mazzy Star)...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam looks out the window at the passing scenery: FARMERS at work in the fields; a BILLBOARD advertising a local restaurant; ROADSIDE DITCHES filled with trash...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She fixates on a MINIVAN travelling in the slow lane. It contains the all-American NUCLEAR FAMILY: MOTHER, FATHER and three SIBLINGS, one of them being a YOUNGSTER. The Youngster makes a face at Sam as they pass by...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COREY'S CHEVROLET - LATER - DAY

Corey glances at the CONTROL PANEL when she HEARS the engine start to RATTLE. She sees that the TEMPERATURE GAUGE has hit the red and her CHECK ENGINE LIGHT is on.

EXT. OKLAHOMA HIGHWAY 40/COREY'S CHEVROLET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By the time they pull over on the side of the empty highway, steam billows out from under the hood. Sam gets out of the car to check on it while Corey remains behind the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam peeks under the hood, trying to clear the air of the steam. It sounds like someone is rhythmically TAPPING the inside of the engine with a hammer.

<DIRECTION>
Sam looks up when she HEARS a PICK-UP TRUCK coming toward them. Corey watches as she steps out to wave it down...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pick-up pulls over ahead of them. CHRIS HOLT (24), a brawny, attractive young man, gets out. When Corey sees him she gets out too.

INT./EXT. CHRIS' TRUCK/EL RENO, VARIOUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All three crammed into the cab of the pick-up, they drive through the center of El Reno, Oklahoma (population 16,000) and see some of the locals out and about [MUSIC MONTAGE fueled by early- to mid-90s era GRUNGE ROCK (suggestion: Come As You Are, by Nirvana) -- reminiscent of the `Middlesex Middle School Montage' in DONNIE DARKO]:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AGATHA DOWDY (54), an employee of the local DINER, sits on a bench in front of the establishment smoking a cigarette. The manager, TED MONCTON (50), calls her back inside...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RANDY EVANS (21), RUTH GIBBENS (18) and JEFF (21) and MIKE JIMENEZ (20) loiter in the parking lot of a LIQUOR STORE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRUDY POTTER (39) flirts with FATHER HOMEIJER (54), a Catholic priest, outside the BANK. A BANK SIGN shows the TIME -- 12:00 PM -- then flashes to the DATE -- JUNE 18, 1995...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OFFICER RYAN O'DELL (31) has pulled over a PRETTY LADY and uses his uniform to impress more than intimidate...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They come up on VIETNAM TOM (48), who ambles along the side of the road against traffic, and he waves to them as they pass. He wears old, weather beaten clothes and a multi- colored SKI MASK over his head and face...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
[END MONTAGE]
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam swivels her head to watch Tom. ANOTHER CAR passes and he waves to it as well. Chris picks up on her curiosity.

<CHRIS>

Sam continues to stare until he disappears out of sight... PAN DOWN to a PUDDLE by the side of the road. As a CAR TIRE splashes through it, PAN UP TO FIND:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dusty's auto repair shop, which is nothing more than a big garage attached to his old two-story house. Corey's car has been towed there, and DUSTY GIBBENS (37; father of Ruth Gibbens), the lone mechanic, tinkers around under the hood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam and Corey sit on the front steps of the house waiting, bored as hell. A PIT BULL laps at a nameless treat wedged into a crack in the walkway. The girls are forced to get up when Ruth (from outside the liquor store) comes to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I get out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<DIRECTION>
Sam and Corey move so that she can exit the house. Ruth's look is hardened, rough around the edges -- she appears older than her 18 years.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girls watch as she enters the garage to see her father. She whispers something in his ear, and Dusty hands her some CASH, which she pockets then kisses him on the cheek. After this, Dusty wipes his hands on his greasy jeans and comes outside to address Corey and Sam.
</DIRECTION>
<DUSTY>

INT. MOTEL LOBBY - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phil Coulter (48), the proprietor of a dingy little roadside motel, looks up from a hardcover copy of Stephen King's GERALD'S GAME when the girls enter. They each have a SMALL SUITCASE and a BACKPACK in tow.

EXT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam and Corey arrive at the liquor store, which is down the street from the motel. Ruth, Randy Evans, and Jeff and Mike Jimenez are loitering in the parking lot in a similar fashion to how they were earlier in the day.
</DIRECTION>
<RUTH>

<RANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be right back...

</RANDY>

After he's gone, there's an uncomfortable moment of silence in which Mike and Jeff ogle the girls mischievously. Ruth stares at them in a different way. She seems somewhat resentful of their presence.

EXT. BANK - LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The clock on the BANK SIGN shows 3:30 AM -- then flashes to -- JUNE 19, 1995... It changes again, this time to a countdown to the JULY 4TH FIREWORKS CELEBRATION: 15 DAYS, 17 HOURS, 29 MINUTES, 57 SECONDS... 56 SECONDS... 55 SECONDS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam awakens suddenly from a nightmare. She lies atop the blankets wearing a T-SHIRT and BOXER SHORTS. She looks over and sees Corey passed out on the other full-size bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO PLASTIC CUPS, EMPTY SODA CANS, and the BOTTLE are on the nightstand between them, the liquor partially consumed. There's a digital CLOCK/RADIO that reads 3:30 AM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TV is on, and a late night INFOMERCIAL for the GEORGE FOREMAN GRILL plays. Sam stares at the screen as the images WARP and RIPPLE in a way that coincides with an increasingly loud, rumbling TREMOR from outside...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a daze, she gets up and slowly walks closer to the television. She reaches out with her RIGHT HAND, about to touch it... A strange, abrupt HARD CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRASSY FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is in a grassy field behind the motel, moving away from the building. She wears a HOODED SWEATSHIRT, JEANS, and her RIGHT HAND is wrapped in some sort of MAKESHIFT BANDAGE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a GASH in the side of her forehead by her temple, with what looks to be a SHARD OF METAL partially embedded under the skin and protruding from the wound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is without expression, and her movements are rhythmic and fluid. A tall AERMOTOR WINDMILL towers in the distance...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - THE GRASSY FIELD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A glimpse of the field through Sam's eyes shows a phosphorescent PLANE OF DESTINY -- an intricate grid in which objects organic and inorganic dwell in assigned positions, and move according to a framework of set paths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A JACKRABBIT follows a silvery VECTOR SPEAR like prophetic life-gel to its burrow... COSMIC ENERGY burns around a CLUSTER OF STONES... Miniature VECTOR SPEARS lead a SWARM OF INSECTS around in a circle and then BUZZING right past Sam's field of vision...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's infinitely complex, but Sam sees through it clearly. She has no vector spear of her own to guide her, but she is cognizant of her path... She moves toward the WINDMILL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WINDMILL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam appears at the foot of the windmill tower. A giant WATER TANK squats beside it. Remaining stoic, she looks up and sees Vietnam Tom sitting atop the windmill platform, more than 30 feet up, staring back down at her through the eyes holes of his ski mask...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE: WINDMILL PLATFORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom peers over the edge of the small platform, the surface of which is littered with TATTERED CLOTHING, a WATER BOTTLE, CANS OF FOOD and SCRAPS OF A TARP. He cradles a RIFLE in his arms...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His focus shifts from what is at the foot of the windmill to what is sitting right beside him --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVEAL Sam. Her legs dangle over the side of the platform, and she stares off into distance.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The sky's so beautiful here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Tom looks in the direction that she stares and then back at her. Sam turns to meet his gaze...

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we can't stay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - VIETNAM TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam sees through to the core of his physical being, the DYNAMIC CENTER of which lingers pulsating in a translucent circle around his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Magnified NEURONS in TOM'S BRAIN send ELECTRIC IMPULSES that release NEUROTRANSMITTERS, which excite OTHER NEURONS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom slowly reaches out to touch Sam, but an invisible FORCE FIELD makes contact impossible. RIPPLES swell throughout the clear plasma-like barrier from where he touched it, and his hand remains glued to the spot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam extends her bandaged right hand, and presses it to Vietnam Tom's as if she were touching a mirrored image of herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The contact generates more RIPPLES, and as TREMORS begin to shake the windmill a DISTORTED VOICE echoes throughout the COSMOS:
</DIRECTION>
<DISTORTED_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	15 days... 18 hours... 45 minutes... 6 seconds. That is when the world will end.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DISTORTED_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
A CYLINDRICAL PORTAL opens up below them, gaping and swirling like God's eye on the mouth of a liquid tornado. As Sam and Tom stand in unison to peer into it, a HEXAGONAL PLATE OF WHITE LIGHT emanates from within --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BELOW WINDMILL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They appear near the foot of the windmill, sprinting away from it together. Tom has his rifle, and he looks up to the sky as he runs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...there's a brilliant flash of GREEN LIGHT -- deafening THUNDER -- a blinding EXPLOSION --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUS STOP - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam awakens to the morning sun blinding her. She struggles to peer through the harsh whiteness at a looming figure that stands over her. Her eyes adjust to discover that it's a policeman -- Officer O'Dell.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER_O_DELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	`Fraid you can't sleep here, miss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER_O_DELL>
<DIRECTION>
Sam sits up and realizes she's on a bench at a bus stop near the side of the road. O'Dell's tone is innocuous, and when she looks up at him again she sees that he's grinning.
</DIRECTION>

INT./EXT. O'DELL'S CRUISER/MOTEL - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
O'Dell's cruiser pulls into the motel parking lot, which is uncharacteristically full. A FIRE TRUCK is parked by the side of the road. Just then, a call comes in on the POLICE RADIO:
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRASSY FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where the towering windmill once stood is now only a CRATER about 5 feet deep and 10 feet in diameter, with charred bits of wood and metal strewn everywhere. GROUND WATER spurts from the broken WELL SEAL...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And a cantaloupe-sized METEORITE sits in the center of the crater.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two FIREMEN haul out the meteorite with gloved hands as Sam and O'Dell arrive on the scene. Corey is already there looking on, as well as Chris Holt, who gave them a ride into town, Phil Coulter from the motel, and other local CITIZENS. FRANK HALEY (54), the farmer who owns the land, is fuming.

Sam turns and peers up at the WATER TANK. It's marred by BURN MARKS and DENTS from the explosion. As she tilts her head and looks closer, she can almost pick out a shape created by the damage -- a negative image like the Shroud of Turin...

...in the form of a bizarre, toothy-grinned FACE OF A GIANT MONSTER BUNNY.

EXT. JUNKYARD - DAY

Vietnam Tom explores a cluttered junkyard, gathering materials. He scours amongst the PILES OF REFUSE, RUSTY MACHINES and crumbling STORAGE SHACKS.

He bends to pick up a SCRAP OF METAL and adds it to a collection he's making in a worn SATCHEL...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DINER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Sam and Corey are about to enter the diner, Trudy Potter, a bank teller, is on her way out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girls move to the side so she can exit, and take notice of a MISSING PERSONS SIGN posted next to the door -- BILLY MOORCROFT'S (10) dark, empty eyes stare at them from the BLACK & WHITE PHOTOGRAPH.

Sam is impressed, but something about her subdued reaction exhibits reservations... Just then, Agatha Dowdy arrives with plates of BURGERS AND FRIES.

Agatha moves off, and Sam and Corey start to dig into their food...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Momentarily, someone else enters and takes a seat at the counter by their booth. It's Jeremy Frame, the driver of the BMW. He raises a finger to alert Ted of his presence.
</DIRECTION>
<JEREMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a coffee, please.
	</DIALOGUE>

Ted nods and pours him a cup... After he receives his coffee, Jeremy turns and stares at the girls. They both notice him doing it, but Corey is the first to speak.

Sam glances up at Jeremy, expecting him to be hurt or embarrassed by Corey's snub. But he's not. He's smiling at her, and she can't help but smile back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FATHER HOMEIJER'S HOUSE/CHURCH - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Each licking an ICE CREAM CONE, Corey and Sam walk past the home of Father Homeijer. The priest is outside working in his flower garden, wearing his CLERICAL COLLAR. An old CATHOLIC CHURCH rests on the same lot as his house, looming behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Father Homeijer sees the girls walking by, he rises from his work, takes off his gloves and wipes sweat from his forehead. Sam and Corey both notice him eyeballing them.
</DIRECTION>
<COREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's his problem?

</COREY>

EXT. JUNKYARD, STORAGE SHACK - AFTERNOON

EXT. LIQUOR STORE - LATER - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Having finished their ice creams, the girls pass the liquor store on the way back to the motel. They find Randy, Ruth, Jeff and Mike at their usual post.

<RANDY>

</RANDY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BACKYARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The party at Randy's teems with LOCALS, ages ranging from early teens to late-20s. On the back deck is a KEG OF BEER and a BOOMBOX blasting MUSIC. There's a slimy-looking POOL, and a few people swim in the greenish water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy and Ruth make their rounds as a pair. They stop off so Ruth can sell a BAG OF WEED to some eager KIDS. Corey and Sam hang with Mike and Jeff, drinking beer.
</DIRECTION>
<COREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys gotta come visit the club when we get all set up. We'll give you the VIP treatment, man...

</COREY>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Definitely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Corey is relaxed, enjoying their newfound friends, while Sam appears more out of place. She drains the better part of her cup for some liquid courage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy and Ruth converge back on the group just as Officer O'Dell creeps into the backyard wearing plainclothes. Ruth notices him first.
</DIRECTION>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck.

</RUTH>
<RANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>

<RUTH>

</RUTH>
<RANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry about Ryan. He might be a cop, but he still likes to party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Randy's theory is proven when O'Dell takes a FLASK from his pocket and has a snort before approaching a pair of TEENAGE GIRLS... But Ruth is still not satisfied.
</DIRECTION>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think that asshole knows I deal. You know how fucked that is?
	</DIALOGUE>

Sam bends to wipe some of the water from her pants. Ruth watches her, smirking.

<RANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We might as well all go in now, we're already wet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDY>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good idea...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<DIRECTION>
Without warning, Ruth shoves Sam backwards into the pool --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE: BENEATH THE WATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sinks into the murky water in SLOW-MOTION. All SOUNDS are DROWNED OUT and everything is tranquil, completely detached.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through her blurred vision, Sam can see Randy's PORCH LIGHTS glimmering beyond the surface of the water... TRANSITION TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SPOT LIGHTS are blinding from the perspective of the STAGE. Through the WHITE BLUR an auditorium full of PEOPLE can been seen...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In SLOW-MOTION and perfect synchronicity, YOUNG SAMANTHA (11) and the "SPARKLE MOTION" GIRLS are in the midst of their dance performance... BACK TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BACKYARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HAND reaches into the pool, grabs onto Sam's arm and pulls her up --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She breaches the surface of the water, gasping for breath -- back to reality. She sees that Randy is the one responsible for pulling her out.
</DIRECTION>
<RANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fall asleep down there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDY>
<DIRECTION>
He, Ruth and the others are looking down at her, laughing. Sam is lost in thought, struck by her vision...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She snaps out of it when she sees Corey tear off her top and jump into the pool beside her. Many of the PARTYGOERS hoot in approval, and Randy, Mike and Jeff strip down and leap in right behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam swims toward the far side of the pool where the steps are, and fewer people. When she arrives there, she's surprised to find Chris Holt waiting for her with a towel.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thought you could maybe use this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
As Chris hands her the towel, he notices a wide SCAR on the inside of Sam's RIGHT WRIST... but doesn't mention it. Sam wraps the towel around her sopping wet body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey looks over and sees her getting out...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, PORCH - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Chris and Sam stand by the keg with fresh beers.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. RANDY'S HOUSE, SIDE ENTRANCE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam finds a STOOP at the side of the house where she can be alone. She can HEAR the PARTY going on in the backyard, but no one else is in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still soaking wet, she plants herself on the stoop and starts to pound the rest of her drink...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A strange, abrupt HARD CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF RANDY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam lies in the middle of the street in front of Randy's. A lone, flickering STREET LIGHT intermittently bathes her in an orange glow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is completely dry, wearing her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and JEANS, with the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE wrapped around her right hand. The SHARD OF METAL protrudes from the GASH in her forehead...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CAR suddenly screams right past her prostrate form, missing her by inches. She sits up slowly and looks toward the front of Randy's house, which is about 20 yards away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - DRUNK GUYS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two DRUNK GUYS exit the house and enter the complex, phosphorescent grid that is Sam's field of vision. VECTOR SPEARS jut from their chests and precede all their movements as they open the gas tank of a PARKED CAR, insert a SIPHON, and begin to drain the gas into ANOTHER VEHICLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DRUNK_GUY_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hurry up...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRUNK_GUY_1>
<DIRECTION>
Although she is close by, they take no notice of Sam whatsoever. ANOTHER CAR speeds by, again nearly crushing her, but she doesn't flinch...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stands, and turns deliberately to face the opposite side of the road where, unlike the Drunk Guys, there is someone who is completely focused on her -- Vietnam Tom crouches in a DITCH near a CULVERT --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE: CULVERT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam appears with him in the tenebrous ditch. Tom stares at her wide-eyed through the eyeholes of his ski mask.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From one end of the broad, open culvert they can see straight through to the other side...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PORTAL starts to take shape within, swirling around the circumference. Soft, BLUE LIGHT touches their faces from the phosphorescent glow, and a gust of WIND is nearly strong enough to make them falter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the opposite end of the culvert, a PLATE OF WHITE LIGHT flashes for an instant then transforms into an image of FATHER HOMEIJER'S CHURCH --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHURCH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom and Sam stand outside the church. The STEEPLE reigns over them. Sam is stoic as she watches Tom climb the STONE STEPS and approach the great WOOD DOORS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHURCH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam sits like a statue in one of the PEWS. Tom strides past her in a daze, moving toward the PULPIT...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beside the ALTAR stand THREE BARE CROSSES in imitation of Calvary, each standing over 4 feet tall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam looks up to a HIGH CORNER, above the pulpit to the right, where two walls and the ceiling meet...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - CONVERGENCE POINT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three planes come together at an irregular angle, with the WALL ON THE RIGHT SIDE SLANTING INWARD, and the CEILING SLOPING SLIGHTLY DOWNWARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHOSPHORESCENCE burns in the three queerly pitches lines, with a concentration of heightened energy at the juncture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A VECTOR SPEAR bulges from Vietnam Tom's chest where he stands below it, reaching higher and higher...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Tom's SPEAR gets closer to the convergence point, the BIZARRE ANGLING becomes more exaggerated because the planes start to DIP and SWELL with impossible elasticity --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE: BETWEEN THE WALLS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam and Tom find themselves squeezed between the inner and outer walls. Claustrophobic, dusty and obscure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dilapidated WIRING snakes around them, and Tom barely has enough space to reach forth and touch it with his finger...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COSMIC ENERGY jolts through the WIRE. A SPARK. A BLUE FLAME...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heat and pressure build. The old dry wood begins to CREAK and SNAP -- FADE TO WHITE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVER WHITE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SHARP SOUNDS echo and fade away... then become present again. Louder now, and different. A BANGING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - THE NEXT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam pulls back the CURTAIN OF WHITE -- a SHEET over her face. She's lying on the floor of the motel room in between the beds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's alone, and naked except for the sheet. Her WET CLOTHES are in a heap beside her. Her head is throbbing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She scrambles to put something on so she can get the DOOR...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - MOMENTS LATER - DAY

Having thrown on some wrinkled clothes, Sam opens the door to find Phil, the motel owner. He does not look pleased.

Sam approaches the bank, and when she sees the tall SIGN with the digital clock, she stops and stares up at it. It strikes a chord but she doesn't know why...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sign reads 12:48 PM -- and then -- JUNE 20, 1995. It changes to the FIREWORKS COUNTDOWN: 14 DAYS, 8 HOURS, 11 MINUTES, 22 SECONDS... 21 SECONDS...

INT. BANK - DAY

Sam enters the small bank, and as she approaches the counter she sees that Trudy Potter is in tears. Some of her FEMALE CO- WORKERS are consoling her.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's no secret to me how people in this town feel about Father Homeijer. The horrible accusations that have been made against him... But it's just a lot of nonsense. El Reno's changed so much since I was a kid growing up here. The young people nowadays...

	I need to check my balance and get my money out. How do I do that?

ANGLE: NEAR EXIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she's on her way out, she notices a BULLETIN BOARD with another MISSING PERSONS SIGN for BILLY MOORCROFT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stands before the picture, staring into the young boy's dark, empty eyes. Though it's just a low quality black & white photo, Billy's face emotes profound hopelessness and despair.

EXT. BANK - DAY

INT./EXT. RANDY'S CAR - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey rides shotgun in Randy's car, chewing on some greasy FAST FOOD, looking quite content. Randy is behind the wheel with a BEER in his hand, and Mike, Jeff and Ruth are packed into the back, passing around a JOINT.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many cheeseburgers did we get?

Everyone in the car is stunned into momentary silence when they turn a corner and see what's left of the church.

POV FROM THE CAR - THE CHURCH RUINS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POLICE and FIREMEN swarm. Father Homeijer stands with Officer O'Dell, gazing at the soggy ruins. The only things standing amid the charred mess are the THREE BARE CROSSES of Mount Calvary. But they aren't completely intact --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHURCH RUINS - CONTINUOUS - ANGLE ON - DEFORMED CROSSES

All three are bent drastically forward, sagging down toward the murky ground...

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Musta' melted from the heat.

</OFFICER_O_DELL>
<DIRECTION>
Father Homeijer looks down at the metamorphosis, beside himself with bitterness and sorrow.

<FATHER_HOMEIJER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're made of silver-plated steel. A simple fire couldn't do that.

	This is an extension of Satan's own hand... I've seen it coming.

Rolling his eyes, O'Dell walks away, leaving the priest to grieve for his church in private.

EXT. JUNKYARD, STORAGE SHACK - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vietnam Tom continues to toil over his SCULPTURE, but progress has been made...

It has begun to take on a recognizable form: a GROTESQUE COUNTENANCE with TWO LONG EARS, BULGING EYES and a devilish, TOOTHY GRIN...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RANDY'S CAR/STREET IN FRONT OF DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is walking in front of a DEPARTMENT STORE when Randy's car pulls up beside her. Corey sticks her head out the passenger side window.
</DIRECTION>
<COREY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	The motel guy came to the room this morning all pissed off. We're probably not even gonna have enough money to pay for the car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Corey sighs, debating weather or not to get out. Before she can reach a decision, something in the department store's parking lot catches her eye: a LITTLE BOY with dark hair, wearing a BIRTHDAY HAT...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But she blinks and he's gone, having disappeared between two parked vehicles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Confused, Corey rubs her eyes and gets out of the car.
</DIRECTION>

Corey gets out and shuts the door. Randy speeds off toward an intersection about 20 yards ahead...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris is at work, stocking shelves inside the department store...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He checks his watch, stops what he's doing and grabs a PACK OF CIGARETTES from his breast pocket -- time for a smoke break.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam and Corey meander toward the intersection where Randy's car is stopped at a red light.

<COREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll go home and get the shit kicked out of me, and get my ass grabbed by my mom's boyfriend...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COREY>
<DIRECTION>
They're almost to the light, which is still red, and coming up on Randy's car. Jeff, Mike and Ruth stare out at them from the backseat, smelling the drama.
</DIRECTION>
<COREY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew you'd bail on me eventually, but not this quick.

<COREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can fucking sleepwalk back to Middlesex for all I care. I'm not driving you... you're a fucking drag.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COREY>
<DIRECTION>
The light turns green, and Randy's car peels across the intersection, making a left...
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you, Corey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Sam wheels on her and steps out into the street, storming straight across. Corey starts to follow... but something stops her in her tracks: BILLY MOORCROFT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands on the opposite side of the intersection, in the trajectory that Sam is walking -- but Sam doesn't see him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Billy wears a BIRTHDAY HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT. He looks pale and weak, and is covered with BRUISES. He stares right back at Corey, as transfixed as she is... TIME SLOWS DOWN. [Note: Sam's position is in the middle of the road. Randy's car has made the left but is still in the vicinity of the intersection.]
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bewildered, Corey tries to step out into the street but something blocks her -- an invisible FORCE FIELD makes forward progress impossible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RIPPLES swell like waves throughout the barrier where she hit it. She looks up, following the ripples with her eyes, and watches as they disappear beyond her realm of vision, into infinite space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches forth with her hand, wanting to feel the barrier once again... Just as she touches it... REAL TIME RESUMES --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KA-BOOM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM OUT OF NOWHERE AN OLD JALOPY SAILS RIGHT IN FRONT RANDY'S CAR! He jerks the wheel -- and the JALOPY hits on the front passenger side -- completely smashing it in --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam spins when she HEARS the deafening CRUNCH...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy careens into the opposite lane, and an ONCOMING CAR smacks him dead on. The inertia from the oncoming vehicle plows his car into a FIRE HYDRANT by the side of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- AND STRIKES SAM RIGHT IN THE HEAD!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The world goes SILENT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHRIS RUNS TOWARD THE DESTRUCTION, DROPPING HIS CIGARETTE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WATER ERUPTS LIKE A GEYSER FROM THE PIPE WHERE THE HYDRANT USED TO BE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM'S BODY IS CRUMPLED IN THE STREET, MOTIONLESS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY MOORCROFT IS GONE. THE FORCE FIELD IS GONE. COREY STANDS FROZEN, HORRIFIED... IN UTTER SHOCK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE STATION - AFTERNOON

Corey signs her STATEMENT on Officer O'Dell's desk, the expression of shock still glued to her face. O'Dell sits facing her.

He takes the statement from her.

	Can't you just look up the license plates?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COREY>
<OFFICER_O_DELL>

Corey seems somewhat hesitant to bring up the next subject:

O'Dell shifts in his chair.

EXT. POLICE STATION, BACK PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

<DIRECTION>
Corey walks out of the police station and finds herself in a secluded back parking lot. She holds a PRESCRIPTION for anti- depressants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is frightened when she notices a PAIR OF EYES staring at her from the bushes close by -- it's Vietnam Tom. He's wearing his ski mask and he's got his rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey backs away as Tom slowly creeps toward her... She's about to scream for help when Chris Holt comes out of the police station behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>

Corey gets out of the car and walks toward the motel room.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey swallows two of her PILLS with some liquor from a plastic cup. She sits down on one of the full-size beds where Sam's belongings are spread out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She opens Sam's backpack and discovers THE PHILOSOPHY OF TIME TRAVEL book, by Roberta Sparrow...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Corey studies the cover, her image is reflected by the CLOSET DOOR MIRRORS. The angle of the mirrors creates double image reflections for other objects in the room. Strangely, Corey's reflection is only present in one of the panes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The digital CLOCK/RADIO shows 6:30 PM...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are PICTURES of Sam's family tucked away inside the book, between the pages: Sam with her mother and father, ROSE and EDDIE DARKO; YOUNG SAM with ELIZABETH and DONNIE; an old photo of the whole Darko family together -- Young Sam holds ARIEL, a STUFFED TOY UNICORN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey removes the pictures and sets them on the nightstand... She then looks down and notices that the book is open to: CHAPTER THREE - THE FRAGMENTARY UNIVERSE.
</DIRECTION>
<COREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fragmentary Universe...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COREY>
<DIRECTION>
She pours over the text, some of which reads: When the fabric of the fourth dimension within a Tangent Universe becomes corrupted, a highly unstable and volatile Fragmentary Universe can occur, sustaining itself for no longer than several days... FADE TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey awakens to the sound of a little boy CRYING. She sits up in bed. The clock/radio reads 3:30 AM. The CRYING is faint but steady and sorrowful, and sounds as though it's coming from outside...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey follows the distinctive CRYING toward the VENDING MACHINES on the side of the building...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...until Billy Moorcroft emerges from behind them. Corey freezes a few feet away from the boy, who wears the BIRTHDAY HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT. He is pale and bruised.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey sees that he is not crying -- it's coming from elsewhere in the cosmos, far away. The WAILS taper off to a faint, DISTORTED WHISPER as Billy speaks:
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY_MOORCROFT>

Corey takes notice of the vending machines behind him. Where the prices should be, NUMBERS flash in a rhythm that seems to coincide with the ululations of the distant CRYING: 2... 10... 16... 44... -end-... 2... 10... 16... 44... -end-...

Corey looks over and sees Phil dressed in nightclothes, having come out of a room near the lobby. She's dumbstruck.

	Nothing... I-I don't know.

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey wanders through the aisles of the department store, looking peaked and jittery. She comes upon Chris stocking some shelves near the back of the store.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>

	Hey... how ya feelin'?

EXT. BEHIND THE DEPARTMENT STORE - LATER - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey waits on the cement steps by the loading dock. She shoots up when Chris comes out the back entrance with a PLASTIC BAG...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey takes it from him and looks inside: CANDY BARS, a BAG OF CHIPS, some PEANUTS, a pack of CIGARETTES.
</DIRECTION>
<COREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COREY>
<DIRECTION>
She tears open the cigarettes and lights one. Chris lights up one of his own, and notices Corey's hands are shaking.

<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shouldn't you go back home?

Corey looks conflicted, but she takes a harsh stance:

	What's the point? She's gone, that's it. Nothing's gonna change that...

INT. LIBRARY, MICROFICHE RESEARCH BOOTH - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey and Chris sit before a screen in a cramped, dim booth near the back of the library. They stare at a MICROFILM ARTICLE from 1988 about DONNIE DARKO'S DEATH.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was Sam's brother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<COREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.

</COREY>
<DIRECTION>
On the screen is a PHOTOGRAPH of the DARKO HOUSE with many PEOPLE gathered in front of it. A JET ENGINE is being lifted away by a CRANE.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her parents must be going through hell.

</CHRIS>
<COREY>

<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw something on Sam's wrist the other night... it looked like a scar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<COREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She told me it was from some accident. Put her hand through a window or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COREY>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you believe her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Corey doesn't answer. She pulls up ANOTHER ARTICLE, one that chronicles a MAN who was IMPALED BY A METAL PIPE with no known origin...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A THIRD ARTICLE is about a LITTLE GIRL who was DECAPITATED BY A MANHOLE COVER that was inexplicably flying through the air...
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Chris is horrified. Corey is totally engrossed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She brings up a FINAL ARTICLE that tells the story of a BOY who was CRUSHED BY A DUMPSTER that fell from the sky. A PICTURE shows his legs sticking out from under it like the Wicked Witch of the East when Dorothy's house fell on her in Munchkinland.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't understand why we're lookin' at this stuff.

</CHRIS>
<COREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They still never found a driver to that car that hit Randy... I was standing right there. I didn't see anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COREY>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was pretty close too, but everything was all crazy. Whoever it was must've jumped out and took off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<COREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I found this book in Sam's backpack last night. There's a chapter where it talks about stuff like this happening. Like a guy being killed by an arrow that nobody shot, and a swordsmith getting killed by a sword he hadn't made yet. Unexplainable things, but it says there's a reason why they happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COREY>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A book...? I don't get what your talkin' about. What was the reason?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<COREY>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. LIBRARY, FRONT DESK - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Chris and Corey are on the way out, they notice Jeremy Frame at the counter checking out a STACK OF BOOKS.

<DIRECTION>
In putting them down, he accidentally drops half of them onto the floor. He looks frazzled as he begins to pick them up, and he scratches compulsively at his LEFT FOREARM...

<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris and Corey pull up to Dusty's auto repair shop in Chris' truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They get out and start to walk up to the garage, but they're cut off by the unchained PIT BULL -- it's growling and barking in a frenzy --
</DIRECTION>
<RUTH>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darielle!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<DIRECTION>
The dog heels at the sound of the voice, and Ruth bolts out of the house and takes her by the collar. She's got a bandage over a cut on her forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<RUTH>

</DIRECTION>

	Come to check on your car?
	</DIALOGUE>

</COREY>
<DIRECTION>
Hearts still thumping in their chests, they follow Ruth into the garage... COREY'S CHEVROLET is parked in the same spot it was when she left it the other day. The hood is propped open.
</DIRECTION>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Randy's been a wreck since the accident.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<CHRIS>

	That's probably as much as the car's worth.

</CHRIS>
<DUSTY>

Chris' truck pulls up in front of the motel and parks. At the same time, Father Homeijer and Trudy come out of the FRONT OFFICE carrying a COLLECTIONS JAR.

INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Corey lays on her stomach in bed, her head buried in The Philosophy of Time Travel book. The TELEVISION is on in the b.g. (out of focus), playing a repeat of the FOREMAN GRILL INFOMERCIAL...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, there is a slight TREMOR from outside and RIPPLE runs over the TV screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey looks around, taking no notice of the odd change on the television -- instead of GEORGE FOREMAN'S VOICE, HULK HOGAN is HEARD promoting the brand new HULKSTER GRILL...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, there is a KNOCK at the door. She gets up to answer it and finds Randy -- he looks distraught.

INT./EXT. RANDY'S DAD'S CAR/LOOKOUT - NIGHT

RANDY'S DAD'S CAR navigates a DIRT ROAD up a WOODED HILL to a VANTAGE POINT where the whole of El Reno can be seen. SPARSE LIGHTS flicker over about 80 square miles of civilization.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are a few OTHER VEHICLES parked at the lookout, most containing COUPLES with MUSIC playing low.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy pulls into a more SECLUDED CLEARING, away from the other cars but still with a nice view.

Randy passes the joint to Corey and she hits it.

He passes her the joint.

I took two hits, and man... next thing I knew I was on the floor, curled up in ball, and Mike and Jeff were just standing there lookin' down at me.

</COREY>
<RANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can still slip back into it sometimes, but I know now that my brain is what's making it real... and that's like a blessing and a curse, man, `cause that means you have to decide what's real and what's not.

</RANDY>
<COREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The things that feel the most real right now are... impossible. More like a dream.

Corey passes him the joint and he stamps out the roach in the car's ashtray.

Mike, Jeff and Ruth sit on a ratty couch in Randy's living room, watching BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD on MTV. Some EMPTY BEER CANS and a HOMEADE BONG litter a coffee table. When the FRONT DOOR OPENS and Corey and Randy enter, none of them budge.

As Corey and Randy walk to Randy's bedroom, Ruth follows them with her eyes...

Randy shuts the door to his messy room. A TAPESTRY hangs from the ceiling. Corey is drawn to a DESK next to the bed. Above it is a DEATH SHRINE to KURT COBAIN -- MAGAZINE CUTOUTS, POSTERS and TICKET STUBS arranged decoratively.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large BLACK & WHITE POSTER showing a CLOSE UP of COBAIN'S FACE is the centerpiece, and a sloppy BULLET HOLE drawn in RED MARKER marks the center of his forehead. The words `I'M NOT AFRAID OF DYING' are scrawled across the bottom of the poster in the same BRIGHT RED.

<DIRECTION>
A DIGITAL CLOCK on Randy's DESK shows 3:30 AM. There's a SLIGHT TREMOR and the numbers shift, changing briefly to 01:10:23:08, then back again to 3:30.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey wakes suddenly from a nightmare. She sits up and looks around, remembering where she is. She discovers Randy asleep by her side. She finds a pile of clothes on the floor beside the bed and grabs her shirt...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...after she pulls it on over her head, she freezes -- because Billy Moorcroft is standing right there in his BIRTHDAY HAT, staring at her.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY_MOORCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only one day left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY_MOORCROFT>
<DIRECTION>
Corey turns and looks down to Randy. He's still fast asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<COREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I supposed to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COREY>
<DIRECTION>
As soon as she utters her question she notices a silvery, liquid VECTOR SPEAR protruding from the center of her chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Billy is now gone, but her SPEAR beckons her out of the room, elongating to illustrate her path. Corey is in awe...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her SPEAR leads her through the living room, and past the sleeping bodies of Mike, Jeff and Ruth. Following her path leads her to step on RUTH'S FOOT as she goes by...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey doesn't even notice, but one of Ruth's eyes pop open as she treads out the door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey follows Billy, who walks in the middle of the road about 15 yards ahead of her. The residential street is guarded by great, OLD TREES on either side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dark sky above starts to BEND and WARP, and a BUCKLE in space-time materializes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a simultaneous flash of LIGHTING and sharp CRACK OF THUNDER, and Corey looks up to the VORTEX -- a massive, swirling MAELSTROM gapes open like a tunnel to the inter- dimensional realm of darkest night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The VOID brightens, and ominous STORM CLOUDS and TORRENTIAL RAINS are visible within...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey peers up into the MOUTH of it and sees DUSTY'S HOUSE AND AUTO REPAIR SHOP being doused and beaten by the STORM --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DUSTY'S GARAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In contrast to the street, all is nearly SILENT in Dusty's garage. Corey watches as Billy moves along the perimeter WITHOUT SOUND, ghostly... JUMP CUTS and TIME CUTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her CHEVROLET sits in the bay. Some of the PARTS have already been harvested -- the CATALYTIC CONVERTER sits next to it on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey approaches a UTILITY SINK next to a SHOWER in the corner...
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY_MOORCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY_MOORCROFT>
<COREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COREY>
<BILLY_MOORCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY_MOORCROFT>
<DIRECTION>
Corey focuses on the sink, and it begins to tremble. The pipes beneath it CREAK and MOAN. WATER starts to bubble up from the sink drain, also in the shower...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Billy stands atop her car, watching her. His perpetually morose expression transforms into a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SINK BASIN suddenly cracks from pressure. As Corey stares into the drain... WE PLUNGE DOWN INTO THE PIPE --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV OF TELEKINETIC ENERGY - INSIDE THE PIPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We travel through meters and meters of DANK PIPING until we hit the WATER MAIN. There's a sound like a TIDAL WAVE CRASHING --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET/DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - LATER - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- WATER POURS out from under the garage door down to the street. PULL BACK TO REVEAL --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entire driveway and the street in front of the house are covered with water. FIRE TRUCKS, POLICE CARS and an AMBULANCE are gathered in front of the property.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE: DOWN THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ruth runs toward her house. When she turns a corner and it comes into view, she stops dead in her tracks. Her face shows sheer terror --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Because her father Dusty is handcuffed and being loaded into the back of a cruiser by Officer O'Dell and another policeman, OFFICER HINES...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...the PIT BULL struggles against it's CHAIN, growling and barking frantically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...and Billy Moorcroft, half-naked, soaking wet and shivering, is wrapped in a blanket and being tended to by PARAMEDICS.
</DIRECTION>
<FIREMAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lucky I heard him screamin', else he woulda drowned down there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIREMAN_2>
<DIRECTION>
Ruth keeps to the shadows and slinks toward a BACK DOOR...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, FOOT OF THE STAIRS - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sloshes through four inches of water and skips up the stairs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, RUTH'S BEDROOM - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without turning on the lights, Ruth desperately rifles through her closet until she finds a SHOEBOX.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside it are several PLASTIC BAGS -- some filled with MARIJUANA, others with COCAINE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, UPSTAIRS BATHROOM - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hands shaking, Ruth dumps a bag of coke into the toilet and flushes it. The WHITE POWDER disappears down the swirling SPIRAL OF CLOUDY LIQUID...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the bowl doesn't refill.
</DIRECTION>
<RUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUTH>
<DIRECTION>
She begins to stuff the other bags down her pants...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Having deposited Dusty in the back of the cruiser and shut the door, O'Dell's attention turns to an upstairs window of the house when he sees MOVEMENT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RANDY'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy rolls over in bed, opening his eyes to the new day. He looks around for Corey, disappointed to find her gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey walks down an aisle of the department store. She finds Chris assisting a CUSTOMER.
</DIRECTION>
<CUSTOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just checked aisle three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUSTOMER>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're there. At the front, by the Trapper Keepers.

EXT. BEHIND THE DEPARTMENT STORE - DAY

Corey waits behind the store until Chris comes out. She eagerly accepts TWO PACKS.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<COREY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</COREY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey lays on her stomach in bed, studying The Philosophy of Time Travel. The book is open to: CHAPTER SIX - THE LIVING RECEIVER... The Living Receiver is chosen to guide the Artifact into position for its journey back to the Primary Universe. No one knows how or why a Receiver will be chosen...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She flips through the onion skin pages to: CHAPTER TEN - THE MANIPULATED DEAD... The Manipulated Dead are more powerful than the Living Receiver. If a person dies within the Tangent Dimension, they are able to contact the Living Receiver through the Fourth Dimensional Construct...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey glances over at the CLOSET MIRROR and sees Billy's image reflected. She flips over and finds him standing at the foot of the bed, clad in the same garb as all her visions.
</DIRECTION>
<COREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I already saved you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COREY>
<BILLY_MOORCROFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY_MOORCROFT>
<DIRECTION>
He points to the CLOSET MIRROR... She stares into her own reflection as BILLY'S DISAPPEARS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER IMAGE starts to FADE as well, and then the SURFACE OF THE MIRROR TRANSFORMS into a three-dimensional vision of a PARK. The focus is a SWING SET... and one of the SWINGS in particular, which rocks slowly back and forth. Empty. Void of life.
</DIRECTION>
<COREY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONFUSED)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COREY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, DINING ROOM/DEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside Billy Moorcroft's quaint, sanitary-looking home is a small gathering to celebrate his return. STREAMERS hang over a table supporting a partially eaten CAKE. A BANNER that reads `WELCOME HOME BILLY!' is draped across the archway connecting the DINING ROOM to the DEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY'S MOTHER (32), with her fair complexion and dark hair, is an older female version of Billy himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she brings a POT OF COFFEE and a STACK OF CUPS into BILLY'S FATHER (35), BILLY'S AUNT and UNCLE, and a CHILD PSYCHOLOGIST who is moderating (50s; male) in the den, she looks as though she's barely keeping it together.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILD_PSYCHOLOGIST>

(between bites of cake)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The place for Billy to be right now is at home with his family...

Billy's Mother interrupts as she sets the coffee down.

<CHILD_PSYCHOLOGIST>

	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll take years for him to work through what happened, but the best way to open those doors is to surround him with things that are familiar...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILD_PSYCHOLOGIST>
<DIRECTION>
Billy's Mother passes her husband a cup, and they hold a long, painful moment of eye contact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, BREAKFAST NOOK - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Billy sits at a table in the sunny, HEXAGONAL ROOM. He wears the BIRTHDAY HAT, SLACKS and COLLARED SHIRT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He appears clean and groomed, but his face and neck are marred by BRUISES and other ABRASIONS. Before him is a packet of COLORED PENCILS and some sheets of PAPER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His Mother walks up behind him, and peeks over his shoulder at the DRAWING that he's working on.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY_S_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure you don't want some more cake?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY_S_MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
Billy nods. His mother caresses his head as she watches him color. After a moment she sits down in a chair beside him and tries to get his attention.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY_S_MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Billy... I-
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY_S_MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
Before she can go on, she's interrupted by the DOORBELL. Billy never looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Billy's Father answers the door and finds Corey.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY_S_FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only family and close friends are welcome here today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY_S_FATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Billy's Mother hovers behind her husband, curious about and wary of the stranger.
</DIRECTION>
<COREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand... I just wanted to say that I'm sorry about everything that happened to Billy. And I know it doesn't seem like it, but everything happens for a reason... and it'll all work out in the end.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COREY>
<DIRECTION>
Billy's Father stares her down until she turns to leave uncomfortably. Billy's Mother starts to cry... CUT BACK TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BILLY MOORCROFT'S HOUSE, BREAKFAST NOOK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...the breakfast nook. Billy is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Left on the table is his completed DRAWING. It's a neatly executed rendition of a SWING SET -- identical to the one from Corey's vision in the closet door mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Billy walks through the empty park, still wearing his birthday hat. He makes his way past a SAND PIT with a JUNGLE GYM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Balanced on one of the jungle gym's bars is a PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Billy picks it up. The name on the prescription is COREY RICHARDSON. JUMP CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SWING SET. Billy leans back as far as he can as momentum propels his body forward and back through space. He looks up to the sky where SUPERNATURAL BLACK CLOUDS are forming...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He swings back and forth... back and forth...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE: PARK BENCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey sits nearby on a park bench, watching Billy. He looks back at her, showing no signs of recognition... JUMP CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SWING. No longer a little boy sitting in it. It dangles erratically from the ropes, still gripped by inertia...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAN DOWN to the sandy ground below -- FIND the bottle of pills, now empty. Billy's unmoving, OPEN HAND...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OKLAHOMA HIGHWAY 40/EL RENO EXIT - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK gets off the highway and heads into El Reno. It's load is a batch of beat up, OLD CARS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The JALOPY is on the TOP RACK, CLOSEST TO THE END...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy peeks in the window of Corey's motel room but sees nothing. He pounds on the door and calls for her:

	Corey...

</RANDY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey arrives near the intersection where the accident took place. The BLACK CLOUDS overhead have become more vast and oppressive. A cold WIND blows...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK breaches the crest of a hill and comes into view, descending on the intersection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above it the CLOUDS begin to transform and take the shape of an ASTRONOMICAL WORMHOLE that reaches down toward the earth...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris comes outside and gazes up at the foreboding sky...

As the TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK approaches the intersection, Corey fixates on the JALOPY on the back...

The CHAINS that hold the junker in place SHAKE and RATTLE...

<DIRECTION>
We plunge through the PORTAL as it twists through the ether...
</DIRECTION>

EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WORMHOLE extends down to the JALOPY. Gracefully. Like an eel moving through water, confidently pursuing it's prey... mouth widening to swallow...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey is riveted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it passes through the intersection, the TRACTOR-TRAILER hits a POTHOLE -- CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>

KEY SCENES IN REVERSE

PILLS COME OUT OF BILLY'S MOUTH AND INTO HIS HAND --

Everyone cracks up, including Corey. Sam is humiliated. She backs away from the car, anger burning in her eyes. Randy revs the engine, expressing his will to take off.
</DIRECTION>
<COREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See ya later, Sam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COREY>
<DIRECTION>
Sam says nothing, but watches as Randy's car peels off toward the intersection. She's confused and hurt, frozen to the spot where she's standing.
</DIRECTION>

As Corey stares back at Sam from the car, her smile fades...

INT. RANDY'S CAR - CONTINUOUS

Corey turns to face the approaching intersection. Resolute.

<DIRECTION>
INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris is at work, stocking shelves inside the department store...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He checks his watch, stops what he's doing and grabs a PACK OF CIGARETTES from his breast pocket -- time for a smoke break.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy's car is stopped at the red light. Sam strolls toward it ever so slowly. Jeff, Mike and Ruth gawk at her from the backseat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She slows down even more, having no interest in subjecting herself to any more of their mockery...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light turns green, and Randy's car peels across the intersection, making a left. Sam's still 10 or 15 feet away from stepping into the street...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She quickens her pace, almost there when --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KA-BOOM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM OUT OF NOWHERE AN OLD JALOPY SAILS RIGHT IN FRONT RANDY'S CAR! He jerks the wheel -- and the jalopy hits on the front passenger side -- completely smashing it in --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam spins when she HEARS the deafening CRUNCH...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy careens into the opposite lane, and an ONCOMING CAR smacks him dead on. The inertia from the oncoming vehicle plows his car into a FIRE HYDRANT by the side of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hydrant goes flying through the air like a bullet and skitters harmlessly across the intersection --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The world goes SILENT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHRIS RUNS TOWARD THE DESTRUCTION, DROPPING HIS CIGARETTE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WATER ERUPTS LIKE A GEYSER FROM THE PIPE WHERE THE HYDRANT USED TO BE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE JALOPY IS FLIPPED OVER ONTO ITS SIDE...

EXT. POLICE STATION, BACK PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam walks out of the police station and finds herself in the secluded back parking lot. She holds a PRESCRIPTION for anti- depressants...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pair of eyes peek out of the bushes close by -- it's Vietnam Tom. He's wearing his ski mask and he's got his rifle. He sees Sam, but she doesn't see him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam wells up with emotion, about to breakdown, and Tom watches her with empathy. It looks as though he's about to go to her when something stops him -- Chris comes out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?

Sam is still too choked up to speak. Tom sneaks away unnoticed...

	I know what you meant, and it's bullshit. When someone dies for no reason you can't just make one up to fill the void and make yourself feel better. It sucks, and it fucks everything up, but it doesn't mean shit beyond that.

</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
She gets out of the car and slogs toward her room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam swallows her PILLS with some water, and sits down on one of the full-size beds by her BACKPACK...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches inside and pulls out THE PHILOSOPHY OF TIME TRAVEL book, by Roberta Sparrow. As she studies the cover, her image is reflected by the CLOSET DOOR MIRRORS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The angle of the mirrors creates double image reflections for other objects in the room... and Sam's reflection is present in both of the panes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The digital CLOCK/RADIO shows 6:30 PM...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at the PICTURES OF HER FAMILY tucked away inside the book: Sam with her mother and father; Sam as a child with her sister and brother; an old photo of the whole Darko family together...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tears come to her eyes as she focuses on an image of Donnie, and she puts them all down. She touches the SCAR on the inner part of her right wrist...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She then glances down and notices that the book is open to: CHAPTER NINE - REMNANTS.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remnants...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
A portion of the text includes: Like Dreams that the Manipulated can have after journeys into Tangent or Fragmentary Universes, sounds and images may be transferred from one Tangent or Fragmentary Universe to another, as all corruptions exist on relative cosmic planes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JUNKYARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam wanders through the junkyard clad in her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and JEANS, with the MAKESHIFT BANDAGE wrapped around her right hand. The SHARD OF METAL protrudes from the GASH by her temple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM'S LUMINOUS POV - THE JUNKYARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sees the junkyard as the phosphorescent DESTINY PLANE. DEAD CARS, MACHINERY and piles of SCRAP METAL glow as stationary objects within the complex grid. A PAIR OF RATS follow their VECTOR SPEARS as they shimmy up the side of a RUSTY TRACTOR...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam treads effortlessly through the darkness, past the heaps of junk toward the decrepit STORAGE SHACK marked by the CORRUGATED ROOFING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE: STORAGE SHACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stands before the shack, having discovered Vietnam Tom. He squats in the darkened corner of the scrappy shelter, and looks back at her through the eyeholes of a new mask --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wears on his face the SCULPTURE made of SCRAP METAL, which has been formed into the COUNTENANCE OF THE MONSTER BUNNY.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Tom. I like your new mask.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Tom trembles like the frightened animal he personifies as Sam runs her fingers down one of the LONG, METALLIC EARS, down to one of the SHARPENED INCISORS of the EVIL-LOOKING GRIN...

<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you scared?
	</DIALOGUE>

As this contact is made the tarnished metal becomes transparent, and the NEURONS in TOM'S BRAIN can be seen sending ELECTRIC IMPULSES, in turn RELEASING NEUROTRANSMITTERS and exciting OTHER NEURONS...
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you can hear me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
A PORTAL forms around the shelter like a giant cylinder, enclosing them. Tom rises, afraid... Sam takes his hand...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PORTAL shrinks and squeezes the walls until they bend inward, then begin to CREAK and RUMBLE --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BENEATH OVERPASS - THE NEXT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam awakens to a fierce RUMBLING overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It happens again, and when she looks around she realizes that she's underneath a highway overpass in BOXER SHORTS and a T- SHIRT, barefoot, lying on a FLAT AREA atop the CEMENT SLOPE that leads down to the road below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alarmed by both the height and sanitation of her current position, she shifts her body and starts to slide down the SLOPE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once on even ground, she notices a brand new `95 BMW coming toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perfect...

EXT. FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - MORNING

Sam shoves a load of her wet clothes into an industrial DRYER. She plugs in some quarters, presses the button, and sits back in a chair in front of the machine.

EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vietnam Tom sits at his new squatting ground, looking out over all of El Reno. He peers at the twinkling lights through his scrap metal BUNNY MASK, and cradles his RIFLE in his arms like a soldier at rest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slowly turns and sees that Sam is sitting right next to him, facing the landscape. She wears her HOODED SWEATSHIRT, JEANS and the BANDAGE. The SHARD OF METAL is lodged in her forehead.

Tom aims his gun at her face...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He realizes that a FORCE FIELD has formed in between them, because when the barrel of the gun touches it, the barrier bends and becomes slightly opaque.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is expressionless. Tom's finger trembles as he places it on the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He aims down the gun's sights, directly at Sam's RIGHT EYE, and sees a PHOSPHORESCENT GRID take shape like a coordinate system on the force field. Sam's eye is in the CENTRAL QUADRANT...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom pulls the trigger. TIME SLOWS DOWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A liquid VECTOR SPEAR shoots out of the gun barrel. Immediately after, a BULLET is discharged and follows it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The VECTOR SPEAR passes cleanly through the grid, but when the BULLET reaches it, the entire force field curves to accommodate the penetrating force...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The spear juts out until it nearly touches Sam's eye... but then it stops. The bullet catches up and freezes at the same spot, centimeters from her face --

Jeremy turns on the overhead florescent lights in the lab. There are ROWS OF DESKS with MICROSCOPES and some PRECISION ROCK SLICING EQUIPMENT.

As he walks to a desk near the back, he can barely contain his excitement. Sam follows, taking note of a LARGE RABBIT in an extremely SMALL CAGE...

Sam doesn't agree or disagree. She's become tense, because Jeremy's face is now in close proximity to hers.

<JEREMY>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a mystery to me, Samantha.

</DIRECTION>
<JEREMY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ow...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEREMY>
<DIRECTION>
Jeremy retreats, shielding his left arm. Sam looks down and sees that the red, raw area has turned into a much bigger RASH, covering a large part of his wrist and extending onto his forearm.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That doesn't look good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<JEREMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should get some Hydrocortisone.

He looks pathetic, and Sam feels sorry for him.

<SAM>

(regarding the attempted KISS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry about that.

</SAM>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I should've know better. You barely know me, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEREMY>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>

Jeremy manages a smile, and Sam smiles back.

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris is at work, stocking shelves inside the department store...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He checks his watch, stops what he's doing and grabs a PACK OF CIGARETTES from his breast pocket -- time for a smoke break.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INTERSECTION NEAR DEPARTMENT STORE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK carrying the JALOPY breaches the crest of the hill, descending on the intersection...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris lights up a cigarette...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHRIS' POV - TRACTOR-TRAILER TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He watches as the TRACTOR-TRAILER hits the pothole, but passes safely through the intersection, making a right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something about the sight of this strikes Chris so much that his cigarette falls out of his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Father Homeijer and Trudy stroll down a quiet street with their COLLECTIONS JAR, and arrive at a fork in the road.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_HOMEIJER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You take this street, I'll take that one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_HOMEIJER>
<DIRECTION>
Without warning, Trudy kisses him on the cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<TRUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good luck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Father Homeijer blushes, but Trudy smiles at him in a friendly manner. They move off in separate directions...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Father Homeijer raps on the door of Dusty's house. No answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DUSTY'S GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The priest lets himself into the garage, which is open but deserted. He notices COREY'S CHEVROLET. He steps up to the GARAGE ENTRANCE and knocks...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No one comes to the door, but he notices that it's slightly ajar.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_HOMEIJER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dusty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_HOMEIJER>
<DIRECTION>
He can hear COUNTRY MUSIC playing low within.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_HOMEIJER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you home, son?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_HOMEIJER>
<DIRECTION>
He lets himself inside...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Father Homeijer walks into the dingy kitchen. The SINK is full of DIRTY DISHES. A coating of GRIME over everything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, LIVING - CONTINUOUS - ANGLE ON - PIT BULL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sleeping PIT BULL stirs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The priest sees that the COUNTRY SONG is coming from a STEREO that sits on the kitchen counter.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_HOMEIJER>
<DIRECTION>
(calling out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dusty? I'd like to trouble you for a small donation...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_HOMEIJER>
<DIRECTION>
The COUNTRY SONG comes to a close, and the tape runs out. With the music gone, the priest cocks his head to a new sound -- soft, distant CRYING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks curiously toward the CELLAR DOOR... [Note: The CRYING SOUND should be identical to the one that drew Corey out of the motel room.]
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, BASEMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Father Homeijer slowly descends the rickety BASEMENT STEPS. At the bottom, he finds a STRING that connects to a bare overhead BULB...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He creeps along the dusty cement floor, past an old WASHER/DRYER, continuing toward the source of the CRYING, which has become more pronounced. He wrinkles his nose at a foul smell...
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_HOMEIJER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_HOMEIJER>
<DIRECTION>
He rounds a corner, and when he sees Billy Moorcroft he's nearly frozen in shock --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy is locked inside a large, METAL DOG'S CAGE. He sits on the floor of the cage, rocking back and forth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is pale, bruised and slick with sweat, clothed only in a pair of SOILED BRIEFS. Beside him is an aluminum WATER BOWL and some scraps of WHITE BREAD. The floor beneath him is soaked with URINE and scattered FECES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Father Homeijer makes the sign of the cross.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DUSTY'S GARAGE/HOUSE - LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dusty's place is surrounded by FIRE TRUCKS, POLICE CARS and an AMBULANCE. Billy Moorcroft is wrapped in a blanket and being tended to by PARAMEDICS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Father Homeijer stands near the boy, being interviewed by a DETECTIVE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dusty is handcuffed and being loaded into the back of a cruiser by Officer O'Dell and another policeman, OFFICER HINES (28).
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER_O_DELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get in there, you sick fuck...
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER_O_DELL>
<DIRECTION>
Dusty says nothing as O'Dell shoves him in and slams the door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two officers turn when they see RANDY'S DAD'S CAR pull up next to the property. Randy is in the driver's seat, looking confused. Ruth hops out of the passenger seat and darts toward the house --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- but she is cut off and grabbed by a POLICEMAN. ANOTHER OFFICER goes to talk to Randy in the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wheels turning, O'Dell addresses Hines:
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER_O_DELL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (regarding Dusty)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let him rot in there for a few minutes, maybe till the news guys show up... I'm gonna go finish checkin' upstairs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER_O_DELL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DUSTY'S HOUSE, RUTH'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
O'Dell lets himself into Ruth's bedroom. It's a mess -- her CLOTHES are all over the floor, and crinkled ROCK POSTERS litter the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next to her bed is a FRAMED PICTURE of she and Randy. O'Dell starts to rifle through her desk drawers, one after another --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tosses the closet, throwing out clothes and shoes... until he finds the SHOEBOX. He opens it up, satisfied...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE: OUTSIDE THE BEDROOM DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Officer Hines stands by the door, looking in at O'Dell covertly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam lies in bed in front of the television. A NEWS BULLETIN comes on about Billy's Moorcroft's rescue:
</DIRECTION>
<TELEVISION_ANCHOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have an update this morning on our breaking news of Billy Moorcroft, the El Reno youth who was kidnapped over 15 months ago, and rescued yesterday afternoon by Father Homeijer of Mount Calvary Church. Billy's condition at this time is considered stable...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TELEVISION_ANCHOR>
<DIRECTION>
Sam stares at the television, dumbfounded. The news cuts to the scene of the rescue, where Father Homeijer is being INTERVIEWED:
</DIRECTION>
<FIELD_REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father, what led you to this particular house on this particular day?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIELD_REPORTER>
<FATHER_HOMEIJER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was out collecting donations in order to help rebuild my church, Mount Calvary, which recently burned down. Clearly the Lord works in mysterious ways. This is nothing less than divine intervention...

As Sam's walking away from the motel, she looks up to the sky at a PASSING JET...

<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They should hang guys like that. Only thing bothers me is how many of `em are still out there...

</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Chris enters the diner and catches the end of Ted's rant.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you could've been some crazy rapist serial killer.
	</DIALOGUE>

<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What makes you think you can tell me who I can and can't hang around with?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<CHRIS>

	When you were nine years old did you know it was wrong to put a living creature in the trash can and leave it there?

</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Sam's had enough.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>

	Chris... you're a nice guy, but you don't have to be looking out for me. You're not my dad, you're not my big brother...

Chris hangs his head, frustrated.

INT. JAIL CELL - AFTERNOON

Hines extends his hand and smiles. O'Dell shakes it. Grudgingly...

After Hines turns on him and jogs back to the station house, O'Dell kicks the ground angrily.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER_O_DELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!

</OFFICER_O_DELL>
<DIRECTION>
When he looks up, he's startled by a pair of eyes that peer from the bushes nearby. Upon closer inspection, he sees that it's Vietnam Tom in his SKI MASK.

Nervous about how much he's heard, O'Dell takes an aggressive stance.

EXT. LOOKOUT - SUNSET

Sam trudges up the wooded hill to the vantage point, carrying The Philosophy of Time Travel book. It's quiet and peaceful, and everything's bathed in golden light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She comes upon Tom's new squatting ground in a secluded area near the lookout, and looks around before approaching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she sees the handmade BUNNY MASK lying among his things, she puts the book under her arm and reaches down to pick it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs her fingers down the long, shiny ears, nose, and jagged teeth...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't realize that Tom is standing close behind her. When she senses his presence she's startled.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
She sets the BUNNY MASK down where she found it. Tom says nothing. He seems neither surprised nor irritated to find her there. He walks up beside her and sits, facing the view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a long beat, Sam sits down beside him. To her surprise, Tom begins to speak:
</DIRECTION>
<VIETNAM_TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mom told me someday everybody would understand. She said it was my job to look out for the town... so that's what I do. That's what I always do.

<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what you mean...

</SAM>

Tom turns and looks at her strangely.
</DIRECTION>
<VIETNAM_TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're more important than all of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIETNAM_TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Sam peers into Tom's pale blue eyes through his ski mask. Without knowing why, she reaches out and touches the mask...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she starts to pull it off Tom grabs her hand, stopping her -- not too rough, but forceful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam's scared for a moment, but Tom lets her go. His eyes drift down to The Philosophy of Time Travel book by her side. Sam sees him staring, so she picks it up and hands it to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Tom sees the cover, his cold eyes are filled with emotion. Sam sees how struck he is, but doesn't understand.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you like to read?
	</DIALOGUE>

The SHOPPING CARTS whirl in an circle of ever-increasing speed around Vietnam Tom and Sam. The RUBBER WHEELS squeal on the cement until they start to melt...

The VECTOR SPEARS lead the carts in a spiral that hones in closer and closer to the two of them. Sam is stoic. Tom is in awe...

When it looks like they'll be crushed by the scudding metal, or combusted by the cosmic energy, the WORM-LIKE PORTAL from the sky reaches down and encloses Tom and Sam like a vacuum.

There's a brilliant FLASH OF LIGHT -- TRANSITION TO:

CHRIS' TRUCK pulls into the lot early in the morning, and he gets out wearing his work uniform. Still groggy, he's about to walk into the store when something catches his eye...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRANE UP to FIND a STRUCTURE made of all the SHOPPING CARTS, as chilling and impressive as a crop circle, in the shape of an immense FIBONACCI SPIRAL. The metal of the carts has been fused together, and they're stacked in an ascending manner that reaches an apex in the center, like a cone.

Tom's face is a mass of SCARS. Both his cheeks, forehead and chin are marred by scar tissue born from long, deep gashes.

O'Dell looks into his sad, blue eyes...

Sam raises her knee and connects hard with his groin. He starts to double over, but recovers quickly and smacks her across the face --

<JEREMY>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fucking bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEREMY>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is stunned, and Jeremy takes her by the shoulders and shoves her hard --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam stumbles backwards and falls, cracking her head on the metal BUNNY MASK. She rolls over onto her back, REVEALING the SHARD OF METAL that protrudes from the GASH by her temple...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She struggles no more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom stands in his cell to meet the entity that approaches...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris and the other Employees stop working and look up at the sky, now roiling with sinister, SUPERNATURAL CLOUDS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeremy slowly creeps to where Sam lies... Her eyes are open and she is completely still.
</DIRECTION>
<JEREMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEREMY>
<DIRECTION>
Jeremy crouches beside her, and when he puts two fingers to her neck to feel for a pulse, he starts to tremble...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The raining METEORS and FIREWORKS illuminate the SMOKE and the BLACK CLOUDS overhead...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAIL CELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vietnam Tom walks up to the CELL BARS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes face to face with Sam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stares back at him through the bars from the other side. She wears her HOODED SWEATSHIRT and the BANDAGE. Light glints off the METAL lodged in her HEAD WOUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. JEREMY'S BMW/LOOKOUT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeremy speeds frantically down the hill, away from the parking area and the continuing fireworks display. Tears stream down his cheeks...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He cuts the wheel when a pair of HEADLIGHTS blind him and a vehicle cuts him off. His car skids out, and he sees it's CHRIS' TRUCK that has almost hit him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris jumps out, yanks open Jeremy's door and grabs him by the shirt collar. He yells over the FIREWORKS:
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where the hell is Sam?

Jeremy stomps on the gas pedal, and Chris is forced to unhand him as his BMW navigates around the truck and barrels down the hill...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOOKOUT, VIETNAM TOM'S SQUATTING GROUND - LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Chris approaches Vietnam Tom's squatting ground, the FIREWORKS DISPLAY is in the midst of the GRANDE FINALE. Showers of light BURST and CRACKLE in steady succession. PEOPLE SCREAM in approval from the parking area nearby...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chris comes upon Sam's lifeless form.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He stoops by her, picks her up and hugs her limp body close...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he does this, Vietnam Tom approaches from behind him. Chris turns to face him but says nothing, still holding Sam. The WIND picks up and blows in gusts around them...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom looks down at the two of them for a moment, then reaches down and picks up his BUNNY MASK. The EVIL GRIN is red with SAM'S BLOOD, and one of the teeth is missing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The last of the fireworks display occurs, leaving the night full of SMOKE, HELLISH CLOUDS and an increasing number of bright-tailed METEORS -- the APOCALYPSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amongst the churning clouds, a tornado-like PORTAL cuts through the sky and touches down somewhere in the town. It's swirling and vast, stretching down from limitless space...

The clock on the BANK SIGN shows 3:30 AM -- then flashes to -- JUNE 19, 1995... It changes again, this time to a countdown to the JULY 4TH FIREWORKS CELEBRATION: 15 DAYS, 17 HOURS, 29 MINUTES, 57 SECONDS... 56 SECONDS... 55 SECONDS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM 15 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam awakens suddenly from a nightmare. She lies atop the blankets wearing a T-SHIRT and BOXER SHORTS. She looks over and sees Corey passed out on the other full-size bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO PLASTIC CUPS, EMPTY SODA CANS, and the BOTTLE are on the nightstand between them, the liquor partially consumed. The CLOCK/RADIO reads 3:30 AM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WINDMILL PLATFORM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vietnam Tom sits atop the platform, more than 30 feet up, wearing his ski mask and holding his rifle. The surface of the platform is littered with TATTERED CLOTHING, a WATER BOTTLE, CANS OF FOOD and SCRAPS OF A TARP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Relaxed and at peace, Tom looks up to the clear night sky. As a TREMOR starts to build, he takes off his ski mask and gazes out over his town...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, there's a brilliant flash of GREEN LIGHT -- deafening THUNDER -- a blinding EXPLOSION -- CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
Dusty sits and stares at his CELLAR DOOR... Trudy holds a PICTURE OF FATHER HOMEIJER and cries... Ruth snorts some COKE in her room... Jeremy scratches his LEFT FOREARM in his sleep... Billy Moorcroft shivers from the chill in his CAGE... Officer O'Dell sits alone in his patrol car, fingering the trigger of his PISTOL... TRANSITION TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIELD BEHIND MOTEL - THE NEXT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where the towering windmill once stood is now only a CRATER about 5 feet deep and 10 feet in diameter, with charred bits of wood and metal strewn everywhere. Ground water spurts from the broken well seal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cantaloupe-sized METEORITE sits in the center of the crater...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two FIREMEN haul out the meteorite as Sam and O'Dell arrive on the scene. There are PARAMEDICS, a CORONER and other POLICEMEN there as well, and a large area has been cordoned off with POLICE TAPE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corey is there looking on, as well as Chris Holt, Phil Coulter, and other local CITIZENS. TOM'S REMAINS are carried off in a BLACK BAG...
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God...

Sam moves to stand by Corey. The overall mood is grim, and Frank stands peering at the wreckage with a long face.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>

She picks it up.

EXT. MOTEL - MORNING

Sam and Corey are on their way back to the motel room when they turn and see that Chris has followed them.

He's distracted when JEREMY'S BMW pulls up and parks. He hops out and hustles across the field toward the crash site...
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

</SAM>

Chris regains his train of thought:
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was just gonna say, if you wanted, I could give you a ride back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
He looks right at Sam when he says this. He then glances over at Corey, as if just remembering that she were there.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRIS>
