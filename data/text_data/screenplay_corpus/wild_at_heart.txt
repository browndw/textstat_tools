Reggie and Drop Shadow enter through a door on the other side of the room. Reggie catches Mr. Reindeer's eye and smiles. Reggie reaches in his pocket and takes out a silver dollar - flips it in the air - catches it - and puts it back in his pocket. Mr. Reindeer smiles and waves him over to the table. He whispers something in Reggie's ear - then gives him an envelope.

The first thing you'll want to know is I'm keeping the baby. Mama wasn't for it in the beginning but I think she's looking forward to it. I'm gonna name it Pace no matter if it's a boy or a girl.

It is fine with me about the baby as you already know. And Pace being your family name and all is just right. What about a middle name if it is a boy after my granddaddy Roscoe? He would be proud I know though he is long passed. Pace Roscoe Ripley does not sound so bad do you think?

Lula wriggles out of the car and flys into his arms. Behind them is a giant golden sunset. As they embrace - the sound of the horns goes away. Lula's gaze goes to a reflection of golden light on a windshield. It is the same abstract scene she saw before in her room in Big Tuna, but now she knows what it is. It is Pace's happy, smiling eyes looking up at the two of them in love.

<DIRECTION>
Sailor, with a giant blue nose, looks into Lula's eyes and sings “Love Me Tender.”
