FADE IN ON: An ARMY HELICOPTER as it soars over the thick LOUISIANA BAYOU. Lush and green only a day ago, the foliage below has been ripped to shreds. The kind of damage that can only be done by nature. SUPERIMPOSE:, FEBRUARY 2 - 0630 HOURS - 32 KILOMETERS NORTH OF FORT MCKINLEY, LOUISIANA

EXT. CLEARING -- DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO MEN emerge from the underbrush at a run. The BIGGER MAN carrying the wounded SMALLER MAN over his shoulder. Both in ragged army cadet fatigues - ripped, muddy, and bloody. The Bigger Man lowers the Smaller Man to the ground and unshoulders his M-16. Face panicked. The sound of the HELICOPTER approaching...

As the Helicopter comes over the clearing, Styles and the Pilot squint down through the windscreen to see the Two Men, huddled together as BULLET HITS kick up DUST around them!

</PILOT>

Below, the Bigger Man still shooting and then he lowers his rifle and there's only SILENCE. No return fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then Styles sees why. A THIRD MAN. Lying by the treeline. Chest torn open by gunfire. Obviously dead. His clothes - the same fatigues the first two men are wearing.

As the Helicopter comes in for a landing, the Bigger Man kneels next to the Smaller Man, who bleeds from a bullet wound to the arm. His face, pale, sweating. The Bigger Man wipes the Smaller Man's brow and speaks softly and seriously.

INT. ROADHOUSE -- MORNING

A full on shit-kicking dive. Nearly empty, given the hour. A TELEVISION plays the morning news over the bar. Only two inhabitants - one a BARTENDER, the other the lone CUSTOMER, smoking and picking at a plate of criminally runny eggs.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell the truth, Vic. You made these with a blender, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
He grins and we get our first good look at TOM HARDY - Three day stubble, dark rings around his eyes, but a with strong jaw and steady voice. Not your average barfly. Somebody who maybe used to be somebody.

	Yeah, if you've slept.

<BARTENDER>

	Yeah, and I could've used the sleep. I'm supposed to meet people here tonight, try and get some work going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>

He stops, his attention suddenly on the TV. A NEWSCASTER:
</DIRECTION>
<NEWSCASTER>
	<DIALOGUE>

The Bartender turns the TV off hastily. Embarrassed:
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>

Hardy just looks away. The Bartender puts an empty glass down and fills it to the lip with bourbon. Hardy nods a "thank you" and reaches for the glass when the PAGER on his hip goes off. He checks the number.

The Bartender hands him a cordless and Hardy dials.

	Hey, Bill, it's Tom. Long time no. . . whoa, whoa, slow down. Yeah... yeah, of course I'll come. An hour.

He hangs up and hands the phone back to the Bartender.

	The official term for it is "Clusterfuck" . By the time Beth hit us, I'd canceled all off base exercises save one - a six man cadet team and their Drill out in the bush. We're missing three and the Sergeant. The cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. But the Sergeant...

<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the problem is you only got three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<STYLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. The one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick-up.

</STYLES>
<HARDY>

	You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was for suspicion of bribery, it's really all in the wording-

	Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.

Osborne opens her mouth to reply but Hardy cuts her off.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three things. First - You don't have a choice. Second- I've never taken a bribe in my life. And Third - I'm still a little drunk from last night, so if I skip over the witty banter and move forward to straight hitting on you, try not to take offense. Tell me about the two guys.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he handsome, self assured, carry himself well, does he look you in the eyes or down at the floor, does he have good bones, suggesting good breeding, does he slouch or sit up straight - these are important questions, as they reveal a great deal about this man's character so please get over yourself for two and a half seconds and tell me is he cute?

Osborne stares at him. She finally nods.

<HARDY>

	Cadet Dunbar, good morning! I'm Tom Hardy and I believe you've already met Officer Osborne. I understand you had a rough time of it last night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
No response. Hardy takes a seat across from the cadet.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not talking, huh? You probably just want to get some food and some sleep. They feed you yet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
No response. Hardy reaches into his pocket. Pulls out a DONUT. Dunbar eyes it, wary but definitely wanting it.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on. You can eat in front of someone and still not talk to them - my parents did it for years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
Dunbar grabs the donut, wolfing it down.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want another one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
No response. Osborne looks to her watch - it's been a minute.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe later. Ray, let me say this up front - I'm not a cop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
Dunbar turns away, no longer interested. Hardy continues:
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used to be, but that's beside the point. Who I am doesn't really matter; what matters is that right now, you're in a shitload of trouble. You understand that, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
No response.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, I don't know if you did what you did in self defense and frankly I don't really care. I'm just doing a favor for Colonel Styles because he wants to know if anyone else who's still out there is in need of assistance. To be honest with you, though, I don't care about that either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
Dunbar looks up at this, surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know those guys, you do. They die, to me, it's like seeing a couple people died in a fire on the news - tragic, but it doesn't affect me. The only thing I care about is I agreed to do a favor for a friend and try and talk to you till your transpo shows up. You like baseball?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
No response. Osborne looks at her watch - two minutes.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could talk baseball for days. Batting averages, ERA's, I got statistics in my brain, I don't know how I remember them. It's freaky. You wanna talk baseball?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
Dunbar, completely confused.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on Ray, we're gonna be here five hours, we gotta talk about something. So who do you like?

<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like baseball.

INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Styles and an M.P. listening to the Coffee Room conversation. DUNBAR'S VOICE, over the speaker:
</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know... I like the Army.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>

INT. COFFEE ROOM -- MORNING

<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did Basic here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifteen years ago under Sergeant West. Piece of work, that guy. I remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd knock you on the head with one of them. He still carry those guns?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
He Dunbar nods.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was also his " knife dummy" .
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Osborne)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, West used to say he could slit a man from stem to sternum in three seconds. He'd use this length of pipe to demonstrate and if you were the knife dummy, you'd spend all day getting a pipe rammed into your balls if you weren't fast enough to defend yourself. That was a loooong day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
Hardy laughs at the memory and turns back to Dunbar.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Incidentally, Ray, I promised them I'd ask where West and the others are. Can we get to them?

He looks to the floor.

No answer. Hardy rubs his nose. Osborne steps forward.

	The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, You're a murderer-

</OSBORNE>
<HARDY>

	See, Ray, this is what we call "good cop, bad cop". She shouts, I stand up for you, you're grateful, a bond of trust is established.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
Osborne, stunned by this.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I don't want to play games. That's why you're not in an interrogation room, with one of those two way mirrors - everyone knows those things are two way, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
Dunbar looks at him good nods slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Now, I'm gonna go get you another donut and you think about whether you want to talk more, okay?

	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
A man with a face of granite strides up and down the lines.

Two ivory handled pistols on his hips. His lifeless cobalt blue eyes take in the Cadets. This is SERGEANT WEST.

</THE_CADETS>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In my time I have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this Army I could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! This base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that I will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand - Give me a sir, yes, sir!

He walks over to a tall black cadet in the front row. PIKE.

</WEST>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, no, sir!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
West grabs Pike by the neck, CHOKING HIM. The others Cadets GASP. Pike goes down on his knees, the loss of air is so great. He reaches up automatically to try and save himself...
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck is this? You lay a hand on me while I'm trying to do my duty and rid the world of you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
He KICKS PIKE IN THE BALLS and releases him. Pike goes fetal on the ground, VOMITING, as West stands over him, screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the fuck up, you're still in formation, get the fuck up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
Pike somehow gets to his feet, vomit streaking his clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck have you done to that uniform, take it off, take it off, take it off!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
Pike, still gasping, can't move fast enough. West slaps him again and tears the man's shirt off.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get those fucking pants off, I want you buck ass naked, you don't deserve to wear these beautiful United States Army issue clothes!

Pike struggles off the rest of his clothes until he is NAKED. West turns and spies Dunbar in the line.

<DIRECTION>
West draws one of his PISTOLS and gives it to him.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty- four hours! He is not to be given food, water, or clothes! If he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?

	Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>
<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, ma'am, he just wanted us to quit. Making it through was kind of an honor. Some of the other guys on the base told us that if you could hack Section Eight, Command would consider you at the top of the class.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not exactly true...

	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
Dunbar gives a look that almost resembles a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That first night with Pike. I made the mistake of letting him sit down at around 0300.

EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE.-- ONE WEEK AGO -- EVENING

The six members of Section Eight on a forced run through the rain. We focus in each face as Dunbar describes them. First up is MUELLER a tall Aryan looking blonde with a square jaw.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mueller was from Tulsa, a real good ol' boy type. One of those "his Daddy's Daddy's Daddy died at Bull Run and no bleeding heart Yankee was gonna take away his scatter gun" . He idolized West.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
Muller, grinning, as West kicks his ass to pick up the pace. Next to him is NUNEZ, a strapping hulk of a manchild.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Nunez idolized Mueller. Big fella from New Mexico. After he got Sectioned he just followed Mueller around like a lap dog. He wasn't mean like Mueller, though, didn't have it in him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
Next to Nunez is CHILDS, small and weasely with feral eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Childs did. Didn't talk to anyone, but you got this feeling something was wrong with him, like real wrong. Type of guy you felt uncomfortable going to sleep near.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
Behind Childs runs Pike.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pike I told you about. He took the brunt of it from Mueller and West. Once they found it out he was a convict they were merciless. He'd been busted for Auto Theft, judge gave him the option of jailor the Army. He made the wrong choice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
Next to Pike, Dunbar and KENDALL run side by side. Kendall is short like Childs, but also weak. Wheezing.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Finally Kendall and me. Kendall was a smart guy, we got along okay. Pike and I tried to help him, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>

Kendall falters and Pike stops to try and help him up. West smacks the him away, practically kicking Kendall to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>

</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My brand. Must be my lucky day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
He takes one and lights it. Dunbar does the same.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me ask you one thing. You seem like a good guy, Ray. You carried Kendall wounded to the pickup. So what I don't get is what you did to make Nunez want to kill you?
	</DIALOGUE>

Dunbar just looks at the ground. A KNOCK at the door. Hardy and Osborne turn to see an M.P. stick his head in.

Kendall's laugh turns into a cough. Placing Hardy.
</DIRECTION>
<KENDALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it. You're that policeman with friends in low places. Tell me, how's Guissepe Torres doing these days? Those racketeering indictments must have really been a downer-

	Levi, you got about four hours before armed men show up here, put you on a plane to Washington, and lock you in a very small dark room. I suggest you talk to us.

Nonplussed, Osborne follows. Hardy turns back at the door.
</DIRECTION>

</HARDY>
<KENDALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. He has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and I have done my best to oblige him. However, in the last four weeks, I began a relationship with another cadet. What do you think of that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENDALL>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you just blew "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" out of the fucking water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<KENDALL>

	The Sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled. My father interceded, so instead, West Sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that I was gay.

	He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.

	I wanted to tell someone what he'd said, but I couldn't. Mueller would just laugh. Nunez and Childs wouldn't care. Pike and Dunbar were okay, but... When West outed me, he isolated me. An outcast among outcasts. And I'd just been told tonight was the night I'd die.

He and Kendall continue on. Mueller lingers a moment longer and then turns, following them up the hill.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kendall, Childs, and Mueller make their way through the bush. The WIND and RAIN have conspired into a FULL BLOWN HURRICANE. The three men are practically stumbling now, leaning in against it to stay on their feet. Kendall spies something through the maelstrom. It looks like WET WOOD. He points:
</DIRECTION>
<KENDALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENDALL>
<DIRECTION>
THE CABIN -- Wooden, one story, and large, it resembles a solidly built shack. It is being thrashed by the storm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trio stumble towards the front door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CABIN -- LAST NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Obviously abandoned. Bare of any furniture save for two wooden chairs next to an empty fireplace. DUNBAR and NUNEZ shout in surprise as the three men practically collapse into the cabin. Dunbar runs to bolt the door against the elements as Nunez helps them up.

Mueller stops, as the others turn towards the big man. Silence. They realize what the question means.

The others nod, becoming convinced.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILDS>

	He is the only one unaccounted for.

Mueller angrily digs into his sack and pulls out his grenades.
</DIRECTION>
<MUELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See? Three. Now can we please-
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUELLER>
<DIRECTION>
He stops. Hearing a SOUND outside. Through the wind and rain, FOOTSTEPS on the porch. They all turn to the door. Waiting... The DOOR SWINGS OPEN.. Pike. Covered in BLOOD.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
They stare at him as he calmly closes the door and walks over to the empty FIREPLACE. Finally:

<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whose blood is that, Jay? West's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any kindling for afire?

He looks around for kindling. A beat.

<DUNBAR>

	He admitted it.

</HARDY>
<KENDALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right in front of us. Mueller went after him but we held him back. Pike surrendered and volunteered to be tied up. So we roped him to a chair and tried to ride out the storm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENDALL>
<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would he just surrender?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>

Kendall turns to her and smiles.

Pike, tied to a chair by the fireplace while the others look for, food in the KITCHEN. Alone, Kendall walks past Pike:
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Kendall, talk to you for a sec?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Kendall looks around - there seems no harm in it.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hated West as much as I did. I'm not saying what I did was right, but you can't tell me you're not glad the motherfucker's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Kendall says nothing. Pike looks around, makes sure no one is listening and then whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The thing is, we've got a real opportunity here. You turn me in Tomorrow and we're both fucked-

</PIKE>
<KENDALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't think I want to hear this-
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENDALL>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone else can do the deed, it doesn't have to be you. Maybe Nunez too, he's got a tendency to follow Mueller, but the rest of us can come out ahead - the guys who took out their Sergeant's killers! We'll move the bodies out to the creek and say we came over the hill right as they fragged West, all we gotta do is tell the story right.

Kendall stares at him. Disgusted.

<KENDALL>

He turns and walks away. Pike watches him go.

INT. CABIN -- KITCHEN LAST NIGHT

Kendall, looking through the empty cabinets for food when A GUNSHOT -- From the living room. As Kendall bolts towards the noise, the air is filled with the sounds of SCREAMING and SHOOTING! He pushes through the door...

INT. CABIN -- LIVING ROOM -- LAST NIGHT

Kendall, coming through the door as we SLO-MO... Mueller, sprawled out on the floor, dead... Pike, tied to the chair, bullethole in his forehead... Nunez, wounded, stumbling out the front door into the hurricane... And a badly wounded Childs, pistol out, TURNING towards the SOUND OF THE DOOR and FIRING... Kendall's arm, HIT with a SLUG, and he starts to go down... FREEZE-FRAME -- On Kendall's form, falling.
</DIRECTION>
<KENDALL>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)

EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- DAWN
</DIRECTION>

The sounds of RUNNING and HEAVY BREATHING. Kendall's eyes flutter open. He's on Dunbar's back, being carried through the woods. The sound of GUNFIRE and a TREE BRANCH SHATTERS next to them. Someone is chasing them. Trying to kill them. Nunez.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dunbar bobs and weaves as another volley of bullets comes from behind and we can now hear ROTOR BLADES APPROACHING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CLEARING -- DAWN

As Dunbar bursts into the sunlight, carrying Kendall. The entire thing dreamlike, what we saw at the opening, but from KENDALL'S VIEWPOINT -- the helicopter overhead, Nunez behind, Dunbar turning and shooting, NUNEZ GOING DOWN...

	Why did he come back for you?

</HARDY>

Silence. Kendall's got nothing more to say.

<OSBORNE>

	I don't think that has anything to do with-

</OSBORNE>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That means under a year. Let me explain what ten years of police work has taught me - murder is basic. There are no conspiracies, no grand mysteries, and no evil puppet masters behind it all, pulling the strings; murder is shitty people doing a shitty thing to other shitty people - it doesn't always make sense but it's always neat. Dunbar's our guy.

Osborne struggles to put it into words.

Osborne turns, making her case to Styles.

	Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies - he didn't see any crime committed.

Later. The fury of the storm has increased. Kendall, Childs, Nunez, and Mueller, in the KITCHEN looking for food. IN THE LIVING ROOM Pike, tied to the chair. Dunbar sitting in a corner, listening to the hurricane rage outside. Pike watches him.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just like the first day, huh? You standing guard on me.

Dunbar starts to get up.

</DUNBAR>
<PIKE>

</PIKE>
<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's exactly what he says about you.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DUNBAR>

Dunbar walks over to Pike's pack and unzips it. Checks the little pocket. Pulls out a VIAL and a SYRINGE.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>

	Combat grade morphine. Mueller sold it to me. .

<DIRECTION>
Dunbar sits down. Not knowing what to say.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After that first night on the parade Grounds with you, I was bad - Exposure, malnutrition, the works. I needed something to keep me from crashing. Mueller found me.

</PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CADET SHOWERS -- EIGHT WEEKS AGO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Empty except for Pike. He sits, nude, curled up on the tile, as the nozzles blast STEAMING WATER down onto his shivering form. FOOTSTEPS approaching. Mueller. He leans down next to Pike, speaking to him. Kindly.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>

<PIKE>

<DIRECTION>
A beat. Dunbar gets to his feet.

<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.

<PIKE>

<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His chest was hamburger-

</DUNBAR>
<PIKE>

	That's close range. You go full auto on a guy from close range, you're gonna be swimming in blood. Look at my uniform. Nothing.

Dunbar looks. Not a speck of blood on it.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And where's Mueller's? When I came in, he was only wearing a t-shirt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Dunbar looks over to fireplace, where ashes are smoldering... FLASHCUT TO - When Dunbar first entered the Cabin: Mueller, standing there in a T-SHIRT, a FIRE burning in the hearth.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Way I figure it, West must have found out about their little business and was gonna bust them, so they decided to get rid of him first...

West emerges from the bush at a sprint.

Six feet away from West, Mueller suddenly raises his rifle and PULLS THE TRIGGER.

Kendall and Childs, running in the direction of the grenade...

He tackles Kendall into the mud.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED -- EARLIER LAST NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Mueller, smoking rifle in hand, uniform covered in blood stands over WEST'S DEAD BODY. He turns and runs off INTO THE BRUSH. A moment later, Childs and Kendall come into view at the top of the embankment...
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>

The hurricane outside GROWING LOUDER as the Cabin ROCKS again. The sound of WOOD SNAPPING. Pike stares up at the roof.

The cabin SHIFTS again. Dunbar stares at him.

	What about him, huh? Maybe he offed the Sarge and changed shirts, brought an extra one in his pack. Y'ever think of that? Go ahead, cut him loose! First chance he gets, he'll waste the rest of us, that's how they work-

Pike leans forward.
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You stupid white trash motherfucker, I saw you do it-
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
And Mueller FIRES. Pike's head SNAPS BACK. The gunshot, DEAFENING. Then, for an eternity, SILENCE. Nobody moves. Nobody breathes. As if time has stopped.
</DIRECTION>
<KENDALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.. . my God...

Mueller lowers his arm, the pistol clattering to the floor. His face, as shocked as the others.
</DIRECTION>
<MUELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wouldn't... stop talking...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUELLER>

He takes a step forward towards Pike. A hole in the middle of the black man's forehead.

Almost mechanically, Dunbar begins to reach for his own gun... The unmistakable sound of a two rifles' magazines being RACKED simultaneously. Dunbar turns to see Childs and Nunez, their M-16's in hand. Levelled at him.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get that hand away.

Dunbar does. Looks to Nunez.

<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<CHILDS>

	We can still come out of this okay. Pike got free, he got a gun, he came after us. That's the story.

Mueller collapses on the ground. Head in hands.

<MUELLER>

</CHILDS>
<KENDALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You framed-him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENDALL>
<CHILDS>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILDS>
<DIRECTION>
Dunbar and Kendall, looking at each other. It's clear what the wrong answer will mean. A long beat, until
</DIRECTION>
<KENDALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay-
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENDALL>
<DIRECTION>
He is cut off as the WIND outside ROARS - the HURRICANE mounting to it's FULL FORCE - and the WINDOWS BLOW INWARDS, showering Childs, Mueller, and Nunez with glass! Dunbar's hand flies to his pistol, PULLING IT... Mueller, SCREAMING, trying to claw the glass from his EYES... Childs, seeing Dunbar move, PULLS THE TRIGGER. .. . And the cabin is filled with the THUNDER OF GUNFIRE as Kendall goes down, clutching his ARM... DUNBAR FIRES, hitting Childs directly in the chest... Childs, still shooting, falls back, his random spray of bullets PUNCHING INTO MUELLER who jerks like a marionette... Nunez, drawing a bead on Dunbar, about to shoot, when... A great CRESCENDO of WOOD SPLINTERING and SUPPORTS BUCKLING overtakes them and the CABIN'S ROOF COMES DOWN ON THEIR HEADS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DEMOLISHED CABIN -- FIRST LIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hours later. The rain has lessened and the Hurricane has begun to lift as Dunbar pulls himself from the debris. Hearing a FAINT CRY from his left.
</DIRECTION>

Kendall. Half conscious, his arm, bloody. Dunbar slings the man across his shoulders as the rising sun begins to peak through the clouds overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- SUNRISE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dunbar, carrying Kendall towards the clearing when GUNFIRE comes from behind. He turns to look... Nunez. The only other survivor from the Cabin. A hundred yards back, rifle in hand, coming after them with a vengeance. Dunbar, sprinting towards the clearing, bullets at his heels and as he bursts from the tree line he looks up to see a HELICOPTER OVERHEAD
</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then I killed the last of them.

Osborne blinks, like a trance has been broken.

	Yeah... yeah, sure.

She goes over to the machine and pours a cup.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shot Childs and Nunez.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They would have killed us both. You want me to write a confession, I'll write a confession.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You saved Kendall's life-

Their faces say "no". Osborne spreads a MAP out on the table.

<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's the cabin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>
<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't know on a map. West told us it was there, we just found it. Maybe the hurricane took it away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Raymond, for you to have any chance of coming out of this, we need to locate the other bodies and examine them to corroborate your testimony. Otherwise this is just another story-
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Hardy, I joined the army for college money. I didn't ask for any of this - I tried to do the right thing out there and people got killed. You say finding those bodies'll help me, then go find them. I don't want to die.

EXT. FOR MCKINLEY -- CORRIDORS -- DAY

<DIRECTION>
Hardy and Osborne, walking and talking.
</DIRECTION>
<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or ho hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And they're smart about it. They know when you commit a crime you know is going to be investigated, you need a fall guy and for that to work, you have to have a witness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dunbar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly, someone who's not involved, who's word can't be questioned. You only let them see what you want them to see, you make them believe, so when the time comes, they've totally bought into your version of events.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if they're asked, that's what they'll tell the, world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the Cover story-
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kendall maybe would have agreed, but The hurricane buttfucks the cabin-
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buttfucks the cabin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And all hell breaks loose. A lot of Good guys shoot a lot of bad guys and whiz, bang, zoom, happy ending.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That bugs you too?

Hardy lays a piece of paper on Styles' desk.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dunbar's confession. It should be enough to get you out of trouble.

Styles looks at it and then slowly up to Hardy.
</DIRECTION>
<STYLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want Kendall, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STYLES>
<OSBORNE>

	He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.

</OSBORNE>

Hardy nods, agreeing. Styles stares at them.
</DIRECTION>
<STYLES>

Styles nods and looks to his desk. Almost to himself:
</DIRECTION>
<STYLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't get to be a Colonel without compromising. Without getting out of the way of the bigger dogs. You politic, play it safe, think of the career first. And when things get dirty, you just look the other way...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STYLES>

He looks back up at Hardy. His eyes, steeled.

<KENDALL>

	No, but it got you interested, didn't it? Got you to dig. Inspired Ray to tell you terribly sordid tales about drugs and creek beds and dead little sergeants who stuck their noses where they didn't belong.

	Why did you tell us he shot everybody, Levi? You put him in for three murders, the man saved your life-
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<KENDALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I should stay silent about his misdeeds? The guns went off, I ran in, Childs shot me, Pike and Mueller were dead, and Dunbar was running out the door with the smoking gun-
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENDALL>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dunbar was running out the door? Ohhhhhh... See that's where I was confused, because I thought you said Nunez was running out the door.

<KENDALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I said Dunbar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENDALL>

(off Kendall's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah we taped the last interview. This one too. Cause it'd be a real break for us to catch you in a lie.

<DIRECTION>
Silence. They wait for Kendall's reaction. He looks momentarily flustered by this... and then he smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<KENDALL>

	I believe your next line is "What are you trying to hide?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENDALL>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<KENDALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry to disappoint. I'm on painkillers for the injury - they cloud the mind. You're right, it was Nunez. Any more questions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENDALL>
<DIRECTION>
Hardy doesn't know what to say. That was his ace card.
</DIRECTION>
<KENDALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't get me wrong, Mueller and Childs were quite the pair, the type of guys you didn't feel comfortable going to sleep around. Completely capable of murder. But as I said, I didn't hear the exchange before the shooting. I wasn't in the room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENDALL>
<DIRECTION>
Osborne furrows her brow at this as Hardy continues.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dunbar will testify that you were.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<KENDALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then we'll leave it up to the courts - His word against mine. What does his father do again? Steelworker?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't matter, I'm sure justice will be served. In any case, my father will definitely want to talk to you about all these questions, these accusations on his son. He's quite protective.

Smiling, she stops the tape. Then turns to Kendall.
</DIRECTION>
<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you.

<DIRECTION>
He pauses, taking a shaky sip of water.
</DIRECTION>
<KENDALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was in on the PX thing. He and Mueller and me, we were making thousands. West found out. Childs said we were just gonna scare him - Use my Dad's clout. I had this whole speech prepared about how if he ratted us, his career was over. We met him in the creek bed but before I said anything...

</DIRECTION>
<KENDALL>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told him what had really happened to West. Told him to keep quiet about it or I'd destroy him. Because if it came out that I was involved with the whole PX scam, my father would be finished.

Hardy smiles and gets up. Walking slowly to Kendall's bed.

Kendall nods, still a little teary.

And then. His mouth SLAMS SHUT. Teeth cracking together over and over again like a metronome on speed, and his body JERKS HORRIBLY, going horizontal, SHAKING VIOLENTLY!

Later. Hardy and Osborne sit in silence, eyes downcast. Waiting. Hardy pulls his last cigarette from the pack, lights it, crumples the pack and tosses it into a garbage can.

<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanted to get the truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>
<HARDY>

	No, I didn't. I wanted to humiliate him. For what he did to Dunbar. For fucking over the little guy.

</HARDY>
<OSBORNE>

	You mean the falsely accused?

She looks back to the floor. Hardy takes a drag from the cigarette, and then tosses that away too. The door opens and Styles walks into the room. Somber.
</DIRECTION>
<STYLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's over. Time of death was 4:42. JAG's been notified and I called the Senator myself. My report will reflect that his medical condition made this unavoidable... you two had no culpability in the matter.

He sighs and takes a seat next to them.

Hardy says nothing.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't know where to start.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>

Styles nods, understanding.

	But that wasn't enough. You needed a new identity, because no one was going to believe James Randall Pike, convicted felon, had acted so nobly in the face of danger - you needed a name people could trust, one that hadn't been to jail, one that hadn't publicly been West's bitch boy.

<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't do that now, though, can you?

Dunbar looks at them. One to the other. Slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that what I did, now? And of course, you can prove all of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself-
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>
<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I ever claim I was Raymond Dunbar? Was I ever told to state my name rank and serial number for the record? No. You assumed who I was, because I was wearing this uniform. Don't believe me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches under the table and rips out the HIDDEN MICROPHONE.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Check your tapes.

</DUNBAR>

Hardy and Osborne exchange an uneasy glance.

<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't need the tapes-

</HARDY>
<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you don't? What else do you have on me? You haven't found any bodies yet, have you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've found all of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>

Dunbar chuckles at the bluff.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ohhhh, I don't think so...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>
<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a guess. Maybe they're not where they're supposed to be. Maybe somebody moved them. Habeas Corpus - no bodies, no crime, and Nunez still plays as self defense. Face it detectives ... you have nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
Hardy, knowing he's right. In a flash he reaches down PULLS OSBORNE'S GUN and grabs Dunbar, SLAMMING him up against the wall, pressing the weapon TO HIS TEMPLE!
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>

	Not true, Cadet, I've got a gun-

</HARDY>
<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, please don't-

</DUNBAR>

A POUNDING on the locked door. Hardy ignores it.

</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll never find it cause HE'S NOT DEAD!

A CRASH as the door's lock SNAPS and M.P.'s POUR into the room! Styles and the JAG Lawyer behind, taking in the scene.

<HARDY>

<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There never was an exercise! Never targets, never teams, I don't even know if there's a creek bed out there-
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
As the M.P.'s grab Hardy and Osborne, pulling them away...
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>

</HARDY>
<JAG_LAWYER>

The JAG Lawyer glowers as the M.P.'s stand down. Dunbar tries to pull himself together. To Hardy:
</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. I was the one he singled out. Beat me morning, noon, and night, ran me ragged. When Mueller found me, I was gone. He gave me a little taste...

Dunbar, alone, sleeve rolled up, arm tied off: Sliding the needle into his vein...
</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was his game, see? Ride the cadets so hard they'd need something to stay on their feet. Then he'd send Mueller or Kendall to them, waving around their magic needle promising to make it all go away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
He hits the plunger, injecting. His face goes tranquil.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't a new thing either. He'd been doing this for years. Every nine weeks, a new class of cadets, new potential customers. The amount of money involved over that period of time... this was some high stakes shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a deep breath, looking at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dunbar moved his through the kitchen. I worked in the motor pool and hooked all the mechanics. By the time the hurricane hit, we were all in. Some using, some pushing, some both. But then something happened. West heard one of us was about to talk, to blow his whole operation. He figured he'd made enough money, had enough of the army, maybe it was time to disappear. But first he was gonna teach us one last thing.

The six men stand in rigid formation, eyes on West.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen! It has come to my attention that there is a traitor in our midst. Someone who was going to break the code of fraternal brotherhood that I have endeavored to create in all of you. Perhaps that failure is mine. But we take care of our own. And this traitor must be made to pay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
He walks down the line of the six men, eyeing each of them. Finally stopping at one. Putting a hand on his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nunez.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run.

</WEST>
<NUNEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I wasn't-
	</DIALOGUE>
</NUNEZ>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you were. Cadet Mueller found the letter you'd written to the Colonel in your locker. You were going to betray us all. Now, run.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
He points to the door. The hurricane, RAGING outside. Nunez looks to the others, then the door, and understands. He takes off running out the door. Gone. West walks over to a table covered with a tarp. Pulls the cloth aside to reveal M-16's, PISTOLS, and GRENADES.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now we'll see whose training's paid off the most. You are to hunt Cadet Nunez down and bring his body back to me. If you fail and he escapes, we all go down together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
The remaining five cadets, understanding there is no place for friendship or kindness here. This is life and death. They walk to the table and gear up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- LAST NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lightning, thunder, and rain as Nunez runs unarmed through the thick brush. SOMEWHERE BEHIND HIM - The other five fan out, rifles up, following his trail, ready to kill.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was insanity. We were hunting a man down to kill him.

ON MUELLER Making his way down embankment, M-l6 out, ready for anything. From behind him, MOVEMENT...
</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He got Mueller first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
Nunez TACKLES HIM at full speed, feet SLIPPING on the wet hill, and the two TUMBLE head first into a GULLY. Punching, kicking, biting, anything to stop the other man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nunez, CHOKING Mueller as he strains to reach his gun...
</DIRECTION>
<MUELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roberto...

With a HEAVE, Nunez SNAPS HIS NECK. Mueller lies still.

<DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He took his gun. Used it on Childs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
Nunez spins, seeing CHILDS BEHIND HIM. He DIVES as Childs fires! Hits the ground in a roll, comes up with Mueller's rifle, and SHOOTS - BLOWING CHILDS BACK against the wet rocks.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't imagine what it was like. Having your friends try to kill you...

Nunez slumps against the gully's wall, breathing hard. In agony over what he's just had to do.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	But you do what you have to survive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
Closing his eyes, Nunez steels himself. Wipes the blood from his hands and climbs out of the gully. ELSEWHERE PIKE, creeping through the foliage. Trying to listen for sounds of movement through the storm. His eyes narrow as he hears a HIGH PITCHED WHINE... The bullet hits his forehead dead center. He crumples. PULL BACK TO REVEAL - Nunez in a tree, thirty meters away. Lowering his rifle. He climbs down.

</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It came to me in a split second. Change clothes, change identities. If James Pike gets discharged he goes right back to jail. But if I was Dunbar, I could walk away from all this with a new life. But then...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
As he reaches down for the uniform, a SHOT RINGS OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KENDALL FALLS, wounded in the arm. Dunbar raises his rifle to find Nunez, standing ten yards away, gun trained on him. YELLING OVER THE HURRICANE:
</DIRECTION>
<NUNEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put it down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NUNEZ>
<DIRECTION>
A Mexican stand-off. The rain continues to fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just want to go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
Nunez shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<NUNEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were gonna kill me, Pike! Thought you were my friend!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NUNEZ>
<DIRECTION>
Dunbar, torn. He can't bring himself to shoot, but he can't surrender either.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to get Kendall to a hospital!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<NUNEZ>

<DIRECTION>
Silence. The two men still facing each other.
</DIRECTION>
<NUNEZ>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>

	We don't have to do this! You go that way, I'll go this way!

<NUNEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DUNBAR>

	You killed three people! Isn't that enough for one night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
More silence. Neither moves. The sky above, a maelstrom.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to die out here, Roberto! Do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
Nunez, staring at him. Deciding.
</DIRECTION>
<NUNEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you even twitch...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NUNEZ>
<DIRECTION>
Dunbar nods. Nunez begins backing away, rifle still trained on him. And then Dunbar spies something behind and to the left of Nunez... West. Staring down at him from behind some brush. Watching. Nunez, slowly backing away. He pauses as his foot catches on a fallen branch. Looks away from Dunbar for a split second to step over it... West nods to Dunbar as if to say "Go on. . . "
</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive me. ..
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
And Dunbar FIRES. Nunez, caught by the burst, GOES DOWN. The echo of the gunshots, swallowed by the storm. Dunbar lowers his head in agony. West walks down.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congratulations, Cadet Pike. You get the gold star.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
Dunbar stares at his Sergeant through the rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DUN_BAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUN_BAR>
<DIRECTION>
West smiles. Tilts his head to Kendall.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd best get him out of here. Don't worry about the bodies, they'll be taken care of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
Dunbar doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is where we part ways, Cadet. You tell them I died out here, or I'll come back for you. Tell them one of the others did me. Mueller, Childs, I don't care who. You and Kendall, you tell them a story.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can tell a story, can't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
Dunbar doesn't reply. West laughs and flips him a salute.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dismissed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
And West turns and walks away, stepping over Nunez. Giving Dunbar a clear shot at his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dunbar raises his rifle, wanting, needing, dying to shoot the old man...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he can't. West disappears into the bayou.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GROAN from the ground. Kendall. Dunbar's reverie broken, he leans down, beginning to unbutton the Dunbar Uniform...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COFFEE ROOM -- PRESENT EVENING

Dunbar stubs out a cigarette, finished. Hardy, Osborne, Styles, and the JAG Lawyer gaping at what he has just said.

<JAG_LAWYER>

Dunbar says nothing.

<JAG_LAWYER>

</JAG_LAWYER>
<DUNBAR>

<DIRECTION>
(looking at Hardy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We both should have died out there with our brothers. I know that now.

Silence. The JAG Lawyer looks to Hardy, all anger gone.

<JAG_LAWYER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take him now if you don't mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAG_LAWYER>
<DIRECTION>
Hardy nods. Dunbar rises and slowly walks to the door. Turning back to Hardy.
</DIRECTION>
<DUNBAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me, detective. Did you get what you wanted?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNBAR>
<DIRECTION>
Hardy shakes his head, sadly.

<HARDY>

They leave. Styles walks over to Hardy.

<STYLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tom-

Hardy holds up a hand, cutting him off. Styles nods, understanding, and leaves, closing the door behind him. Hardy and Osborne stand there. Not speaking. It's done.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FORT MCKINLEY -- OFFICER'S CLUB -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several hours and bourbons later, Hardy sits at the bar, drunk and alone. Out of place, the only one not in uniform. Osborne walks in, locates Hardy, and strides over to the bar, a sheaf of papers under her arm. Her face, stoic.
</DIRECTION>
<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need to talk-
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seven.

</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a slug of his drink.
</DIRECTION>
<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seven guys. What was it you said? You were "just starting to believe I wasn't the guy people said".

</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
He chuckles.

<HARDY>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seven. That's the answer to Kendall's question. How many? Seven.

<DIRECTION>
Osborne looks at him. Realizing what he's saying.
</DIRECTION>
<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't the time-
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the perfect time. You know what makes a good detective? The number of confessions they get. You're a good detective, Osborne. So now you get mine.

	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
He pours himself another drink.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thing about taking money is, you don't have to do anything. You just sit there. Maybe you don't return a phone call. Maybe you don't follow up a lead. But that's it. Keep the money, your work's done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
Osborne stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seven unsolved murders. And you know what? It didn't weigh on my conscience. Not one goddamn bit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>

He takes a slug from his glass and grimaces.
</DIRECTION>
<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not true.

<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really.

Hardy stares at her.

<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I may not be growing on you, but you're sure as hell growing on me.

</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
He motions to the bartender for another glass, but Osborne takes his hand, stopping him.
</DIRECTION>
<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And because you're a good man, I know you'll do the right thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>
<DIRECTION>
Hardy looks at her, questioning. Osborne takes a deep breath.
</DIRECTION>
<OSBORNE>

</OSBORNE>
<DIRECTION>
She puts the papers on the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are the requisitions from the PX, the ones used to release the drugs to Mueller. West signed half of them - Pike was telling the truth. Look who signed the other half.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>
<DIRECTION>
She taps the bottom of the paper. Hardy, not wanting to believe it. He looks up at her, pained.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I have a choice in this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>

Hardy stares at his glass. Deciding.

<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck it. Let's go finish this.

</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STYLES' OFFICE -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Styles, finishing his paperwork. He rises and turns off his desk light, bathing the office in DARKNESS. He's about to leave when he notices a SILHOUETTE in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"You have to get out of the way of the bigger dogs". That was good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
Styles squints at the figure.
</DIRECTION>
<STYLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tom, is that you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STYLES>
<DIRECTION>
Hardy steps forward, into the office.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was so good, I actually forgot you're one of the bigger dogs now. The Base Commander. The one in control.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
You couldn't let him testify, could you?
</DIRECTION>
<STYLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STYLES>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you let him testify then it would have all come out. West was supposed to take care of it out there, shut Nunez up and then disappear. But it got messy and people got killed. So you called your old pal Tom Hardy, figuring if worse came to worse, he'd cover for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<STYLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're drunk-
	</DIALOGUE>
</STYLES>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going to cover for you, Bill. Not for this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
Styles, realizing what Hardy's talking about.
</DIRECTION>
<STYLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look-
	</DIALOGUE>
</STYLES>
<DIRECTION>
He begins to move from behind his desk.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay where you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<STYLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or what? You've gone round the bend-
	</DIALOGUE>
</STYLES>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	West had a partner. Someone who knew how to get things done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
Hardy throws the papers onto Styles' desk.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I can't understand is why you signed these. If you'd just let West take care of the paperwork, no one would have known, but you got careless. So when Pike finally told the truth you had to get rid of him, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<STYLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's preposterous-
	</DIALOGUE>
</STYLES>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Toxicology report came back. Kendall's attack was caused by a drug known as anephadrine, maybe you've heard of it. It's for asthmatics. If an epileptic takes enough, it kills them. I checked with the nurses at the hospital - you're the only other person who visited Kendall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<STYLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wanted to see if he was okay-
	</DIALOGUE>
</STYLES>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You poisoned him, Bill. You heard our interrogation, you knew he was ready to crack, so you killed him, just like Pike.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<STYLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not even going to dignify that-
	</DIALOGUE>
</STYLES>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! You will stand there and you will listen! What happened to you, Bill? You were the one who joined up to do good in the world. You were the one who believed in it-
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<STYLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to get into a finger pointing contest about character? The army kicked you out for drugs, the cops fired you for taking bribes from a mobster, and you think you can stand there and lecture me on codes of conduct? There's only one criminal standing in this room and it's you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STYLES>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not for long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
He walks towards the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No more witnesses. West's a ghost. But it doesn't matter because we have your signature, the hospital log, and Kendall's toxicology report. And that'll be enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<STYLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're crazy-
	</DIALOGUE>
</STYLES>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't duck this, Bill. I may have done every goddamn thing in my life wrong but I won't let this happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<STYLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the last time, I have no idea what you're talking about-

</STYLES>
<HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
(squinting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get your hands away from the desk!

</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
In the darkness we see Styles MOVE SUDDENLY...
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Osborne, gun!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
Hardy DIVES to the floor - Osborne in the doorway, PISTOL raised, FIRES TWO SHOTS! Muzzle flare lighting the room for a split second as Styles is BLOWN BACK against the wall! Hardy gets to his feet and flicks on the LIGHT. Styles lies slumped in the corner, two holes in his chest. Dead. Osborne lowers her weapon, shaking. Hardy points to the top desk drawer, which is open. Inside it sits an IVORY HANDLED PISTOL. Fully loaded, safety off. It's presence tells them everything they need to know.
</DIRECTION>
<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's West's, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>
<DIRECTION>
Hardy nods and then turns to look down at Styles' body.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now it's over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FORT MCKINLEY -- PARADE GROUNDS -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The aftermath. Flashing blue and red lights from parked Military Police vehicles illuminate the grounds as M.P. 'S string crime scene tape around the front entrance of the building, securing the site for investigation. Hardy takes in the entire scene from afar. Standing by his GTO, watching as several M.P.'s finish questioning Osborne. When she's done she spies Hardy and walks over to him.
</DIRECTION>
<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing out here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leaving without saying goodbye. What are you gonna do?

</HARDY>
<OSBORNE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Want company?

</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
Osborne smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A word of advice about women - that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should probably write that down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. .
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>
<DIRECTION>
Hardy pulls a card from his pocket and hands it to her.
</DIRECTION>
<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your phone number?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In case you need me to testify about the shooting. They'll clear you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was your friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. But he was a lot of other things, too. Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
She nods. An awkward moment. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
He turns away. Walking towards his car.
</DIRECTION>
<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Hardy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns back. She walks up and holds something out to him. A ten dollar bill.
</DIRECTION>
<OSBORNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I owe you this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSBORNE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down at the money.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You saved my life tonight. Keep it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, don't keep it, I need the money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the bill and Osborne laughs. He climbs into his car and starts it. Grinning at her through the open window.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're one of the good ones, Osborne. Don't sweat the details.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARDY>
<DIRECTION>
He puts the GTO in gear and drives off. She watches him go, then looks down at his card. Smiling. Maybe she will call.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OSBORNE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT

A bottle of Scotch at her side, Osborne slips a tape marked "BASIC TRAINING INTRO - SGT. N. WEST" into her VCR. Settles back to watch it. West's face fills the screen.

EXT. LOUISIANA BAYOU -- CREEK BED -- LAST NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
24 hours ago. The hurricane rages. A HAND pulls the PIN on a phosphorous grenade and CHUCKS IT. It blows, frying brush and nothing more. West comes over the hill, running to investigate. He stops at what he sees. Nunez stands unarmed in the creek bed, SURROUNDED by the other Section Eight Cadets. A prisoner.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>

West doesn't move. Kendall walks over and DISARMS West, pushing him into the circle next to the terrified Nunez.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>

	Fuck that. You little pissers really think you can throw a scare into me?

Dunbar raises his rifle and SHOOTS NUNEZ. He goes down, twitches once and lies still. Dead. West looks at Dunbar.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>

	You're gonna have to do a lot better than that, son.

<HARDY>
<DIRECTION>

	How about this?

</HARDY>

And with that, Tom Hardy emerges from the brush carrying, a COMBAT KNIFE. West's eyes sparkle with recognition.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't I kick your ass out for this drug thing fifteen years ago?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
Hardy just smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<WEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should've known you were involved in this. Come on then. Let's see you try and stick me-
	</DIALOGUE>
</WEST>
<DIRECTION>
Moving faster than West thought imaginable, Hardy moves and the knife FLASHES, CUTTING WEST OPEN stem to sternum. Hardy grips the older man by the shoulders, lowering him to the ground as he dies. Whispering in his ear:
</DIRECTION>
<HARDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stem to sternum. You taught me well, Sarge.
	</DIALOGUE>

And WEST DIES. A moment of utter silence and then VOICES FROM THE PAST begin coming back to us:
