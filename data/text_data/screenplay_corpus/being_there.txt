:SC: EXT. TOWNHOUSE GARDEN - WASHINGTON, D.C. - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An afternoon in late November, the leaves have left the trees, and the early darkness of a winter dusk approaches. The garden is long and narrow, guarded on either side by a high brick wall. At one end stands the rear of a three-story brick townhouse; at the other, a one story brick building. CLASSICAL MUSIC is heard in the distance. A MAN, handsomely dressed in a well-tailored suit of the 1920's, works in the garden. A gardener's apron protects his suit from the earth as he turns the loam along one of the walkways. He works slowly,-precisely, obviously engrossed in his surroundings. This man is called CHANCE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chance stops working for a moment, takes a pocket watch from inside his coat, checks the time. He looks to the darkening skies, returns the watch to his pocket. As Chance starts toward the one story brick building, he takes a spotless rag from his apron pocket and wipes the dirt from the tines of his pitchfork.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. GARAGE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of the music increases as Chance enters the garage from the garden. A gleaming 1921 TOURING CAR is revealed as he walks through the garage and leans the pitchfork against a wall. Chance takes a neatly folded cover from a shelf, carefully puts it over the car. When he finishes covering the car for the night, Chance picks up the pitchfork, leaves the garage through a side entry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. POTTING ROOM - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Potting Room is filled with the tools of the gardener, everything arranged in an orderly fashion. Rows of small pots are on tables, young plants sprouting from some of them. A small, 1940's table model black-and-white TV rests on a shelf. It is playing, tuned to the BOSTON POPS ORCHESTRA. Attached to the front of the screen is a wheel containing colored gels. The wheels spins, creates an early form of color TV. As Chance enters, his attention is on the television set. He watches it as he oils the tines of the pitchfork and puts it away. Chance turns off the TV and leaves the room, but the sound of the Boston Pops continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A room adjacent to the Potting Room. A large screen remote control color television set dominates the room. It is on, tuned to the Boston Pops. In contrast to the new TV, the rest of the room is sparsely but tastefully decorated with expensive furniture of the twenties. There are no books, magazines, newspapers or reading matter of any kind to be seen. Chance comes in, watches the TV with a detached gaze as he removes his apron. He changes the channel with the remote control as he puts his apron and the pitchfork rag into a laundry bag. He takes off his suit jacket, hangs it in the closet where it is accompanied by several others, all of like quality. Chance changes the channel once again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. GARDEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chance, wearing a different suit and carrying the laundry bag, crosses from the rear building to the main house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MAIN HOUSE - REAR ENTRANCE/HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The interior of the main house has the mustiness of age, the warmth of oak. White dropcloths and sheets cover all of the furniture. Chance enters, walks through the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MAIN HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large dropcloth is over the dining room table and chairs. It is neatly folded back at one end, leaving one chair and place setting uncovered. A small portable color TV is next to the place setting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chance enters, puts his laundry bag on a covered table near the doorway. He sits at the dining room table, turns on the TV, and carefully unfolds his napkin, puts it on his lap as he watches the screen. LOUISE, an elderly black maid, enters with a tray of food and Chance's clean laundry.

Louise disappears through the doorway. Chance continues to eat and watch TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CHANCE'S ROOM - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chance is asleep, lying on his back. His eyes slowly open, and, with no change of expression, he sits up and turns on the TV with the remote control. Chance gets out of bed, goes to the dresser and takes his pocket watch out of a drawer, checks the time. He crosses to the closet, his eyes never straying from an early morning show on television. He puts on a bathrobe and leaves the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. POTTING ROOM - DAWN

<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. GARDEN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A light snow is falling. The door to the small building opens, Chance peeks out, then goes back inside. A few seconds pass and Chance reappears, this time with an umbrella. Smartly dressed in suit and tie, he crosses to the main house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MAIN HOUSE - REAR ENTRANCE/HALLWAY - MORNING

Chance opens the door, shakes off and closes the umbrella before entering. He hangs the umbrella on a doorknob, then heads for the dining room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Repeating his ritual, Chance enters the dining room, sits, turns on the TV, carefully spreads his napkin on his lap. He watches the screen for a moment, then turns, expecting Louise. She doesn't appear, so he turns back, watches TV. After a few beats, Chance hears Louise's footsteps hurrying down the stairs. She comes into the dining room, visibly distraught. Chance looks up, smiles.

</CHANCE>
<LOUISE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!

<LOUISE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Louise throws back the cover from a chair next to Chance and sits, softening a bit toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUISE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ...

Chance comes out of a doorway adjoining the main staircase. He moves off down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MAIN HOUSE - OLD MAN'S ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The furniture in this room is not covered with sheets but the Old Man is. There is a polite knock at the door, then Chance enters the room. As Chance moves slowly to the Old Man's bed, we sense a feeling of respect from Chance, as well as a bit of curiosity. Chance stands by the side of the bed for a moment, then he reaches down and gently pulls the sheet back from the Old Man's face. He touches the man's forehead, lightly, briefly, then replaces the sheet. Chance moves to the TV (like the one in his own room) and turns it on. He sits in an easy chair next to the Old man's bed and watches a movie from the early forties. Chance puts an arm out, rests it on the Old Man's covered body. With the other, he changes the channels with the remote control. He returns to the channel with the forties movie and seems to become absorbed in a scene in which a gentleman tips his hat to a lady. The scene seems to have 'sunk into' his mind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. GARDEN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It has stopped snowing. Chance, wearing a hat, the gardening apron over his suit and boots, putters in the garden. Louise comes out of the main house. She is dressed warmly, a scarf over her head, a heavy coat. Chance sees her, tips his hat to Louise exactly like the man he saw on television.

Chance, wearing the slippers, enters and sits at his place. He turns on the TV, puts the napkin on his lap. He watches TV for a moment, then turns, looks for Louise. She does not appear so he resumes watching TV. He changes channels, views a wildly exciting FOOTBALL game. At a peak in the excitement, he again switches channels. Chance watches TV News coverage of the PRESIDENT of the United States greeting foreign dignitaries at the White House. CLOSE SHOTS on television reveal that the President uses a two-handed handshake when meeting his guests. Unconsciously, Chance grips one hand with the other, the scene on TV seeming to have 'sunk into' his mind.

<DIRECTION>
A fashionable area. Expensive shops, well-kept streets and sidewalks. A television store has caught Chance's eye. He stands by the display window, looks in at a dozen or so color TVs, all turned on, playing various channels. A video camera points outward from a corner of the window and is focused on the sidewalk to allow potential customers to see themselves live on an Advent TV. Chance is intrigued by his own image. He poses, lifts one arm, then the other to make sure that it is really him on television. He moves forward, smiles, then moves slowly backward, notices himself become smaller on the screen. He steps back off the curb, frowns as his likeness disappears from frame on the Advent. Standing between two parked cars, Chance takes out his remote control, clicks it at the Advent. Four or five other sets in the window change channels, but he does not reappear on the giant screen. As he does this, the car to his,left, a large, American-made limousine, backs up. The car bumps Chance, pins him against the car to his right. Chance cries out in pain, drops his suitcase, his changer, and bangs his hand on the trunk of the limo. The chauffeur, DAVID, and the liveryman, JEFFREY, immediately jump from the car, run back to Chance.

Eve presses a button, the glass partition closes. As the window rolls up behind him, Jeffrey dials the limo telephone.

Two uniformed valets, WILSON and PERKINS, await the limousines by the front door of the Rand mansion. Wilson stands behind a wheelchair. As the limo parks, Perkins and Jeffrey assist Chance into the chair. Wilson turns to Eve as she gets out of the limo.

	Stay here? Is that necessary?

	Yes, when I was younger I had thoughts about public office... But I found, Chauncey - that I was able to contribute more as a private citizen... of course, my wealth provided me with considerable influence, but I've tried, believe me, not to misuse that power... It's extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of eminence, that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country... The temptations are strong, and I've been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many, but I have tried to stay open to voices of the people... I have tried to remain honest to myself...

There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point.

Rand is in bed. Eve, Chance and Allenby are seated around him, the two nurses standing to one side. They all watch the President's address to the Financial Institute on TV. Chance inhales deeply, enjoys the oxygen in the room. Rand is looking weaker. Every so often, Allenby casts a concerned glance his way.
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... And there are so many of you that have proclaimed that we are on the brink of the worst financial crisis in this nation's history. And there are so many of you demanding that we put into effect drastic measures to alter its course. Well, let me tell you, gentlemen, I have been conducting multiple-level consultations with members of the Cabinet, House and Senate. I have conducted meetings with prominent business leaders throughout the country. And this very morning I had an in-depth discussion with your founder and Chairman-Of-The-Board, Mr. Benjamin Turnbull Rand and his close friend and advisor Mr. Chauncey Gardiner...

	</DIALOGUE>
</DUPONT>
<CHANCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I know the garden very well. I have worked in it all my life. It is a good garden and a healthy one; its trees are healthy and so are its shrubs and flowers, as long as they are trimmed and watered in the right seasons. The garden needs a lot of care. I do agree with the President; everything in it will grow strong, and there is plenty of room in it for new trees and new flowers of all kinds.

Eve suddenly begins to cry, sobbing quietly at first, then losing control, the tears flowing freely. To comfort her, Chance puts his arm around her shoulder, nearly tipping his breakfast tray. Eve responds to his touch, draws closer, holds Chance tightly. Chance does his best to avoid spilling his breakfast, keep an eye on the TV, and to comfort Eve. She gives in to her desires, begins to caress Chance, running her hand over his body. She kisses him, his eyes, his neck, his lips, his ears. Chance does not return the lovemaking, and Eve eventually catches hold of herself, stops. She lies quietly beside Chance for a time, regains her demeanor, then speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>

<KARPATOV>

	Apparently the White House shares our curiosity - they have also launched an investigation, and, according to our sources, neither the F.B.I. nor the C.I.A. has met with success.

<SKRAPINOV>

<COURTNEY>

	... It's strictly rumor at this stage, Lyman - just something in the wind...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COURTNEY>
<STUART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something rather big in the wind, I'd say. So whose files were destroyed? The CIA's or the FBI's?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STUART>
<COURTNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Like I said, it's just rumor so far, but we should start nosing around, see if we can talk to some people...

</COURTNEY>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA begins to slowly MOVE AWAY from their table.
</DIRECTION>
<STUART>
	<DIALOGUE>

(his voice fades)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... A criminal record? A membership in a subversive organization? Homosexual, perhaps?

The SOUND of Stuart's voice dissolves into Thomas Franklin's as the CAMERA SETTLES on Dr. Allenby and Franklin sitting at a table nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... And he told us that he had been living there since he was a child, working as a gardener. He showed us a room in the garage, where he said he stayed, and I... Well, I didn't really believe him, of course - but why the act?

</FRANKLIN>
<ALLENBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no idea...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLENBY>
<FRANKLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Another thing that baffles me, Doctor - what was his connection with the deceased? Major financial dealings, obviously - but our firm has no record of any such transactions.

<ALLENBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmmm. You say he showed you his garden?

	One of those little things you don't know about me yet, darling - I'm a little shy.

</EVE>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles, gets in bed and pulls the covers over herself. Chance divides his attention between Eve and the TV, watching both with an equal detachment. Eve begins to respond to her own touch, finds a heretofore undiscovered pleasure with her own body. Chance changes the channel as she reaches orgasm. As Eve's body trembles, Chance yawns, gets up from the bed.

<DIRECTION>
A light snow is failing. Eve is in a fur coat, holds a steaming cup of coffee. Chance stands next to her, an umbrella in one hand. He holds his other arm out, catching the snowflakes as they fall.
</DIRECTION>
<EVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... And I feel so free now, Chauncey. Until I met you, I never felt acknowledged by a man...

<DIRECTION>
(Chance gazes out at the falling snow)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Chance turns to her, says nothing, presses the cold snowflakes to his face.

<EVE>

Allenby, with nothing more he can do to prolong Rand's life, sits on the bed close to him, grips his hand tightly. Teresa shows Chance into the room and Allenby motions to the nurses to leave. As they do, Chance, once again breathing the oxygen with a smile, goes to Rand's bedside.

A cloudy, cold day patches of snow are on the ground. The Rand servants are lined up in front of the mansion, listen to funeral services for Rand on a pair of loudspeakers. PAN AROUND, reveal the services being held on a hill overlooking the mansion. Fifty mourners are gathered around the Rand family mausoleum. Chance stands with Eve and Allenby. The President of the United States stands before a microphone.
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Millions of people across the world have heard of the passing of Benjamin Rand; but, unfortunately, only relatively few will feel the pain and sadness at such a loss. To most, Benjamin Rand was a legend; to those of us gathered here today, Benjamin was a beloved friend. My personal association with Benjamin dates back many years, and my memories of our friendship will stay with me forever.

As the President speaks, Chance turns and walks away. Eve and Allenby watch as he goes into the trees surrounding the area.

'I have no use for those on welfare, no patience whatsoever... But, if I am to be honest with myself, I must admit that they have no use for me, either.' ... 'I was born into a position of extreme wealth, I have spent many sleepless nights thinking about extreme poverty - I do not know the feelings of being poor, and that is not to know the feelings of the majority of people in this world. For a man in my position, that is inexcusable.' 'Life is a state of mind.' ... 'When I was a boy, I was told that the Lord fashioned us from his own image. That's when I decided to manufacture mirrors.'

Chance happens on a tree with a cracked limb, hanging to the ground. He stops, inspects the break, runs his fingers along the split in the bark. He looks to the ground, notices that an end of the limb has fallen on a seedling, bending it double. Chance pulls the limb away, then kneels beside the seedling. He removes an expensive paid of suede gloves, and, with gentle fingers, brushes the dirt and snow away from the seedling. Chance glances up to the remaining limbs of the larger tree which could fall and threaten the emerging tree. He unfolds his umbrella, places it over the seedling in a way to give it protection, yet to still allow it to receive light from the winter sun. Chance stands, puts his gloves back on and continues his walk, disappearing into a remote section of the woods.
