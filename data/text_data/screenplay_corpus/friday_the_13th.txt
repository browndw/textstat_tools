EXT. SOFTBALL FIELD - DAY

In the BG a few dozen CHILDREN, in camp uniforms, are enjoying a game of softball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the FG CLAUDETTE is looking for someone. CLAUDETTE is 17 years old. She is pretty. She wears a t-shirt with "Assistant Counsellor" written on it. She fills out the shirt very well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Failing to find whomever she is looking for, CLAUDETTE walks quickly in the opposite direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA holds on the game for a few seconds and we SUPERIMPOSE:

CLAUDETTE shouts up to the COUNSELLOR from the BG.

EXT. MAIN LODGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two CHILDREN run by carrying Indian headdresses. CLAUDETTE passes them impatiently as she sees BARRY and CHLOE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BARRY is leaning against the front rail of the porch, his arms behind his head--the better to show off his physique to CHLOE, and Assistant Counsellor, who is currently looking at him with cow eyes. In the BG we can hear a portable radio blaring out an Everly Brothers hit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BARRY is 17, handsome and out for all he can get. He is not ashamed for being caught with this other good-looking girl.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got to talk.

BARRY looks at CHLOE, then eases off the rail. Nods.

BARRY puts an arms around CLAUDETTE, looks over his shoulder at CHLOE, and saunters off with the former.

EXT. FOREST - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TRACK goes SILENT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BARRY & CLAUDETTE walk along a path. This is not an aimless walk, for BARRY knows exactly where he wants to go. He leaves the path and goes to sit on a log in a small clearing. CLAUDETTE hesitates, then goes to sit next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<BARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I care very much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He puts an arm around her and draws her close. They kiss. They separate.

<CLAUDETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does Chloe kiss as good as I do?

BARRY decides to be politic.

</BARRY>
<CLAUDETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you...

</CLAUDETTE>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him and they are locked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bird calls, wheels across the patch of sky above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA shifts to ANOTHER ANGLE: Just beyond the thicket of lacy vines. It is a slow tracking shot which gives the impression that we are watching the action from the POV of another person, an unseen visitor...watching the two teen-aged Assistant Counsellors making their first sexual encounters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This unseen observer will be called the PROWLER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BARRY reaches up outside CLAUDETTE'S t-shirt to hold her breast. She reaches up to take his hand away.
</DIRECTION>
<BARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claudette...

</BARRY>
<CLAUDETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</CLAUDETTE>
<BARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, they won't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He ends the argument by snaking his hand inside her t-shirt so that part of her bra is exposed. He seals her protesting lips by kissing her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the PROWLER's POV, the CAMERA MOVES to get a better angle. A hand moves into FRAME and pulls back some branches to clear the field of vision. A branch pops.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDETTE>
<DIRECTION>
(in a thick whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somebody's there, Barry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDETTE>
<BARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Claudette. A man's not made of stone.

</BARRY>
<CLAUDETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go back, Barry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDETTE>
<BARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need you so much, Claudette.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARRY>
<DIRECTION>
BARRY leans in and unhooks her bra. They kiss again, passionately.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PROWLER pauses, then moves, never seen--except for a bit of foot or hand--from the POV of the CAMERA, closer and closer as the two TEENAGERS become more and more oblivious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Closer. The THEME has snuck in. It becomes discordant. It swells. Closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK CUT to BARRY & CLAUDETTE'S faces, their eyes closed, the perspiration streaking their flushed skin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly CLAUDETTE looks up into the CAMERA with terror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hatchet flashes into FRAME and CLAUDETTE goes down under the blow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA TURNS TO BARRY. The PROWLER's powerful hand has him by the throat. He backpeddles, trying to get away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE: as BARRY is stopped against a tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hunting knife soars against the leafy sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BARRY grabs the knife-hand at the wrist. The knife falls to the mossy floor of the clearing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two hands go for the free blade. BARRY's hand has it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a confused jumble of struggle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Onto the bed of moss falls the little finger of the PROWLER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REACTION SHOT: BARRY, horrified by the sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PROWLER's hand has the knife. It moves quickly forward. We can hear the blade strike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BARRY stares up at the sky in a soundless shriek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MCU the moss where the finger fell. The PROWLER reaches into FRAME, picks up the finger, and exits FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK CUT TO: CHLOE, out searching for the missing Counsellors. She stands at the edge of the clearing, her hands pressed on her temples, her throat filled with a scream of terror. The MUSIC has stopped abruptly.

TITLE SEQUENCE

The screen is completely black. A small white shape starts to ZOOMS towards the FG. The shape becomes a three-dimensional rendering of FRIDAY THE 13TH. Just as it gets to its final position, the FRIDAY 13 logo shatters a previously unseen pane of glass. There is a loud crash. The logo shifts to the upper left corner of the FRAME as we ROLLS TITLES, white on black.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The THEME MUSIC is a reprise of the THEME we heard during the Forest sequence, now done in a childlike arrangement.

We can begin to hear a small-town DJ OVER as a pick-up truck moves down the street past the GIRL in her late teens. She has a knapsack, a freshly scrubbed face, jeans, and a plaid shirt. She wears her hair in a long braid. She wears Nike jogging shoes. This is ANNIE.

The regulars are there: five MEN and two WOMEN who always come in for breakfast. They are the retailers, the oil delivery man, the switchboard operators, and the cop.

Next to him is JACK, an athlete whose clean-cut look is as American as popcorn. He is quieter, two years younger and not as smart as NED. He has to think things through.

MARCIE is JACK's girlfriend. She is leaning over the front passenger seat so she can messenger JACK's shoulders.

BRENDA has her sleeves rolled up and is doing her job. She enjoys having the responsibility for the whole safe operation of this area. She likes to think of herself as more sophisticated than she is--or have others think her more sophisticated.

BRENDA rolls a straw target out from under the lean-to shelter and heads for a tripod in the middle distance. There are already two such targets out, a product of her efforts so far. The targets are heavy. This isn't an easy one-person job.

<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA CLOSES IN tighter and tighter on her as she gets closer to setting up the target.

In MCU, she lifts a target up. Her head is very close to the face of the target. She gets it up, lets the tripod take the weight, and then, just as she lifts her weight back, an arrow streaks into the center of the gold, missing her head by eighteen inches.
</DIRECTION>

BRENDA whips around.

WE SEE WHAT SHE SEES: a very cocky NED, standing by the lean- to with a bow in his hands and three more arrows knocked simultaneously. He has a feather stuck in his hair.

EXT. BEHIND ALICE'S CABIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA, shooting from the PROWLER's POV, moves to a place alongside Alice's cabin. There is underbrush about two feet tall and all around that area. The PROWLER stops, leans down and reaches into FRAME with a gloved hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gloved hand reaches into the underbrush for the tip of a burlap bag which has been secreted there. The hand lifts the bag, which has something in it that moves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA MOVES around to the side of the cabin right below the window. The window is open, making entry quite simple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PROWLER's gloved hands untie the neck of the bag, reach in and haul out quickly a medium-sized snake. One hand has the animal firmly behind the jaws. The hand takes the snake and puts it through the open window, leaving it on the clean white coverlet. It slithers across the bed.
</DIRECTION>

The PROWLER's hand closes the window.

BILL and ALICE are lying on the shore on their towels, watching the OTHERS in the water and grabbing some afternoon sun. ALICE is on her stomach, tracing angular designs in the sand. BILL is on his back, listening.

Set up behind the cabin is a make-shift exercise area. There are chinning bars--pipeslashed between two trees--and there's an aging set of parallel bars. There is even a set of weights made from tin cans, pipes and assorted amount of cement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ECU of NEDS's face in a distorted, twisted expression. He explodes his breath.

INT. ALICE'S CABIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the FG is the camp bed with its white coverlet. The snake is nowhere in sight--which means it could be anywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE is humming to herself and is happier now than she has been since we met her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is small. There is the metal-frame cot, an old wooden dresser with a cloudy mirror on top. The walls are a light blue, freshly painted. The wall on the inside does not go all the way to the ceiling so that she can monitor what's going on in the campers' section of the cabin on the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE looks at herself in the old cloudy mirror and likes what she sees. She pushes her hair so that she looks a little sexier. She smiles at herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches out in CU. Open a drawer. Takes out a towel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE turns and goes to her footlocker. Bends down and opens it up. Takes out a terrycloth robe.

ALICE walks into her room wearing her bathrobe, her hair in a towel-turban. She flicks off her shower clogs, and looks for her hairbrush. She takes her towel off and lets her tangled hair fall down.

She hums. Opens her top drawer. Nothing there.

<DIRECTION>
Opens the next drawer. Nothing there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Opens the next drawer. Nothing there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE opens the fourth drawer and the snake strikes! It flails at her right wrist, a wrist which we have established earlier as having a Navajo bracelet on it. The snake strikes the bracelet, hangs on as ALICE tries to shake it free. The snake falls to the floor and recoils for another attack.

There is no way that ALICE can get past the snake to run away. Her scream is loud.

BILL sees it. He freezes, then takes a step forward. Carefully, he winds up and smashes down with the edge of the machete, cutting the snake into two pieces. Blood spurts onto the floor.

MARCIE and JACK enter. JACK carries a shovel as a weapon. MARCIE stops when she sees the embrace, but then looks further to see the blood and guts.

The CAMERA becomes interested in a droplet which appear to have leaked from the ceiling, hit the vertical member of the bed and dribbled down. As the bed shakes with its love-making, the CAMERA PANS up the bunk's strut to trace the droplet's course.

As the CAMERA PANS UPWARD, it pulls back slightly and we see NED lying in the upper bunk. In a flash of lightning we realize he is dead: his throat has been slashed.

BRENDA goes first to the row of sinks and looked at herself in the mirror, holding up a propane Coleman lantern like an examination lamp. She takes out a toothbrush and some other toilet articles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She flips on both faucets and nothing comes out. She put her lantern down on the floor and turns on the water valves. She stands up, and washes her hands and face.

She turns off the faucets and now we hear the dripping sound that Marcie had heard. BRENDA looks off at the shower stalls, shrugs, picks up her lantern and makes her exit.

She puts down her lamp and uses both hands and tugs. She pulls until she finally wrenches the door open. The lamp casts long shadows upwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The generator sits silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE leans into the shed to look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA TRACKS very slowly around behind her so that we can see behind the right-hand corner of the building. As we clear the edge, we see something hanging from a rope which runs down from a branch above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The something turns slowly in the wind. It is BILL--dead--in a travesty of the martyrdom of St. Sebastian, shot with arrows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE comes out of the shed, distraught.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bill?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
She closes the door, and turns in the direction of the body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REACTION SHOT: ALICE. She is riveted with horror, unable to move or turn or run. The SOUNDTRACK screams with the THEME, the insistent STINGER, a shriek and a thunderclap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE finally gives voice to her terror--again and again. She turns, leaving the lantern, and runs back towards the main cabin.

ALICE races to the coffee table, looking for BILL's machete. It is not there.

<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The knife!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
She gets down on her hands and knees to look for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOW ANGLE: as she scrabbles on all fours. Nothing under the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE gets back up and rushes to the ping-pong table to get the lamp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as she reaches the table--which is more or less against a window--a figure swings, pendulum-like, into the glass, shattering the pane in the window opposite ALICE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is BRENDA, long-since dead, dripping wet, white-faced.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE sees her, turns and runs as fast as she can for the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE flings open the wooden door and runs into a rain-suited figure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE screams. The figure holds ALICE in a strong grasp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When ALICE focuses, she sees a kindly woman in her early forties. She is strong, fairly tall, and very nice-looking. This is MRS. VOORHEES. She wants ALICE to stop shrieking long enough to tell her what the matter is. ALICE sobs incoherently, pointing back to the rear window.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_VOORHEES>

ALICE looks up as the WOMAN strokes her hair.

	Why shouldn't we wait for Mr. Christy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
MRS. VOORHEES has gone through some subtle changes. While her voice remains warm and comforting, her face has started to slip into her other manifestation. All of this is in concert with the visibility of her weapon.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_VOORHEES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was my son they killed. They said he drowned, but I know it was inadequate supervision...

MRS. VOORHEES shakes her head from side to side.

The shock of recognition hits ALICE. In CU her eyes look up and see the knife which MRS. VOORHEES now has poised and ready to strike.

ALICE bolts off the couch and stumbles backwards into the fireplace, scattering ashes and sparks.

MRS. VOORHEES stands and steps forward.

MRS. VOORHEES raises her arm to slash downward with the knife. ALICE swings the poker hard to MRS. VOORHEES' other arm and rib cage.

<DIRECTION>
MRS. VOORHEES is in pain, her face a mask of rage.
</DIRECTION>

ALICE drops the poker to run for the door.

CLOSER on ALICE, taking one look over her shoulder, kicks at the door, snapping the latch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE: as ALICE runs out into the rain, the mud, the thunder and the lightning. The THEME is going full-tilt as ALICE makes a quick turn to run towards the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO-SHOT: as ALICE bumps into an object which swings from above. A slice of lightning reveals it to be the dead body of STEVE CHRISTY hanging from the tree. A rope is looped under his arms, his head is down on his chest, and a long blade protrudes from his heart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REACTION SHOT: ALICE in terror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE: ALICE runs and suddenly bumps into another pair of legs which swing from the same big tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STROBE SHOT: of JACK, dead.

ALICE is hiding in the shadows behind a table. We hear the SOUNDS of the generator starting outside and suddenly three bright overhead lights come on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE looks across the room to the light switch, afraid to reveal her hiding place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks for an escape. There's a window. She starts for it, then stops and turns and dives under an arts & crafts table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE: MRS. VOORHEES opens the door and walks in a few feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She carries a machete in her hand. We see this instrument in CU as we hear OVER the sound of her son, JASON, calling to her.
</DIRECTION>
<JASON>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help, mommy, I'm drowning! Oh, mommy, please....

</JASON>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PANS UP to her face and we see that the voice of JASON is coming from within her in LIP SYNC. She is both characters--though the child's voice is authentically dubbed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE can just make out what is happening and can hear the VOICE OF JASON.

ALICE is very still. Her eyes widen as she listens to MRS. VOORHEES rave.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't let them kill any more children. Come out now.

<DIRECTION>
She wades through table after table, pushing them out of her way with the strength she has demonstrated throughout as the PROWLER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When MRS. VOORHEES is too quick for her, shoving a table across her path like a barred door. Before ALICE can think twice, MRS. VOORHEES has shoved a second table in behind her so that now ALICE is sandwiched between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She can duck down or climb over or come out the only open end-- the end where MRS. VOORHEES is standing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE looks behind her and sees a shelf. On the shelf is a box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MRS. VOORHEES is coming down the aisle between the two tables. Her machete is coming up in an attack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE reaches into the box in CU and pulls out a handful of leather-working tools. She hurls them at MRS. VOORHEES as hard as she can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MRS. VOORHEES has to put her arms up to ward off the spinning knives. One cuts her under the eye and she lets out a low animal bellow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE leaps up, climbs over the table and runs for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MRS. VOORHEES shoves the tables over and hurries after her.

ANOTHER ANGLE: MRS. VOORHEES is standing in the doorway, blocking the light. Still carrying the machete, MRS. VOORHEES steps slowly toward ALICE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE, with an almost useless .22 in her hands, does the only thing she can. She takes the weapon by the barrel and, swinging it like a baseball bat, whacks MRS. VOORHEES on the arm/shoulder, knocking the killer off balance and into the wall.

There is some light that comes through the cracks and crevices. ALICE's hands fasten onto the inside lock--the dead bolt type which requires a key to unlock it from the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE relaxes a little bit now that she is locked inside.
</DIRECTION>

As soon as she relaxes, we hear the front screen door slam. Then we hear some shuffling around outside. The lights are turned on.

There is the sound of pots being rustled through. Then the sound of another door being slammed.

<DIRECTION>
ALICE relaxes again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then there is a silence. ALICE thinks about unlocking the door now. She reaches out for the lock. Then thinks better of the idea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She cases down the door frame to the floor. On all sides are the cans of food and cooking implements. There is a large skillet, some bags of flour, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE covers her head with her arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doorknob above her head (a few inches away) turns very slowly. We see it, but she does not. MRS. VOORHEES' hand finishes turning and now starts to push gently. There is almost no give, but we see that the door is being tested.

<DIRECTION>
ALICE folds her hands at the side of her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fist-banging gives way to a short silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The silence is interrupted by a new sound: MRS. VOORHEES has begun to use her machete to chop away at the outside of the door to the larder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REACTION SHOT: ALICE... oh, my God...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At first we see nothing on our side. Then, gradually, we see little slivers of lights admitted by the blade's chops. ALICE's eyes race around the larder to try to find a weapon, a defense, anything...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Larger holes are now made. MRS. VOORHEES stops just long enough to take a peck inside. We can see her eye at the largest hole. She goes back to whacking away at the door. The hole is near the lock. It is soon big enough for MRS. VOORHEES to reach inside with her hand and turn the rachet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE realizes she must defend herself. She reaches down and picks up a heavy skillet and, as the door opens, ALICE raises her weapon and, screaming, charges the woman who is trying to come through the entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MRS. VOORHEES chops down with the machete. ALICE fends off the blow with the skillet that she holds with both hands above her head. As the machete blade bounces off the skillet, ALICE is able to swing the skillet downward and hit MRS. VOORHEES with a solid blow on top of her head. MRS. VOORHEES sprawls sideways across the table and then collapses in a heap on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE raises the skillet again to strike. She crosses carefully to MRS. VOORHEES and pushes her gently with her foot, the way she might poke a dead animal in the roadway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE: MRS. VOORHEES lies totally inert. There is a small puddle of blood under her head.

The first rays of sunlight streak the sky from beyond the horizon, promising a hot and sunny summer's day. The birds are up, foraging for food.

As the CAMERA scans the peaceful scene, we see the sky reflected in the calm waters of Crystal Lake. The canoe holding ALICE is drifting in big slow circles across the surface of the lake.

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LAKE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALICE lies, in MCU, in the canoe, sleeping. She has not changed her position since collapsing a few hours before. The water laps gently against the side of the canoe. Very slowly, she wakes. She opens her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The canoe has drifted into the shade of some enormous tree boughs that overhang the edge of the lake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They shade ALICE from the bright rays of the sun. The canoe rocks gently. ALICE is still, listening to the sound of the lapping water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly there is a blood-curdling scream, a MUSICAL STINGER, and the screen is filled with the flying, whirling form of MRS. VOORHEES, who leaps from the overhanging boughs into the canoe, barely missing ALICE's slumped form!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The canoe immediately overturns and both MRS. VOORHEES and ALICE try to find their footing in the shallow water. MRS. VOORHEES is covered in mud and blood. She sees ALICE struggling to get up and move toward her, brandishing her blood-spattered machete. ALICE turns, sees MRS. VOORHEES coming. ALICE grabs a paddle floating near her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MRS. VOORHEES pushes the canoe to one side, wading through the waist-high water as fast as she can. She screams with rage. Her face goes through a horrifying transformation. From her mouth comes the VOICE OF JASON.

ALICE can't move fast enough to get away from MRS. VOORHEES, who is slashing the air with her big knife trying to hit ALICE. ALICE slips, falls in the water, gets her footing back and has to turn and block the blow of the machete with the paddle, using it like a staff to ward off the blow. The machete cuts the paddle nearly in half. MRS. VOORHEES raises the knife for another blow and ALICE lunges for her knees and succeeds in throwing MRS. VOORHEES into the water. The machete flies out of her hand and lands in the water. The two women roll in the water. MRS. VOORHEES is trying to strangle ALICE, her hands stretching to reach around her throat. They roll over and under the water. We cannot see who is winning.

Suddenly MRS. VOORHEES finds her footing and stands up, looking for ALICE. She is screeching madly.

ALICE shoots up out of the water holding the machete, and in one, wild swing, decapitates MRS. VOORHEES, whose head flies off into the water.

The body stands for a minute, then falls heavily into the lake.

ALICE drops the machete into the water and starts to wade to shore.

EXT. CAMP ROAD/SIGN - MORNING

<DIRECTION>
ALICE walks slowly down the road away from the camp. We hear the sound of a car approaching. Now it comes into view. It is a state vehicle, black and white, with an emblem on the door that says "State Department of Health and Safety". There are two middle-aged bureaucrats inside.

ALICE waves down the car, which pulls up beside her.

EXT. CAMP - MORNING

LONG SHOT of the camp with the sun sparkling on the waters of Crystal Lake. The canoe lies half sunken in the shallows. One paddle drifts in the current. The lake has swallowed its secret.
