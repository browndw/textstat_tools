EXTERIOR STREETS OUTSIDE RAILWAY TERMINAL DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The film opens with crowds of girls, shot in a sequence of CLOSE-UPS, chasing after GEORGE, JOHN and RINGO. The boys hare off just ahead of them. They take a turn down a back alley way and the crowds of screaming girls are after them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR TERMINAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They rush on through the narrow cobbled passageway and into the main station, quickly show their tickets at the barrier for the London train, and get onto the platform as hordes of yelling and screaming girls reach the closed gates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR TERMINAL PLATFORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the fans rushing to the few platform ticket machines, and endless pennies being dropped and tickets torn out in their haste to get onto the platform to see the boys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NORM has been waiting for the boys and he hurries them to where all their baggage, instruments and the drums are waiting, piled up to be put into the guards' van. The boys turn and see the oncoming stream of girls pushing through the barriers and descending on them with yells and shouts. They grab their instruments, RINGO makes for the drums.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NORM plugs into a handy transformer and using their instruments like a gun volley to stop the onrush of females, the boys blast fire into a number and start to sing. This stops the girls in their tracks and they settle down on whatever they can to listen to them playing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the boys are playing, we CUT BACK into the crowds. In the centre we see PAUL struggling and pulling to fight his way through the girls to join the other boys. He is dragging a very reluctant old man behind him. The old man seems most disgruntled and we can see by his gestures how unwilling he is to be pulled and pushed forward through all the girls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At last PAUL reaches the other boys. He sits the old man down on a pile of cases and joins in the number to the squeals of delight from the fans. The old man sits aloof and proud ignoring the whole proceedings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO look enquiringly at PAUL who gives a noncommittal shrug of the shoulders as if to say, "it's not my fault" and the number proceeds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT of sudden horror on JOHN's face. PAUL follows his eye line only to see the old man has doffed his cap and is busily collecting money from a disconcerted crowd. PAUL dives hastily into the crowd, and with suitable apologies extracts the old man and with a long suffering sigh drags him back to the group. GEORGE and PAUL hold him firmly as they finish the number, the old man standing there between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the number finishes and the girls scream and shout with delight, the guard blows his whistle. NORM and SHAKE grab the instruments and the drums, and with the rest piles the lot into the guards' van. The BOYS head into their reserved compartment pursued by the fans but the train moves off. They have successfully repelled all extra boarders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BOYS stand and wave to the fans until out of sight line... the girls running along to the end of the platform waving and calling out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR RESERVED COMPARTMENT IN THE TRAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys relax, sitting down on one side of the compartment. They are about to settle down and make themselves at home when first RINGO nudges GEORGE who in turn nudges JOHN. Opposite them is sitting the LITTLE OLD MAN. He is holding himself stiff, erect and very aloof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three boys look at him enquiringly but with an elaborate sniff he looks away from them and out of the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAUL catches his eye and winks at the LITTLE OLD MAN. He winks back at PAUL, scowls at the other three then looks firmly out of the window again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys turn on PAUL crowding around him.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eh... pardon me for asking but who's that little old man?

The lads all look intently at the GRANDFATHER.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aah... the poor old thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
He leans across to GRANDFATHER.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eh, Mister... are you nursing a broken heart then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
The GRANDFATHER nods soulfully glares at him, in a way that indicates yes.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see, he was going to get married but she threw him over for a butcher.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A butcher?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, she was fickle.

</PAUL>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aye and fond of fresh meat and all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(seriously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... it was his sweetbreads. She was dead kinky for sweetbreads. Anyroad, me mother thought it'ud give him a change of scenery, like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
He inspects GRANDFATHER carefully.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(to PAUL)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eh, he's a nice old man, isn't he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah, he's very clean, y'know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
They all agree with PAUL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHN has been examining GRANDFATHER. He now leans forward to him.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(in an over-friendly voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</JOHN>
<PAUL>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Course he can talk. He's a human being, like. Isn't he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<RINGO>
<DIRECTION>
(grinning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... if he's your Grandfather, who knows?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
The lads all laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And we're looking after him, are we?

</JOHN>
<GRANDFATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll look after meself.

</GRANDFATHER>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aye, that's what I'm afraid of!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's got you worried, then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<PAUL>

</GRANDFATHER>
<DIRECTION>
At this moment, SHAKE, a tall man who works with the BOYS, pulls open the door of the compartment.
</DIRECTION>
<SHAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, thank God you're all got here. Now, listen, I've had this marvellous idea... now just for a change, let's all behave like ordinary responsible citizens. Let's not cause any trouble, pull any strokes or do anything I'm going to be sorry for, especially tomorrow at the television theatre, because...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>

He looks sharply at JOHN who is polishing his nails.

	Are you listening to me, Lennon?

He sees the GRANDFATHER.

<NORM>
	<DIALOGUE>

</NORM>
<RINGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He belongs to Paul.

</RINGO>
<NORM>
<DIRECTION>
(accepting the situation)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah well, there you go. Look, I'm going down the diner for a cup of coffee, are you coming?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll follow you down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
GRANDFATHER rises.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want me coffee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER>
<NORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He can come with Shake and me if you like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, look after him. I don't want to find you've lost him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<NORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be cheeky, I'll bind him to me with promises. Come on, Grandad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>
<DIRECTION>
GRANDFATHER joins SHAKE and NORM.
</DIRECTION>
<NORM>
<DIRECTION>
(over Grandfather's head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's very clean, isn't he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>
<DIRECTION>
SHAKE and NORM collect GRANDFATHER and are in the process of leaving the compartment when a fat upper class city Englishman, JOHNSON, attempts to enter. There is a bit of confusion and they get tangled up with each other.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make up your minds, will you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNSON>
<DIRECTION>
At last SHAKE, NORM and GRANDFATHER sort themselves out and JOHNSON enters with his case. The other three go to coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHNSON puts his case up on the luggage rack, then sits down. All his movements are disgruntled... he finally picks up his copy of the Financial Times and burying himself behind it, starts to read. After a moment he looks up, notices the compartment window is open. He gets up and without so much as a "by your leave" he closes it, glares at the BOYS and sits down again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys exchange looks as if to say... "Hello, Saucy!!"
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(politely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you mind if we have it opened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<JOHNSON>
<DIRECTION>
(briefly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNSON>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but there are four of us, like, and we'd like it open, if it's all the same to you, that is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<JOHNSON>
<DIRECTION>
(rudely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it isn't. I travel on this train regularly twice a week, so I suppose I've some rights.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNSON>
<RINGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aye, well, so have we.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINGO>
<DIRECTION>
He disappears behind his paper before the BOYS can say another word.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RINGO pulls a face at the raised paper and switches on his portable radio. A pop number is playing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHNSON puts down his paper firmly.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And we'll have that thing off as well, thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNSON>
<RINGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINGO>
<DIRECTION>
JOHNSON leans over and switches it off.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An elementary knowledge of the Railway Acts would tell you I'm perfectly within my rights.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNSON>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles frostily.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but we want to hear it and there's more of us than you. We're a community, like, a majority vote. Up the workers and all that stuff!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<JOHNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I suggest you take that damned thing into the corridor or some other part of the train where you obviously belong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNSON>
<JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(leaning forward to him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gie's a kiss!

<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shurrup! Look, Mister, we've paid for our seats too, you know.

</PAUL>
<JOHNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I travel on this train regularly, twice a week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNSON>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Knock it off, Paul, y' can't win with his sort. After all, it's his train, isn't it, Mister?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<JOHNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And don't you take that tone with me, young man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNSON>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But...

<JOHNSON>

</RINGO>
<JOHNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll call the guard!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNSON>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aye... but what? They don't take kindly to insults you know. Ah, come on, you lot. Let's get a cup of coffee and leave Toby the manger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
The boys troop out of the door into the corridor. JOHNSON smiles triumphantly. He is about to settle down to his paper when there is a tap on the corridor window. He looks up and we see pressed against the window a collection of hideous Beatle faces.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eh, Mister... can we have our ball back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
The man jumps to his feet.

INTERIOR OF THE TRAIN CORRIDOR

From the P.O.V. of the door leading to the restaurant car.

The boys come down the corridor in full flight, laughing away like happy idiots. GEORGE and PAUL pull open the sliding doors. The boys look inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR RESTAURANT CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From their P.O.V. we see the car is half empty and at a table in the centre SHAKE and NORM and GRANDFATHER are sitting. On the table is a pile of photos of the boys. NORM and SHAKE are arguing. NORM is being very aggressive, much to SHAKE's discomfort.

	Yeah, you want to watch it.

</NORM>
<PAUL>

	You two have never had a quarrel in your life and in two minutes flat he's got you at it. He's a king mixer. Adam and Eve, meet the serpent. Anthony and Cleopatra, there's your asp. Divide and Conquer, that's this one's motto. He hates group unity so he gets everyone at it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
The BOYS, i.e., JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO, look at each other then at PAUL.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aye and we'll have to watch it and all.

</PAUL>
<GEORGE>

SHAKE and NORM leave. GRANDFATHER grins triumphantly and collects them, then with a sweet smile he turns to PAUL.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you ever sign this one for us, Pauly?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER>
<DIRECTION>
PAUL does so automatically but in the middle of signing he gets suspicious. GRANDFATHER smiles at him charmingly so PAUL finishes signing.

<JOHN>

	Come on let's get this coffee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<GRANDFATHER>

	Before you go, I think it's only fair to warn you about me Grandson... don't let our Paul have his own way all the time, 'cos if you do he won't respect you!

JOHN, RINGO and GEORGE take this up straight away. They all pretend to be girls, RINGO jumps into PAUL's arms.

	Eh, look at that talent.

<DIRECTION>
They all gaze across the aisle. From their P.O.V. we see two very attractive young girls, RITA and JEAN, having coffee.

	Aye, but don't rush. None of your five bar gate jumps and over sort of stuff.

JOHN and GEORGE are about to move over when GRANDFATHER suddenly appears by their sides.

<GRANDFATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(sternly)

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, miss, but you mustn't fraternise with my prisoners.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prisoners!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<GRANDFATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Convicts in transit to Wormwood Scrubs. Typical old lags, the lot of 'em.

	Quiet, you lot, or I'll give you a touch of me truncheon.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(He points at Ringo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That little one's the worst. If we don't keep him on tablets he has fits.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER>
<RINGO>
<DIRECTION>
(protesting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now look here!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINGO>
<DIRECTION>
GRANDFATHER grabs two lumps of sugar from the table and forces them into RINGO'S mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out while you can, ladies, his time's coming round for one of his turns.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER>
<DIRECTION>
The frightened girls scurry out of the restaurant car. The boys look in amazement and horror at GRANDFATHER. They are completely flabbergasted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRANDFATHER smiles at them benignly.

INTERIOR OF RAILWAY COMPARTMENT

SHAKE and NORM are seated. SHAKE is buried in a science fiction book.

Grandfather is in full flight of conversation with a charming elderly lady, AUDREY, who is listening intently.

<GRANDFATHER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I'm their manager, I discovered them.

<LADY_AUDREY>

	Did you indeed, Mr. McCartney?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY_AUDREY>
<GRANDFATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, Audrey, I told you, the name's John. We show biz people are a friendly lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER>
<AUDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, John.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDREY>
<GRANDFATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, they were playing the queues outside the picture palaces of Liverpool. Scruffy young lads, lacking even the price of a jam roll. Orphans, every Paddy's son of 'em. I saw their potential at once although I had me doubts about the little fella, a savage primitive, that Ringo, but it was him what gave in first. He picked up a brick and heaved it at me and I quelled him wid one fierce flash of me eyes. "Mister, can you spare us a copper?" he said. I was disarmed by the grubby little outstretched mauler... So, I took them under me managerial banner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER>
<AUDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The usual ten per cent?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDREY>
<GRANDFATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, not at all, I let them have twenty- five; sure aren't there four of them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER>
<AUDREY>
<DIRECTION>
(her eyes lighting up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How fascinating. Do go on...

</NORM>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, he's concealed about me person.

	Don't exaggerate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've lost him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<SHAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put it this way, he's mislaid him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHAKE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't trust you with anything, Norm, if you've lost him, I'll cripple you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<SHAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He can't be far.
	</DIALOGUE>

<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope he fell off.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be callous.

</PAUL>

	<DIALOGUE>
	He doesn't like me, honest, I can tell... It's 'cos I'm little.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINGO>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got an inferiority complex, you have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<RINGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I know, that's why I took up the drums. It's me active compensatory factor.

<DIRECTION>
JOHN and PAUL run down the corridor. SHAKE and NORM turn from the door and go in the opposite direction, GEORGE and RINGO follow after the other two boys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR CORRIDOR OF TRAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAUL and JOHN look into various compartments. CLOSE SHOT of RINGO looking into compartments in the manner of Groucho Marx. In one of the compartments we see from RINGO'S P.O.V. the occupant, a glamorous woman, TANIA, with a small lap dog.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is beautifully and most expensively dressed. She looks up and sees RINGO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RINGO smiles at her and she smiles back. She then beckons him to join her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around to see if she means someone else. She nods a negative.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RINGO looks back enquiringly then points at himself as if to say: "Who, me?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TANIA smiles enthusiastically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GEORGE has been watching all this.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you going in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<RINGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, she'll only reject me in the end and I'll be frustrated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINGO>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never know, you might be lucky this time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<RINGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I know the psychological pattern and it plays hell with me drum skins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINGO>
<DIRECTION>
He blows the glamorous lady a kiss, then moves sadly on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR FURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAUL enters a compartment followed by JOHN. The TWO GIRLS, RITA and JEAN, from the restaurant car are sitting there.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me but have you seen that little old man we were with?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
The girls jump up, surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've broken out, oh, the blessed freedom of it all!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he extends his hands as if handcuffed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eh, have you got a nail file, these handcuffs are killing me. I was framed. I was innocent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you stop it! Sorry to disturb you, miss...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to drag JOHN after him.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was innocent. I was framed. I won't go back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
JOHN is now by the door; he leers at the girls horribly.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bet you can guess what I was in for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
He cackles like a maniac before disappearing, the door closing after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A waiter carrying a tray with champagne and glasses on it passes into one of the compartments with the blinds down.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about that one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
He moves towards the compartment.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(to Ringo and George)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you look in here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I mean, it's probably a honeymoon couple or a company director or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, let's broaden our outlook.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
PAUL opens the door of the compartment.

<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR OF COMPARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the BOYS' P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER and the elderly lady, AUDREY, sipping champagne and nibbling caviar on toast.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(looking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congratulate me, boys, I'm engaged.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER>
<DIRECTION>
PAUL enters and crosses over to him.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no, you're not. You've gone too far this time... and who's paying for all this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<GRANDFATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all taken care of. It's down on our bill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, well that's all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(realising)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<AUDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Young man, kindly moderate your tone when you address my fiance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDREY>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Missus, but the betrothal's off.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he grabs GRANDFATHER by the arm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll refuse me consent, he's over- age!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
AUDREY grabs GRANDFATHER's other arm and pulls back.
</DIRECTION>
<AUDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave him alone, after all he's done for you is this the way you repay him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDREY>
<DIRECTION>
A tug of war now starts between PAUL and AUDREY.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(pulling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Him? he's never done anything for anybody in his life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<AUDREY>
<DIRECTION>
(pulling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You dare to say that when even those ridiculous clothes you are wearing were bought when you forced him to sell out his gilt edged Indomitables!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDREY>
<DIRECTION>
JOHN and GEORGE jump on the seat egging PAUL and AUDREY on.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Auntie, you're winning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get in there, Paul, she's weakening.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
RINGO attempts to interfere.
</DIRECTION>
<RINGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Missus, this is all a misunderstanding, you see, he's...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINGO>
<AUDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep away from me, you depraved lout, I know all about your terrible past.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDREY>
<RINGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Y'what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINGO>
<DIRECTION>
She hits RINGO with her handbag and continues struggling with PAUL for GRANDFATHER. RINGO grabs her handbag to stop her hitting him.
</DIRECTION>
<RINGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's given me a bad character, blackguarding me name to all and sundry. He's got to be stopped. It's not fair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINGO>
<DIRECTION>
RINGO pushes out into the corridor, forgetting that he is holding the woman's handbag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A voice shouts off from outside.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_OFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's one of them... stop thief!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_OFF>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From Ringo's P.O.V. we see down to the right the city man, JOHNSON, approaching with a GUARD. RINGO turns the other way to the left when he is joined by [the] three other boys. From their P.O.V. down the corridor we see the two girls, autograph books in hand, followed by ten girls from the same school.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both groups are closing in on the BOYS. There's no escape.
</DIRECTION>
<RINGO>
<DIRECTION>
(looking down at the handbag in his hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Mother!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINGO>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR LUGGAGE VAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Very dark, and behind bars we see GRANDFATHER. He is sitting crouched up on a wooden box tea chest and looks pretty miserable. He turns towards the CAMERA; in the foreground of the SHOT we see PAUL standing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the background an impassive GUARD is reading a paper which he does throughout the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(bitterly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And to think me own grandson would have let them put me behind bars!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't dramatise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see GRANDFATHER in the luggage compartment of the guards' van. In with him are a crate of chickens and a dog. The chickens peck at him; GRANDFATHER moves listlessly away.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's face it, you're lucky to be here. If they'd have had their way you'd have been dropped off at Stafford already.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
GRANDFATHER proudly turns away from PAUL who dodges round so he can still see his face.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you've got to admit you've upset a lot of people. At least I can keep my eye on you while you're stuck in here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
GRANDFATHER turns away again.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, how about Ringo? I mean... he's very upset, you know... and as far as your girlfriend, little Audrey's concerned, she's finished with men for the rest of her natural, and another thing...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<GRANDFATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A harmless bit of fun, aah, none of you have any sense of humour left these days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, it's all right for you but those two girls were scared to death! Honest, Grandad, why? I mean, why do you do these things?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<GRANDFATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(cutting in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're left-handed, aren't you, Paul?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... so what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<GRANDFATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you always use your left hand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, don't be daft, I've got to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<GRANDFATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I take a left-handed view of life, I've got to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER>
<DIRECTION>
PAUL grins. After a moment of looking at him, PAUL opens the door of the luggage compartment and joins GRANDFATHER on a box.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shove up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
GRANDFATHER produces a penny.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Odds or evens?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER>
<DIRECTION>
PAUL sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Odds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
GRANDFATHER flips the coin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guards' van door opens and JOHN, GEORGE and RINGO come in, with them are the girls, RITA and JEAN.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(as he sees PAUL behind the bars)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, son, we'll get you the best lawyer trading stamps can buy.

<PAUL>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyroad up... It's all your fault.

<DIRECTION>
JOHN has been looking around the guards' van.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gaw, it's depressing in here, isn't it? Funny...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he pats the dog)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'cos they usually reckon dogs more than people in England, don't they? You'd expect something a little more palatial.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he shudders)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. Let's have a little action. Let's do something, then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I've got me gob stopper.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he produces his mouth organ.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, a genuine Stradivarius, hand tooled at Dagenham.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
And to RINGO's beat on a tea chest they are off, PAUL and GEORGE improvising other sounds, much to the GIRLS' delight. During the number, GRANDFATHER quietly lets the latch off the chicken crate and chickens begin to wander through the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR TRAIN IN MOTION FROM ABOVE (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While the number is progressing, the train is getting nearer and nearer to London.

<DIRECTION>
By the time the number finishes the train pulls up with a sharp halt that sends them all sprawling, BOYS and GIRLS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NORM enters the guards' van.
</DIRECTION>
<NORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move, any of you. They've gone potty out there. The whole place is surging with girls.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, can I have one to surge with?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<NORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, go on, you swine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<NORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you can't. Look, as soon as I tell you, run through this door here and into the big car that's waiting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>
<DIRECTION>
He points and we see a big car parked across the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BOYS prepare to depart, lining up with GRANDFATHER at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR PLATFORM TERMINUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as they are ready to go, a line of taxis draws up parallel to the train and now separates them from the big car waiting for them.
</DIRECTION>
<NORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>
<DIRECTION>
GRANDFATHER pushes past the BOYS, holding his coat closed.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, lads, follow me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER>
<DIRECTION>
And before NORM can stop him, he darts out of the door, PAUL after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fans further down the platform see PAUL and charge forward... in a panic NORM and the others follow, JOHN just having time to kiss both the girls.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vive l'amour!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
NORM drags him away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR RAILWAY STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BOYS manage to follow GRANDFATHER by leaping onto a motorized luggage carrier, GEORGE driving and the other three posing as a frozen tableau on the back. GRANDFATHER has arrived at a taxi door. He flings it open and runs through, opening the other door, thus making a safe bridge to the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BOYS follow and manage to make it to the big car safely. They run towards grandfather's taxi. The FANS have followed the BOYS and we see streams of GIRLS piling through all the taxis one of which contains JOHNSON the city man, opening and shutting the doors to get through, much to the indignation of the TAXI DRIVERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR BIG CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NORM is sitting in front with the driver, FRANK. The four BOYS and GRANDFATHER are squashed together in the back.

	Go like the clappers, son!

	<DIALOGUE>
	That was my entire intention, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car moves off surrounded by the FANS; from a height we see them converge on the car but it moves forcefully out of the station and off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It moves into the traffic in the main road and the journey to the hotel begins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR HOTEL SUITE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a reception room and off it lead rooms that are presumably bedrooms, bathroom, etc. JOHN is lying sprawled out on a settee listening to a transistor radio, demolishing a basket of fruit. PAUL is sitting at an upright piano and GRANDFATHER is mooching about the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the doors opens and GEORGE enters followed by RINGO, none of the BOYS are wearing coats.

The club is the latest in modern decor and full of teenagers all enjoying themselves. The CAMERA wanders around the club till it finally picks out JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE and RINGO all crowded around one small table. The music is blaring away from a juke box and the BOYS join the dancers.

The whole atmosphere is of quiet elegance and loud wealth. Around the baccarat table the rich, bored customers sit barely moving a face muscle as they languidly murmur "suivez" and "banco" to the dealer as he operates the shoe. The manager of the club is beaming with satisfaction as he surveys his customers. One of these customers is clad in evening dress and he has his back to us. The rest of the players (male) are in suits. By each of them is standing a lush lady with a bored sophisticated face that looks as if it has been painted on. From the REVERSE of the LAST SHOT we now see the solitary evening dress player is GRANDFATHER. He looks around him and wipes off his look of enjoyment and elaborately out-bores everyone in the room.

	Get ready John, open the door and as it draws up, out you go and straight in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>
<DIRECTION>
JOHN nods and opens the door. The FANS start to swarm 'round them. To escape, the BOYS dash into the night-watchman's canvas hut, pick it up and run with it to the stage door, revealing the night-watchman, staring in astonishment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the door the BOYS put the hut down and enter the theatre.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR STAGE DOOR ENTRANCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the BOYS enter, two P.R.O. men in dark suits, stiff white collars and old school ties step forward and smile menacingly.
</DIRECTION>
<FIRST_P_R_O_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(menacingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Press conference, they're waiting for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRST_P_R_O_MAN>
<NORM>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give us a couple of shakes to get our breath.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>
<FIRST_P_R_O_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(more menacingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're waiting now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRST_P_R_O_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
And without more ado they grab an arm each and march the protesting NORM towards the stairs that lead to the dress circle.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eh this lot means it. They're even taking hostages.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
The BOYS, SHAKE and GRANDFATHER rush after the rapidly disappearing NORM, who by now is half way up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR OF DRESS CIRCLE LOUNGE BALLROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is empty except for two barmaids poised ready to serve, standing behind trestle tables full of drinks and sandwiches. The dark suited MEN enter with NORM and close behind them follow GRANDFATHER, SHAKE and the boys. The group arrives at the centre of the lounge and have time to look about and see the food but before they can get to it, from all directions NEWSPAPERMEN and PHOTOGRAPHERS converge upon them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now begins an elaborate tug-of-war between various PHOTOGRAPHERS using their flash attachments and REPORTERS to capture a Beatle and in the midst of this running battle a man with a portable recorder is trying to interview them. Together and singly the BOYS are pushed about the room and while this goes on a hard core of NEWSPAPERMEN are busily devouring sandwiches and pouring themselves drinks, to the annoyance of the BARMAIDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Every time one of the BOYS attempts to get a sandwich or a drink, it is either too late, the plate is empty, or they are intercepted. The single and constant thing we see in the scene is the pushing and pulling, heavy impersonal handling, the boys are just things to be placed like still life in one advantageous position after another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
During the scene these individual exchanges take place:
</DIRECTION>
<SOUND_REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your philosophy of life?

</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, actually, we're just good friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
HIGH SHOT of the press reception and we see the BOYS ease their way out until they get to the curtained entrance to the dress circle; completely unnoticed, they slip through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR THEATRE DRESS CIRCLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BOYS come up the stairs into the Dress Circle proper. GRANDFATHER and SHAKE are sitting there having a picnic of beer and sandwiches.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
(ironically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything to spare?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<GRANDFATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've just finished, Pauly. Hey George, write us your John Henry on this picture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(He does so)
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah well. Eh, look!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
He points, and from PAUL'S P.O.V. we see on stage, the setting up of the show, scenery and lights, cameras and sound equipment are being put into position by a small army of studio staff. DANCERS and SINGERS are milling about as well.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go and muck in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aye, before anyone stops us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
They exit to rows of the dress circle and go through the entrance down the narrow stairs to the stalls and on to the stage that is built and extended right into the stalls, which are partly covered up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone is so busy that they hardly notice the BOYS, who wander about and examine the studio equipment. A load of three drum sets are being brought on stage and a voice shouts out:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, what about these electric guitars?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<SHAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHAKE>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back here, mate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<SHAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(going towards the voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHAKE>
<DIRECTION>
RINGO is busy setting up his drums, and men are setting up the other sets. He drops a stick and the FLOOR MANAGER retrieves it and is about to tap the drum. The FLOOR MANAGER is a languid young man.
</DIRECTION>
<RINGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave them drums alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINGO>
<FLOOR_MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, surely one can have a tiny touch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLOOR_MANAGER>
<RINGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you so much as breathe heavy on them, I'm out on strike.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINGO>
<FLOOR_MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you being rather arbitrary?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLOOR_MANAGER>
<RINGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right retreat behind a smoke screen of bourgeois cliches. I don't go round messing about with your ear- phones, do I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINGO>
<FLOOR_MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spoil sport!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLOOR_MANAGER>
<RINGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINGO>
<DIRECTION>
RINGO fusses like a mother hen clucking over his drums. The FLOOR MANAGER is furious.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's very touchy about those his drums, they loom large in his legend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
RINGO gives his drums a defiant crash and JOHN and PAUL stop whatever they are up to and hurry over.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's sulking again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll show him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up a set of drum sticks and bashes back at RINGO, who does a more complicated drum roll. GEORGE now joins in and to PAUL'S encouragement a drum duel starts completely naturally and improvised.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
During this encounter the work proceeds around them and the guitars are brought on and SHAKE sets them to working order. PAUL first, then JOHN and GEORGE take up their own instruments and out of the drum duel emerges one of their numbers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR RAMP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the number finishes a baldheaded man (he is the T.V. director) storms down the ramp that leads from the control box under the dress circle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(with over-exaggerated calm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right I'm sorry and let's hear no more about it. If that's your opinion, you're probably right. Look, if you think I'm unsuitable let's have it out in the open, I can't stand these back-stage politics.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
By the end of this speech he is standing in front of JOHN who takes the scene in his stride.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you tending to black and white this whole situation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, quite honestly I wasn't expecting "a musical arranger" who would question my ability... picture- wise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(to the others)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could listen to him for hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heave to, what's all this about a musical arranger?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. McCartney Senior!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The BOYS have a giggle at the very idea and at this moment GRANDFATHER appears from behind the DIRECTOR.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Pauly, they're trying to fob you off wid this musical charlatan but I've given him the test.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER>
<DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(bravely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm quite happy to be replaced.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<GRANDFATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating the director)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a typical buck-passer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won an award.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A likely story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's on the wall in my office.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
At this moment NORM comes on the stage, confident, cigar in mouth and serene.
</DIRECTION>
<NORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello our lot, everyone happy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>
<DIRECTION>
The BOYS, the DIRECTOR, FLOOR MANAGER and GRANDFATHER turn on him and stare silently.
</DIRECTION>
<NORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, all right. If you don't need this lot, I'll lock 'em up in the dressing room till you do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please do, I'll not need them for fifteen minutes. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He glares at GRANDFATHER who glares right back. The DIRECTOR walks away with the FLOOR MANAGER pacifying him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me a bottle of milk and a packet of Oblivion. Oh, it's a plot, I see it now, it's all a plot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
They go left towards the back-stage.
</DIRECTION>
<NORM>
<DIRECTION>
(producing key)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, come on, I've got the key.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>
<DIRECTION>
He leads the lads off right. RINGO is last as he is putting his drum sticks down safely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NORM and the BOYS turn on him.
</DIRECTION>
<NORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's have you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on speedy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ringo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wake up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
RINGO glares at them and follows quickly. As the BOYS move off after NORM, they pass the next act waiting for rehearsal. It is an elegant man in full-tail suit meticulously adjusting his cuff-links. Beside him is a free-standing sign reading "Leslie Jackson and his ten disappearing doves." The BOYS pass him and go through the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRANDFATHER stops and looks at the performer with respect.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDFATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't tell you how much I've enjoyed your act.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER>
<DIRECTION>
He slaps the man on the back with happy camaraderie. There is the sound of a dove, a few feathers fall out of the sleeve of the man's coat and he and GRANDFATHER look down at the floor. The man glares at GRANDFATHER, takes out a pen from his pocket, crosses out "10" on his sign, and writes "9" in its place, puts the pen back in his pocket and starts towards the centre stage putting on a false performer's smile as he does.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR THEATRE BACK-STAGE CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BOYS move down the narrow stairs, and out of the ground floor dressing rooms stream a steady flow of costumed actors and actresses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They engulf the lads and force them against the wall -- the actors are all making for the stage door. As the actors push past the boys we see the boys' excited faces, their mouths watering for the costumes. JOHN touches the costume on one actor.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(to actor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gear costume!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<ACTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(eyeing him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Swap?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACTOR>
<NORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right, first floor and no messing about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>
<DIRECTION>
NORM, leading the way, goes up the stairs but as they turn the first corner they are confronted by a group of girls, a game of manners starts, "after you," "No, after you." NORM who is ahead of the group looks down on them in disgust.
</DIRECTION>
<NORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lennon, leave them girls alone or I'll report you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORM>
<DIRECTION>
The BOYS let the GIRLS pass and resume the journey, always surrounded by people.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR DRESSING ROOM AND CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RINGO'S attention is caught by a door. He crosses and opens it, looking out to a fire escape. The others join him and the four boys step through the door and onto the fire escape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR TOP OF FIRE ESCAPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the BOYS' P.O.V. we see down below into the property yard behind the theatre. It is a long narrow yard full of old coaches, motor cars and all the general debris of hundreds of sets from past theatre shows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the piles of heaped high junk there are a couple of narrow alleyways.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BOYS scamper down the fire escape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When they reach the bottom of the alleyways, there is a large door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They open it and look through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From their P.O.V. we see a large green field quite empty. The boys step through the doorway into the field. We now see from a HELICOPTER SHOT the four BOYS standing together surrounded by space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is the first time they have been alone and unconfined all day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other and grin... then first GEORGE and PAUL let out a whoop and run towards the centre of the field, after a moment JOHN and RINGO follow them. The BOYS pick up some loose straw and insert it under JOHN'S cap and sleeves, turning him into a scarecrow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The four BOYS dash about madly calling out to one another and generally horsing around. Out of this emerges an imaginary game of soccer and although there is no ball the game is fast and furious. After a few moments the long shadow of a man falls across the grass.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose you know this is private property.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The boys freeze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From their P.O.V. we see a big burly middle-aged man glowering at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys exchange rueful glances and, under the big man's eye, mooch back towards the gateway they came in by. JOHN is the last to go through. He turns to the man.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry if we hurt your field, Mister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR CORRIDOR BACK-STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRANDFATHER is sneaking down the corridor, a pile of photos under his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR T.V. THEATRE UNDERNEATH THE STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Under the stage the usual set of wooden columns that support the stage with lots of furniture and a single light is on; it is placed by the orchestra's entrance to the orchestra pit. GRANDFATHER comes down the stairs and winds his way through the columns until he finds himself a safe little cubby hole and settles himself under the light. He spreads the signed photos of the BOYS in front of him and, adjusting an old-fashioned pair of glasses, ball-point pen in hand begins to copy the BOYS' signatures on to the fresh photos, tutting at his failures and chuckling at his successes. After a moment, there is a sound of someone coming down the stairs. GRANDFATHER darts into a dark patch out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The menacing shadows appear on the stairway.
</DIRECTION>
<NORM>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no one here.

<SHAKE>
<DIRECTION>
(VOICE OFF)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the only way they could have gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHAKE>
<DIRECTION>
We now see GRANDFATHER holding himself stiffly in, he is on some sort of raised platform and he fidgets and in doing so he knocks a lever of some sort. Slowly GRANDFATHER ascends out of shot with a light that grows bigger above him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR T.V. THEATRE STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A rehearsal of the toast scene from a Strauss Operetta. The entire stage is full of SINGERS, glasses in hand they are singing away at each other but in true opera tradition they are addressing out to the audience. Slowly in-between the leading man and leading woman, who are about to embrace, a stage trap opens and a blinking, surprised, GRANDFATHER appears. Here we INTERCUT to the T.V. Control Room for amazed reaction shots of the DIRECTOR and control room CREW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back now on the stage the toast song reaches its climax and the leading man and woman rush into each other's arms, GRANDFATHER sandwiched between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

By this time the TAILOR has his tape stretched between his hands to measure GEORGE's shoulders. But since GEORGE has moved away, he is measuring space. JOHN takes up his scissors and cuts the tape.

INTERIOR BACKSTAGE AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Five beautiful MODELS are standing about in costume. One is knitting a loose wool sweater which is almost completed. There is the sound of a juggling act's music off and a few of the girls are looking off towards the centre stage. At the edge of frame is a collapsible table covered with green baize. On it are three spaced white plates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the door off stage, above which is a sign "To Canteen and Production Offices", GRANDFATHER enters eating a plate of spaghetti on toast. The knitting GIRL sees him and, in mime, asks him to stand still so that she can measure the sweater against him. GRANDFATHER, eager to help, puts his plate of food on the green table between plates two and three. He goes to be measured with the sweater.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the onstage area, a juggler's ASSISTANT (pretty girl) in costume backs up and with the usual theatrical flourishes picks up, without looking, plate number ONE and throws it off screen towards centre stage. There is a drum roll from orchestra. She then throws plate number TWO. We CUT on stage to the JUGGLER now balancing the two spinning plates on two poles, one in each hand. He has another pole in his mouth and nods to his ASSISTANT, asking for the THIRD plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We CUT BACK to the ASSISTANT who, still not looking, throws plate THREE which is GRANDFATHER's. There is the sound of an orchestra raggedly stopping and all the hangers-on in the scene look off interestedly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the DIRECTOR's voice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTOR>

WE CUT TO:

centre stage. The JUGGLER is as before but the spaghetti is covering his head, having slipped off the third plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FLOOR MANAGER is bustling around, trying to help.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We CUT BACK to back-stage. GRANDFATHER has finished being measured and goes to the green table where he put his plate down. He picks up the only remaining plate, looks at it, wondering where his food has gone, shrugs and heads back towards the exit door as we hear the DIRECTOR's VOICE.

SHAKE has a long blond girl's wig on. With the assistance of the girls, NORM gets the boys seated into the chairs nearest the door. For some reason RINGO now has a Guardsman's busby wedged down almost over his eyes and is sitting with it under a hair drier, reading a copy of "Queen" Magazine.

Well, that's maybe all right for a bunch of powdered gee-gaws like you lot but I'm feeling decidedly strait-jacketed. This is no life for a free-booting agent of my stamp.

LIONEL and DANCERS are doing their routine on one side of the stage... it becomes a challenge dance between both groups. JOHN swings his GIRL onto the motorized CAMERA, Western style, and starts to track through the GROUP. GEORGE is on another CAMERA.

The DIRECTOR is about to stop the boys but his GIRL P.A. glares at him, with a shrug he lets the dance go on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We now cut between the dancers on the monitors and the boys actual dancing down on the studio floor. When the recorded music stops, they grab their instruments and go into a number.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
So we can watch every aspect of their work and with so many monitors it gives the impression that there are many more boys than just four.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the number finally ends we are back in the studio on the floor.

INTERIOR BACKSTAGE

<DIRECTION>
A man, whose act is playing tunes by hitting himself on the head, is swallowing a handful of aspirin tablets. He starts rehearsing his act, which consists of throwing his head back and slapping his cheeks. Next to him, a JUGGLER is practising with four table tennis balls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRANDFATHER passes him and bumps his arm slightly. Only 3 balls come down. There is the sound of coughing off.

The canteen is about half full of actors many of which are dressed as Nazi soldiers, with mock blood bandages and arm bands. Also there are a sprinkling of T.V. people. At a table sits GRANDFATHER and RINGO. RINGO is deeply engrossed in a book and GRANDFATHER has a near empty cup of tea in front of him. The old man is bored and looks about him slyly. He then looks at Ringo who is innocently occupied, a malicious gleam comes into GRANDFATHER's eye. He decides to have a go at RINGO and sits staring at him. RINGO gradually becomes aware of the stare and shifts uncomfortably then tries to continue reading his book.

He throws the book down.

<GRANDFATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you could be out there betraying a rich American widow or sipping palm wine in Tahiti before you're too old like me. A fine neat and trim lad the class of you should be helping himself to life's goodies before the sands run out. Being an old age pensioner's a terrible drag on a man and every second you waste is bringing you nearer the Friday queue at the Post Office.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDFATHER>
<RINGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... funny really, 'cos I'd never thought of it but being middle-aged and old takes up most of your time, doesn't it?

RINGO comes along the corridor then down the narrow stairs. Half-way down he comes face to face with GEORGE who is coming up the stairs.

JOHN and PAUL are chatting up a couple of girls, when they see RINGO approaching they break off the conversation.

<JOHN>

	Here he is, the middle-aged boy wonder.

RINGO looks at JOHN hard.

PAUL and JOHN gape at him. For good measure Ringo takes a quick photograph of them before he leaves them flabbergasted and walks off into the street.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got only half an hour till the final run-through. He can't walk out on us.

	We'll split up and search for him, he can't be far.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
They now all start to go off in the same direction, they pause, there are three roads they can take but each time they begin to move they all go the same way.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's happened at last, we've become a limited company.

EXTERIOR STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RINGO is walking along taking photographs with his camera when some girls recognise him and start to follow him. They quicken their pace and RINGO runs ahead of them. He turns and comes into another street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees a second-hand clothes shop with a sign saying "We Buy Anything" and enters the shop just before the pursuing girls come round the corner. The girls stand about looking in all directions. After a moment RINGO comes out of the shop. He is wearing a long mackintosh and a natty cap pulled well down. He is ignored by the girls who don't recognise him. Realising this he goes back and ogles one of them. She glares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<RINGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello.

<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UP on Ringo's secret but happy smile as he walks briskly down the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR TOW PATH CANAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RINGO kicks at a brick. He kicks stylishly but misses so tries again, misses again, but finally kicks the stone which doesn't budge so he bends down and pulls it out of the ground. It is quite big. Three quarters of it being below the surface. Having got it he now decides to throw it away. As he does so the same POLICEMAN rides past on a bicycle.
</DIRECTION>
<POLICEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ain't you got no more bleeding sense than to go round chucking bricks about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Before RINGO has time to answer the man has disappeared.
</DIRECTION>
<RINGO>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting after him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Southerner!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINGO>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at the canal water moodily; at this moment a large lorry tyre rolls down the incline and bashes him slap in the back, sprawling him on the path, the tyre on top of him. A small boy appears after the tyre and stands over the prostrate RINGO.
</DIRECTION>
<BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, mate, that's my hoop, stop playing with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<RINGO>

He moves off and the BOY follows.

<BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh you can have it, I'm packing it in -- it depresses me.

<BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that's right, they was supposed to come with us but they chickened.

(disbelievingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<RINGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What they like?

</RINGO>
<DIRECTION>
BOY is glad to have something to talk about.
</DIRECTION>
<BOY>
<DIRECTION>
(enthusiastically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ginger's mad, he says things all the time and Eddy's good at punching and spitting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<RINGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about Ding Dong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINGO>
<BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a big head and he fancies himself with it but you know it's all right 'cos he's one of the gang.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<DIRECTION>
RINGO nods his head understandingly and they mooch on together.
</DIRECTION>
<BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why aren't you at work?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<RINGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a deserter, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RINGO>
<BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<DIRECTION>
At this moment a child's voice shouts out "Charley" and from RINGO'S P.O.V. we see three kids. RINGO turns to the BOY and looks at them enquiringly.
</DIRECTION>
<BOY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Ringo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<DIRECTION>
The BOY runs off to join his mates. As he joins them they punch and scuffle together. They are obviously a gang. RINGO is left alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR CORRIDOR T.V. THEATRE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GEORGE comes round the corner, looking for RINGO, then grins and walks past a sign saying "Canteen and Production Office Opposite." He comes to the exit door, crosses to a modern building across from the theatre.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He enters [the] building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is the reception room that leads to an inner office. Behind a desk sits a smart young woman typing busily as GEORGE enters. He is surprised when he sees the girl; she looks up and speaks to him at once.
</DIRECTION>

	Oh, there you are!

	Is he?

phone.)

	Hello, I've got one... oh, I think so... yes, he can talk... Well... I think you ought to see him.

<DIRECTION>
(she smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, right away.
	</DIALOGUE>

She crosses to the inter-office door. On the door is written SIMON MARSHAL... she opens it.

He follows her quickly in.

INTERIOR THE INNER OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large room, part production office with models and sets, drawing board with ground plans, the other part of the room a mixture of Pop and Queen's magazine decor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind a large desk sits SIMON MARSHAL, a bland but slightly irritable young man of about thirty-five. He is wearing the ultimate in the current smart set fashion. He is attended by a couple of underlings ADRIAN and TONY and behind him on the wall is a poster of a girl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the poster is printed, "Way Out, your own T.V. Special with Susan Campey. Director, Simon Marshal."

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn around, chicky baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
GEORGE does so.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes, a definite poss. He'll look good alongside Susan.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he indicates the girl on the poster)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, Sunny Jim, this is all going to be quite painless. Don't breathe on me, Adrian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
ADRIAN has recognised GEORGE and is trying to stop SIMON.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I'm terribly sorry but I'm afraid there's been some sort of a misunderstanding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
(sharply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you can come off it with us. You don't have to do the old adenoidal glottal stop and carry on for our benefit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid I don't understand.

	Oh, my God, he's a natural.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<SECRETARY>
<DIRECTION>
(anxiously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I did tell them not to send us any more real ones.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECRETARY>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They ought to know by now the phonies are much easier to handle. Still he's a good type.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
He now speaks to GEORGE in the loud voice that the English reserve for foreigners and village idiots.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We want you to give us your opinion on some clothes for teenagers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, by all means, I'd be quite prepared for that eventuality.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, not your real opinion, naturally. It'll be written out and you'll learn it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to secretary)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can he read?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean lines, ducky, can you handle lines?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll have a bash.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. Hart, get him whatever it is they drink, a cokearama?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ta.

</GEORGE>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, at least he's polite. Tony Show him the shirts, Adrian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
A collection of shirts are produced and GEORGE looks at them. While he is doing this SIMON briefs him.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, you'll like these. You really "dig" them. They're "fab" and all the other pimply hyperboles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't be seen dead in them. They're dead grotty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grotty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, grotesque.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
(to secretary)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make a note of that word and give it to Susan. I think it's rather touching really. Here's this kid trying to give me his utterly valueless opinion when I know for a fact within four weeks he'll be suffering from a violent inferiority complex and loss of status if he isn't wearing one of these nasty things. Of course they're grotty, you wretched nit, that's why they were designed, but that's what you'll want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I won't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can be replaced you know, chicky baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that pose is out too, Sunny Jim. The new thing is to care passionately, and be right wing. Anyway, you won't meet Susan if you don't cooperate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And who's this Susan when she's at home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
(playing his ace)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only Susan Campey, our resident teenager. You'll have to love her. She's your symbol.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you mean that posh bird who gets everything wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I beg your pardon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes, the lads frequently gather round the T.V. set to watch her for a giggle. Once we even all sat down and wrote these letters saying how gear she was and all that rubbish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's a trend setter. It's her profession!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's a drag. A well-known drag. We turn the sound down on her and say rude things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get him out of here!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(genuinely surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have I said something amiss?

<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get him out of here. He's knocking the programme's image!!

</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
He is ejected through the door.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get him out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he stops in mid-shout)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't think he's a new phenomenon, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<SECRETARY>

EXTERIOR STREET PUB ON THE CORNER

The sign on the pub is Liverpool Arms. RINGO is standing looking up at it. He decides to go in and does so.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR T.V. CONTROL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The atmosphere is tense. GRANDFATHER is standing miserable in front of the DIRECTOR, the criminal confronted by the judge. SHAKE and NORM are flanking him grimly.

INT. PUB PUBLIC BAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UP on RINGO. He is eating a bone dry sandwich that curls up at the end. He puts it down with disgust. He has a lager glass in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<BARMAID>
<DIRECTION>
(accusingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was fresh this morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARMAID>
<DIRECTION>
We now see the pub is full of enormous cockney workmen downing pints.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RINGO is very much alone. He moves away from the bar towards a group that is standing together, they've an average height of over six-foot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a group at a dart board. Another group is playing bar skittles and a third group is around a pin-ball table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Near the bar is a shove-halfpenny board with two players. There is a caged parrot nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<BARMAID>
<DIRECTION>
(to Ringo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That'll be two and nine...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARMAID>
<DIRECTION>
RINGO fumbles some change out of his pocket. A few coppers fall from his hand on to the shove-halfpenny board just as the crucial point has been made. The men glare at him. Embarrassed, he moves away and without looking, places his glass on the skittles table just as a player swings the string, which hits Ringo's glass. More embarrassed, RINGO backs away, unfortunately into the pin-table just as a winning score is about to be reached. He bumps it very slightly, but enough to cause it to TILT. He then moves to the dart board. By this time most of the pub is staring at him. With great style he takes the darts. The first throw goes into a cheese sandwich which a man is pointing in demonstration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second we see arrive into a pint of bitter and then we see RINGO shoot the third dart and hear the sound of the parrot shouting angrily, off. The BARMAID has had enough.
</DIRECTION>
<BARMAID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right... On your way!

<RINGO>

</RINGO>
<BARMAID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You heard, on your way, troublemaker!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARMAID>
<DIRECTION>
Now the centre of attention, RINGO backs out of the pub, followed by every eye in the place, the BARMAID and a few players following him to the door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR STREET OUTSIDE PUB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RINGO comes out and crosses road, watched by the POLICEMAN who is now quite suspicious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAUL comes down the street looking about him for RINGO. In the street is an old building, the sort of place that is highly favoured for TV rehearsals. There is a sign on the door, "TV Rehearsal Room." As PAUL draws near, a load of actors and extras, etc. are leaving, they are in costume, they are the ones who earlier had been going to a word rehearsal. When PAUL gets near the entrance he decides to go inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAUL enters and wanders about. He reaches a door, pushes it open and looks in. He sees a GIRL clad in period costume. She is moving around the room and obviously acting. PAUL watches her for a moment and then decides to go in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR REHEARSAL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAUL goes into the room. The GIRL is in mid-flight. She is very young and lovely and completely engrossed in what she is doing. The room is absolutely empty except for PAUL and herself. She is acting in the manner of an eighteenth-century coquette, or, to be precise, the voice English actresses use when they think they are being true to the costume period... her youth however makes it all very charming.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I believed you, sir, I might do those things and walk those ways only to find myself on Problem's Path. But I cannot believe you, and all those urgings serve only as a proof that you will lie and lie again to gain your purpose with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She dances lightly away from an imaginary lover and as she turns she sees PAUL who is as engrossed in the scene as she was.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>

	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, sorry I spoke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
He makes no attempt to go. He simply continues to look steadily at the girl; then he smiles at her. She is undecided what to do next.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you supposed to be here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got you worried, haven't I?

	I'm warning you, they'll be back in a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>

<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... I mean, sure, well, I took it at school but I only ever heard boys and masters saying those lines, like, sounds different on a girl.

(smiles to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it's gear on a girl.

	I'm a walk-on in a fancy dress scene. I just felt like doing those lines.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I see. You are an actress though, aren't you?

<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>

	"I don't believe you, sir..." and all that. Yeah, it was gear.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh aye, a sledge.

</PAUL>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the way you did it then sounded so phony.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... I wouldn't say that... just like an actress... you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
He moves and stands about like an actress.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that's not like a real person at all.

<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Is it really fab or are you just saying that to convince yourself?

	Well, you've got to have people to taste your treacle toffee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him in surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, hang on, I've not gone daft. You see, when I was little me mother let me make some treacle toffee one time in our back scullery. When I'd done she said to me, "Go and give some to the other kids." So, I said I would but I thought to meself, "She must think I'm soft." Anyroad, I was eating away there but I wanted somebody else to know how good it was so in the end I wound up giving it all away... but I didn't mind, mind, 'cos I'd made the stuff in the first place. Well... that's why you need other people... an audience... to taste your treacle toffee, like. Eh... does that sound as thickheaded to you as it does to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not really but I'm probably not a toffee maker. How would you do those lines of mine?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, look at it this way, I mean, when you come right down to it, that girl, she's a bit of a scrubber, isn't she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is she?

	Eh, fella, you want to try pulling the other one, it's got a full set of bells hanging off it... Y'what?... I know your sort, two cokes and a packet of cheese and onion crisps and suddenly it's love and we're stopping in an empty shop doorway. You're just after me body and y'can't have it... so there!!

<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, definitely, it sticks out a mile, she's trying to get him to marry her but he doesn't want... well... I don't reckon any fella's ever wanted to get married. But girls are like that, clever and cunning. You've got to laugh.

EXTERIOR STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the street, workmen are collecting shovels, drinking tea and doing all the things people do around building sites. RINGO mooches around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the road is a hole with a diameter of about 3 feet, and at least 6 feet deep. RINGO looks down and a man is busily working at the bottom of the hole. He glares at RINGO. After a moment RINGO turns away. We now see a very elegant young lady coming towards RINGO. She is daintily avoiding a series of puddles. RINGO has an idea and does a Sir Walter Raleigh with his large Mac spreading it over one of the puddles. The girl walks across it smiling graciously. RINGO proceeds with the coat to the next puddle and to the next backing gradually towards the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At last he spreads the coat, without noticing what he is doing, over the hole. The girl steps onto the coat and disappears sharply. RINGO looks down the hole where the girl is held in the workman's arms. The workman rises out of the manhole until he is waist height. At this point an elegantly dressed gentleman appears (the girl's husband) he looks at his wife in the workman's arms and hits the workman. RINGO backs away through the puddles, and is nicked by the POLICEMAN.

The CAMERA PULLS back and we see GRANDFATHER is surrounded by girls who have broken from the queue and are doing a brisk trade with the old man. He has a large sign on which is written: "Get your genuine autographed Beatles photographs." On the edge of the crowd two POLICEMEN are trying to force the girls back into the queue. Finally they wade through the girls and confront GRANDFATHER. They look at the old man quizzically; he stares back coldly. They indicate he should hop it and quick but GRANDFATHER defiantly glares back at them. So with a sigh, they grab an arm each and escort the old man off.

EXTERIOR STREET
</DIRECTION>

GRANDFATHER is running at top speed down the street. He is breathing heavily and runs as if pursued by the hounds of hell. The street however is entirely empty and no one is even in sight. As he reaches the top of the street he pauses and turning, looks around him. From his P.O.V. we see just how empty the street is and heaving a sigh of relief GRANDFATHER cackles to himself. His triumph is short lived. At this precise moment down the street comes a parade of police vehicles, a Black Maria, an escorting police motor bike patrol and an ordinary squad car. The procession draws up and the street is full of policemen getting out of the Black Maria and squad car and off motor bikes.

He dashes off wildly in the general direction of the theatre. He has been completely unnoticed by the policemen who are lining up for a last minute inspection by the inspector in charge. The inspector is like a commander-in-chief of a spear- head attack force.

They smartly march off in the direction taken by GRANDFATHER.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are followed at once by ten POLICEMEN also in single file. They are also pounding along knees high in the air. The BOYS and the coppers disappear around the corner. At once, they reappear from the other direction, then run down the street still followed by the policemen.

When they reach the police station another group of police bars their way so they are forced to run up the stairs and inside.

RINGO whips it off and NORM delightedly hugs him. The BOYS dash through the stalls entrance and on stage. The DIRECTOR sees them and bursts into tears with relief. NORM hustles the lads into the wings to be changed into their show costumes. All around them last-minute preparations are going on.

We see the audience of girls streaming in and settling down in their places for the show. There is the usual business of getting the show ready and we see SHOTS of the girls' faces, then JOHN, PAUL, RINGO and GEORGE looking at them. At last on cue from the floor manager the BOYS start their act to the audience's screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
During the number we constantly CUT away to the audience with various SHOTS of the ecstatic girls. In the middle of these shots we see NORM standing at the side of the audience his face glowing with satisfaction. We follow his gaze and from NORM'S P.O.V. we see GRANDFATHER handcuffed to SHAKE, but in spite of this, the old man is enjoying himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BOYS now perform a medley of numbers, i.e., a little of all the songs we have heard during the story. This gives the impression of a full set and we finish after their bows. While they are doing so they look again in the general direction of SHAKE and GRANDFATHER and from their P.O.V., we see SHAKE is beating time to the music but from his wrist dangles an empty set of handcuffs. GRANDFATHER has gone again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the BOYS are reacting to GRANDFATHER's disappearance once again, the trap door on the stage opens and GRANDFATHER appears in the centre of the group as they finish their act and take their final bows.
