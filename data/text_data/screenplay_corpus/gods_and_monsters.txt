MAIN TITLES BEGIN

<DIRECTION>
Writhing pools of light and dark, out of which emerge images from "The Bride of Frankenstein," directed by James Whale. Elsa Lanchester, as the Monster's Bride, looks up, down, left, right, startled to be alive. The Monster stares at her. "Friend?" he asks, tenderly, desperately.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT (B & W)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lightning splits the black-and-white sky, revealing a single shattered oak in a desolate landscape. Below, a HUMAN SILHOUETTE stumbles through the darkness, the top of his head flat, his arms long and heavy, his boots weighted with mud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the storm fades. Light creeps into the scene, and color, as we DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PACIFIC OCEAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
melting into a hazy morning sky. In a box canyon off the coast highway, we see row after neat row of trailer homes, a makeshift village for beach bums.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAILER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLAYTON BOONE opens his eyes. He is 26, handsome in a rough-hewn, Chet Baker-like way, with broad shoulders and a flattop haircut. He grabs a crumpled pack of Lucky Strikes, lights a bent cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clay stands and walks bare-assed across the single tin room, his head almost touching the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clay goes a few rounds with a weatherstained speed bag that's set up behind his trailer.

<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAILER - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Clay towels off, glances at the morning paper. He moves aside a pile of paperbacks on a card table until he finds a calendar. His finger targets today's first appointment. "10 A.M. - 788 Amalfi Drive."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRAILER PARK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clay steps out of the trailer, clean-shaven and dressed in dungarees, a T-shirt with a fresh pack of cigarettes flipped into one sleeve. He weight-lifts a secondhand mower onto the bed of his rusty pick-up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clay climbs into the truck, slides the key into the ignition. It takes a few tries but the engine finally turns over.

Clay's truck sails down the road, "Hound Dog" blaring on the radio. MAIN TITLES END.

EXT. COLONIAL-STYLE HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sprinklers twirl on a grassy slope outside a rambling clapboard house. Below, a swimming pool forms a perfect rectangle of still water. A title reads: SANTA MONICA CANYON. 1957.

The pick-up drives past. Clay parks in the back, hops out.

In the dining room, visible through open double doors, DAVID LEWIS, 55, speaks softly with the housekeeper, HANNA. She is a squat, muffin-faced Hungarian woman in her late 50s, dressed in black, her hair cinched in a tight bun. She speaks with a thick accent.

	Hanna? Who's the new yardman?

Whale moves jauntily onto the front lawn, singing to himself:

Whale clears his throat behind the back of his hand.

	When you're through, Mr. Boone, feel free to make use of the pool. We're quite informal here. You don't have to worry about a suit.

Clay glances warily at Whale.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thanks. I got another job to get to this afternoon.

Whale holds Clay's look.

Whale heads off, smiling to himself. Pleased to be naughty again.

INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY

<DIRECTION>
The room is filled with unframed canvasses, many of them copies of paintings by the Old Masters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whale rolls out the easel, lifts a half-painted canvas into position. He stares at the blotches of color, trying to remember what he intended to paint.
</DIRECTION>

Whale pulls out a heavy volume on Rembrandt, opens to a black-and-white plate of "The Polish Rider." We CUT TO:

A rough pencil outline of the same painting. Whale, age 16, sits on his bed, ignoring the roughhousing of the three younger BROTHERS who share the room. The door opens and Whale's mother SARAH enters.

<WHALE>

	Quite so, mum. To the privy.

Whale looks up at EDMUND KAY, 22, a slim boy who rests his weight on one slouched hip, his arms twined behind him. There is a look of mild disappointment on Whale's face as he realizes that Kay is a baby poof.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, Mr. Kay. I'd almost forgotten. My guest for tea.

He suddenly growls out an imitation of Boris Karloff.

<KAY>

	Love dead. Hate living.

Kay laughs, a high, girlish giggle. Whale fights a cringe with a polite smile.

<KAY>

	That's my favorite line in my favorite movie of yours. "Bride of Frankenstein."

</KAY>
<WHALE>

	Is it now? Hanna? I think we'll take our tea down by the swimming pool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
It's clear from Hanna's frown that she doesn't approve of the idea. Whale ignores her, turns back to Kay.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will that be good for you, Mr. Kay?

Fiery melt is poured into molds on the shop floor of a machine parts factory. WHALE, 16, grips the hot casting with tongs. His father WILLIAM, his face blackened with grime, hammers away at the flaws. A heavy blow causes young Whale to drop the mold, prompting catcalls and sneers on the floor. There is a look of genuine fear in Whale's eyes as he looks up at his singed, beast-like father. We CUT TO:

<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your father was a schoolmaster?

</KAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. I attended Eton -- it wouldn't do for a master's son to attend where his father taught. I was to go up to Oxford but the war broke out and I never made it. The Great War, you know. You had a Good War, but we had a great one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
He glances to see if the boy smiles at the quip.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't imagine what life was like after the Armistice. The twenties in London were one long bank holiday, a break from everything dour and respectable. I had a knack with pencil and paper, so I was hired to design sets for stage productions.

	There was one play in particular, a beautiful, grim study of war called "Journey's End". Every experienced director turned it down, so I offered myself, bullying and begging for the job.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no, I want to hear everything. You made twenty pictures in all --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty-one. The romantic comedies and dramas were much more to my liking. The horror pictures were trifles. Grand guignol for the masses.

Whale takes in the boy's blank, bored expression. He sighs.

</KAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</WHALE>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That you were forced to retire because, uh -- a sex scandal.

</KAY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	A homosexual scandal, you mean? For me to answer a question of that magnitude, you'll have to remove both your shoes and your socks.

Kay just sits there, squinting and grinning.

<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a dirty old man.

Whale tilts his head as if brushing off a compliment. Kay kicks off his penny loafers, bends over to remove his socks.

	You are kind to indulge your elders in their vices. As I indulge the young in theirs.

Kay hesitates a moment, then sets his pen aside to pull the sweater over his head, revealing a sleeveless T-shirt.

	You must understand how Hollywood was twenty years ago. Nobody cared a tinker's cuss who slept with whom, so long as you kept it out of the papers. Outside of Hollywood, who knows who George Cukor is, much less what he does with those boys from the malt shops along Santa Monica?

<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	George is famous for his Saturday dinner parties. Great artists, writers, society folk, all rubbing elbows with Hollywood royalty. But how many of those oh-so-proper people know about the Sunday brunches that follow? Gatherings of trade eating leftovers, followed by some strenuous fun and frolic in the pool.

	If a goat like that can continue about his business, my more domestic arrangements could've raised very few eyebrows.

The revelation seems to have left Kay a little shaken. he flips to a blank page.

<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we talk about the horror movies now?

<WHALE>

<KAY>

Kay stands to unbuckle his belt, glancing around the yard again. He unzips and steps out of his sharply creased flannel legs. His thighs are thin and pale.
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just like going swimming, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you'd like a swim when we're through. I never swim myself, so the pool tends to go to waste.

	Who came up with the Monster's makeup and look?

Whale clutches at the air, suddenly notices that his hand is empty. He looks down and sees the cigar on the flagstones.
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boris Karloff. Where did you find him?

</KAY>
<DIRECTION>
Whale bends down to retrieve his cigar -- and the change of gravity drives a spike through his skull.

Whale turns toward the froggy voice.

He forces himself up with one hand. Kay finally looks up, notices Whale's colorless lips and desperate eyes.

</KAY>
<WHALE>

Whale lurches from the table. Kay jumps forward, catching him under an arm.

Kay hurries outside to retrieve his clothes. Hanna undoes Whale's bow tie. She makes no attempt to be gentle.

The noise is deafening -- the clank of chains, the screech of wheels and the endless banging of hammers. William Whale continues to knock away at the hot casting. The rhythmic sound blends into the insistent knocking of:

<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what they say. If you have to ask --

</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just a hick who cuts lawns. But some of these look familiar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They were familiar when I painted them. That one's copied from a Dutch still life done almost three hundred years ago. And that's a Rembrandt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're just copies then. Gotcha.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But before I retired, you might say I had a brief time in the sun. Fame, as it were. Tell me, do you like motion pictures?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, everybody does. When I was a kid I'd go with my sister twice a week. Why? Were you an actor or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In my youth, yes, but never in Hollywood. No, I was merely a director here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? What were some of your movies?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This and that. The only ones you maybe have heard of are the "Frankenstein" pictures.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Clay sits up, surprised, skeptical and impressed all at once.

<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Frankenstein" and "Bride of" and "Son of" and all the rest?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I made only the first two. The others were done by hacks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>

	Still. You must be rich. Making a couple of famous movies like those.

	Merely comfortable. Here's Hanna with our refreshments. Can you get the door?

Clay jumps up to open the screen door. Hanna walks past, refusing to look at him. She sets the tray on a table very hard, ringing the glasses and silverware.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not forgetting your last brief chat.

Hanna stares up at Clay.

<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing serious. A touch of stroke.

Clay nods, chugs his tea. When he lowers the glass, he finds the old man watching him.

</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale's gaze deepens. He laughs lightly.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I apologize for going on like this. It's the Sunday painter in me. Of course I can understand your refusal. It's a great deal to ask of someone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean -- you really want to draw me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed. I'd pay for the privilege of drawing your head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even an amateur artist needs a subject to inspire him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it's just my head you want? Nothing else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you suggesting? You'll charge extra if I include a hand or a bit of shoulder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't want to draw pictures of me in my birthday suit, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no interest in your body, Mr. Boone. I can assure you of that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay takes a moment to size up Whale -- whose innocent, slightly befuddled smile makes him appear about as threatening as a box of cornflakes.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right then. Sure. I could use the extra dough.

INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

Doctors and technicians flash lights into Whale's eyes... test his reflexes...inject him with radioactive isotope. Whale sits very still with his head behind a fluoroscope screen while two doctors murmur over the image.

<DIRECTION>
INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pair of X rays are slapped wet on a light board. Two skulls, one facing forward, the other in profile. DR. PAYNE, a bland young neurologist, points to a smudge in the side-view X ray.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_PAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the area of infarction. By which we mean the portion of brain affected by the stroke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
The venetian blinds of the examining room are closed. Whale sits calmly, flanneled legs crossed at the knees, gazing at his own skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_PAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a lucky man, Mr. Whale. Whatever damage was done by your stroke, it left your motor abilities relatively unimpaired.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PAYNE>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, yes, Dr. Payne. But from the neck up? What's my story there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DR_PAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I'm trying to explain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Payne turns off the light board and goes to the venetian blinds. The room is instantly full of sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_PAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The central nervous system selects items from a constant storm of sensations. Whatever was killed in your stroke appears to have short-circuited this mechanism. Parts of your brain now seem to be firing at random.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PAYNE>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're saying there's an electrical storm in my head?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DR_PAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's as good a way as any to describe it. I've seen far worse cases. You might even learn to enjoy these walks down memory lane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PAYNE>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the rest of it? The killing headaches. The phantom smells. My inability to close my eyes without thinking a hundred things at once. It's all nothing more than bad electricity?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DR_PAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a manner of speaking. I've never encountered the olfactory hallucinations, but I'm sure they're related.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_PAYNE>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what do I do?
	</DIALOGUE>

The doctor responds with a sympathetic gaze. Whale nods solemnly.

INT. HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whale makes his way toward the stairs. He passes a stoop-shouldered ELDERLY WOMAN who leans on the arm of her middle-aged DAUGHTER. Then an OLD MAN in a wheelchair, his eyes brimming with bewilderment and despair.

Hanna opens the door. Clay wears dungarees and a white dress shirt.

Clay follows Hanna into the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's down in his studio. Here. Take this with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
She thrusts a TV tray toward him. Two glasses, two bottles of beer, a bottle of Coke.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's your job, lady, not mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hands back the tray)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm here so he can draw my picture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm keeping away. What you are doing is no business of mine.

</HANNA>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you talking about?

</CLAY>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of man are you? Are you a good man?

	Yeah, I'm a good man. Something make you think I'm not?

</CLAY>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will not hurt him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gimme a break. I'm going to sit on my ass while he draws pictures. Is that going to hurt him?

</CLAY>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No.

INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clay opens the squeaking door and enters behind Hanna. Whale stands at a drafting table, sharpening a pencil. Hanna sets the tray down.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very good, Hanna. Now goodbye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
She goes toward the door, wrinkling her forehead at Clay. The screen door bangs shut.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure you'd like something to wet your whistle while I work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale opens a bottle of beer, pours it into a glass, hands it to Clay. He gestures to a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll go slowly today. Since this is your first time as a model.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay sits. He pulls a "TV Guide" out of his back pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you see this? They're showing one of your movies tomorrow night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't say? Which picture?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Bride of Frankenstein."
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmmm. I much prefer "Show Boat" or "The Invisible Man." Shall we begin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>

Clay takes a swig of beer and sets the glass on the floor.

Whale stares at Clay.

<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That shirt, Mr. Boone.

</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's new.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. It's too white, too distracting. Would it be asking too much for you to take it off?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not wearing an undershirt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pish posh, Mr. Boone. I'm not your Aunt Tilly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it's just my face you want to draw.

</CLAY>
<WHALE>

	Oh if it's going to make you uncomfortable...

<DIRECTION>
(sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps we can find something else for you to wear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
He lifts a drop cloth off a footlocker, revealing a stack of "Physique" magazines. Whale casually covers them with a newspaper.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We could wrap this like a toga around your shoulders. Would that help you overcome your schoolgirl shyness?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right already. I'll take it off. Kind of warm in here anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>

He unbuttons the shirt and pulls it off.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Much better.

<DIRECTION>
(steps forward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here.

</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay adjusts his belt buckle as Whale hangs the shirt on a wall peg. He moves back to the easel again.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we'll have you sit slightly sideways, so you can rest one arm on the back of the chair. Yes. Just so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
The arm with the tattoo faces the easel. Clay smirks.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take a picture, it lasts longer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's exactly what I intend to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
A clatter of pencils in the easel's tray, followed by a moment of silence. Finally, a low, whistly scratch. Clay concentrates on keeping still, focusing on an open window.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You seem to have no idea how handsome you are, Mr. Boone. It has to do with how snugly your face fits your skull.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay wipes a thin line of sweat from his waist.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you be more comfortable barefoot? Feel free to remove your boots and socks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I'm fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a bit like being at the doctor, isn't it? You have to remain perfectly still while I examine and scrutinize you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>

Whale suddenly sniffs, as if smelling something. He sniffs several times more but continues to draw.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dripping?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Clay)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you ever eat dripping in this country? The fat from roasts and such, congealed in jars. Used like butter on bread.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds like something you feed the dog.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is. Only the poorest families ever ate it. We kept ours in a crockery jar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your family ate dripping?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
(catching himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course not. As I said, only poor people --
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale stops. He lets out a bitter laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've spent most of my life outrunning my past. Now it's flooding all over me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay stares out blankly.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth. Yes, my family ate dripping. Beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley. Are you also from the slums, Mr. Boone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We weren't rich. But we weren't poor either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you were middle class, like all Americans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any American can imagine. Every Englishman knows his place. And if you forget, there's always someone to remind you. My family had no doubts about who they were. But I was an aberration in that household a freak of nature. I had imagination, cleverness, joy. Where did I get that? Certainly not from them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale's voice has changed, becoming more pinched and nasal.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They took me out of school when I was fourteen and put me in a factory. They meant no harm. They were like a family of farmers who've been given a giraffe, and don't know what to do with the creature except harness him to the plow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale seems completely lost in the past by now.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hatred was the only thing that kept my soul alive in that soul-killing place. And among those men I hated was my own poor, dumb father. Who put me in that hell to begin with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale peers out from behind the square of paper. He pales when he sees his father William, his face covered with grime, glaring at him from across the room. Whale retreats behind the pad, takes a breath.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Whale?

</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Relief floods Whale's face. He looks out, smiles at Clay.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't mind. I'm not crazy about my old man either.

Whale rubs a hand across his eyes and steps into the open.

The place is dead. There's only Clay and Dwight sitting at the bar with the owner, HARRY, a balding hep cat with a scraggly tuft of beard. And, in a booth, KID SAYLOR, a cocky 20-year-old, necking with a pony-tailed TEENAGER.

BETTY CARTWRIGHT appears behind the bar, lugging a bucket of ice from the storeroom. She's an attractive woman in her early 30s, big-boned and almost as tall as Clay.

Betty glares at Clay, who realizes he's gone too far.

Harry reaches up, turns on a battered Motorola. On the tv, a voice announces: "Tonight, Boris Karloff in 'The Bride of Frankenstein.'" The titles come on. Ending with the phrase "Directed by", which floats over a white blob. The blob jumps forward to form letters: "James Whale."

<WHALE>

Suddenly the tinny tv soundtrack is drowned out by the voice of Elvis Presley. Kid Saylor bends over the jukebox, wagging his denim butt and tapping a high-top sneaker.

Clay slams the heel of his hand against Saylor's chest. The boy staggers backward. Clay grabs the corner of the jukebox and jerks it from the wall; the needle scratches across the song. Saylor holds up both hands in a nervous surrender.

	Hey, I didn't know. It's your favorite movie. Sorry, okay?

In a crypt, the Monster meets Dr. Pretorius, who is having a midnight snack on top of a closed coffin. "Friend?" the monster asks. "Yes, I hope so," answers Pretorius, without batting an eyelash. He offers the Monster a drink, then adds: "Have a cigar. They're my only weakness."

The Monster blows up the laboratory and the movie ends. Hanna shivers as she stands.

He waits to see how Betty reacts. She shrugs. Harry takes his book and cash drawer to the back door.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm next door if you need me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He gives Clay one last look and goes out to the breezeway and his apartment.

<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what? I think you guys are all jealous.

</CLAY>
<BETTY>

(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's to be jealous of?

</BETTY>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've gotten to know someone who's famous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If he were that famous, he probably wouldn't give me the time of day. This way, he's like my famous person.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs at himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, my own personal famous person. Who treats me like I'm somebody worth talking to.

<DIRECTION>
Clay leans down to plug in the jukebox.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to go for a swim?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
She snaps her mouth open and imitates the Bride's furious cat hiss.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It means it's too cold to go swimming. And I don't mean the water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't going to try anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.

He patiently waits by the door while Betty turns out the lights. She walks briskly through the glow of the jukebox, waving Clay outside with her hand.

EXT. HARRY'S BEACHCOMBER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Betty pulls the door shut and bends over to lock it. Clay catches a glimpse of skin in the side slit of her shirttail.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go for a walk at least. Walk and talk. I really feel like talking tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Betty's eyes blink in mock surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This old guy -- he's the kind of person I expected to meet when I moved out here. Someone who's done things with his life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's different. He's a man. And by the way you have no business calling him a homo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It never crossed your mind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's an artist. Anyway, he's too old to think about sex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.

</BETTY>

She opens the door of her Chevy. Clay grabs it with both hands to keep her from getting in.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon. What's eating you tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Betty hesitates, then looks him sharply in the eye.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You picked up that girl right in front of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, no strings, right? That's what you always said. Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It still hurt. A lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't mean to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened. It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You liked it too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. I loved it.

<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you enjoy it, you should do it.

</CLAY>
<BETTY>

	You know, I just can't do that anymore. I still have time to get things right. Get married again --

</BETTY>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Betty bursts out laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The look on your face! You're not marriage material. You're not even boyfriend material. You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not a kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you then? What will you be ten years from now? Still cutting lawns? Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
Clay glares at her, his jaw working forward in anger.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like my life. I'm a free man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone? Pathetic and alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<DIRECTION>
Clay's anger jumps from his jaw into his shoulders and arms. He grabs the door handle.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you don't want to fuck. That's what you're telling me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that all this conversation means to you? Am I going to put out or not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETTY>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn straight. I'm sick of playing games.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Betty quickly gets into the car. before she can pull the door shut, Clay slams it on her, hard. Her hands leap in front of her face, as if he'd hit her. The look of fear in her eyes startles Clay out of his rage.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Betty, look. This is coming out all wrong --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
She frantically turns the key in the ignition and the Chevy pulls out.
</DIRECTION>
<BETTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From here on out, Boone, you're just another tired old face on the other side of the bar.

The car screeches away. Clay stumbles across the highway.

Clay comes to the dump at the end of the canyon. He climbs into it, kicking at loose cans.

<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all shit! Shit on by women! Shit on by the Marines. Shit on by the world! Fuck!

He shouts the word at the cliff, for the raw, sudden violence of shouting.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuuuck!

A dog in the carport starts to bark. The sound of Clay's pain echoes off the canyon as we CUT TO:

Hanna kneels next to the body. She makes a Sign on the Cross, launches into a frantic "Hail Mary." We CUT TO:

INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Whale snorts at the imagined scene. One by one, he returns the capsules to their bottle, until a single pill remains. He places it on the table, then turns out the lamp and lies on his back in the dark, waiting for sleep.
</DIRECTION>

The distant sound of laughter invades the darkness. Whale sits up, straining to identify the voices. The bedroom wall opposite him melts away, revealing:

INT. SPECIAL MAKEUP TRAILER - UNIVERSAL STUDIOS - DAY (1935)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA LANCHESTER and BORIS KARLOFF sit side by side in dentist chairs, cloths around their necks, heads tilted back. JACK PIERCE, the makeup artist, is patting the hair drawn over a cage on Elsa's head. He looks up, sees Whale, and breaks into a conspiratorial grin. Elsa's eyes are closed; she hasn't heard whale enter.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA_LANCHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You done yet, love? I am absolutely dying for a fag.

Elsa stares at the beautiful corpse in the mirror. She snaps her head left, right, up, down, startled by the sight of herself, electrocuted into frightened, spastic jerks.

	Oh, James.

As Whale observes his star we see her spasms through his eyes -- as a series of dissonant, line-jumping close-ups.

INT. SOUNDSTAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The interior of Stage C is completely filled by the laboratory set. Electricians adjust the lights on the wooden tower beside the Bride's table. COLIN CLIVE (Dr. Frankenstein) and ERNEST THESIGER (Dr. Pretorius) sit off to the side, in full makeup and costume. Clive mumbles earnestly over his script. Thesiger pinches his face over the needle he dips in and out of an embroidery ring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whale comes on the set with Elsa on his arm. She walks regally beside him, the train of her long white robe thrown over one arm. There's a wolf whistle from overhead, and applause, causing Elsa to curtsy to her admirers. Thesiger takes her hand, leans back to study her.
</DIRECTION>
<ERNEST_THESIGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God. Is the audience to presume that Colin and I have done her hair? I thought we were mad scientists, not hairdressers.

	Only a mad scientist could do this to a woman.

Clive walks over, glumly.

<COLIN_CLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not at my best today, Jimmy. A touch of flu, you know.

Whale sees through the excuse, rests an arm on Clive's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax, my boy. You could do this scene in your sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clive grits his teeth and nods. Whale positions them in front of the upended table, Clive and Thesiger holding Elsa's robe out by the hems. The shadow of the sound boom passes back and forth while they rehearse.
</DIRECTION>
<ERNEST_THESIGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gather we not only did her hair but dressed her. What a couple of queens we are, Colin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERNEST_THESIGER>
<DIRECTION>
Elsa giggles. Clive looks distraught -- which brings some life to his stiffness. Whale sees this, decides to tune it higher.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, a couple of flaming queens. And Pretorius is a little in love with Dr. Frankenstein, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>

Clive's distress reads clearly now. He is twitchy and alive.

INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Whale glances at the clock, sees that it is 3:15. He is wide awake. He reaches over, picks up the Luminal.

<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Luminal. Illumine all.
	</DIALOGUE>

Whale reluctantly places the pill on his tongue and swallows. He rests his head on the pillow and stares at the ceiling, where the reflection of the window sheers casts an ever-shifting pattern of light and dark. We move down to reveal:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT (BLACK & WHITE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a cobblestone cell, a plaster set from "Bride of Frankenstein." Whale sits in a massive chair, straining against thick iron chains, as a lightning storm rages outside. In the distance, heavy footsteps, coming closer, until the cell door is filled with the silhouette of the Monster. Whale hardly dares to breathe as the Monster rips off the door and enters the cell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Monster steps into the light, allowing us to see his face for the first time. It is Clay Boone, dressed in a Marine parade uniform. He uses his hedge clippers to cut the chains from around Whale's chest.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. Thank you so much.
	</DIALOGUE>

Clay leans down and takes Whale in his arms, cradling him like a child. They move across the sound stage -- Clay carefully sidestepping the lights and cables on the floor -- until they reach the next set:

Clay carries Whale past a painted backdrop of a stormy English countryside.

<DIRECTION>
INT. FRANKENSTEIN'S LAB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whale lies on the Bride's table. Clay pulls on a doctor's smock, picks up a scalpel from a table covered with various medical instruments. he carves a thin circle around the top of Whale's forehead. Then, with one deft movement, he pops off Whale's scalp and pulls out the brain. It is soot-covered, charred, used up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whale watches with detached fascination as Clay tosses it on the floor, then takes a throbbing, luminous mass from a tray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clay inserts the new brain into Whale's skull, sutures the scalp back into place. he fastens the conducting clamps around Whale's temples, then throws the heavy circuit breaker. Lights throb with bursts of energy...loose sparks crackle...rotary sparks create snapping circles of fire...as the energy of the raging storm is harnessed into the machinery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clay steps back to take in his handiwork. A sudden look of panic fills Whale's face.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It isn't working. The experiment is a failure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>

Clay glances down at Whale, whose breathing is slowing. Realizing that the new brain hasn't taken:

<CLAY>

	No. We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I. People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim. You have people, Boone?

	Oh, I don't know. Because no girl in her right mind will have me?

</CLAY>
<HANNA>

	A man who is not married has nothing. He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.

	You proposing what I think you're proposing? Don't you think I'm a little young for you?

Hanna twists her head around with such an indignant look that Clay bursts out laughing. She realizes that she is being teased.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Men. Always pulling legs. Everything is comedy.

Hanna stares at Clay until his smile fades. She resumes her chopping in silence.

<CLAY>

	Poor Mr. Jimmy. There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell. Very sad.

	You're sure of that?

She loses patience with Clay's blank look.

Clay slowly sits up.

<HANNA>

	That is why he must go to hell. I do not think it fair. But God's law is not for us to judge.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No!

<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. That is what I hope. I did not think you a bugger too. I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.

<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going to hurt anyone.

Off in the distance, a throat loudly trumpets itself clear.

A hesitant smile from Clay. Whale picks a stack of mail off the table, rifles through envelopes.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive my rudeness. At my age, the post is the cream of the day.
	</DIALOGUE>

He returns the stack to the table but holds on to a square envelope.

	Do you mind?

<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead.

Clay looks off while Whale opens the envelope.

He is examining a folded card. He rubs a thumb over the printed lettering.

He tosses the invitation on the table.

<WHALE>

	Yes. An old, useless friend. You must excuse me, Mr. Boone. This is a world I finished with long ago. I pay them no mind and expect them to return the compliment.

They both take a sip of wine.

Hanna nods, steals a glance at Clay as she leaves.

<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? Was it supposed to be funny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>

	I don't like to talk about that.

</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's nothing to be ashamed of, in the service of one's country. That's something to be proud of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Proud? Any jerk with a gun can kill someone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>

	What is we say phooey to the hedges? Could you spare an hour after lunch? To sit for me?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't today.

Whale passes him a gold penknife.

	Just a trim. And mine while you're at it. Fingers are a bit stiff today.

Clay hands a clipped cigar back to Whale.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you had a wife?

<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or a husband. Depending on which of us you asked. My friend David. He lived here for many years.

The other cigar crunches faintly between Clay's fingers.

</CLAY>
<WHALE>

	Don't be ridiculous. I know a real man like you would break my neck if I so much as laid a hand on him. Besides, you're not my type.

Clay suddenly laughs. Whale's smile deepens.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So we understand each other?

</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>

	Can I see what you did so far?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It will only make you self-conscious. You'll have to remove your shirt.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. Not today.

</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we have to match the other sketch.

Whale steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps if we open the shirt and pull --
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale's hands to in. Clay's flesh tightens; he shrinks back. The hands stop, palms raised.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh dear. I have made you nervous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine. I'd just rather keep it on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suppose we unbutton the top and pull it down around your shoulders? Two buttons. Is that so much to ask? Just two little buttons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale's thumb and fingers unpluck buttons in midair.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Look. What you told me at lunch is still very weird for me. So either you sketch me like I am or I'll say forget it and go do your hedges.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Whale takes a step back. His eyes are locked on Clay, fascinated by his temper.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't mean to be a prick, but that's how I feel.

Whale glides behind the easel. The pencils rattle in the tray.

	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay glances out the window. Feigning a merely casual interest:
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that why you and your friend split up? Because you wanted to be free?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a way, yes. I suppose so. I know it's why I stopped making pictures.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale backs away from the easel and stares at the paper with a sour frown.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You might not think it to look at me now, but there was a time when I was at the very pinnacle of my profession. The horror movies were behind me. I'd done "Show Boat." Major success. Great box office. Now I was to do something important. "The Road Back." An indictment of the Great War and what it did to Germany. It was to be my masterpiece.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fucking studio butchered it. It was 1937, Hitler's armies were already massing -- and still the New York bankers stood in line to curry his favor. Anything to avoid losing the German market. They cut away the guts and brought in another director to add slapstick. The picture laid an egg, a great expensive bomb. For which I was blamed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
A shadow passes over Whale's eyes. He presses two fingers against his temple.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After that, I went out of fashion. I was no longer able to command the best projects, so I walked away. Why should I spend my time working in such a dreadful business?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you miss it?

	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale stops himself. He smiles gently at Clay.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Making movies was the most wonderful thing in the world. Working with friends. Entertaining people. Yes, I suppose I miss it. More so now that --
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale reaches into his pocket, takes out the bottle of Luminal.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we all want to feel we've left our mark on the world. Yes. I wish I had done more work.
	</DIALOGUE>

</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale moves across the room to the screen door.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I chose freedom. David was still in the thick of it, his life full of anxiety and studio intrigue. I didn't fancy spending my golden years as merely "the friend." The dirty little secret of a nervous producer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long were you...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty years. Too long. We were like a play whose run outlasted the cast's ability to keep it fresh. So I finally decided to close down the show.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale places a pill on his tongue and swallows. He fixes Clay with a pinched smile.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When all fetters are loosened, a certain hedonism creeps in, don't you think? There was a period when this house was overrun with young men. Some even posed for me. Right where you're sitting now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay sits uncomfortably in his chair. His face flushes.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, they weren't nearly as bashful. No, this room was once filled with bare buttocks. And pricks. Hard, arrogant pricks --
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut it out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>

Clay explodes out of his chair, knocking over a small side table.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck it. I can't do this anymore.

</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
He looms over Whale, whose breathing starts to quicken.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't it enough you told me you're a fairy? Do you have to rub my nose in it?

</CLAY>
<WHALE>

	I assure you, Mr. Boone, I meant no --
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From now on, Mr. Whale, I cut your grass and that's it. Understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Before Whale can respond Clay storms out, nearly ripping the screen door off its hinges. Whale sits on the daybed, takes a few quick breaths. Suddenly the air is filled with the sounds of people cavorting in the pool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whale looks up, sees a young man standing outside the screen door. It is now dark outside.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_MAN>

Whale offers a melancholy smile.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'll just rest for a moment.

The man shrugs, disappears into the shadows. We move across the room and through the door...

Whale sits in a director's chair, a martini in one hand, a cigar in the other, a harmless old uncle watching young men swagger and splash in the pool.

Dwight's WIFE, a pert, steely-eyed brunette, places a firm hand on his shoulder. Dwight shrugs, heads toward the door.

<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the fear you showed at our last session? How did you overcome that?

</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not fear. More like disgust.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Same difference, Mr. Boone. Disgust, fear of the unknown -- all part of the great gulf that stands between us. Am I right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?

Whale clears his throat, bored by his standard line.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- a war without end. There were trenches when I arrived, and trenches when I left, two years later. Just like in the movies. Only the movies never get the stench of them. The world reduced to mud and sandbags and a narrow strip of rainy sky.

Now he's talking only to himself.

<WHALE>

	Barnett. Was that his name? Leonard Barnett. He came to the front straight from Harrow. And he looked up to me. Unlike the others, he didn't care that I was a workingman impersonating his betters. How strange, to be admired so blindly. I suppose he loved me. But chastely, like a schoolboy.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Odd, how even there one could have days when the weather was enough to make one happy. He and I were standing on the fire step and I showed him the sights of no-man's land, through the periscope. It was beautiful. The barbed wire was reddish gold, the water in the shell holes green with algae, the sky a clear quattrocento blue. And I stood shoulder to shoulder with a tall apple-cheeked boy who loved and trusted me.

<PRINCESS_MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had no idea you'd be here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS_MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
She seizes Whale's hand in her little white gloves.
</DIRECTION>
<PRINCESS_MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS_MARGARET>
<WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
(taken aback)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. Quite fine. And Your Royal Highness?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<PRINCESS_MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Splendid. Now that I know you're around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS_MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
Standing beside him, Clay is clearly impressed that Whale knows a princess.
</DIRECTION>
<PRINCESS_MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we get together while I'm in town? I so badly want to sit for you again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS_MARGARET>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<PRINCESS_MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've changed my hair, you see. Since our last session. Those old snaps look rather dowdy now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS_MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
Whale realizes she's mistaken him for someone else. He tugs his sunglasses down his nose so she can see his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<PRINCESS_MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh dear. Have I made a blunder?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS_MARGARET>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ma'am, the pleasure is all mine. James Whale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<PRINCESS_MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am such a goose. I mistook you for Cecil Beaton. It's the hat. You're wearing one of Cecil's hats, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS_MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
Whale attempts to chuckle while he fights a feeling of humiliation. He turns to Cukor for help.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, George. James Whale. David Lewis's friend. I once made pictures myself, Ma'am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<GEORGE_CUKOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Of course. One can't throw a rock in this town without hitting one of us old movie directors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE_CUKOR>
<DIRECTION>
Whale feels the sting. He turns to Clay.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ma'am, may I present Mr. Clayton Boone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay steps forward to shake hands.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My gardener, who insisted I bring him today. He so wanted to meet royalty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Cukor's face goes blank with indignation.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pleased to meet you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<PRINCESS_MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quite. I adore gardens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS_MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
Whale narrows his eyes at Cukor and sharpens his smile.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's never met a princess. Only queens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Cukor puffs out his chest, quivers a bulbous lower lip at Whale.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	George, Ma'am, this has been an honor. An occasion to remember for the rest of my days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
He leads Clay away and an American couple promptly crowd in to take their place. Striding through the garden, Whale is obviously pleased with himself.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was that about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing of importance. Just two old men slapping each other with lilies. Shall we have a drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale leads Clay to a tented bar. Across the way, David Lewis has come through the gate with a WOMAN on his arm. People look discreetly, not at David but at the woman, lightly veiled in a scarf and sunglasses.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David. The friend I thought was in New York.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. The girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Girl? Oh. Elizabeth Taylor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay watches in amazement as ELIZABETH TAYLOR waves to someone and pipes out a happy hello. She hurriedly unties her scarf, thrusts it at David and runs off on tiptoes to embrace a woman.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that really her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David produced her last picture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
David glances around while he slips the scarf into a coat pocket. He sees Whale looking at him. He puts on a tight smile and strolls across the patio.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just what I was about to ask you. I thought you were in New York.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was, until last night. Publicity asked me to fly Miss Taylor in for today's reception.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
The waiter arrives with their drinks. Only when Clay takes his glass of beer does David see that Whale is not alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David Lewis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clay Boone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our yardman. Who was kind enough to serve as my escort to George's little do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
David freezes. Whale lifts his martini glass at Clay and takes a sip.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should you be drinking in your condition?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, David, stop being a nanny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay clears his throat, eager to escape this domestic squabble.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'll go look at Elizabeth Taylor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
He hurries off.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't, Jimmy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did. But Princess Margaret was a doll. We're all equals in her eyes. As commoners, I presume.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You only embarrass yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh dear. I'll never work in this town again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I mean. Your reputation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I have no reputation. I'm as free as the air.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well the rest of us aren't. Can't you remember that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I never could. You must regret having had the invitation sent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
David is looking over Whale's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't ask George to invite you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then who did?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to. You'll be fine on your own?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Perfectly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, then. I'll come by tomorrow for breakfast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Whale nods, watches David stroll over to the pool and greet a gaggle of executives. Whale drifts toward some deck chairs at the far end of the croquet lawn. He sits, takes a sip of his drink. Suddenly a high-pitched giggle pierces the air.
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Whale!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<DIRECTION>
Whale looks out to see Edmund Kay, his interviewer from several weeks ago, marching across the lawn.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr....Kay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bet you thought you'd never see me again. I didn't know if you'd be well enough to come to this party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm the one who got you on Mr. Cukor's guest list.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You, Mr. Kay? How do you know George Cukor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I interviewed him after I met you. I'm his social secretary now. Well, assistant to his secretary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I commend you. If you're going to pursue poofs, go after those who can do favors for you. You waste everybody's time when you court dinosaurs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't think that, Mr. Whale. I love your movies. That's why I wanted you to come to this. So I could see you with your monsters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My monsters?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't go away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<DIRECTION>
Whale tries to do just that, but finds himself caught in the chair. He is stumbling to his feet when Kay returns with Elsa Lanchester, 55, at his side.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA_LANCHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jimmy. How are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA_LANCHESTER>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elsa?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
She takes Whale's hand, with a look of deep concern and sympathy. Kay races off again.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA_LANCHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw Una O'Conner a few weeks ago. She said you'd been under the weather.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA_LANCHESTER>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, nothing out of the ordinary. Growing old.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<ELSA_LANCHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're all getting a bit long in the tooth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA_LANCHESTER>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you appear quite fresh, my dear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
She swats aside the compliment and gestures at the chair.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA_LANCHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. You shouldn't stand on my account.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA_LANCHESTER>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perfectly all right. But if you'd like to sit --
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<ELSA_LANCHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine, Jimmy. I can only stay a few minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA_LANCHESTER>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<ELSA_LANCHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's our pesky friend up to now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA_LANCHESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Kay returns, accompanied by a stopped, gray-haired man with a long rectangular face and wary, heavy-lidded eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA_LANCHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that Boris? Our little chum appears to be arranging a reunion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA_LANCHESTER>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh dear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Karloff, age 70, comes reluctantly, followed by his niece ALICE, a bashful young woman who carried a blanket-wrapped bundle.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA_LANCHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boris, darling. I didn't know you were here. These public revels are hardly up your alley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA_LANCHESTER>
<BORIS_KARLOFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came for the sake of my visiting niece. Alice. And Miranda, my great-niece.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORIS_KARLOFF>
<DIRECTION>
His huge hand lifts the blanket in Alice's arms, revealing a bald infant with enormous blue eyes. Karloff gurgles and coos at the child.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA_LANCHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what do you make of our royal visitant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA_LANCHESTER>
<BORIS_KARLOFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perfectly charming. A real lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORIS_KARLOFF>
<ELSA_LANCHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course she's a lady. What did you expect? A hussy in tennis shoes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA_LANCHESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Whale looks up and discovers Clay standing a few feet behind Karloff. He is ogling two bosomy actresses who are listening intently to the monocled British consul.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whale's eyes try to focus Karloff and Clay together, his once and future monsters. Kay shouts to a passing photographer carrying a bulky Speed Graphic.
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you! With the camera! We got a historical moment here. Come get a picture of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<DIRECTION>
The man scans the scene for a famous face.
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Mr. James Whale, who made "Frankenstein" and "Bride of Frankenstein." and this is the Monster and his Bride.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<DIRECTION>
Clay looks up when he hears Kay identify Karloff.
</DIRECTION>
<PHOTOGRAPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Karloff. Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHOTOGRAPHER>
<DIRECTION>
Karloff and Elsa drift into position next to Whale. The flash goes off, a snap and a crunch of light. Whale cringes in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA_LANCHESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(through clenched teeth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you just love being famous?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA_LANCHESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Another flash. From Whale's perspective, the bulb resembles nothing so much as the translucent tube of electrical current from Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory. Whale concentrates on his smile as another snap of light stabs his brain. He clutches Elsa Lanchester's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA_LANCHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you all right, Jimmy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA_LANCHESTER>
<DIRECTION>
A sharp nod from Whale. The photographer motions to Karloff's niece.
</DIRECTION>
<PHOTOGRAPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me get one with Frankenstein holding the kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHOTOGRAPHER>
<DIRECTION>
Alice hands over the baby. Karloff gently cradles the child. Whale stands on his left, Elsa on his right. They all smile at the baby, who gurgles and points up. Whale follows the baby's gaze to the sky, where a large kite rocks and strains in a furious electrical storm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera flashes once, then again.
</DIRECTION>
<PHOTOGRAPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHOTOGRAPHER>
<DIRECTION>
Whale glances up -- the kite is gone. Thunder rumbles as the group starts to disperse. Whale nods to the faces exchanging good-byes.
</DIRECTION>
<BORIS_KARLOFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So good to see you again, James.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BORIS_KARLOFF>
<DIRECTION>
He strolls off, clucking and cooing at his baby.
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Catch you before you go, Mr. Whale. I'll make sure everybody gets sent a print.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<DIRECTION>
He goes off with the photographer. Elsa kisses Whale on the cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA_LANCHESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll be in touch, Jimmy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA_LANCHESTER>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good-bye. So nice to see you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Finally Whale is alone. He staggers to the deck chair and lowers himself sideways into the lawn chair.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Whale gazes up at Clay.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tired. A bit tired.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay nods. Whale smiles at him.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you enjoying yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, no. I feel a little out of place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neither of us really belongs here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must have been funny for you. Seeing your monsters again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Monsters? The only monsters...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(closes his eyes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...are here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Across the lawn, conversation has stopped. Birdlike shrieks come from all directions.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh fuck. And we left the top down. You want to run for it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run for what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't you see? It's raining!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
The rain is only a flickering of air, but people are jumping and shrieking, throwing coats over their heads as they dash toward the house.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
He takes Whale under the arm, helps him up and escorts him to a small tent. On the patio, everyone shoves and squeezes to get through the one open door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whale stares out, hypnotized by the deluge. From his POV, we see a young man step into the rain. Whale squints, is finally able to identify the man as Leonard Barnett.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whale's eyes follow Barnett as he emerges onto a new landscape, a scarred and barren battlefield. As the storm continues to rage:
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Whale?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Whale shifts his gaze to Clay. He takes a moment to orient himself.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get out of this funk hole
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't want to wait it out? Rain should let up soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not sugar. We won't melt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale adjusts the brim of his hat and steps into the downpour. Clay has no choice except to follow. They walk briskly, the minute splashes on Whale's hat forming a ghostly aura of spray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whale opens the door and climbs in next to Clay. The roof slowly closes over them.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I better get you home before you catch your death from pneumonia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Catch my death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay glances over, sees Whale sitting very wet and rigid, staring straight ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You all right, Mr. Whale?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Whale blinks, slowly turns. There is a cracked look in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jimmy. Please. Call me Jimmy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay smiles, starts to back the car out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - FOYER - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hallway is pitch-dark as Whale and Clay enter.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hanna! Bring us some towels. We're drenched to the bone!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
No response.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blast her. If we soil her holy floor, it's her own damn fault.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale goes squashing down the hall. Clay remains just inside the open door, prying off his shoes and peeling off his socks. He follows Whale into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whale stands over the table with his jaw open.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
He slides a note to Clay.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not like her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
(reading)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a night out. Sounds like she can't say no to her daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certainly you have better things to do than babysit an old man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. Let's get dry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whale stands just inside the closet, buttoning a crisp white shirt. He reaches for a red bow tie, closes the closet door. In the mirror, Leonard Barnett stands behind him, in uniform. Whale's eyes twinkle in surprise. He drapes the tie around his collar.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Barnett smiles his approval.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clay opens the bathroom door, calls out.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Whale?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. He goes to the top of the stairs and calls out.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's those clothes you promised?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Again, nothing. Rain ticks against the windows. Clay goes down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whale fiddles with the knot of his tie.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He trusts me, you know.

</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Barnett sits on the edge of the bed now. He smiles, a bit sadly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's glow coming from the bedroom, and the sound of Whale's voice.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Whale? Jimmy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Clay steps slowly toward the door, pushes it open. He peers in.

<DIRECTION>
INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whale pulls on a blazer.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Whale?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Whale jumps. He slaps a hand over his chest, twists around, sees Clay.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, of course. Clayton. You finished your shower already?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten minutes ago. Didn't you hear me calling?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid not. Terribly sorry.

(stands)

	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe I promised you some clothes.

Whale crosses to the closet. Barnett is nowhere to be seen.

	You're much wider than I am. You won't want to attempt to get into my pants.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Definitely not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Clay chuckles. Whale smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very good, Clayton.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a robe from a hook on the closet door. Clay tries it on but it won't close over the towel.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale opens a drawer, takes out a crewneck sweater.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely swims on me, but should take care of your upper half.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay pulls the sweater over his head.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That only leaves the rest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have any baggy shorts? Pajama bottoms?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. My pajamas are tailored. Would it be too distressing to continue with the towel? No more immodest than a kilt, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I have any other choice?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very sporting of you, Clayton.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay notices a framed drawing on the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that --?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The only memento I ever kept. My original sketch for the Monster.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
He hands the sketch to Clay, who stares down at the famous flat head, hooded eyes, bolted neck of the Monster.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay puts down the sketch, starts into the hall. Whale turns back, sees Barnett standing by the window. Whale flips off the light and closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clay sits at the kitchen table. Whale opens the refrigerator and brings out two plates wrapped in wax paper, and a bottle of beer for Clay. He pours himself a shot of Scotch from a decanter and sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After dinner, if Hanna isn't back? Can we try a few more sketches?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you'd given up on my picture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to try again. If you're game.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not? Give us something to do while we wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Clay munches on his sandwich. Whale pours himself another Scotch, takes a sip.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me something, Clayton. Do you believe in mercy killing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never gave it much thought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come now. I'm sure you came across such situations in Korea. A wounded comrade, or perhaps one of the enemy? Someone for whom death would be a blessing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay stops chewing. He stares down at his plate.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never went.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a deep breath, looks up at Whale.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never made it to Korea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you said --
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- that I was a Marine. Which is true. You filled in the rest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay downs his beer, refills the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My old man was a Marine. He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Great War?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over. He missed out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A very lucky thing indeed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not the way he saw it. To him, it was like his life never got started. Nothing else really mattered. Definitely not his family.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Whale gazes sympathetically at Clay.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist. He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted. Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing. Hey, I loved it too. A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't have the guts for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
A look of surprise crosses Whale's face.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, literally. My body screwed me up. Burst appendix. They gave me a medical discharge. All I thought about was, how am I going to tell the old man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
He breaks into a crooked smile.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what he did when I called him? He laughed. He laughed so hard he practically burst a blood vessel. Said it was a good lesson for me. Not to try to fill his shoes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm very sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Them's the breaks, right? No war stories for this pup.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's where you're wrong, Clayton. You've just told one. A very good story indeed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale lifts his glass in a toast. Clay empties his glass of beer. He motions toward the decanter.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you mind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
He hands the decanter to Clay.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clay sits in a straight-backed chair, smoking a cigarette and sipping his Scotch. Whale sketches from a wing chair across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Storm's getting worse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"A perfect night for mystery and horror. The air itself is filled with monsters."
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's from your movie, right? "The only monsters are here."
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't remember that one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	James Whale. This afternoon at the party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Whale looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said it must be weird seeing your monsters again, and you said, "The only monsters are here." I was wondering which here you meant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't recall. Memories of the war, perhaps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that was so long ago. It can't still bother you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, but it does. Especially in light of the journey I'm about to make.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're planning a trip?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Whale's gaze remains dreamy and preoccupied as SOUNDS of battle fill the room. A relentless rat-a-tat of gunfire. The whistling of bombs. The tortured wailing of dying men. Whale stands, moves over to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Barnett. Barnett on the wire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your friend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Whale gazes out at the storm. From his POV, we see a scarred and barren landscape, illuminated by occasional flashes of lightning.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He caught his one night coming back from the reconnoiter. I wouldn't take him out, but McGill did. Just to give the lad a taste. They were nearly home when a Maxim gun opened fire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRENCHES - NIGHT (1917)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We race along the open trench with Whale, the darkened sky intermittently punctured by bursts of gunfire. He reaches the periscope, pulls an enlisted man off it. From his POV, we see Barnett and McGill dodging bullets as they attempt to make their way back.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
(through clenched teeth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. Come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
McGill leaps over the barbed wire of a forward trench. Barnett follows. Just as his feet leave the ground his chest is riddled by a fresh round of gunfire. Whale's eyes snap closed, trying to obliterate what they've just seen.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Barnett's body fell in wire as thick as briers. It was hanging there the next morning, a hundred yards from the line, too far out for anyone to fetch it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whale stares out impassively.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We saw him at morning stand-to and evening stand-to. "Good morning, Barnett," we'd say each day. "How's ole Barnett looking this morning?" "Seems a little peaky. Looks a little plumper." His wounds faced the other way and his hat shielded his eyes, so one could imagine he was napping on bedsprings. He hung there until we were relieved. We introduced him to the new unit before we marched out, speaking highly of his companionship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay's eyes are filled with pity.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, but we were a witty lot. Laughing at our dead. Telling ourselves it was our death too. But with each man who died, I thought, "Better you than me, poor sod."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(bitterly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A whole generation was wiped out by that war. Millions and millions of young men.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale begins to hum, a tune we have heard before:
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh death where is thy sting-a-ling? Grave where thy victory?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You survived it. It can't hurt you now. It's no good to dig it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no, my friend. It's digging itself up. There is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it. All my diversions have abandoned me. Parties. Reading. Painting. Work. Love. All gone to me now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale remains perfectly still, staring out the window. Clay deliberates a moment, then puts down his drink next to the decanter of Scotch. He stands and yanks the neck of the sweater over his face, then tosses it on the sofa. Whale blinks at the reflection in the glass, not yet understanding.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanted to draw me like a Greek statue. All right, then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Clay pulls at the knot, lets go of the towel. He defiantly parks his hands on his hips.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There. Not so bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Whale continues to stare at the reflection, his back to Clay, his eyes wide and expressionless. He turns slowly, fully expecting the vision to evaporate. When he sees that Clay is truly naked he mutters softly under his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it is going to happen after all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd you say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Whale doesn't respond. Finally he opens his mouth to take a breath.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It won't do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What won't do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are much too human.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you expect? Bronze?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale moves abruptly across the room. He walks past Clay.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whale passes quickly through the dining room and out to the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - GARAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whale reaches for the hatbox, which sits on top of a garbage can. Suddenly a large hand appears on the box. Whale gasps when a flash of lightning reveals the face of the Monster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Monster growls out an inarticulate greeting. He picks up the box and hands it to Whale.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whale removes the lid, sets the hatbox on the sofa.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would like you to wear this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale steps back. Clay takes the box and covers his lap with it. He lifts out the gas mask.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the artistic effect. The combination of your human body and that inhuman mask. It's quite striking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Clayton. Just for a minute. Long enough for me to see the effect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's from the first World War, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are straps in back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay fits the mask on the top of his head and draws it down. The living room turns brownish yellow in the thick glass goggles.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me help you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale is suddenly behind him. Clay's vision is enclosed in two round windows, so he can't see Whale buckling the second strap.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Mouth muffled by the inhalator, Clay hears his voice from inside his head. Whale comes around to stand in front of him. He grins as he steps back to examine Clay. Clay nervously taps his knees with his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. Let's take it off now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's too tight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Clay raises his voice to make himself heard. He reaches back to undo the buckles.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Allow me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale steps in past the goggles.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't want to tear the straps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay drops his hands so Whale can undo the buckles. But nothing happens. Clay turns left and right.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes. I am still here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Two hands grip Clay's shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What steely muscles, Clayton.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale's hands squeeze. Clay grabs the frame of his seat, to stop his arms from automatically swinging a fist. Whale's hand slides over Clay's shoulder to his arm, caressing the tattoo. Clay jerks his shoulder to shake Whale off.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just take off the fucking mask!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax, Clayton. I can't hear you. I can't hear a word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale presses his lips to Clay's tattoo. Clay's muscles tense from head to toe.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a solid brute you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale's tongue moves down Clay's arm.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No? Maybe this, then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
The hand slides over Clay's stomach toward his lap. The tattooed arm swings backward, slamming an elbow against Whale's skull. Clay jumps from the chair, knocking into an end table. The glass and crystal decanter fall to the floor. The lamp spills over and the room goes dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clay's ankle is caught by the sofa leg and he hits the floor, jamming the inhalator against his mouth. He quickly gets up, on his knees and elbows, pulling at the mask. Flashes of lightning strobe the room as Whale collapses over Clay's back and holds on.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes. I have you now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
A strap breaks. Clay rips the mask off.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the fuck off!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Whale's hand squeezes between Clay's legs.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What will you do to get yourself back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay jabs with his elbow, flipping Whale on his back. His body straddles Whale's and pins him, face to face.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not that way. Get it through your fucking head. I don't want to mess with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, but you feel good, Clayton.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
His hands clasp Clay's hips. Clay's fist opens as it comes down; he slaps Whale across the face.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That didn't even sting. You're not such a real man after all. Are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay whacks Whale's face again.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait until I tell my friends I had you naked in my arms. Won't they be surprised?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't done a damn thing with you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, but you have. You undressed for me. I kissed you. I even touched your prick. How will you be able to live with yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay snatches Whale's wrist before it can touch his crotch. With his other hand he picks up the heavy crystal decanter.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell do you want from me?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Whale tilts his face up for another blow.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to kill me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay freezes. He stares down at the old man with white hair and wild eyes lying beneath him.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Break my neck. Or strangle me. It would be oh so easy to wrap your hands around my neck and choke the life out of me. Please, Clayton. We've come this far.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Whale's eyes glimmer in the sporadic bursts of lightning.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly, I'm losing my mind. Every day, another piece goes. Soon there will be nothing left. Look at the sketch I made of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay turns to the sketch pad, which lies on the floor next to Whale. The page is filled with nothing but doodles and scrawls.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, if you want to die do it yourself!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't want to die alone. But to be killed by you -- that would make death bearable. They say you never see the one with your name on it. But I want to see death coming at me. I want it to be sharp and hard, with a human face. Your face. Think, Clayton. You'd be my second Monster. Almost as famous as the first. It would be the great adventure you've yearned for. A war story for both of us to share.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay's breathing comes in quick, panicked bursts.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd be fully exonerated, I've taken care of that. I wrote a note, I'll even leave you the house, the car...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay's body starts to tremble.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do it now, Clayton. Make me invisible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay lets out a howl -- his shoulders heave and shake.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not your monster.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
He climbs off Whale, crawls away, his body collapsing in wracking, anguished sobs. Whale opens his eyes, gazes at Clay.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have I done?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sits up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, selfish, selfish fool. I have lost my mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
He forces himself to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was I thinking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale picks up the towel and moves over to Clay.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a softhearted bloke. A bloody pussycat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale places the towel around Clay's shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My deepest apologies. Can you ever forgive me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay doesn't look up.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose not.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a bone-crushing sigh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good God, I am tired. I really must go to bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale starts slowly down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whale sits on the edge of the bed, tugs the bowtie from his collar. Clay taps on the door, opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Clayton.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I hurt you?

</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing I didn't deserve.

</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Need some help?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pray you, undo this button.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
He lifts his chin and points to his collar.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can never manage it when I'm tired.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay leans in to open the button. His face is only six inches from Whale's.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you believe people come into our lives for a reason?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay doesn't answer. Whale turns, breaking their shared gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can undress myself, thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
(steps back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Whale hauls his legs up and stretches out on the bed.

	When you die...be sure your brain is the last organ to fizzle --

</WHALE>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll feel better tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Whale smiles fondly at him.
</DIRECTION>
<WHALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodnight, Clayton.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHALE>
<DIRECTION>
Clay pulls the door shut and it clicks. He stands there a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clay shakes open a bedsheet and wraps himself in it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clay finds a pack of cigarettes on the floor and lights one, then sets the furniture back up. He picks up the gas mask from beside the sofa, shoves it into its box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clay sits in the wing-back chair, props his feet on the hassock, adjusting the sheet around his shoulders. We CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whale bolts up in bed. An electrical storm flashes and cracks in the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whale gets out of bed, stares outside. From his POV, the lawn is a barren slope covered with stumps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whale turns on the desk lamp, sits. He pulls out a piece of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're back to the scene that opened the movie, a flat-topped creature stumbling through the mud. A flash of lightning reveals Clay's face. He turns, signals for Whale to follow him. Whale joins Clay on a slight rise of ground, the rim of a crater. Clay points down into it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CRATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crater is full of bodies gathered around a pool of water. Whale stumbles down, reaches the bottom and bends over the nearest corpse in khaki. It is Leonard Barnett. There are no wounds on his body, no rips or gaping holes. His eyes are closed in dreamless sleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whale looks up and sees that Clay is gone. The only other living creature is an owl, which blinks wearily at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whale lies down, finding a spot next to Barnett. He takes a last breath and closes his eyes. We CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHALE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A roar of bells blasts Clay awake. The telephone is ringing. A hard pair of shoes thunder out to answer it.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Oh, Mr. David!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Clay blinks at the sight of Hanna in black dress and white apron, chattering on the phone by the far wall.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, he did not tell me. But no problem. I will make breakfast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
She scoldingly cuts her eyes at Clay.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten? Very good, then. Good-bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
She hangs up and faces Clay with a stern frown.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not what you think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go. We are having a guest for breakfast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to talk to you about Mr. Whale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe. But I still need to talk. Do I have time for a cup of coffee before I go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late. I only hope you did not get him excited. It could give him a new stroke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
She stomps into the kitchen. Clay gets up, slips on his undershorts. He's zipping up his chinos when she comes out again with a breakfast tray. She hands him a cup of coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you do it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take care of Mr. Whale like he was your flesh and blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is my job. I did it when he was happy and it was easy. It is only fair I do it now when he is ill.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(picks up the tray)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough talk. I must wake up the master.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
She marches around the corner towards Whale's bedroom. Clay hears her knocking on a door.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Jimmy? Morning, Mr. Jimmy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Clay pulls on his shirt. Hanna comes back around the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have you done with him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I put him to bed. He's not there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to the foot of the stairs and shouts:
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Jimmy! Mr. Jimmy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Hanna starts up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look for him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Clay reaches for his socks when he notices an envelope on the floor next to the chair. He picks it up. On the front is scrawled the word 'CLAYTON'. Clay opens the envelope. Inside is Whale's original sketch of the Monster's head. He turns it over. There is a message written on the back.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Clay drops the sketch, looks out. He sees something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clay crosses the patio, hurtles down the slope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WHALE'S HOUSE - POOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clay leaps headfirst into the water. Whale rests lightly on his back, with an upward sway of straight white hair. Clay hauls the body toward the side.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Almost there. Almost there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
He gets an arm around Whale's chest and heaves the body over the curb. he climbs out, drags the body forward to rest in the grass. He grabs the wrist. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son of a bitch. You crazy son of a bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Clay straddles Whale's thighs and applies pressure on his rib cage. But it's no use. Clay sits up and takes a deep breath.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ohhh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Hanna comes down the path, her run slowing to a walk. She stares at Clay.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't do it. This wasn't me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wanted me to kill him, but I didn't. He did it himself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says here good-bye. I find it in his room. He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
She waves a folded piece of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You poor, foolish man. You couldn't wait for God to take you in his time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Clay slowly stands up. Hanna looks around in panic.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must leave. You were not here this morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I didn't do this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have his note.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy? Please, Clayton. It will be better if I find the body alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But how're you going to explain this?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(points at the body)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you get him out of the pool?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are right. Yes. We must put him back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
They both hesitate, looking down at Whale. Then Clay drags the body parallel with the pool. Hanna stoops over to adjust the collar of Whale's shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor Mr. Jimmy. We do not mean disrespect. You will keep better in water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNA>
<DIRECTION>
She nods to Clay. He rolls the body over and it splashes on its belly. It bounces a moment in the waves of the splash, then begins to sink. As it drops, the air in the chest slowly flips the body around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking up at them with open eyes, Whale sinks backward into the thickening light. His arms trail upward and the hands lightly flutter as if waving good-bye. The melancholy sound of a solo violin pierces the silence as we CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. BLIND MAN'S HUT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A black-and-white scene from "Bride of Frankenstein." The old BLIND MAN plays a mournful lullaby on his violin while the MONSTER listens outside, moved by the music. He smashes open the door of the hut in an effort to get closer to the soul-soothing sound. The blind man stops playing, looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<BLIND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is it? You're welcome, my friend, whoever you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLIND_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Monster attempts to communicate, manages only a plaintive moan. The blind man stands.
</DIRECTION>
<BLIND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cannot see you. I cannot see anything. You must please excuse me. But I am blind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLIND_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Monster holds out his burned hands.
</DIRECTION>
<BLIND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come in, my poor friend. No one will hurt you here. If you're in trouble, perhaps I can help you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLIND_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The old man touches the Monster, who recoils with a defensive growl.
</DIRECTION>
<BLIND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you not speak? It's strange. Perhaps you're afflicted too. I cannot see and you cannot speak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLIND_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT (1972)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MICHAEL BOONE, 10, lies on the living room carpet, staring raptly at the movie playing on the large Zenith console. The house is small but tidy and comfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<BLIND_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been a long time since any human being came into this hut. I shall look after you. And you will comfort me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLIND_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
On the tv screen, the old man starts to cry, then collapses onto the Monster's chest. A thick tear rolls down the Monster's cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clay Boone sits on the sofa, a baby on his lap. He's 40 now, his hair starting to thin but still closely cropped at the top and sides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the tv, daylight fills the hut. The blind man and the Monster share a meal.
</DIRECTION>
<BLIND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are friends, you and I. Friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLIND_MAN>
<MONSTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONSTER>
<BLIND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before you came, I was all alone. It is bad to be alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLIND_MAN>
<MONSTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alone, bad. Friend, good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONSTER>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the old man's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MONSTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Friend, good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONSTER>
<DIRECTION>
The blind man nods. On the sofa, Clay watches his son watch the movie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A color promo for "Chiller Theater" fills the screen. Clay turns off the set.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time for bed, sport.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Michael groans, slowly stands.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd you think of the movie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty cool. Better than most monster movies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew the guy who made it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Michael glances skeptically at his father.
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Dad. Is this another one of your stories?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Clay unfolds Whale's sketch of the Monster, hands it to his son.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's his original sketch of the Monster.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Michael turns over the sketch. On the back, scrawled in block letters: "TO CLAYTON BOONE -- FRIEND?"
</DIRECTION>
<MICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is for real?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>
<DIRECTION>
Clay nods. At the same time, his wife DANA appears in the doorway. A pretty, cheerful woman in her mid-30s.
</DIRECTION>
<DANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The trash, Clay. Before it rains.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANA>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
Clay kisses the top of his son's head.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Off to bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CLAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clay carries a large metal bin down the tidy lawn. The sky momentarily brightens with a silent flash of lightning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clay gazes up at the electrical storm. He glances back at his house, sees Dana cradling the baby in an upstairs window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The skies open with a shattering crash of thunder. Clay tilts up his face, drinks in the cool rain. Then he extends his arms and staggers along the sidewalk, imitating the Monster's famous lurch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We PULL BACK, revealing a sleepy neighborhood of small houses and neat lawns, until Clay is only a small dot in the landscape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
