<DIRECTION>
(LATE SPRING, 1957)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OPENING CREDITS ROLL over a TENT MONTAGE -- ASSORTED ANGLES of a group of men hard at work erecting a large striped "big-top" style canvas tent, INCLUDING: The long steel stakes being sledge-hammered into the lawn, practiced hands rapidly rigging the lines, the tall center poles being leveraged upright, the heavy rolled-up sections of canvas being maneuvered into position, and ENDING WITH the canvas being hoisted up the poles as the tent assumes its full and finished form.

NEW ANGLE - TENT

<DIRECTION>
-- on the front yard of the Abbott mansion. The residence is on Main Street, four blocks from where the commercial district begins. The mature, over-arching trees makes this street of prosperous houses a grand promenade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACEY HOLT and DOUG HOLT walk along the sidewalk on their way to school. Jacey is seventeen; he's as handsome and seemingly self-confident as his younger brother is rumpled and impulsive. Doug is fifteen, a popular culture chameleon who takes on the colors and affectations of whomever his "hero" is at the moment (which presently happens to be Elvis Presley).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey stops and stares with open-faced misery at the tent on the Abbott's front yard (the installation of the tent indicates that the Abbott's are having yet another of the many parties they throw every year).
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't get invited, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go to hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who cares? I'm not going and I got invited.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who invited you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pam, I guess. I don't know. Didn't open the envelope. I mean, come on, every time an Abbott girl gets her period they have some party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, shut up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kotex parties, Kotex party hats, pin the Kotex on the...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey swats Doug's school books out from under his arm -- Doug charges his brother to retaliate but they are rudely interrupted by a CAR HORN. They scurry out of the way as LLOYD ABBOTT pulls his 1957 Cadillac out of the driveway and cruises down the street. Lloyd is a well-dressed- and-fed man in his mid-forties. A Midwestern burgher, he exudes the status he enjoys as one of the preeminent pillars of this community. Doug is embarrassed by Lloyd's passing, but Jacey evidently experiences a deeper humiliation -- he gives Doug a glance of betrayal, turns and walks down the block.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAY (SHORT TIME LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELEANOR ABBOTT gathers some books from her locker. Eleanor is sixteen, outgoing, sarcastic, and very popular. She is the middle of the three Abbott daughters. Eleanor closes her locker, turns and discovers Jacey standing behind her. He follows her down the busy hall.
</DIRECTION>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tried to call you last night but the line was busy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No it wasn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was busy all night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you had the wrong number?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you mad at me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Are you mad at me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Who said I was?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just wanted to talk to you last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can talk tonight at the party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't invited.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, you were.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I wasn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, now you are. But if you're mad at me you don't have to come.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
She gives him a sultry smile, turns and glides into a classroom as the BELL RINGS. The corridor is quickly vacated by all but Jacey -- he savors the aftertaste of Eleanor's smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOLT HOME - EVENING (MAGIC HOUR)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ESTABLISHING ANGLE of the modest two-story clapboard house in a working class neighborhood. A home-made ping- pong table takes up so much room in the detached garage that it forced the eviction of the family car, a 1950 Plymouth coupe, which is parked nearby on the driveway. The garage doors are open and the garage light is on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear (V.O.) DOUG SINGING bits and pieces of "Heartbreak Hotel" in his best Elvis fashion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOLT HOME - BATHROOM - EVENING (MAGIC HOUR)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doug stands in front of the bathroom mirror (wearing a coat and tie) still singing "Heartbreak Hotel" while he carefully draws sideburns on his face with a wide-nib pen and a bottle of India ink. Jacey's reflection appears in the mirror behind Doug -- he's wearing a coat and tie too. Jacey does a pained take on Doug's handiwork:
</DIRECTION>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Christ!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINING ROOM - EVENING (MAGIC HOURMINUTES LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HELEN HOLT is seated at the dining table. She was grading a stack of spelling tests with a red pencil when Jacey and Doug came in to ask her to adjudicate the matter at hand. She is an attractive but unostentatious woman without interest in appearing to be anything other than what she is: a forty-one-year-old widow raising two teenage sons on a school teacher's salary. (She teaches second grade at Haley Elementary School.)
</DIRECTION>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has to wash it off, Mother. You cannot let him go to the party unless he washes it off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll look worse if I wash it. It's India ink, it'll turn gray, it'll look like dirt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He looks like such a clown and he doesn't even know it! He doesn't get how things work in this town. I thought you weren't even going to the party?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Changed my mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doug, you do understand that you may be the only person at this party with artificial sideburns?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do understand that your sideburns don't look real?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Doug was hoping they didn't look that phony, but he conceals his disappointment and nods:
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That they look, really, as though you'd drawn them on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
(swallows, then shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
She looks hard at Doug for a beat, then turns to Jacey.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, darling, it seems he does understand. Why don't you just go on to the party and ignore Doug. Just have a good time and pretend you don't even...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey curses under his breath and storms out the front door before his mother can finish her sermon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The curb is lined with parked cars. We hear a dance band playing "QUE SERA" and the sounds of the party as Doug lopes up the sidewalk sporting his India ink sideburns and smoking a cigarette. He flicks the cigarette into the street with well-rehearsed ease as he turns and walks up the long driveway towards the glowing "big-top" tent. Doug trails his hand over Lloyd Abbott's Cadillac, caressing it from hood-to-trunk as he ambles by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doug enters the tent and surveys the gathering -- a tuxedoed ten-piece band plays on the bandstand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Despite his mother's advice, a nauseated grimace falls over Jacey's face when he sees that his younger brother has arrived. He is dancing with Eleanor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They dance past a group of young men on the sidelines (Jacey's senior classmates), they are all edgy with envy, waiting like predators for their chance to dance with Eleanor.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going out to the lake tomorrow. Sandy wants to show-off her dad's new boat. Why don't you come?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I guess you'll just have to write me a letter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said you wanted to talk to me in private.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I meant... just... we never get a chance to be together, alone, you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DIRECTION>
STEVE (one of the envious classmates) makes his move and cuts in on Jacey and dances away with Eleanor. Jacey handles it with aplomb but his true irritation at being separated from the object of his desire reveals itself as he observes Eleanor flirting with her new dance partner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - BUFFET TABLE - DOUG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- sampling the hors d'oeuvres. He places the ones he doesn't like back onto the platter. PAMELA ABBOTT steps over to Doug. She is his age (fifteen), the youngest of the Abbott girls, and the least stuck-up.
</DIRECTION>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	u DOUG Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She points at Doug's chest.
</DIRECTION>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like your tie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DIRECTION>
Doug glances down at his tie and Pam flips her index finger up across the tip of his nose. Doug scowls and points at her bust.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I borrow a Kleenex?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Greaser.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
(mouth full of food)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got any smokes around here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ABBOTT HOME - BACK YARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doug and Pam smoke their cigarettes in the back yard. The tent can be seen in the b.g. The band is playing "MONA LISA."
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, is this Peter guy Alice is gonna marry rich?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. He's one of the Atlas Steel Vanlaninghams. Pittsburgh. He's a bully.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how come Alice's marrying him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because my parents want her to and Alice is afraid of my parents. It's practically an arranged marriage. They think Alice has peanut shells for brains or something, so they sort of suggested that maybe it was time to tie the old knot and they sort of suggested that Peter was the one to do it with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jeez, no one can be that much of a pushover.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Alice is the good daughter, Eleanor is the bad one, and I'm the one who sort of gets off the hook. That's just the way it works. Which one are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean, which kind of brother am I? You got me? The little brother, I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ABBOTT HOME/TENT - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The band improvises a FANFARE as Lloyd Abbott and his wife, JOAN ABBOTT, step up onto the bandstand. Joan has the practiced poise of a former beauty queen (as if her smile had been surgically sewn onto her face). She has a tendency to smoke and drink a bit too much and eat and sleep a bit too little.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and Gentlemen -- I'd like to propose a toast in honor of our cause for celebration tonight -- the engagement of our daughter, Alice, to Mister Peter Vanlaningham.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
He gestures to ALICE ABBOTT and her fiance PETER VANLANINGHAM. Alice is nineteen, the eldest and the prettiest and seemingly most conventional of the three sisters. Peter is the scion of a wealthy Pittsburgh family. He and his bride-to-be smile and acknowledge the applause and AD-LIBBED toasts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The band strikes up "I Got the World on a String" and Joan whispers something to Alice -- Alice goes over to Lloyd and (despite his mock-protest) pulls him out onto the dance floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guests applaud their uninspired box-step; neither father nor daughter appear comfortable at such close quarters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ABBOTT HOME - DRIVEWAY & TENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The party is going full swing as Doug wanders out of the tent and walks down the driveway. He's had enough of high society for tonight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDEWALK (HALEY) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doug strolls along the sidewalk (in a residential neighborhood) softly singing "You Ain't Nothin' but a Hound Dog." He pauses beside a rubbish can on the curb, strikes a wooden match, and sets the trash on fire. As he nonchalantly continues down the sidewalk we see several trash cans on fire in the near distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ABBOTT HOME - BACK YARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eleanor necks with Steve (Jacey's rival) on the glider in the gazebo in the distant corner of the yard. The sounds of the PARTY can be heard in the b.g. (the band is playing "In Old Monterey"). Jacey stands in the shadows of the shrubbery spying on them with pure heartache.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET (HALEY) - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey walks home with his eyes brimming with bitter tears -- past the smoldering rubbish cans along the curb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOLT HOME - SIDEWALK & GARAGE - NIGHT (MINUTES LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Jacey turns up the driveway, a light snaps on in the garage. The garage doors are open, Doug sits on the edge of the ping-pong table smoking a cigarette with his hand still on the light fixture pull chain.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three out of five?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two out of three. You serve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey and Doug pick up their paddles and begin a game of ping-pong. They are expert players and fierce competitors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TEXACO GAS STATION (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - NEXT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lloyd Abbott pulls his (1957) Cadillac up to the pumps. The DING-DING of the BELL HOSE summons Jacey. He wears a Texaco uniform complete with bow tie and cap.
</DIRECTION>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fill 'er up. Hi-test.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey sets the pump nozzle on automatic and cleans the windshield. Lloyd slips the ashtray out of the dash, climbs out of the car, and empties the ashtray in the trash can.
</DIRECTION>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was a nice party last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir. Eleanor invited me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did she? Didn't see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(slight beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You going to be an engineer like your dad was?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to be an architect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmmm... I guess some people care more about having ideas that they do about making money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I care about making money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DIRECTION>
Lloyd idly examines the mechanism on the ashtray that enables it to slide in-and-out of the dash.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That full suspension file drawer your dad invented is still in production, did you know that? We'll ship thirty-maybe-forty thousand of those file cabinets this year. Hell, that drawer put Midwest Steel Desk on the map.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir. I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An architect, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
The GAS NOZZLE CLICKS OFF, Jacey hangs up the nozzle, and replaces the gas cap. Lloyd pulls out his wallet.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want some free advice?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't waste your life making other people rich. Keep the change.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
He hands Jacey a five-spot and gets into his car. Lloyd drives away in his Cadillac. Jacey crumbles the five dollar bill into a ball. As he returns to the office he catches his reflection in the mirror of the cigarette machine. He frowns and pulls off his cap and bow tie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOATHOUSE (LAKE) - LATER THAT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The abandoned boathouse is a dilapidated structure situated on an isolated shore of the large lake. Doug strikes a wooden match, shepherds the flame, leans over, holds the match to his ass and lights a fart. The amorphous blue flame flares and almost instantly disappears as the gas is consumed. VICTOR, Doug's partner in crime and best friend, is impressed. (Victor is fifteen, too.)
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jeez Louise! How'd you do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Intestinal gas -- produced by bacterial metabolism of food residues in the colon. A mixture of oxygen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane. That's the secret ingredient.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's so secret about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not everyone can produce methane. It's genetic, that means it's inherited. There's a lot of methane in my family.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're full of shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look it up, it's all in the encyclopedia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They don't got farts in the encyclopedia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, they got 'vagina' in the dictionary, they got farts in the encyclopedia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
The ROAR of a PASSING SPEEDBOAT attracts Doug's interest.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(incredulous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vagina is in the dictionary?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'A canal leading from the uterus to the vulva'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure read a lot, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(slight beat)

	<DIALOGUE>
	A canal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOATHOUSE DOCK (LAKE) - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doug steps out of the boathouse onto the sagging dock and sees a fast speedboat cutting across the lake towing a male water skier. (Another young man is driving the boat with two young women in bathing suits as passengers.) Victor comes out as the speedboat's wake rocks the old dock.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Assholes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Jacey -- that's him skiing. He must've skipped out on work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LAKE - ANGLE ON SPEEDBOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- with Jacey skiing behind it. STEVE is at the helm. Eleanor and SANDY lounge in their bathing suits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they pass a ski ramp Steve points to it. Jacey gives him a thumb's up gesture and Steve circles the boat around for the approach.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way! He's never done the ramp.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDY>
<STEVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wants to do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVE>
<DIRECTION>
Steve lines up the approach and pushes the throttle open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey swings out on the end of the tow-rope and pops over the wake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eleanor leans over to Steve.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know you're going too fast?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<STEVE>
<DIRECTION>
(grins)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVE>
<DIRECTION>
The boat zips by the ramp and Jacey's skis contact the slippery surface and his skis go out from under him. He takes a hard bounce, loses hold of the tow-rope, and goes tumbling over the apex of the ramp into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOLT HOME - BATHROOM - THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey is soaking in the bathtub. Doug enters without knocking.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time to eat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
Doug washes his hands. Jacey climbs out of the tub and fetches a towel. And Doug reacts to...
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey's back and buttocks are severely bruised. Jacey wraps the towel around his waist and turns to his brother.
</DIRECTION>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tell Mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, shit...

(cutting him off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just don't tell Mom. All right?

</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, okay, all right.

</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey walks out of the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TEXACO STATION (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - DAY (SUMMER 1957)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lloyd Abbott's 1957 Cadillac pulls up to the pumps. Lloyd is behind the wheel, Joan sits next to him, Eleanor and Pamela are in the back seat. The DING-DING of the BELL HOSE summons...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TEXACO STATION - JACEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- sticks the mop he's been using into a pail and goes to answer the bell. He hesitates as he sees the Abbotts and lets another attendant wait on them. He retreats into the garage and resumes mopping the floor.

	Well, that's what you thought. I think Steve is... I don't even know what I think about Steve, I never think about him. I just do things. And let other people figure them out. That's what parents are for. They're real good at doing all the thinking. Why should I?

	Alice is going to have a baby. She and Kilroy didn't waste any time. He's already talking about having another, and Alice is up- chucking every hour on the hour. She's got morning-noon-and-night sickness. I've got the feeling she'll be barefoot and puking for years to come. Wallpaper patterns -- that's all she talks about. She and my mother spend hours looking at wallpaper pattern books. That's another thing I never think about... wallpaper.

She starts to walk away, but Jacey pulls her back and kisses her fiercely -- Eleanor responds with equal heat. They don't see Pamela enter the garage. Pam studies them for an imperturbable beat, then:

Doug sails through the back door. He gets a bowl out of the cupboard and fetches the ice cream scoop from a drawer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOLT HOME - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS ACTION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doug enters with the bowl and ice cream scoop in hand. He lifts the lid of the freezer, reaches for a carton of ice cream and something startles him. He cocks his head to listen and slowly lowers the freezer lid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He peers into the silvery, dim light and sees Jacey and Eleanor naked on an old daybed near the coal bin in the back of the garage. She is on top of Jacey, riding him rhythmically. Eleanor is facing Doug. She reacts without alarm or shame when she notices Doug staring at her. She coolly returns his stare. Doug tries, but he's unable to avert his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eleanor only shifts her gaze when distracted by her orgasm, which triggers Jacey's -- as she recovers her composure she says:
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Doug.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey bolts upright, throwing her off of him, and shouts:
</DIRECTION>
<JACEY>

Doug drops the bowl and scoop and charges out of the garage.

</DOUG>

Jacey gives Doug a quizzical look.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, when I was in first grade. At school? In the boys' room? Remember I wouldn't let Mrs. Horton help me, so she went and got Mom out of her classroom, but I wouldn't let Mom help me either. I told her to go get you. Remember?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I remember.
	</DIALOGUE>

Doug retrieves his beer from the roof of the car. A semi-trailer drives past with "Midwest Steel Desk, Inc. -- Haley, Illinois" painted on its sides.

	I didn't say she was stupid. Lloyd's pretty smooth. That's why he owns the company.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He owns the company 'cause he married the boss's daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He owns the company 'cause that patent saved the company's ass after the war, when all the war contracts dried up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, maybe Mom sold it 'cause we needed the money.

</DOUG>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What money? We never had any money. Money had nothing to do with it.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why did she sell the patent?

Jacey gestures to '57 Thunderbird convertible speeding past them. He finishes off his beer, then:

<DIRECTION>
INT. HIGH SCHOOL - LIBRARY - DAY (SPRING, 1958)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doug steals lustful looks at Eleanor from behind his book. She is seated across the table from him. The library is filled with students poring over their assignments. Eleanor is seemingly oblivious to Doug's probing eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doug allows his pencil to roll off the edge of the table. He ducks under the table to retrieve his pencil and his ruse is revealed as he stares up Eleanor's skirt at the soft triangle that her white panties cover between her parted legs. Eleanor's hand lowers a piece of notebook paper beneath the table, on it she has written: "Hi Doug!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doug starts with panic, rears back, cracks his head on the bottom of the table, and then, as his head rebounds from the blow, he accidentally impales himself in his chin with the sharp pencil. Doug scrambles up from under the table with the pencil dangling from his chin, knocking over his chair in the process. The tranquility of the library is destroyed by the flabbergasted reactions of the students. Eleanor is momentarily concerned about his welfare, but she cannot help but laugh, too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREETS OF HALEY - LATER THAT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doug morosely slouches along the sidewalk on his way home from school. He sports a Band-aid on his chin. Pamela Abbott pulls up alongside Doug and tails him in her 1958 Dodge Custom Royal Lancer convertible (with the top down).

<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, either you're mad at me 'cause you're mad at me -- or you're mad at me 'cause you like me. 'Cause that's how girls act. I don't know much, but I know that. So like which is it?

</DOUG>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Both.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DIRECTION>
Doug exhales with bewilderment, stubs out his cigarette, then awkwardly slides down the sofa to Pamela. She holds perfectly still as Doug slowly moves his mouth to hers and kisses her. Then he concludes the kiss to check her reaction; she timidly smiles. He kisses her again with greater fervor. Doug creeps his hand up her blouse and massages her breast. Pamela struggles to suppress her surprise, which he mistakes as a sign of her approval. Emboldened by her lack of resistance, he slips his hand under her bra. Pam is shocked by the pleasure of the sensation, then alarmed by the pace of their passion.
</DIRECTION>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doug...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DIRECTION>
Doug kisses her again and as they kiss he stares at a framed photograph of Eleanor amongst an assortment of family photos on the long table behind the sofa. It is Eleanor that he is thinking of -- in his mind's eye it is Eleanor's breast that he is fondling. Pamela pulls her lips from his:
</DIRECTION>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you love me, Doug? Do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her with such ardor that she interprets his answer to be yes, when in reality Doug is only trying to silence her. He pulls his hand out of her blouse and slips it under her skirt. Pam lurches back into the sofa:
</DIRECTION>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to kiss her again but she twists her head away.
</DIRECTION>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it... stop it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DIRECTION>
She shoves him away and jumps off the sofa. Doug looks at her with breathless confusion. She turns away from him and tries to button her blouse, but she can't see the buttons for her tears. She begins to sob and runs out of the room.
</DIRECTION>

Pamela dashes up the stairs. Doug comes out of the den looking for her. He is quite shaken:

	Pam? Hey...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(under his breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, dammit...

He slowly mounts the stairs, wary of invading Pamela's privacy anymore than he already has.

He notices a small window in the stairwell.

INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - DAYS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doug makes his way along the crowded corridor showing a few of his wounds from his emergency landing in the rose bush. He slows as he nears Pamela at her locker. She's aware of him, but pretends that she isn't. Doug hesitates as if he might say something to her, but loses his nerve and continues to mope along the hallway. Pam's disappointment is plain to see.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doug doesn't notice Eleanor and a few of her girl friends approaching in the opposite direction. As they pass him Eleanor smiles brightly and says:
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Doug!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELEANOR>
<DIRECTION>
The girls giggle, "Hi, Doug!" has become a running punchline to them. Doug is so undone by their laughter that he walks into an open door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUS DEPOT (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - DAY (SUMMER, 1958)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey collects his suitcase from the bus driver. He's become very much the Ivy League man. Doug waits for him beside the Plymouth across the street. As Jacey starts across the street a CAR full of young women, including Eleanor and Sandy, HONKS, and stops beside him. Jacey hops into the car and calls out to Doug:
</DIRECTION>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Doug! Get my suitcase!

</JACEY>
<DIRECTION>
The car pulls away and Doug irritably fetches Jacey's bag.

The hood on the Plymouth is propped open. Doug assists Jacey as he replaces the fuel filter.

<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They are?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They might not be willing but they're ready. Just have to make them think you're the only one around who has what they need.

<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JACEY>

	You mean, it's all just fake?

<JACEY>

The marquee reads: TONY CURTIS -- JANET LEIGH -- "THE PERFECT FURLOUGH" -- CINEMASCOPE -- AIR-CONDITIONED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Friday night -- a long queue has formed at the box office window, mostly teenagers, but some adults, too. Jacey cruises past the theater in the Plymouth, looking for... Eleanor. She chats with a group of friends standing in line. She sees Jacey, skips over, and gets into the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TEXACO GAS STATION (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lloyd Abbott opens a bottle of Coke that he just purchased from the vending machine. His (1958) Cadillac is being fueled at the gas pumps. As he returns to his car he sees Eleanor and Jacey drive by the station in the Plymouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIVER POINT PARK - WOODS (HALEY) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey and Eleanor are copulating on a blanket beneath a canopy of tall trees near the river. Jacey is on top, Eleanor has her legs clenched around his hips.
</DIRECTION>
<ELEANOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, come on, come on...

Her encouragement inspires their mutual orgasms.

EXT. RIVER POINT PARK - ROAD - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey and Eleanor approach the parked Plymouth. Jacey has the blanket rolled up under his arm. Suddenly they are captured by a pair of headlights. Lloyd Abbott climbs out of his parked (1958) Cadillac.

Jacey doesn't respond to the kiss Eleanor gives him, but when she places her hand on his crotch, he yanks her hand off. Eleanor walks over and gets into the car. Lloyd gazes at Jacey for a beat, then gets in the car and drives away.

<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?

</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
The woman turns -- it is Joan Abbott. Helen is momentarily caught off balance by Joan's bristling presence.

Doug spies on Joan and Helen and their curious exchange through a dining room window. Unable to hear their words he can only witness how their words are spoken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOLT HOME - DOUG'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen steps off the porch and approaches Joan, who is doing most of the talking -- but Joan seems to require a certain distance from Helen and works her way to her Chrysler Town & Country station wagon parked at the curb. Joan grows more and more agitated as she talks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Eager to hear what is being said, Doug dashes through the living room to the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - HOLT HOME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joan has the driver's door to her station wagon open now. Helen is on the sidewalk. Her demeanor is measured, purposefully matter-of-fact.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm sorry, Joan, I will not do that. If you have something to say to my son, then you'll have to say it to him yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just thought you would like to know what he's done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And why on earth should I believe anything you say, Joan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Joan is unable to find a quick retort, she gets into her station wagon and drives away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen notices a baseball lying in the gutter, she picks it up and cleans it off with her apron. As she turns to go back to the house, she finds Doug standing on the porch steps. Without warning, she expertly pitches the baseball across the yard to Doug -- it makes his hand sting when he catches it. Helen walks up to the porch.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to ask you one question, Doug, and if you have no idea, or don't want to answer, just tell me.

	Okay.

</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Doug's mind works in several directions at once as he tries to figure out how much he should or could tell her.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... jeez... I know that he's... that he's slept with her. But not because he's talked about it. I mean... Eleanor has lots of boyfriends. I think Jacey likes her more than she likes him.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go finish your homework.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
Doug lobs the baseball back to her and goes inside. Helen sits on the porch steps and now the true toll that Joan's visit has taken on Helen becomes apparent -- a bone-weary sadness falls over her. Her "tranquility" is not borne of happiness, it is only a means of coping with the sadness that is at the core of her being.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - ROAD - DAY (ONE WEEK LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A drab, four-door Chevrolet sedan with Wisconsin license plates speeds away from town.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Incongruously, the unassuming vehicle is chauffeured by an African-American DRIVER. There are two passengers in the back seat: a conservatively-dressed, middle-aged WOMAN and Eleanor Abbott. There is nothing telling about Eleanor's countenance, neither happiness nor sadness can be found on her face.
</DIRECTION>

The party is well underway, it's a younger crowd tonight. The band plays "Fly Me To The Moon." Doug stands apart from the others. He's ill-at-ease. His conversation with Jacey resonates within him. As he looks over the gathering, he's pained to discover how easy it is to see things the way Jacey does: Lloyd holding court with a group of men in tuxedos... Joan Abbott propelling a reluctant Alice towards a group of guests Alice's age (Alice and Peter have separated)... and, finally, Pamela dancing with a handsome young man (TED). She is the belle of the ball, radiant and suddenly mature in her beautiful gown. She smiles as she sees Doug, excuses herself, and comes over to him.

</DOUG>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I am. Come on, dance with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls him towards the dance floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't tell me I had to dance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just one dance and we'll be even. I won't have to be mad at you anymore and you won't have to be so sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I supposed to be so sorry about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you're not sorry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, yeah, I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry about what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You always do this to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said you weren't sorry and now you say you are. So maybe I'm not sure what you're sorry about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry for what I'm supposed to be sorry about. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're sorry for feeling me up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
(embarrassed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, shit, come on, Pam. Dammit. For crying out loud. Forget it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I accept your apology. Let's dance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DIRECTION>
Doug allows Pam to pull him out onto the dance floor. He feels like a dolt, but she arranges his hands on her and they begin to dance. She gazes into his eyes and smiles:
</DIRECTION>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
Pam is in love with Doug, she has been since they were children. Doug is mellowed by his tender feelings for her. For a golden minute they are in pleasurable bubble of true affinity. But their bubble begins to deflate as Doug sees Joan Abbott staring at them. Her disapproval is unmistakable. Doug steers Pam around the dance floor to avoid Joan's eyes, but then he sees Lloyd Abbott. Lloyd's stare is even more discomforting. Pamela senses the change in Doug's mood, but she is unaware of the cause.
</DIRECTION>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is Jacey home for the summer or is he just here for a visit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DIRECTION>
The mention of his brother's name at this exact moment sends a chill down Doug's spine.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Home for the summer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(slight beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's cheaper if he stays here for the summer. He can save more money for school, 'cause he doesn't have to pay rent. Money's tight, you know, we're sort of poor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not poor, are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell -- you kidding? Even with Jacey working summers, my mom had to borrow against the house so he could go to Penn. I don't know where the money'll come from for me to go to college.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
Doug sees Joan Abbott prompting Ted to cut in on his dance with Pamela. Doug's bitterness swells.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hear Alice and Peter are getting a divorce.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're just separated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the difference?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, you'll have to ask them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, where's Eleanor tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eleanor's... just not here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is she pregnant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Who said that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, everybody in town is saying something different -- she got knocked up, she ran away, your old man kicked her out. So, which is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
Ted steps over and taps Doug on the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
Ted is taken aback. Pamela's eyes fill with tears.
</DIRECTION>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you hate me so much?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, asshole, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Doug spins and slugs Ted in the jaw -- sending him reeling into the other dancers. Everyone pulls away from Doug and Pam. Doug massages his fist and looks helplessly at Pamela:
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't hate you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOLT HOME - DOUG'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hall light is on but the bedroom is dark. Doug lies on his bed (still dressed). Jacey appears in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You asleep?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOLT HOME - GARAGE - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doug and Jacey play another hard fought game of ping-pong in the garage. In the midst of a volley Doug says:
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna go to Penn like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey snorts with incredulous laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're gonna what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to the University of Pennsylvania. I think I'm going to be an architect, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like hell you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not? Maybe we can be roommates in Philadelphia?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're nuts. You'll never get accepted to Penn. Besides, Mom couldn't afford it anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get a scholarship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had a four-point-0 grade average and I couldn't get a scholarship -- so, I say you got your head up your ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey skillfully manipulates the volley and wins the game with a savage return that Doug is unable to counter. Jacey smiles, puts his paddle down, and walks out of the garage. Doug quickly picks up a ping-pong ball and hits it into the back of Jacey's head. Jacey turns and shoots a perturbed look at Doug -- Doug smiles:

INT. WOMEN'S APPAREL STORE (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - DAY (WINTER, 1958)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen looks over the merchandise. Doug absent-mindedly trails after his mother as he studies a large brochure about the University of Pennsylvania.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's 'scenic design'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In what context?

<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>

</HELEN>
<DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
(re: brochure)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'The Howard Lambert Scholarship in Scenic Design for the Theatre.' It's a full ride, four years. Pays everything almost. Hell, I could do that. Just have to figure out what scenic design is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
Doug looks up from the brochure and comes face-to-face with a mannequin wearing a bra, girdle, and stockings. He almost flinches with surprise and blushes profusely:
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll wait for you outside, Ma.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LADIES APPAREL STORE (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - MOVIE THEATER - SIDEWALK - DAY (MINUTES LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's snowing -- Doug paces to keep warm. He momentarily forgets the cold as he sees Pam and three of her girl friends come out of the drugstore across the street. The girls are in high spirits as they get into Pam's car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two well-dressed townswomen (MURIEL and DORIS) encounter Helen on their way into the apparel shop as she steps out onto the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Muriel... Doris.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
The women pass by Helen with obvious reserve. Helen is seemingly unruffled by their distant responses. She observes Doug as he watches Pam and her friends drive off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen and Doug walk up sidewalk (towards the movie theater -- the marquee reads: KIM NOVAK -- JEFF CHANDLER -- JEANNE EAGELS):
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you drop me off at home and take the car and go out with your friends. Go have some fun.

Doug and Helen share a bag of popcorn as they wait for the feature to begin.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - PLAYING FIELD - GYMNASIUM - DAY (SUMMER, 1959)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The commencement exercises are being held in the sweltering gym to accommodate the large crowd of proud parents and family members. Doug, hot and uncomfortable in his cap and gown, is seated among his fellow graduates behind the podium. The PRINCIPAL (at the podium) announces the names of the graduates as he calls them forward to receive their diplomas.
</DIRECTION>
<PRINCIPAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pamela Louise Abbott...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCIPAL>
<DIRECTION>
Pamela rises from her seat and takes her diploma.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lloyd and Joan Abbott applaud their daughter. Joan stands to take a snapshot. Alice is occupied with her restless and fussy eighteen-month-old daughter, Susan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doug watches Pam return to her seat; she avoids his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen is all smiles, this is a very special day for her. The chair next to her is empty. She glances behind her and sees Jacey standing in the back of the gym.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey idly surveys the gathering with irritable boredom. He is only there at his mother's insistence. His eyes settle on... Alice Abbott.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alice tries to quiet her CRYING eighteen-month-old daughter (SUSAN). Lloyd makes a reprimanding aside to Alice and she rises and carries Susan up the aisle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey's eyes follow Alice -- she notices his stare as she passes by with Susan in her arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - LATER THAT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Commencement is over -- the parking lot is a sea of cars slowly negotiating through the mob of celebrating graduates, beaming parents, and rambunctious siblings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Helen slips through the crowd she is pleasantly ambushed by three (second grade) students of hers. She has a brief exchange with the children and then moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen finds herself face-to-face with Lloyd Abbott as they both attempt to pass through a narrow space between two parked vehicles. They are both caught off-guard -- there is no graceful way for them to squeeze past each other.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congratulations, Helen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. Congratulations to you, too. Where's Pam going to school?

</HELEN>
<LLOYD>

	Hmm... Christ, I forgot. Bryn Mawr. I should be able to remember that. It costs enough.

</HELEN>
<LLOYD>

</LLOYD>
<HELEN>

</LLOYD>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Lloyd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
They pass each other and head their separate ways. Their chance meeting has not gone unobserved:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joan Abbott has been watching them from the front seat of Lloyd's brand-new 1959 Cadillac. She pretends to repair her lipstick with her compact mirror as Lloyd slips behind the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Helen finds Jacey frowning at her. He opens the door so that she can get into the Plymouth (Doug is already in the back seat). Jacey glares at Lloyd as he walks around the car and gets in behind the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lloyd flips down his sun visor (to block Jacey's glare) and pulls out of his parking spot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. IRON SKILLET RESTAURANT - THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A waitress walks across the busy diner to Helen, Jacey, and Doug at their table. Helen and Doug are eating their desserts -- Jacey is content to brood over his cup of coffee. The waitress puts their bill on the table and steps away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Helen starts to open her purse Webb Crosby appears and picks up the bill.
</DIRECTION>
<WEBB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's on the house.

The Holt family drives home from the restaurant -- Jacey driving, Helen in front, and Doug in the back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a wonderful night. What a wonderful day. My two Ivy League boys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
This is torture for Jacey. Doug looks out the window at the striped tent in the Abbott's front yard as they pass by. A party for the "Class of 1959" is underway (as a banner on the tent proclaims). The street is lined with parked cars and busy with late-coming guests.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doug checks the rearview mirror for Jacey's reaction, but his brother keeps his eyes on the road.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never understood that tent. I wonder if they own it? I'm surprised they don't just leave it up all year long.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(slight beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lloyd's mother was a tough old bird. She sold eggs. They had a place way out on Ditch Road near County Line. That was ages ago. Poor Lloyd had to walk all that way in to school and then back everyday. Charlie used to call Lloyd 'Egg-head' and he didn't mean smart.
	</DIALOGUE>

	I'm in the mood for ice cream.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>

EXT. HOLT HOME - FRONT PORCH - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey and Doug sit on the porch steps eating bowls of ice cream. Helen rises from the porch swing and takes her empty bowl inside the house.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'll have one more scoop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>

	No, I don't want to go out to the...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(exhales)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddammit. Goddammit! Look, I don't want you in Philadelphia. I don't need you around to remind everybody that I come from Hicksville, U.S.A. So if you're going to go to Philadelphia, you're on your own, dip shit. I don't need you riding my coat tails. Christ -- why don't you get your own life? Stop being my fucking shadow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DIRECTION>
Doug digests Jacey's insult, then scoops a ball of ice cream out of his bowl with his spoon and flings the gooey ice cream into the side of Jacey's face. Doug rises and goes to the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Screw you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>

Jacey hurls his BOWL at Doug -- it misses and SHATTERS on the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Missed me, peckerhead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
As Doug opens the screen door Jacey dives into him -- they fall into the porch swing with such force that its chains rip out of the porch ceiling and Doug, Jacey, and the swing go overboard off the end of the porch into the shrubs.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (inside house)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doug? Jacey? What was that?

Doug and Jacey scramble to their feet, their clothes are ripped and disheveled.

</JACEY>
<DOUG>

Doug takes off with Jacey in hot pursuit. A few beats later, Helen steps out onto the front porch and discovers her sons and the porch swing missing.

Jacey races up a driveway -- Doug is nowhere to be seen.
</DIRECTION>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, weasel dick! Come on out, you chicken shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DIRECTION>
A collection of GARBAGE CANS EXPLODE in all directions as Doug pops up from behind them and bolts down the driveway. Jacey chases after him, following him across the street. They pay no heed to Helen (in the b.g.) standing in their front yard, calling out to them:
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Douglas Lee! John Charles!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
NEIGHBORHOOD - HOLT HOME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Porch lights are turning on up and down the block and the neighborhood DOGS begin to HOWL as Doug leads Jacey between two houses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEIGHBORHOOD - HOLT HOME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doug jumps up onto a tall wooden fence. He gets halfway over when Jacey leaps up and grabs him and the fence collapses, dumping them into a back yard vegetable garden.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEIGHBORHOOD - HOLT HOME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doug and Jacey wrestle and grapple in the muddy soil, cursing each other and crushing the rows of green crops. MRS. PORTER appears at her back door brandishing a broom.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_PORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Git! Stop that! You two git!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_PORTER>
<DIRECTION>
She sails into combat with her broom swinging. But Doug and Jacey are unwilling to give up the fight -- they are finally separated by a strong blast of water. They sputter for breath and discover that Helen is holding the hose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MRS. PORTER'S HOUSE - DAY (NEXT DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen sits in a lawn chair in the back yard wearing a large straw hat and reading a book. Doug and Jacey are repairing and painting the fence. Helen looks up from her book:
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That board doesn't look straight, Jacey. Come on, Doug, you've been painting the same spot for the last five minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOLT HOME - GARAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doug and Jacey clean their hands with turpentine. Doug picks up a ping-pong paddle and bounces the ball on it, trying to see how long he can keep it bouncing. Jacey finishes cleaning up, picks up a paddle, and then, without a word, Doug serves the ball and they begin to volley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD (COUNTRYSIDE) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Plymouth drives along the two-lane blacktop past the fields of tall, green corn. Doug is driving, Helen sits beside him. She reacts to something in the distance:
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't that Pamela Abbott?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance Pamela struggles with a jack as she tries to remove a flat tire on her convertible.

<DIRECTION>
Doug grimaces as he recognizes her.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is Pam. Pull over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>

Doug reluctantly pulls over beside Pam's car. She's no more pleased to see Doug than he is to see her.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Pam. Do you need some help?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Mrs. Holt. It's so darn hot the stupid jack just keeps sinking into the pavement.

Doug frowns and slowly climbs out of the Plymouth.

</DOUG>
<PAMELA>

INT. IRON SKILLET RESTAURANT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey sits at the counter at the rear of the busy diner sipping an iced tea. He sees Alice Abbott enter -- she pulls a dollar bill out of her purse as she approaches the cash register near the front door. She calls out to a waitress who is fetching an order from the grill.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me -- could I get change for a dollar?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
The waitress is too distracted to take notice of Alice and Alice herself doesn't notice Jacey as he steps up behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<JACEY>

</JACEY>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't.

Jacey opens his palm and reveals the correct change. Alice nervously exchanges the dollar bill for the coins.

<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, thanks.

</ALICE>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have time for an ice tea?

</JACEY>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mother's waiting by the car so I won't get a ticket.

Jacey turns to her.

<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know if I can. I'll try. It just depends.

Alice goes out the door -- as she passes by Jacey he says:
</DIRECTION>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sunday. River Point. Around noon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey watches through the window as Alice returns to the Town & Country station wagon and puts a few coins into the meter. Joan waits impatiently beside the car with Susan in hand. As the Abbott women walk down the sidewalk (away from the diner), Alice glances back and sees Jacey smiling at her from the diner window.

Pamela sits behind the wheel of her convertible listening to PAT BOONE sing "April Love" on the car RADIO. Doug drips with sweat as he tightens the lugs on the spare tire. Pamela climbs out and inspects his progress.

</PAMELA>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because -- I know all the answers on 'The $64,000 Question,' because I have X-ray vision and I can sing better than Pat Boone. And because I'm really a negro, but don't tell anyone around here, 'cause you know what would happen to me.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the point?

</DOUG>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You tell me, because I don't get it! Look, I'm not rich, my father is. And I didn't pick my father. And if I had a choice between having tons of money or having another father, I'd be absolutely delighted to be poor! But unfortunately life is not a cafeteria!

Doug exhales as if he's winding up to apologize.
</DIRECTION>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you don't have to say you're sorry, and you don't have to look like somebody just ran over your dog. You just make me want to scream sometimes.

	I knew he would hit me. Peter's a real hot-head. I knew if he hit me hard enough, hurt me enough, that even my father wouldn't stand for it. Then one night I put too much soap in the washing machine and it overflowed. That did it. He punched me. Broke my front tooth.

Pamela takes his hand, gently unfolds it, and with her index finger she writes on his palm, "I love you." Telling him took all the nerve she could muster, she hasn't the stamina for a disappointing response -- she places her fingers on his lips to silence him. Doug leans over and kisses her, sweetly and tenderly, and for a long time. They will always remember this kiss.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MOVIE THEATRE - BALCONY - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey guides Alice to two seats deep in the shadows of the otherwise unoccupied balcony. They gaze at the screen for a few moments, then he moves his mouth to her ear and nibbles on her lobe. She turns her lips to his and they kiss passionately. Jacey slides his hand under her skirt. Alice presses herself against his hand and whispers:

</DOUG>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If the Abbotts didn't exist, Jacey would've had to invent them, one way or another. There are no ends of Abbotts in the world, if that's what you need. And he just needs that somehow. Well, actually, I know how.

	I was just a wreck when Charlie died. Jacey was almost two and I was eight months pregnant with you and... well, some mornings I'd be crying before I even woke up. Then you were born. And Jacey just got lost in there. I didn't have anything for him. Mother took him over. He'd cry or call for me, and then I'd hear Mother answer him, and I'd go back to sleep.

</DOUG>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After Charlie died Lloyd Abbott started dropping by on his way home from work. He felt so bad about that bet Charlie made with him at the lake. That foolish, idiotic bet. Poor Lloyd -- I felt sorry for him. He'd have a cup of coffee with Mother and me. If a doorknob had come off he'd fix it. He'd carry the garbage cans to the curb. Someone dies, people try to be helpful. But he was by here so often that people started to talk. It was fairly obvious that he wanted something more from me than just a cup of coffee. I suggested that he didn't need to stop by here so often, but... then one afternoon I was at Woolworth's, having lunch at the counter. All of sudden Joan Abbott was standing there -- screaming and yelling at me to stop sleeping with her husband, with Lloyd. I was speechless. She was gone before I could find my tongue.

	Dammit, why didn't Lloyd tell her that nothing had happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<HELEN>

	I'm sure he did, but men always say that, darling. Besides, Lloyd was always having affairs. He's that type of man.

<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahhh, Jesus... but why? Why did everyone in town believe Joan Abbott?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because she's Joan Abbott. If you cross Joan you don't get invited to her parties -- and the Abbotts have the best parties in town. The only parties.

INT. JACEY'S APARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A vintage, third-floor, railroad flat -- sparsely furnished and neat as a pin. Jacey is hosting a party. A TONY BENNETT record ("When Somebody Breaks Your Heart") plays on the hi-fi. The apartment is elbow-to-elbow with Penn men and attractive coeds from Radcliffe, Mt. Hollyoke, and Byrn Mawr. Doug sits in the middle of the sofa wedged between two coeds having separate, but equally animated conversations with two of Jacey's classmates (who are perched on the arms of the sofa). Doug wears a jacket and tie but his knack at looking out of place is intact.
</DIRECTION>

Jacey is apart from the others wooing a gorgeous CO-ED in a tight cashmere sweater.

His finger trails the shoulder strap of her bra...

	Carefully calculated suspension...

He draws his fingertip around the outside of her breast to the lower front of her bra...

	And cantilevered elements to provide support.

The traffic light changes and the other pedestrians cross the street.

Doug comes down the wide stairs with a puzzled look on his face. He stops at the front desk and the student clerk points to another part of the lobby. Doug walks across the cavernous lobby and finds Pamela Abbott slumped in a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you miss the bus?

<DIRECTION>
Pam laughs and Doug suddenly realizes:

	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn, you're drunk. Awww, man... I better get you out of here before the Puritans tar-and-feather you. Can you walk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
Pam awkwardly rises and Doug guides her to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>

	Listen to me -- go out the front door, turn right, go around to the side of the building and wait for me by the fire escape. Okay? Just wait.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you can't stand up. All right.

<DIRECTION>
He undoes the waist of her pants and tugs on her pant legs, but her panties start to slide off along with her pants.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope, nope, let's keep the panties on, okay? Pam? Can you hold on to your underpants?

Doug doesn't respond -- he turns the page of his book.
</DIRECTION>
<PAMELA>

	I don't know... I was blotto. I mean, I was so happy to see you. Then I just got sad. I got sad. And stupid. It happens, you know?

Doug snaps his book shut.

Pam is stung by his flippancy, she begins to cry.

	No, no, it's not too late. It's perfect timing. We're on our own now. No Jacey and Eleanor or Jacey and Alice. That's what stinks about being the youngest, we have to sweep up after everybody else. But now it's just us. It's our turn.

There's the RUMBLE and SQUEAK of a piece of SCENERY being rolled onto stage -- then the SWOOSH of a backdrop being lowered from the fly loft.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Almost, almost... hold on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
We hear Doug RUNNING somewhere backstage then a beautiful sunset slowly illuminates the stage -- creating the perfect mood for the modestly scaled stylized set that Doug has put into place: It is the roof of a weathered farmhouse with a dormer window and a tall brick chimney. Doug steps on stage, he's a bit winded from his quick- change routine.

</PAMELA>
<DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
(a tad embarrassed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Umm... Romeo and Juliet. It's something different, I think that's why they picked it. Everybody else was doing castles and stuff. Rooftop Romeo and Juliet by Douglas L. Holt.

<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're really good at this.

A boiling water KETTLE starts to WHISTLE (O.S.) -- Jacey goes into the kitchen to tend to it. There is a soft KNOCK on the front door. Doug goes to answer it.

Pamela drops her coat on the floor. She pulls her sweater off over her head. Doug's anguish is as great as Pamela's humiliation. He cannot bear any more if this -- he walks out the door.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She didn't betray Alice! She was just trying to get rid of you so Alice wouldn't try to kill herself again. Jesus Christ, you shit- head, Alice couldn't marry you!

Doug spins and delivers a wild, roundhouse punch that lands brutally on the side of Jacey's face -- the impact knocks him down onto the steps. Jacey's eyebrow has split open, he is blinded by blood.

Jacey turns and walks out through the door they came in. Doug walks over to his seat in the front row -- he hesitates when he sees Lloyd Abbott standing in the back of the parlor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOLT HOME - DINING ROOM - NEXT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doug sits at the table wrapping dishes in newspaper. Jacey comes in with a framed photograph of their grandmother.
</DIRECTION>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want this picture of Grandma?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can have it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey steps out of the dining room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOLT HOME - HELEN'S BEDROOM - DAY (SHORT TIME LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey is packing Helen's things. Doug steps in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm starving. You want to go get something to eat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey is caught a bit off-guard by Doug's invitation, then:
</DIRECTION>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. IRON SKILLET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey and Doug are seated in a window booth. They eat in silence, then:
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to stick around. I can handle things here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about school?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate Penn. Always have. You were right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should live my own life. Stop being your shadow. I'm not like you, Jacey -- I don't want to be like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You going to stay here? In Haley?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I was thinking New York. If I'm going to really learn how to design sets, that's the place to do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JACEY>
<DIRECTION>
(long beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(slight beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you have to get stitches?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmmm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your eyebrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My eyebrow -- yeah, ten stitches.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
Doug takes an envelope out of his coat pocket and puts it on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Found this in one of the boxes in the basement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A letter of agreement between Lloyd Abbott and Dad. Dad sold him the file drawer patent -- not Mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
Jacey opens the envelope and studies the yellowed document.
</DIRECTION>
<JACEY>
<DIRECTION>
(re: document)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A car?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yup.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ... he sold the patent for a used car?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Used cars were the only kind of cars around. The war was on -- everything was mobilized. They stopped making new cars, they were making tanks and bombers in Detroit. And even Midwest Steel wasn't making desks, they were making ammo boxes and mortar shells.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you get to be such an expert on World War Two?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	U.S. History -- high school. I should be an expert, I had to take the damn class twice. I guess Dad needed a car and he figured who- the-hell needed a full-suspension file drawer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JACEY>
<DIRECTION>
(reading aloud)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'1937 Desoto coupe convertible as is.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wonder whatever happened to it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<JACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He parked it at the bottom of the lake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUS DEPOT (DOWNTOWN HALEY) - NEXT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doug follows Jacey to the door of the bus. Neither one of them knows how to say good-bye, after an awkward beat:
</DIRECTION>
<JACEY>
<DIRECTION>
(fighting back tears)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do me a favor. Don't stand here and wave good-bye... it makes me think of Mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACEY>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. See you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
Doug turns and walks away. Jacey climbs onto the bus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ABBOTT HOME - STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doug drives home from the bus depot in the old Plymouth. He slows as he sees... the party tent in the Abbotts' front yard (with its canvas sides rolled up).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Susan's third birthday party is underway, dozens of well- dressed children and their parents are in attendance. Alice (who is very pregnant) and Peter Vanlaningham and Lloyd and Joan Abbott watch Susan riding her new pony, a gift from her grandparents. A new generation of Abbott parties has begun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOLT HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A "For Sale" sign has been placed on the front yard. Doug pulls up the driveway in the Plymouth. He turns OFF the ENGINE but doesn't get out of the car. Then he STARTS the CAR again and backs out of the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ABBOTT HOME - TENT - DAY (SHORT TIME LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Despite it being a birthday party for a three-year-old, this is very much a grown-up affair. The band is playing, the adults are dancing, Joan Abbott is flitting from guest-to-guest, Alice is dutifully silent while Peter dominates the talk at their table, Lloyd is with his cronies. Doug enters the tent -- one-by-one the guests take notice of him as he works his way across the tent -- and all are very aware of his uninvited presence by the time he reaches Lloyd Abbott. Lloyd scrutinizes Doug, then:
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to talk to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ABBOTT HOUSE - DEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doug follows Lloyd into the dark-paneled room.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut the door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
Doug closes the door. Lloyd lights a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smoke?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(slight beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry about your mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry about what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't know your mother at all if you think someone like me would've ever stood a chance with someone like her. That just goes to show you how stupid this town is -- that they'd believe she slept with me. That'd make Charlie laugh. Your old man was my best friend. He used to call me 'Egg-head' -- hell, everybody did. And back then everybody knew that Egg-head Abbott didn't stand a snowball's chance in hell with Helen Riley. Of course, that was all before I became Lloyd Abbott -- Mr. Abbott. That was back when I still had chicken shit on my shoes and twelve cents in my pocket. Charlie Holt was the only one good enough for Helen. I used to spy on 'em -- yup, I did.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(fixes a drink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Used to watch them sit on the front porch of her house -- your house -- and watch 'em talk. And talk. I never knew what to say to a girl. Never could just talk. Could dance, could listen to the radio. But I couldn't talk... except with your mother, except with Helen. I talked more to her after your dad died than I'd ever talked to any woman before then -- or since then. Jesus, I talked. Just like this. Just like right now. Just pouring out. Helen would listen and whatever I said, she'd never make me feel bad or ignorant or guilty. I mean... for Christ's sake, she never blamed me for what happened at the lake, for letting Charlie drive out on that ice. She never did anything but try to make me hurt less and I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
Lloyd is startled by Joan as she opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lloyd...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out of here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's time for Susie's birthday cake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
(exploding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddammit, Joan, go way! Get the hell out of here! Leave me alone!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
He hurls his GLASS at her and it SHATTERS on the door jamb. Joan recoils in dumb-founded shock and backs out of the doorway. Lloyd fumes over and slams the door shut in her face. He leans against the door and catches his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted sons -- isn't that funny? I wanted sons and I got three daughters. I wanted a woman I could talk to and I got a woman whose ears are stuffed full of money and Percodan. But I got the chicken shit off my shoes. My shoes are clean.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(slight beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know that's what Jacey thinks. I could always tell by the way he looked at me -- even when he was a little boy -- like I owed him something. But, goddammit, he's wrong. That bet was your father's idea and I never meant your mother any harm. I would've done anything for her -- anything. I loved her. But the only thing she ever wanted from me was just for me to leave her alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
He pours himself a fresh drink, then turns to Doug:
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to find Pam -- and you're going to tell me where she is.

EXT. BROWNSTONE APARTMENT BUILDING (CHICAGO) - THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doug navigates the busy sidewalk to the entrance of the building. He checks the number over the door to the address on the scrap of paper in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING DOORWAY - ELEANOR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (MINUTES LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doug knocks on the door. Eleanor opens it, she's dressed for work in her stewardess uniform. She's obviously surprised to find Doug on her doorstep, but she greets him with a warm smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE DISPLAY WINDOW (CHICAGO) - SIDEWALK - NIGHT (SHORT TIME LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pamela dresses a mannequin in the display window. As she moves behind the mannequin to fasten a garment she sees Doug standing on the other side of the glass watching her from the sidewalk. Doug writes a message on the plate glass window with his index finger (printing the letters in reverse so that the message is legible from Pam's POV); his message reads: "I love you."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE ENTRANCE - SIDEWALK - NIGHT (MOMENTS LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pamela comes out of the store via the revolving door and finds Doug waiting for her on the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can I what?

<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ever... forgive me?

</PAMELA>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You always loved me no matter what I did, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe that's how I love you -- no matter what. That's the best kind of love, you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But... oh, Jesus... how do we start all over again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAMELA>
<DIRECTION>
Pam's eyes fill with tears. Doug steps over to her and embraces her tenderly, holding her close.
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There. We're doing it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOUG>
<PAMELA>
<DIRECTION>
(through her tears)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doing what?

</PAMELA>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Starting over. So, what are you doing tonight? You want to go out?

</PAMELA>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some people never change.

</DOUG>
<DIRECTION>
He wipes her tears from her cheeks with his fingers, then gives a short, but sweet, kiss. Then he smiles:
</DIRECTION>
<DOUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.

</DOUG>
<PAMELA>
	<DIALOGUE>

FADE OUT.
