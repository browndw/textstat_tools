IMAGES hit the screen: ROSA PARKS, Peace Demonstrators stuffing FLOWERS in the barrels of National Guard rifles. Protesters in Birmingham, rallies on the White House Lawn.

Mixed in with the MUSIC comes NEWS BITES -- quick catchwords of 60's turmoil -- "More troops to Vietnam," "Bus Boycott," "Sit ins," "Draft Dodgers," "Malcolm X speaking."

Teeming with life on a bright day, the Ghetto moves to its own unique cadence. A YOUNG BOY, no older than ten, pedals down the street on his BICYCLE.

	Today's arrest exposes the Black Panthers for what they truly are... common criminals. Yes, we have a group of the so called revolutionaries in custody right now.

<DORSETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want it duly noted, that this operation was entirely under the auspices of the Oakland Police Department. The FBI doesn't have a monopoly on agents infiltrating enemy organizations, my friend. As I've said before, Agent Rodgers, we have things under control in our city...

<DORSETT>

	No I'm not. I'd like to say, frankly and off the record, that I resent the Bureau's presence here. "Advisory Basis" or not. And, once we get these boys put away and the Panthers permanently discredited, I'd appreciate it if you'd leave us to take care of our own. Now I'm finished.

<CARMICHAEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We say that Huey P. Newton is a prisoner of war. Many people say that that's not true. Or that the Party is exaggerating. I think it's clear, it's crystal clear that the United States has declared war on Black people. She did that when she took the first black man from Africa.

The Crowd ROARS in approval, raising Black FISTS.

<CARMICHAEL>

	Now of course, she never came out and said the words, "I declare war on Black people. She did not do that. Well now, the United States to this day has not declared war on Vietnam, but there is Vietnam. They did not declare war on North Korea but they fought in North Korea. And they did not declare war against the Indians. They just wiped them out.

MORE applause, even non-Panthers pick up on the message.

<TRAFFICANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well put. As you and Agent Rodgers know, my organization has moved into narcotics. It was decided that this product would be confined to the ghettos. However, you and your police department has made operations in Oakland impossible. I take delivery of shipments and they sit. I -- and my associates -- lose money. Vast sums of money. Now, you have some very large problems with the Black community.

FLAMES leaping up behind him, TYRONE, pure defiance, steps out and FACES the cops.
