	The good soul's pleasure was to dress me; and on Sundays and Holidays, I turned out in a velvet coat with a silver-hilted sword by my side, and a gold garter at my knee as fine as any lord in the land. As we walked to church on Sundays, even the most envious souls would allow that there was not a prettier pair in the kingdom.

	Ah! That first affair, how well one remembers it! What a noble discovery it is that the boy makes when he finds himself actually and truly in love with some one! A lady who is skilled in dancing or singing never can perfect herself without a deal of study in private. So it is with the dear creatures who are skilled in coquetting. Dorothy, for instance, was always practicing, and she would take poor me to rehearse her accomplishments upon...

EXT. FIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Dorothy, like a greyhound released from days of confinement, and given the freedom of the fields at last, runs at top-speed, left and right, back and forth, returning every moment to Roderick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs and runs until she is out of breath, and then laughs at the astonishment which keeps Roderick motionless and staring at her.

After catching her breath, and wiping her forehead, she challenges Roderick to a race.

	I was certain to win, but I meant to lose to see what she would order me to do.

Dorothy catches her breath, thinking of the penalty. Then she goes behind the trees and, a few second later, comes out and says:
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your penalty is to find a cherry- colored ribbon which I have hidden somewhere on my person. You are free to look for it anywhere you will, and I will think very little of you if you do not find it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
They sit down on the grass. Roderick searches her pockets, the fold of her short bodice and her skirt, then her shoes; then he turns up her skirt, slowly and circumspectly, as high as her garters, which she wears upon the knee. He unfastens them and finds nothing; he draws down her skirt and gropes under her armpits. The tickling makes her laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<RODERICK>

	<DIALOGUE>
	About this time, the United Kingdom was in a state of great excitement from the threat generally credited of a French invasion. The noblemen and people of condition in that and all other parts of the kingdom showed their loyalty by raising regiments of horse and foot to resist the invaders. How I envied them. The whole country was alive with war's alarums; the three kingdoms ringing with military music, while poor I was obliged to stay at home in my fustian jacket and sigh for fame in secret.

(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have endured torments in my life, but none like that. Some of the prettiest girls there offered to console me, for I was the best dancer in the room, but I was too wretched, and so remained alone all night in a state of agony. I did not care for drink, or know the dreadful comfort of it in those days; but I thought of killing myself and Dorothy, and most certainly of making away with Captain Best.

	Sure it's a bitter night, Roderick dear, and you'll catch cold without a handkerchief to your neck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
To this sympathetic remark, from the pillion, the saddle made no reply.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you and Miss Clancy have a pleasant evening, Roderick? You were together, I saw, all night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
To this, the saddle only replies by grinding his teeth, and giving a lash to Daisy.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh! Mercy, you make Daisy rear and throw me, you careless creature, you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
The pillion had by this got her arm around the saddle's waist, and gave it the gentlest squeeze in the world.
</DIRECTION>
<RODERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.

<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had not been in the room five minutes before I was engaged for every single set.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERICK>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care a fig for Captain Best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man. He looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could I refuse him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<RODERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you refused me, Dorothy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERICK>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh! I can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner. Besides, Roderick, Captain Best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<RODERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two. I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERICK>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Captain Best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in London. It is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an Englishman is a very different matter.

Roderick falls silent.

EXT. SMALL BRIDGE OVER A STREAM - DAWN

They come to an old, high bridge, over a stream, sufficiently deep and rocky.

	Suppose, now, Roderick, you, who are such a hero, was passing over the bridge and the enemy on the other side.

	What, with me on the pillion? Would you kill poor me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<RODERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do. I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERICK>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jump twenty feet! You wouldn't dare to do any such thing on Daisy. There's the captain's horse, Black George, I've heard say that Captain Bes --

She never finished the word for, maddened by the continual recurrence of that odious monosyllable, Roderick shouts:
</DIRECTION>
<RODERICK>

	Hold tight to my waist!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERICK>

And, giving Daisy the spur, springs with Dorothy over the parapet, into the deeper water below.

The horse's head sinks under, the girl screams as she sinks, and screams as she rises.

Roderick lands her, half-fainting, on the shore.

The air is fresh and bright, and the birds sing loud amidst the green trees. Roderick is elated, and springs down the road, as brisk as a young fawn.

He encounters an orderly whistling "Roast Beef of Old England," as he cleans down a cavalry horse.
</DIRECTION>
<RODERICK>

Roderick see Captain Best and Dorothy pacing the path together. Her arm is under his, and he is fondling and squeezing her little hand which lies closely nestling against his arm.

Some distance beyond them is Captain Grogan, who is paying court to Dorothy's sister, Mysie.
</DIRECTION>
<RODERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)

	No, Dorothy, except for you and four others, I vow before all the gods, my heart had never felt the soft flame.

	Ah, you men, you men, John, your passion is not equal to ours. We are like -- like some plant I've read of -- we bear but one flower, and then we die!

</DOROTHY>
<CAPTAIN_BEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you mean you never felt an inclination for another?

	Never, my John, but for thee! How can you ask me such a question?

Roderick rushes into view, drawing his little sword.
</DIRECTION>
<RODERICK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pulled out a knot of cherry- colored ribbons, which she had given me out of her breast, and which somehow I always wore upon me, and flung them in Captain Best's face, and rushed out with my little sword drawn.

<RODERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's a liar -- she's a liar, Captain Best! Draw, sir, and defend yourself, if you are a man!

</RODERICK>
<DIRECTION>
Roderick leaps at Captain Best, and collars him, while Dorothy makes the air echo with her screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Captain Grogan and Mysie hasten up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Though Roderick is a full growth of six feet, he is small by the side of the enormous English captain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Best turns very red at the attack upon him, and slips back clutching at his sword.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dorothy, in an agony of terror, flings herself round him, screaming:
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain Best, for Heaven's sake, spare the child -- he is but an infant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<CAPTAIN_BEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And ought to be whipped for his impudence, but never fear, Miss Dugan, I shall not touch him, your favorite is safe from me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN_BEST>
<DIRECTION>
So saying, he stoops down and picks up the bunch of ribbons, which Roderick had flung at Dorothy's feet, and handing it to her, says in a sarcastic tone:
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN_BEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When ladies make presents to gentlemen, it is time for other gentlemen to retire...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN_BEST>
<DOROTHY>

	Good heavens, Best! He is but a boy and don't signify any more than my parrot or lap-dog. Mayn't I give a bit of ribbon to my own cousin?

	Monster! Your father was a tailor, and you are always thinking of the shop. But I'll have my revenge, I will! Roddy, will you see me insulted?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<RODERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll send for the usher to cane you, little boy, but as for you, miss, I have the honor to wish you a good day.

Best takes off his hat with much ceremony, and makes a low bow, and is just walking off, when Michael, Roderick's cousin, comes up, whose ear has likewise been caught by the scream.

<MICHAEL>

	Hoity-toity! John Best, what's the matter here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICHAEL>

</CAPTAIN_BEST>
<MICHAEL>

	Well, well! What is it? We'll make you used to our ways, or adopt English ones.

</MICHAEL>
<CAPTAIN_BEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not the English way, for ladies to have two lovers, and, so, Mr. Dugan, I'll thank you to pay me the sum you owe me, and I resign all claims to this young lady. If she has a fancy for school-boys, let her take 'em, sir.

Michael runs after Best.

</MICHAEL>
<CAPTAIN_GROGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are a gallant lad, and I like your spirit. But what Dugan says is true. It's a hard thing to give a lad counsel who is in such a far- gone state as you; but, believe me, I know the world, and if you will but follow my advice, you won't regret having taken it. Dorothy Dugan has not a penny; you are not a whit richer. And, my poor boy, don't you see -- though it's a hard matter to see -- that she's a flirt, and does not care a pin for you or Best either?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN_GROGAN>
<RODERICK>

He looks hard at Roderick for a second to two, then he walks away, humming a tune, looking back at Roderick as he goes through the old gate out of the garden.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Grogan is gone, Roderick is quite alone, and he flings himself down on the bench where Dorothy had made believe to faint, and had left her handkerchief and the ribbons and, taking them up, hides his face in them, and bursts into a passion of tears.
</DIRECTION>
<RODERICK>

(V.O.)

</UNCLE>
<DIRECTION>
It is evident that his uncle doesn't know of what happened, but Michael, who is at dinner too, and Harry, and almost all the girls, look exceedingly black and the captain foolish; and Miss Dorothy, who is again by his side, ready to cry. Captain Grogan sits smiling, and Roderick looks on as cold as stone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His uncle is in high good-humor.
</DIRECTION>
<UNCLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dorothy, divide that merry thought with the captain! See who'll be married first. Jack Best, my dear boy, never mind a clean glass for the claret, we're short of crystal at Castle Dugan; take Dorothy's and the wine will taste none the worse. Mrs. Dugan and ladies, if you please; this is a sort of toast that is drunk a great deal too seldom in my family, and you'll please to receive it with all the honors. Here's to Captain and Mrs. John Best, and long life to them. Kiss her, Jack, you rogue; for faith, you've got a treasure.

<DIRECTION>
Roderick flings a glass of claret into his face. The next moment, he is under the table, tripped up by Harry, who hits him a violent cuff on the head; as he goes down, he hardly has time to hear the general screaming and scurrying that is taking place above him, being so fully occupied with kicks, and thumps and curses, with which Harry is belaboring him.

	Captain Grogan, I beg you to understand that, for my cousin Harry, who has been my best friend through life, I could put up with rough treatment from him; yet, even that sort of treatment I will bear from him no longer; and any other person who ventures on the like will not like the cost. Mr. Best knows that fact very well; and, if he's man, he'll know where to find me.

<CAPTAIN_GROGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick. Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family? Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN_GROGAN>
<RODERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERICK>
<CAPTAIN_GROGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this is the return you make for his kindness! Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN_GROGAN>
<RODERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan. I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine. Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERICK>
<CAPTAIN_GROGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if it must be, it must. For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw. No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
	</DIALOGUE>

	It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck. He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly. But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.

	I'll match any man with the sword.
	</DIALOGUE>

Grogan takes him aside.

<CAPTAIN_GROGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business. The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her. You are but a boy. Best is willing to consider you as such. Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service. Make Best an apology, and be off.

	No, the very same one, my boy. He recovered from his wound. The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him. It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family? The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you. But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.

<COLONEL_BULOW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are a gallant soldier, and have evidently come of good stock; but you are idle, dissolute, and unprincipled; you have done a deal of harm to the men; and, for all your talents and bravery, I am sure you will come to no good.

</COLONEL_BULOW>
<RODERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope Colonel Bulow is mistaken regarding my character. I have fallen into bad company, it is true; but I have only done as other soldiers have done; and, above all, I have never had a kind friend and protector before, to whom I might show that I was worthy of better things. The Colonel may say I am a ruined lad, and send me to the devil; but be sure of this, I would go to the devil to serve the regiment.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Give him his discharge! Bon Dieu! You are a model of probity! You'll never succeed to my place, my dear nephew, if you are no wiser than you are just now. Make the fellow as useful to you as you please. You say he has a good manner and a frank countenance, that he can lie with assurance, and fight, you say, on a pinch. The scoundrel does not want for good qualities. As long as you have the regiment in terrorem over him, you can do as you like with him. Once let him loose, and the lad is likely to give you the slip. Keep on promising him; promise to make him a general, if you like. What the deuce do I care? There are spies enough to be had in this town without him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur. He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.

<DIRECTION>
The Captain smiles at Roderick.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN_GALGENSTEIN>

The Captain rises and begins to pace back and forth.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN_GALGENSTEIN>

	Naturally, your knowledge of English makes you an ideal choice to go into his service. Of course, you will not know a word of English; and if the Chevalier asks as to the particularity of your accent, say you are Hungarian. The servant who came with him will be turned away today, and the person to whom he has applied for a faithful fellow will recommend you.

<DIRECTION>
Roderick nods.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN_GALGENSTEIN>

<RODERICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only a very little, as soldiers do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RODERICK>
<CAPTAIN_GALGENSTEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had thought you more expert. You must find out if the Chevalier cheats. He sees the English and Austrian envoys continually, and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house. Find out what they talk of, for how much each plays, especially if any of them play on parole. If you are able to, read his private letters, though about those which go to the post, you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there. But never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes, and by what channel or messenger. He sleeps with the keys of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck -- twenty frederics, if you get an impression of the keys.

	He goes to church regularly -- he is very religious, and after hearing mass comes home to breakfast. Then he takes an airing in his chariot till dinner, which is served at noon. After dinner, he writes his letters, if he has any letters to write; but he has very little to do in this way. His letters are to the Austrian envoy, with whom he corresponds, but who does not acknowledge him; and being written in English, or course, I look over his shoulder. He generally writes for money. He makes his party with Calsabigi, the lottery contractor, the Russian attaches, two from the English embassy, my lords Deuceace and Punter, who play a jeu d'enfer, and a few more. He wins often, but not always. Lord Deuceace is a very fine player. The Chevalier Elliott, the English Minister, sometimes comes, on which occasion the secretaries do not play.

	Simplicity was our secret. Everything successful is simple. If, for instance, I wiped the dust off a chair with my napkin, it was to show that the enemy was strong in diamonds; if I pushed it, he had an ace, king; if I said, "Punch or wine, my lord?" hearts was meant. If "Wine or punch?" clubs. If I blew my nose, it was to indicate that there was another confederate employed by the adversary; and then, I warrant you, some pretty trials of skill would take place. The Prince of Turbingen, although so young, had a very great skill and cleverness with the cards in every way; and it was only from hearing Ritter von Brandenburg, who came with him, yawn three times when the Chevalier had the ace of trumps, that I knew we were Greek to Greek, as it were.

He first tries a bunch of keys, but none of them fit the English lock. Then he takes out of his pocket a chisel and hammer, and falls to work like a professional burglar, actually bursting open the little box! Now was my time to act! I advance towards him armed with an immense water-jug. I come noiselessly up to him just as he has broken the box, and, with all my might, I deal him such a blow over the head as smashes the water-jug to bits, and sends the captain with a snort lifeless to the ground. Then I ring all the bells in the house; and shout, and swear, and scream, "Thieves! -- Thieves! -- Landlord! -- Murder! -- Fire!" until the whole household comes tumbling up the stairs.

Towards the end of the game, Dascher, seeing that he is losing, makes an unfair stroke, so obvious that the marker tells him so to his face.

Lieutenant Dascher, for whom the stroke wins the game, takes the money which is in the stake bag, and puts it in his pocket, paying no attention to the marker's adjurations, or to Roderick's.

Roderick, who is without his sword, reaches for a billiard cue and swings it at Dascher's face.

Dascher places himself at the specified distance.

Without a word, but in a firm and confident manner, Roderick fires his first shot into the air.

They meet a four-wheel carriage, drawn by two horses, carrying a master and a servant.

The driver of the four-wheel carriage wants Roderick's driver to make way for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roderick's driver protests that if he does, he will upset his master in the ditch, but the other insists.

Roderick addresses the master, a handsome young man, and asks him to order his driver to make way for him.

	The ladies were passionately fond of play, and hence would often arise no small trouble to us; for the truth most be told, that the ladies loved to play, but not to pay. The point of honor is not understood by the charming sex; and it was with the greatest difficulty that we could keep them from the table, could get their money if they lost or, if they paid, prevent them from using the most furious and extraordinary means of revenge.

Roderick and the Chevalier are sound asleep in their carriage when they are awakened by a violent jolt, upon which the carriage overturns in the middle of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Chevalier is underneath, and screams from the pain in his right arm, which he thinks is broken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their servant forces the door open to help them out, telling them that the two postilions have fled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roderick easily gets out of the carriage through the door, which is above him, but the Chevalier, unable to move because of his disabled arm, has to be pulled out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His piercing shrieks make Roderick laugh, because of the strange oaths with which he interlards his prayers.

From the carriage, Roderick takes his dueling pistols, and sword.

Roderick tells his servant to mount and to looking for armed peasants in the vicinity; money in hand, he leaves.

In this predicament, Roderick cannot help laughing at the poor Chevalier, who is writhing like a dying dolphin on a seashore, and uttering the most pitiful execrations, when a mare, whose back was turned to him, take it into her empty head to empty her bladder on him. There is nothing to be done; he has to put up with the whole stinking rain, and to forgive Roderick's laughter, which he has not the strength to hold in.

His servant finally arrives at full gallop, shouting at the top of his voice, and followed by a band of peasants, each with his lantern, come to his rescue. There are ten or twelve of them, all armed with muskets, and all ready to obey his orders.

	Indeed, you are right, sir. Look at me. Marriage has added forty years to my life. I am dying, a worn-out cripple, at the age of fifty. When I took off Lady Cosgrove, there was no man of my years who looked so young as myself. Fool that I was! I had enough with my pensions, perfect freedom, the best society in Europe -- and I gave up all these, and married and was miserable. Take a warning from me, Mr. Roderick, and stick to the trumps. Do anything, but marry.

No man of sense need restrict himself or deny himself a single amusement for his wife's sake; on the contrary, if he selects the animal properly, he will choose such a one as shall be no bar to his pleasure, but a comfort in his hours of annoyance. For instance, I have got the gout; who tends me? A hired valet who robs me whenever he has the power. My wife never comes near me. What friend have I? None in the wide world. Men of the world, as you and I are, don't make friends, and we are fools for our pains.

	The first days of a marriage are commonly very trying; and I have known couples, who lived together like turtle-doves for the rest of their lives, peck each other's eyes out almost during the honeymoon. I did not escape the common lot. In our journey westwards, my Lady Cosgrove chose to quarrel with me because I had pulled out a pipe of tobacco. Lady Cosgrove was a haughty woman, and I hate pride, and I promise you that, in this instant, I overcame this vice in her.

It is not only the lowness of his birth, and the general brutality of his manners which disgusts me, but the shameful nature of his conduct towards your ladyship, his brutal and ungentlemanlike behavior, his open infidelity, his habits of extravagance, intoxication, his shameless robberies and swindling of my property and yours. It is these insults to you which shock and annoy me more than the ruffian's infamous conduct to myself. I would have stood by your ladyship, as I promised, but you seem to have taken latterly your husband's part; and, as I cannot personally chastise this low-bred ruffian, who, to our shame be it spoken, is the husband of my mother, and as I cannot bear to witness his treatment of you, and loathe his horrible society as if it were the plague, I am determined to quit my native country, at least during his detested life, or during my own.

	Well, Mr. Cosgrove, I'll answer you point by point. The King is exceedingly averse to make peers, as you know. Your claim, as you call them, have been laid before him, and His Majesty's gracious reply was, that you were the most impudent man in his dominions, and merited a halter, rather than a coronet. As for withdrawing your support from us, you are perfectly welcome to carry yourself whithersoever you please. And, now, as I have a great deal of occupation, perhaps you will do me the favor to retire, or tell me if there is anything else in the world in which I can oblige you.

What sufferings, what humiliations have I had to endure! I am a prisoner in my own halls. I should fear poison, but then I know the wretch has a sordid interest in keeping me alive, and that my death would be the signal for his ruin. But I dare not stir without my odious, hideous, vulgar gaoler, the horrid Irish woman, who purses my every step.

	Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you! Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy?

Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you? Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you. I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty. What sacrifice do you want from me?
