:SC: UNIVERSE - EIGHT BILLION LIGHT YEARS FROM EARTH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cosmos on the grandest scale we know. Clusters of galaxies strewn like sea froth; whorls and smudges of light representing hundreds of billions of stars each.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILKY WAY GALAXY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A view from the edge. We DRIFT ABOVE the majestic, spiraling disk, tens of thousands of light years across.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RING NEBULA (M57) - CONSTELLATION LYRA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A local group of stars, the brightest of which is a point of hot, blue-white light...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VEGA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rings of glowing gas and debris surround the giant, blue- white star... and then we notice something ahead of us in polar orbit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An immense, world-sized construct gleams in Vega's blue light. Far too big to be artificial, by human standards -- but this wasn't built to human standards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bowl-shaped transmitters cover the quicksilver gel-like surface of the polyhedron, forming then vanishing again. We DESCEND INTO one vast bowl as it deepens --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- then silently convulses. A lost chord. We SWING AROUND, assuming a breathtaking, MOVING POV --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A message begins its journey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUBTERRANEAN DARKNESS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shadows appear, dark and murky. Slowly we become aware of a MUFFLED, PULSING sound; like a DISTANT, BOOMING HEARTBEAT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a bright light unzips the amniotic darkness; two great hands reach in to assist what we now realize is a Caesarean birth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELLIE ARROWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
age five seconds, opens her eyes wide. In the b.g., we can see a nurse methodically giving CPR to the unseen mother; the decor beyond tells us we are in a small-town doctor's office. The DOCTOR holds Ellie as he calls softly to the nurse.
</DIRECTION>

rockets through a black dust cloud where young stars are just beginning to glow. An icy worldlet evaporates, releasing gasses which blow away in spectral bursts of iridescent color...

<DIRECTION>
SURFACE OF ALIEN WORLD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are MOVING OVER an exotic, technological landscape; strange ALIEN SQUELCHES and SQUEALS become audible --
</DIRECTION>

Ted joins his daughter at the workbench where she sits in front of the short-wave, her feet dangling from the stool. He puts his hands on her shoulders.

Now in her pajamas, Ellie sits hunched over in bed, working intently on her latest masterpiece. A crayon behind her ear.

	Could we hear to China?

She hands Ted the drawing. As he holds it up to the lamp we see it shows an idealized beach, palm trees. It glows in the light.

</TED>
<DIRECTION>
He carefully pins the drawing on the wall, turns out the light. As he starts out she says softly --
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think there're people on other planets?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ted pauses, smiles at his daughter's inexhaustible curiosity. He returns, sits on the edge of her bed, now lit by starlight.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well let's see... the Universe is a pretty big place... And the one thing I know about nature is it hates to waste anything. So I guess I'd say if it is just us, an awful lot of space is going to waste.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
He tenderly brushes a stray lock of her hair behind her ear.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>

He kisses her again, rises, goes to leave, stopping at the door to watch her. Ellie looks out the window at the stars...

A comet blows by. We chase it, riding its luminous tail of evaporating ice...

careful as a safecracker, slowly TURNS the DIAL on an ancient A.M. RADIO -- finally landing on an old HANK WILLIAMS TUNE.

The old red Ford trundles through the pines along a mountain road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ARROWAY KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NINE-YEAR OLD ELLIE throws her schoolbooks on the table and goes to the refrigerator. As she starts to take out items we see her hand-drawn chart taped to the side of the fridge; Mondays and Thursdays say "Ellie Cooks!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fawn is feeding. CUT WIDE to reveal it standing in the middle of an empty road, nibbling at the grass growing out of the old blacktop. The TWITTER of a BIRD; the wind in the trees... and then, far in the distance, we hear an ENGINE STRAINING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOGGING TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
heads up the mountain road, its driver humming along to the same HANK WILLIAMS TUNE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ARROWAY KITCHEN - DAY

A stew of some sort bubbles on the stove. Ellie hums as she experiments with every spice on the rack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A) Ted sings to the RADIO as he eases off the gas to take a bend in the road --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
B) The fawn continues to graze, oblivious. We can now hear the RADIO in the DISTANCE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
C) Ted look up as he rounds the bend -- sees the deer --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D) The logging TRUCK ROARS around a blind curve --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
E) Ted swerves onto the wrong side of the road, misses the deer, sighs in relief --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
F) The truck driver looks up, sees the Ford coming at him, Ted still looking over his shoulder at --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who suddenly looks up at the O.S. sound of a HORRIBLE CRASH --
</DIRECTION>

INT. ARROWAY KITCHEN - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The table is set. A stubby candle and some wildflowers in a peanut-butter jar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie sits at her place, frowning. She glances up at the wall clock -- and then slowly stands as she sees something else THROUGH the kitchen window:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sheriffs' car is pulling up, lights going, siren silent. The sheriff looks up -- their eyes meet -- PUSH IN ON Ellie --

EXT. ARROWAY HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sheriff stands in front of the house, shaking his head as he talks to a MINISTER. VOICES continue to CALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We start to CRANE UP, HIGHER and HIGHER until we clear the house -- REVEALING Ellie lying on the roof, staring up at the stars. Her fingers grip the shingles...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRY CEMETERY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Minister kneels next to Ellie, watching her knead another piece of bread into a ball before tossing it into a small fish pond. In the b.g. we see the sheriff and several relatives watching.
</DIRECTION>
<MINISTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so sorry, Ellie. More than I can ever say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINISTER>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie keeps watching the pond. The clouds overhead are reflected in the patches of water between the lily pads.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those lily pads must look like clouds to that carp, don't you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
The Minister frowns. Gently:
</DIRECTION>
<MINISTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ellie... this life doesn't last forever. Some day you and your Dad are going to be together again, in heaven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINISTER>
<ELLIE>

(turns to him; equally gentle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He isn't in heaven; he's in the ground. We just put him there, remember?

INT. ARROWAY HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Relatives, townspeople, the Minister and sheriff mingle quietly. The kitchen table and counters are covered with a sea of casseroles.

Ellie watches the gathered from a doorway, then slips away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ARROWAY HOUSE - WORKSHOP AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie slowly approaches the darkened bench area where the SHORTWAVE is set up; the pin-dotted map above it. She TURNS it ON; the dial glows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches out for the microphone, holding it tightly in both hands. Pushes the button.
</DIRECTION>

PALM LEAF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lies on the streetlamp-lit sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the sound of a BUS PULLING UP, its door opening. After a moment a pair of sneakered feet tentatively step INTO FRAME. A suitcase is set down next to them as we hear the BUS WHEEZE OFF into the night. A hand reaches down, picks up the palm leaf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
22-YEAR-OLD ELLIE examines it, then looks up in apprehension at the old prewar Spanish structure of Cal Tech.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAMPUS BUILDING - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie's FOOTSTEPS ECHO as she walks down a corridor, its walls hung with portraits of Galileo, Copernicus, Hubble. She pauses at a photograph of Einstein standing outside the entrance we just saw. Sound up cut: THE RAMONES' "I Wanna Be Sedated" --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DORM CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An altogether different sort of hallway, reflecting the imagination and individuality of its occupants. The walls are covered with whimsical graffiti ("anthropocentrism is a 17 letter word;" "WATCH FOR FLYING POTATOES") and 3 A.M. paintings of alien sunsets; the MUSIC is coming from behind a door covered in Tolkien and comic book art.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Ellie enters this strange new world she begins to hear animated voices coming from a room at the end of the hall.
</DIRECTION>

INT. DORM ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Ellie peers around the corner we see six or seven STUDENTS, mostly male, of mixed nationality and race, passing around cereal which they eat from the box. A primitive (circa 1980) home-built personal computer glows in the b.g.; a door opens onto a terrace and the California night beyond. They stop, look up at Ellie --

<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um... I'm not sure.
	</DIALOGUE>

DAVID DRUMLIN, 42, fit, sardonic -- and the world's foremost radio astronomer -- leads a group of grad students past the first Jet Propulsion Lab radio telescopes at Goldstone. Ellie lags behind talking to PETER VALERIAN, who is about as good-looking as an astronomer should be allowed to be.

	... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's beautiful but it does get a little lonely. Sometimes I think the reason we build these things in such godforsaken places isn't to avoid excess radio traffic but because we're all such pathetic antisocial misfits... Speaking of which: How're you getting on with the old man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<ELLIE>

	He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what they all say.

</ELLIE>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(embarrassed but pleased)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep it down, okay? Drumlin thinks I'm enough of a flake as it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look -- everyone here has their little fetishes. Caven goes to topless bars, Vernon's got his carnivorous plants... mine just happens to be extraterrestrial intelligence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a coincidence. It happens to be my fetish too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
A brief but electric moment between them. They both feel it. Drumlin calls back from the head of the group:
</DIRECTION>
<DRUMLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You two coming along or you just gonna do it right here in the sand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRUMLIN>
<DIRECTION>
The other students laugh good-naturedly. Ellie and Peter, rather than being embarrassed, seem to be considering the idea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOJAVE CLIFFS - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dusky orange sun hangs over the mountains, the Goldstone telescopes visible in the distance. Ellie and Peter walk along a windswept cliff overlooking a vast desert lake.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about! Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They can't. I think it's against human nature to admit to that level of... insignificance; to not see yourself as basically the center of the universe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made. I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...

	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
A moment... and then Peter takes her hand like it's the most natural thing in the world.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dunno. I know I should be objective, ice-cold hard-assed scientific about it, but just on an intuitive level -- what's the point of a universe so vast if we're the only ones it it? It'd just be such a... waste of space.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie stops, looks at him -- and then slowly, carefully leans in and kisses him. A pleasantly awkward beat.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.

</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter laughs.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

A million stares blaze overhead as Peter and Ellie make love on an Indian blanket in the middle of the desert. Ellie looks searchingly up into Peter's face... and then her gaze drifts upwards to the canopy above...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie and Drumlin walk briskly, in heated discussion.
</DIRECTION>
<DRUMLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Miss Arroway, not only is it too Speculative a subject for a doctoral dissertation, at this point in your career it'd be tantamount to suicide.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRUMLIN>
<ELLIE>

	I'm willing to take that risk.

</ELLIE>
<DRUMLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not. You're far too promising a scientist to waste your considerable gifts on this nonsense --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRUMLIN>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity. There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DRUMLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And only two probabilities: One: there is intelligent life in the universe but they're so far away you'll never contact it in your lifetime --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRUMLIN>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're --

</DRUMLIN>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if you're wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as he starts to speak)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DRUMLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I disagree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRUMLIN>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then disagree but don't stand in my way!

</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
By this point they've gathered a small crowd. Drumlin regards her for for a moment; then, softly:
</DIRECTION>
<DRUMLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it that makes you so lonely, Miss Arroway? What is it that compels you to search the heavens for life when there's so much of it being neglected right here at home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRUMLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Body blow. Ellie just stares, stunned. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<DRUMLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will approve a general thesis on the detection of radio signals from space but that's all. No E.T.I.s. Enough?
	</DIALOGUE>

Flushed, overwhelmed... Ellie nods. Enough.

	Please. Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F. I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...

<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ellie... even if you do manage to raise the money, have you thought about what it would really mean to follow through on this? I mean a college fetish is one thing, but we're talking about your career. You won't be publishing. You won't be taken seriously... and you could spend your entire life looking and never find anything at all.

Ellie pauses; looks out at the endless ocean of green. Quietly:
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it. This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology. The moment when contact becomes possible. We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.

<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe that's the problem. I want... a family, Ellie. I want kids. A townhouse on L street instead of still living like a college kid. A real life. Maybe that makes me a sellout but I don't care anymore. It's what I want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you think I don't want those things? You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday?

(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Over an ancient Mr. Coffee machine some hysteric has scribbled: "Someone has been drinking the coffee without leaving the .10c in the cup and WE KNOW WHO YOU ARE." Ellie drops her dime in.

The lights are off; the large room is illuminated solely by the night sky and glowing banks of electronic equipment.

	My fellow Americans, citizens of the world, ladies and gentlemen of the press. At 7:09 A.M. Eastern Standard Time yesterday morning, American scientists detected a radio signal from space. This message was largely mathematical, and in spite of some of the headlines I've seen today, so far seems to be completely benign in nature. To better explain the extraordinary events of the last 24 hours, I'm turning you over to... Doctor David Drumlin.

Ellie looks up in surprise. Drumlin doesn't miss a beat as he strides to the podium.

<DRUMLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning. In 1936 a very faint television signal transmitted the opening ceremonies of the Olympic games as a show of German superior technology. That signal left Earth at the speed of light and twenty-six years later arrived on Vega, which they then sent back to us hugely amplified. As evidence of intelligence this is indisputable --

Various preachers and new age gurus speak to gatherings all along the new cyclone fence surrounding the VLA.

	I want you to listen to me, carefully.

<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lights.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HADDEN>
<DIRECTION>
The lights dim. The wall monitors take center stage.
</DIRECTION>
<HADDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive the theatrics, it's a weakness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HADDEN>
<DIRECTION>
Hadden pulls on a pair of gloves for an imaginary VR keyboard. He gestures for Ellie to sit beside him, facing the monitors. He begins to type as the monitors scroll hieroglyphics --
</DIRECTION>
<HADDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Page after page of data -- over sixty-three thousand in all, if I'm not mistaken... and at the end of each...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HADDEN>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A page-break signal. A period.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<HADDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not if you think like a Vegan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HADDEN>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<HADDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- even if he doesn't receive the entire transmission. Heaven is the mustard seed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HADDEN>
<DIRECTION>
Hadden ghost-types a series of commands. The monitor wall syncs into a giant vidscreen --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hieroglyphics begin to enlarge. An almost invisible dot in the lower right corner of the screen -- the page- break signal -- grows larger and larger, until it reveals a level of complexity and detail greater than that of the hieroglyphics themselves.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(breathless)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
These new symbols begin to mutate change... something is happening, Hadden leans in to Ellie.
</DIRECTION>
<HADDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll like this part. A little flashy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HADDEN>
<DIRECTION>
ON SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The symbols metamorphose into strange, fractal shapes; like crystals, they begin to grow and shift, interacting in a stunningly beautiful and intricate ballet --
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some kind of circuitry...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<HADDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very good, Doctor. I've also detected structural elements, back references, a general movement from the simple to the complex -- all of which would seem to indicate instructions -- an enormously complicated set of instructions -- for building something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HADDEN>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A machine.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Hadden's nod)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But a machine that does what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<HADDEN>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That would seem to be the question of the hour.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to build it, Doctor. Of course I'm already lobbying through the usual channels of influence and corruption -- but as I said, my colorful past has made many of those channels... difficult to navigate. I need someone on the inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HADDEN>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And in return?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<HADDEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In return... you get the primer -- and with it the power to stay in the game. Do we have a deal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HADDEN>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie pulls herself away from the hypnotic display.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But. If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charts display a decoded periodic table, the slice of circuitry; monitors scroll through hundreds of decoded pages.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<PRESIDENT_LASKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A transport. So are they coming or are we going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT_LASKER>
<KITZ>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The transport theory is only one hypothesis, Ms. President, and in my view a rather naive one. It could just as easily be some kind of Trojan Horse. We build it and out pours the entire Vegan army.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITZ>
<CHAIRMAN_OF_JOINT_CHIEFS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why even bother to risk personnel? Why not send some kind of doomsday machine? Every time an emerging technological civilization announces itself by broadcasting radio waves into space they reply with a message. The civilization builds it and blows itself up. No expeditionary force needed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAIRMAN_OF_JOINT_CHIEFS>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds. There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile. We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DRUMLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Interesting analogy. And how guilty would we feel if we happened to destroy some microbes on a beach in Africa?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRUMLIN>
<KITZ>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to Ellie)

<RICHARD_RANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From a non-secular perspective, I'm forced to agree.

</RICHARD_RANK>
<DIRECTION>
All heads turn to RICHARD RANK, a surprisingly young and well-spoken spokesman for the religious right.
</DIRECTION>
<RANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My coalition's phone lines have been flooded with calls from concerned families, wondering if this message signifies the end of the world or the advent of the rapture.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We feel that U.S. policy in this matter wants to be extremely conservative -- if there's any chance of danger or threat to our way of life perhaps the message and its contents should simply be disregarded.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANK>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is absurd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Drumlin shoots her a warning look; Rank ignores her.
</DIRECTION>
<RANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Bible states that God made man in His own image. From everything I've been told it's highly unlikely the creatures who sent this message resemble human beings in any way, shape or form, ergo, they are not of God; and therefore by definition evil. My constituents simply want to know what their government plans to do to protect them --
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANK>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms. President, forgive me but I thought this was to be a serious discussion of policy and technical issues, not a war council against Satan's minions --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<PRESIDENT_LASKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Rank's organization represents the point of view of tens of millions of families, Dr. Arroway. Feel free to disagree, but there won't be any suppressing of opinions here today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT_LASKER>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists. If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<JOSS>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But a voice from the sky is just what you say you've found.

</JOSS>
<DIRECTION>
Palmer Joss sits forward in his chair.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I agree with Mr. Rank that there are unavoidable religious implications here -- but I don't think it justifies taking an alarmist position. Dr. Arroway is right -- their chosen means of communication was a scientific one, and a scientific approach is probably appropriate, at least until the theological dimensions of the problem become more apparent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And where exactly does that put your position...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<JOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd have to say I don't know enough to have one yet. For the moment I don't believe the two approaches have to be mutually exclusive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie looks at him, impressed in spite of herself.
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT_LASKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the status of the decryption effort?

<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DRUMLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're continuing around the clock, but the amount of data is enormous. It's difficult to tell when we'll find the key that will tell us the machine's purpose -- maybe tomorrow, maybe next year, maybe never.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRUMLIN>
<PRESIDENT_LASKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to know the minute you find anything.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Of course, Ms. President. We'll keep you fully informed.

That's the cue; most of the gathered begin to rise, make their way to the door. As Ellie collects her things Drumlin accompanies her out -- then starts to shut the door behind her --

	The President wants to discuss a few matters in private.

But it's too late. The door closes on the inner circle.

Ellie stands with a group of dignitaries, straining to make small talk. As she glances up a familiar face catches her eye: Peter Valerian.

He looks up, sees her too. A beat... he whispers something to the young woman he's standing with; she looks up too. They excuse themselves to Drumlin, make their way over.

Their voices and FOOTSTEPS ECHO as they walk past old spacecraft. They sip their champagne.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... What I'm curious about are the wilderness years. You're out there all alone, no money, mocked by the skeptics. It must have taken tremendous faith.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd say logic more than faith. The odds were on my side.

	And what would you have done if the odds had gone against you?

	Very smooth. It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Joss laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old. I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Joss looks at her -- challenged, intrigued. Slowly:
</DIRECTION>
<JOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who was it who said -- it was a scientist I think -- that one's sophistication is determined by the ability to tolerate paradox -- to hold contradictory ideas at the same time...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<DIRECTION>
They approach a circular brass railing surrounding a circular mosaic below; at its center is a Foucault pendulum; a basketball-sized iron sphere suspended from the ceiling. They lean on the railing.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... which I suppose is as good a definition of faith as any.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(getting an idea; smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Care to test yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<DIRECTION>
He takes her champagne glass, sets it down on the floor alongside his, then climbs under the rail. At her surprise --
</DIRECTION>
<JOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay. I'm a preacher.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<DIRECTION>
He offers her his hand. She takes it, climbs under the railing. Joss helps her down into the circular space below.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your 'faith' tells you that the distance a pendulum swings from the vertical can never get bigger, only smaller.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not faith, it's physics. The second law of thermodynamics.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Joss places his arms around the metal ball and walks it over to the outer rim of the circle, right in front of Ellie's nose.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you believe this law with all your heart and soul.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And mind, yes. What are you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<JOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So if I let the pendulum go, when it swings back you wouldn't flinch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie pauses. Then, almost curiously.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Joss lets go. We see the ball fall away and reach the opposite railing. As it slows and then reverses direction it appears to approach much faster than we expected.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't lean forward. Not even a hair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<DIRECTION>
As it careens towards her, the ball grows alarmingly in size. We understand completely when the pendulum almost reaches her and she instinctively moves. But Ellie can't believe it.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I flinched.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<JOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only a tiny bit. Even the most devout believer is allowed a little doubt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not doubt. That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.

Stars shine down as Ellie and Joss walk along the portico. The party continues inside. The mood is subdued, intimate.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... It's an old story. I grew up in South Boston, more or less on the streets. By the time I was thirteen I'd tried my first hit of heroin, by fifteen I'd stopped using but I was dealing full-time. By the time I was nineteen I decided I didn't want to live any more, at least not in a world like that. One day I got on a bus; I got as far as Ohio before my money ran out, and after that I just kept walking. Didn't eat, didn't sleep... just walked. I ended up collapsing in a wheat field. There was a storm... I woke up...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's about as far as words'll go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you try?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<JOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had... an experience. Of belonging. Of unconditional love. And for the first time in my life I wasn't terrified, and I wasn't alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(delicately)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<JOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I'm a reasonable person, and reasonably intelligent. But this experience went beyond both. For the first time I had to consider the possibility that intellect, as wonderful as it is, is not the only way of comprehending the universe. That it was too small and inadequate a tool to deal with what it was faced with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat, then softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God. To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something. But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real. Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<JOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you love your parents?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<ELLIE>

<ELLIE>

AFS Berets sit stone-faced, barely visible. UP ahead the twinkling lights of an installation becomes visible.

The convoy passes through a security gate in the first perimeter. AFS officers check I.D. and cargo. As the convoy continues our VIEW begins to RISE, REVEALING three more checkpoints beyond --

Out VIEW continues to CLIMB, REVEALING an immense sprawl of lights and buildings. Concentric electric fences surround the rambling facility; new roads are still being added to old ones. Encircling the installation is a vast graveyard of discarded aircraft -- the detritus of Twentieth Century war-making. And in the center of it all lies an enormous open area, its very emptiness full of danger and promise. Orange surveying FLAGS RUFFLE in the BREEZE.

INT. OBSERVATION FACILITY (MACHINE, TEXAS) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An enormous multi-tiered room bustling with activity. The main floor consists of tables devoted to various constituents of the international selection committee; each area devoted to a different discipline: medical, psychological, philosophical, religious, diplomatic/political, and military/communications.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is dominated by ten enormous overhead viewscreens, each monitoring the activity of one of the ten machine candidates while also displaying telemetry readouts of their vital signs. One candidate is undergoing a psychological evaluation, another is visible via infrared camera in a sensory deprivation tank; another on a treadmill, another sleeping (EEG displayed); we also catch brief glimpses of Ellie and Drumlin. All are watched with great interest by the committee members swarming on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A level above the floor and looking out over it THROUGH large floor to ceiling windows is the pool media area; a group of REPORTERS and camera crews allowed limited access, with blue-badged MACHINE SECURITY carefully monitoring their every word. As we MOVE THROUGH the maelstrom we COME ACROSS a familiar face...
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm here with Peter Valerian, recently named David Drumlin's replacement as Science Advisor to the President. Doctor, there were loud complaints from the international community last week when it was announced that three of the ten candidates -- were to be Americans. How do you defend that decision?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(a bit nervous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe the response was somewhat disingenuous; when it was determined that national interests would be represented on a pay for play basis it was understood that the U.S., by shouldering close to one third of the financial burden, would be entitled to commensurate representation.

EXT. MEDIA CITY (MACHINE, TEXAS) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A vast encampment of vans, tents, reporters and satellite dishes; print and video journalists from every nation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Competing twenty-foot high skyboxes from various networks overlook the action. Our VIEW continues to CLIMB until finally in the distance, wavy and hard to make out THROUGH the LONG LENS, we can see a structure beginning to rise. Our first glimpse of the machine.
</DIRECTION>
<CNN_REPORTER>

INT. OBSERVATION FACILITY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two hundred members of the ISC watch each of the candidates' reactions. FEATURE Joss, studying the screens intently --

For CAPTAIN JOHN RUSSELL, a classic chiseled Astronaut type, this is as easy as breathing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For Drumlin it's not quite that, but he takes it, stoically.

Ellie seems to be enjoying her self tremendously.

	You know what, sir? You're right. We have no idea whatsoever what one of you may encounter.

<RUSSIAN_CANDIDATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Based on what evidence? As far as we know all they know about us is what they've learned from watching three minutes of German television... even if they do not mean to do damage they may do so inadvertently. Look at the impact they've had on the world by simply sending the message...

	</DIALOGUE>
</DRUMLIN>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe they are. Maybe this is all part of the package. The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale. Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<JEAN_CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very well. Assume this is true. Assume they have only the best of intentions. Suppose they decide to just step in and solve all our problems for us. You have no objection to them so flagrantly intervening in human affairs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN_CLAUDE>
<ELLIE>

<TEAM_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This just came in from systems integrations in Hokkaido.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEAM_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
He presses play. The monitor shows a large, apparently empty lucite chamber. A clock showing tenths and hundredths of a second is inset into the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<TEAM_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The chamber contains an exotic substance manufactured according to message specifications. In its normal state it appears as you see it, a transparent gas which is apparently breathable. As you'll see, it also has some other... unusual properties.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEAM_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
A Japanese technician places his hand inside a waldo, picks up a REVOLVER. He aims it into the chamber, FIRES --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- as then we see the bullet slow, coming to a dead stop in mid-air. We see the same thing again, this time in slow motion. As we watch, the air in the chamber seems to thicken around the bullet, changing from a gas to liquid, from gel-like colloidal to diamond-hard solid in a tenth of a second.
</DIRECTION>
<TEAM_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The substance appears to have intelligent multiphasic properties; able to shift states at will. We believe it may function as some sort of transport medium.

	Now I know why the Japanese gave up having a candidate in exchange for licensing rights...

	</DIALOGUE>
</TEAM_LEADER>
<DRUMLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRUMLIN>
<DIRECTION>
The Team Leader pushes play. We see the action as he describes it:
</DIRECTION>
<TEAM_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was apparently an aqueous residue covering part of the chamber floor. The technician slips. As he falls the substance hardens around him, breaking his fall...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEAM_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
We see the technician as his fall slows -- and then he suddenly convulses -- and then stops, suspended at an odd angle slightly above the ground. He doesn't move. Ellie, Drumlin and the other candidates watch in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<TEAM_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and solidifying in his lungs and bloodstream, killing him instantly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEAM_LEADER>
<ELLIE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe... maybe it was an anomalous reaction. Maybe when it's correctly integrated with other components of the machine...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks again to the eerie sight of the suspended dead technician. Team Leader snaps off the monitor.
</DIRECTION>
<TEAM_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe. Unfortunately that's all we have is maybes, increasing exponentially every day. This machine is now building itself as much as we're building it. Almost as if it's growing, evolving...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEAM_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
They all take this in... then instinctively look out the hanger doors at the structure taking shape in the field beyond, now rising to a height of twelve stories. We PUSH IN ON it...
</DIRECTION>

	And even if they aren't, something else may go wrong. There may be an unforeseen mechanical failure. You may be marooned, unable to return. There are a thousand reasons we can think of for the occupant of the machine to have this with them -- but mostly it's for the reasons we can't think of.

Ellie pulls out in her T-Bird. As she drives toward the perimeter she sees a figure walking toward her. Joss. He sticks out a thumb.

EXT. TEXAS COUNTRYSIDE - DAY

Ellie tears down the highway, wind whipping her hair. Joss is pushed back in his seat, enjoying himself immensely. He yells over the WIND'S ROAR:

<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's too... elegant. The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<JOSS>
<DIRECTION>
(after a pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't deny I was ambitious. When I had my... experience... I wanted to tell my story to as many people as possible. I'm the first to admit that process included making some compromises.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(still seems troubled; then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't answer my question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt. And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<JOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't consider you the enemy, Ellie. I'm not 'out to get' technology. I only ask the question: Does it have to have all the answers? I look out there and I see so much emptiness... People are so starved for meaning, and it's something they just don't seem to be getting from science.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<JOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't follow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isn't because science has obscured it... maybe it's just revealed it isn't there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Now it's Joss' turn to be disarmed. He looks at her; softly:
</DIRECTION>
<JOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you really believe your life is meaningless?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<JOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And yet you're willing to die for this cause, the one thing that's given your life a sense of purpose. Don't you see the contradiction here -- ?

	An excellent question, Doctor. But what if we don't like the answer?

	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<JOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if their answer is, 'Oh, that's easy. A thousand years ago our world was in terrible shape, our population out of control, violent crime, no food... so we called a general council and decided to eliminate the anit-social. The weak. The sick. The unwanted. And ever since we've been doing great.'

</PROJECT_OFFICIAL>
<ELLIE>

	Nobody is proposing we censor the truth here, Doctor. We're simply talking about putting a mechanism in place --

Ellie is making her final, prepared remarks to the committee.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't claim to be a perfect example of the human species... far from it. But I think, paradoxically, that's my strength as a candidate. Because I think we need to share the truth of who we are with them -- our strengths --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes suddenly fall on Joss, looking at her from his seat on the panel. A timeless beat --
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- and our weaknesses. To go to them openly, nakedly, and say these are our dreams, these are our fears. What I'm saying, ladies and gentlemen, is that I believe we should make this journey with honesty and integrity or not at all.

The words are spoken with passion and conviction, but something tells us this isn't playing in Peoria. Ellie looks uncertain.

Drumlin in the chair. Reassuring, smooth -- statesman- like.
</DIRECTION>
<DRUMLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and gentlemen, I come to you today not only as a scientist, but as a politician -- an occupation for which I make no apologies. With all due respect to Doctor Arroway's talk of naked honesty and integrity -- high ideals, to be sure -- I believe it would be foolish and, in fact, dangerous to ignore the fact that what we are dealing with here is a political situation -- the most political of situations -- and one that must be examined in that context.

A murmur of assent from the ISC. Drumlin continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DRUMLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and gentlemen. I'm proud of what we've achieved as a species and a civilization. I would hate to see all that we stand for, all that we've fought for for a thousand generations, slighted, taken advantage of, or God forbid, done in by the fact that at the final hour we chose to send a representative who didn't put our best interests first.

	It's not even close. Arroway may be a good, even great scientist, but she's politically tone-deaf and a loose cannon. She leaked the message without so much as a nod to the D.O.D. or N.S.C., and I don't think anybody here would say diplomacy's her strong suit. Drumlin may not be as glamorous a choice, but he's reliable, patriotic, sound. He has impeccable scientific credentials. And I think he'd be perceived by the public as the safer choice.

	I believe that the person we're selecting will play a crucial role in humanity's future. I believe that when this person comes back -- if they come back -- they will be seen as being anointed by a higher intelligence, and may well emerge as one of the most important people on Earth. It may be true that Eleanor Arroway is not a perfect human being -- but I believe her honesty, her purity, and her integrity to be unimpeachable. Ms. President -- aren't those qualities that this representative should embody? Are we seriously considering choosing a man who openly claims that he stands for nothing more than political self-interest to be the one person to represent the human race?

INT. CONTROL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone watches as the enormous dowel is positioned beside a giant sphere of the machine and prepared for insertion. Then Team Leader spots something on one of the monitors -- he enlarges the image -- Joseph climbing onto one of the dowels. Team Leader pushes the abort button. ALARMS SOUND as the controllers panic -- Drumlin looks around in confusion --

stands next to the sphere, puts a hand out to touch it. A last look up to heaven -- and then he EXPLODES in a BALL of FLAME --

Everyone freezes -- a timeless moment... and then, as the smoke begins to clear, we see the damage to the machine is minimal. Drumlin exhales. Everyone breathes a nervous sigh of relief --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and then one of the MONITORS begins to RATTLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MACHINE SITE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entire SUPERSTRUCTURE begins to RUMBLE. A giant erbium dowel shudders downwards, crashing into the sphere and ripping a hole in the machine. The controllers stare as another EXPLOSION rents the bottom of the machine, weakening the support structure. Gantries begin to collapse around it as the giant sphere falls off its support --

The SPHERE IMPLODES in a blinding flash of light. Time and gravity seem suspended as debris gets sucked into an eerily vacuole of nothingness -- as if for a moment, the space around the machine is turning inside out -- and then the VACUOLE EXPLODES in a unearthly FIREBALL of nuclear proportions.

The fireball begins to expand, the shockwave spreading out to envelop the entire facility. Bodies are tossed through the air like rag dolls. The blast wave approaches the control tower --

A TV above the bar plays an afternoon talk show ("Intergalactic Fashions -- today on Geraldo") as Ellie nurses her second beer.

Suddenly a LOW RUMBLE is heard, barely on the threshold of sound. GLASSES RATTLE in their racks -- and then the TV GOES OFF, followed by the lights and the JUKEBOX. PUSH IN ON Ellie as she looks up at the frightened Bartender --

<DIRECTION>
CNN coverage of the funeral continues. As we SLOWLY WIDEN, the next monitor over shows footage of the destruction at Machine, Texas; FBI sharpshooters and police firing into a run-down motel; an amateur video of Joseph's suicide note. He is spookily well-spoken, calm:

We CONTINUE TO WIDEN as a pair of familiar glasses float INTO VIEW; a gnarled hand plucks them from mid-air as Hadden turns to look out a panorama window showing a breathtaking view of Earth from 250 miles out in space.

The Japanese Major Domo we saw at Hadden's plane appears in the hatchway; Ellie a moment later. He points toward the other end of the airlock. Ellie starts to glide-walk through, glancing back to see the Major Domo gesturing to three, very young, very beautiful women with empty eyes. Ellie keeps moving...

The enormous chamber is webbed with delicate organosilicate implanted pattern. An inner dodecahedron marks the core of the machine. Ellie steps through, staring in wonder.

Something is happening inside the machine; a shimmering, almost as if the air itself was changing...

The shimmering amber-lit gas surrounds Ellie, in some places remaining gaseous (for breathing); in others aqueous, in others a gel-like colloidal, supporting her. Nervously:

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MACHINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sense of acceleration is tremendous, as if dropping through the center of the earth. The fluid has become more gel-like solid, supporting Ellie's body. The front panel is now opaque, the left and right panels semi- transparent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bright blue-white light up ahead, illuminating what seems not so much to be a tunnel as a sense of space warping around us; like being inside a fisheye lens as it dolly/zooms. Ellie speaks breathlessly into her mike...
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm falling... sense of enormous acceleration. It's a wormhole, it's got to be, but how do they keep it stable? The energy required --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Now the front panel becomes transparent: Ahead is a dazzlingly bright blue-white object with dimmer copies of it surrounding it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As speed increases the subsidiary images become fainter, moving in a transverse circle. Behind Ellie, though she doesn't see it, the panels show similar images of the launch site at Hokkaido. The blue-white light from up ahead becomes blinding as the Dodec erupts into space.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a star, I'm in orbit around a star, spectral type A, maybe early F. Getting weird multiple images here; relativity effects? Accretion disk... gotta be Vega, only... oh my God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
A great mass passing above eclipses Vega's light, throwing the Dodec into shadow. The immense polyhedron construct from the opening of the film, dappled with its millions of transmitters, drifts overhead. It's easily 100 miles across. Staring in awe:
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're talking to the whole universe... Okay, okay, clearly artificial, some sort of relay station but the scale is just... tens of thousands of receivers, hundreds... some sort of biotechnology, like the machine but... don't see anything like a docking port...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
The machine suddenly makes a hard left; an object appears ahead, an impossible inside-out sphere in space; four dazzling lights seem to be embedded within it.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Another wormhole? Bigger this time -- oh God --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
The Dodec plunges down it as Ellie struggles to contain her wildly fluctuating emotions. The surrounding gas begins to shift color, modulate --
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Okay. A series of wormholes, linked together, artificially created, but why would...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, it's a subway system.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
The Dodec erupts into a quadruple star system. A pair of red and blue stars orbit each other while a pair of yellow-green dwarfs orbit them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie swallows hard, hyperventilating --
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quadruple system... incredible... don't recognize any background constellations... hundreds, possibly thousands of light years from Earth now. So beautiful. So...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie growing woozy; trying to snap out of it.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The physics must be a thousand, ten thousand years beyond us but... oh God... oh God something's... happening...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie is overwhelmed with emotion -- we think she's about to cry but then she bursts out laughing --
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's beautiful. It's beautiful. I keep saying that but I can't... my mind can't... words... should've sent a poet. I'm a poet and don't know it...

	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Now Ellie is crying, sobbing uncontrollably.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Palmer, I wish I'd had a baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
The Dodec plunges into another inside-out sphere, this one larger and glowing blood red --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A) A GIANT RED STAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it engulfs an Earthlike planet. We watch the planet's oceans boil away; the surface chars, sears dead --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
B) SUPERNOVA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tidal waves of gas clouds rush away from the exploding sun -- shock waves tumble debris AT us. At the center of the cataclysm a rapidly rotating neutron star flashes like a lighthouse, ten times a second.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
C) LARGE BLUE GAS GIANT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Circling an emerald green star. On the night side of the planet are huge glowing jellyfish-like shapes, the floating cites of an alien civilization. Millions of glowing gold particles connect them in elaborate swirling patterns, a dance of golden glitter...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D) LAST WORMHOLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
choked with multicolored pinprick flares -- a sense of tremendous acceleration, finally erupting into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CENTER OF GALAXY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
So many dazzling multicolored stars they almost touch. Millions more stars than are visible from Earth on the clearest night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An immense, spiraling river of gas and dust, millions of miles long, pours into the maw of a black hole of staggering dimensions. Flashes of radiation leap from the center like summer lightning --
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The center of the galaxy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
The Dodec suddenly rotates. Swimming INTO OUR FIELD OF VIEW...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GALACTIC GRAND CENTER STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It fills half the sky. A vast vast artificial planet; immeasurably immense liquid clouds drift in its atmosphere, punctuated by planet-size holes, columns of mist thousands of mile high.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Dodec gently plunges into an atmosphere of blue night; below we can make out thousands of yellow-lit openings in the gel-like surface, each a different geometric shape.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Docking ports... those are docking ports for other machines... hi, everybody...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
As the Dodec continues to lower toward a hexagonal receptor the panels grow opaque, blocking out all light. Ellie fights to remain conscious as it grows dimmer and dimmer:
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now arriving Grand Central Station... floating down... floating...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(like a little girl)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twinkle twinkle... little star... how I wonder... ellemenopee...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... have to stay awake... stay awake...

<DIRECTION>
(slipping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please... please...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
She passes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN BLACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing. Still nothing. Finally, a gentle, familiar SOUND...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELLIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lies in a fetal position. After a long moment she opens her eyes. The familiar RHYTHMIC sound is LOUDER. Her eyes widen...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie sits up on a pristine white beach. Huge ranges of cumulus lit red/gold by the dawn silhouette clusters of palm trees; the sound of gently ROLLING SURF, SQUAWKING GULLS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie stands. The Dodec is nowhere to be seen. She looks around in disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a few halting steps, like a child learning to walk. She kneels, scoops up some sand. Frowns in confusion...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie digs her hand into the sea, almost loses her balance again. She tastes the water. Normal. Her confusion grows...
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... remember this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
She steps further into the water; letting its warmth soothe her, wipes the furrows from her brow. Closes her eyes as she lets the water take her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun is higher now. The SURF CRASHES.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Recording... check, check. Recording, is this on? I think this is on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie sits against a palm tree, looking out at the sea. She seems a little more cogent.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. I've traveled thirty thousand light years, give or take a few parsecs, to go to the beach. So... Either they've created this environment... or the illusion of this environment, to make me feel at home... or else somehow I am at home -- or else this is my cage at the intergalactic zoo and the tour bus will be along any minute...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
A distant figure becomes visible down the beach. As it approaches Ellie continues, unaware:
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or else, of course, I'm completely insane. This should not be discounted as a possibility -- although the fact that I'm questioning my sanity should be a pretty good indication that I am in fact sane... unless of course... unless...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie stops, as if sensing something. The figure grows closer, now clearly humanoid. Ellie turns to look --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and stares in utter disbelief. She rises to her feet...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

It's too much. Ellie throws herself into his arms, holds him tight.

She sobs. He holds her.

Ellie recovers a bit, wiping away her tears --

And in the blink of an eye they are no longer standing on a beach but on the rim of the Grand Canyon, looking out at a spectacular sunset.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>

Ellie tries hard to swallow her amazement as Ted begins to stroll along the rim; she walks with him.

<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ELLIE>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Many others.

<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.

</TED>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So who...?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Not all. Some choose to stay at home and dream their dreams.

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>

	There are no tests, Ellie. We don't sit in judgment. Think of us more as... librarians. Curators of the Universe's rarest and most valuable creation...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
And now they are walking through a familiar forest. Sunlight streams through the tall trees.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As many civilizations as we've found, compared to the vastness of space...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
He seems momentarily overcome with a terrible sadness... and then he recovers, smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... life is unspeakably rare. So whenever we do find another civilization, especially one that's... struggling... We send a message. Sometimes we can offer help. Sometimes we can't. But we always try. Life is simply too precious not to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you help us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ted hesitates. They are now standing in the middle of a vast alien desert, stretching to the horizon. The dome of the sky darkens revealing a view from outside the galaxy; the Milky Way hangs like a pinwheel in the blackness of intergalactic night.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to Ellie, puts a loving hand to her face. Softly:
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're so lost. So cut off... and so sad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
And suddenly Ellie is standing on the sun-dappled Cal Tech campus. She turns to find herself standing opposite David Drumlin.
</DIRECTION>
<DRUMLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it that makes you so lonely, Miss Arroway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRUMLIN>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie stares at him -- instinctively backs away, turning around --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- to find herself high atop the radio dish at Arecibo looking into Peter Valerian's face --
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be honest, El. The truth is you really don't want the company.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
Peter shakes his head -- then begins to melt, morph into Palmer Joss --
</DIRECTION>
<JOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does it feel like to understand everything in the universe except yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<JOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ellie, there is no reason you have to be alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie stares at him; he slowly morphs back into Ted as he and the space around them become infused with an unearthly golden light; his voice ECHOING and resonating into infinity --
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are alone. For millions of years we've searched the cosmos... and after all the suffering, after all the chaos and desolation of the void -- the one thing we've found that makes the emptiness bearable is each other. That's why I sent the message. That's why I made contact.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Ellie is back, standing with her father on a perfect beach in the glow of twilight. A gentle breeze blows. Ellis is overcome.

She turns back. Ted has vanished.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Peter... What is going on? Has everyone gone completely insane?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's one way of putting it. Kitz, the President, the I.S.C. have shut down all official communications; there've also been reports of riots flaring up across the U.S. and Europe. Until we figure out what went wrong things may get rough, especially for you --

Kitz turns off the monitor, turns to Ellie, still in her hospital gown and robe. Peter stands nearby, as do a group of frighteningly expressionless I.S.C. and Pentagon officials.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I don't understand it. All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.

</ELLIE>
<KITZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that your official response?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITZ>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have an official response, Michael. All I have are the same questions you have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kitz pauses... and then he turns to her, his intensity increasing as we PUSH IN ON him --
</DIRECTION>
<KITZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid that's not a satisfactory answer, Doctor. We spent two trillion dollars. You walked into that machine with the hopes and prayers of an entire planet with you, and you stepped out with nothing. Those people are going to want more than idle speculation and conjecture -- they're going to want answers -- and I hope for all our sakes you can come up with them.

Ellie, surrounded by a phalanx of security, moves quickly through the nightmarish mob scene. Disorienting TV lights glare, illuminating a flurry of drift snow --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Ellie is hustled toward a van she glimpses a figure -- an oasis of stillness in the mob, watching her -- Joss. Their eyes meet for the briefest of moments -- and then Ellie is swept into the van and away. Joss watches her go -- looks at the chaos, the madness around him -- then slowly looks up to the sky ...

A KNOCK on the door. Ellie looks up nervously --

	I don't have any proof, Palmer.

	Ellie, you're the proof. You tell them your story. Ultimately they'll have no choice but to believe you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not enough, don't you understand? I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point. It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<JOSS>

	Ellie, the only one holding you to that standard is you! The people want to hear your story, they need to hear it!

</ELLIE>
<JOSS>

<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(a deep breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Senator... I believe I traveled through a series of wormholes. Wormholes are a phenomenon deduced by Einstein; they're essentially tears in the fabric of space/time. Because of the effects of relativity what I experienced as a period of approximately eighteen hours passed almost instantaneously on Earth. To you I seemed to depart and arrive back at the same moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<KITZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doctor, isn't it true that wormholes are merely predictions of relativity theory? That there's no evidence they actually exist?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITZ>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie hesitates. Looks up at Joss in the gallery. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no direct evidence, no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<KITZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And current theory holds that to sustain the sort of wormholes you're talking about, even for a fraction of a second, would require more energy than our sun produces in a year, is that correct?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITZ>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.

</ELLIE>

<CHAIRMAN>

</CHAIRMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Joss leans forward in his chair.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it possible...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<CHAIRMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All the elements are there. A woman, orphaned young, under a great deal of stress. The failure of a project she's staked her self-worth and very sense of identity on -- induces a fantasy of reuniting with her 'father in heaven' as it were. Is it possible?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAIRMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie is silent.
</DIRECTION>
<KITZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please answer the question, Doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>

<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(a long silence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it possible. Yes. But --

</ELLIE>
<CHAIRMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(peering at her; intrigued)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't believe it to be... tell me something, Doctor. Why do you think they would go to all this trouble... bring you tens of thousands of light years, and then send you home without a shred of proof? Sort of bad form, wouldn't you say? What was their intent?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAIRMAN>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(hesitates)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.

</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd murmurs. Committee members exchange glances.
</DIRECTION>
<CHAIRMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(sigh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Arroway, you come before us with no evidence. No records, no artifacts -- only a story that -- to put I mildly -- strains credibility. Over two trillion dollars was spent, hundreds of lives were lost, many more may be in jeopardy due to the almost incalculable worldwide psychological impact... Are you going to sit there and tell us that we should simply take this all on faith?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAIRMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The word rings out like a shot. Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<KITZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Answer the question, Doctor. As a scientist -- can you prove any of this?

Closes her eyes. Finally, almost inaudibly:
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
The room is silent. Almost gently:
</DIRECTION>
<KITZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So why don't you admit what by your own standards must be the truth: that this experience simply didn't happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITZ>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(pauses, then, simply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd reacts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie looks up to the gallery... and finds Joss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she speaks with great emotion and restraint, she seems to be talking directly to him.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had... an experience. I can't prove it. I can't even explain it. All I can tell you is that everything I know as a human being, everything I am -- tells me that it was real.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
The room grows quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was given something wonderful. Something that changed me. A vision of the universe that made it overwhelmingly clear just how tiny and insignificant -- and at the same time how rare and precious we all are. A vision... that tells us we belong to something greater than ourselves... that we're not -- that none of us -- is alone.

</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
JOSS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moved beyond words.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELLIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looks lovingly at Palmer... then shifts her gaze to Michael Kitz. Softly:
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish I could share it. I wish everyone, if only for a moment -- could feel that sense of awe, and humility... and hope. That continues to be my wish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
The emotion in her voice compels the room to silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kitz.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spilling out; reporters closing in. As Kitz emerges he sees Ellie -- she meets his gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment... and then he nods, walks briskly off. Ellie turns -- to find Joss standing by the door, waiting for her. A timeless moment...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and then she silently crosses to him and lets him fold her into his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAPITOL BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rain lashes down unabated. A sea of press crushing in on Ellie and Joss as they grimly make their way through, police clearing the way -- A ZEALOT intones in the b.g. --
</DIRECTION>
<ZEALOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'... He dreamed, and behold, a ladder was set up on the Earth, and the top of it reached to heaven... Surely the Lord is in this place, and I knew it not. This is none other but the House of God.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZEALOT>
<DIRECTION>
As Ellie moves through the crowd PEOPLE in wheelchairs fight to approach, people with terrible deformities -- they call to her:
</DIRECTION>
<PEOPLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ellie... Bless me, Ellie... Heal me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PEOPLE>
<DIRECTION>
Ellie, torn between wanting to help these suffering souls and not wanting to lie, whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
And then the reporters descend, shouting out questions -- one in particular rings out --
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reverend Joss, do you think the failure of the machine is God's rebuke to science?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
Joss stops. He turns to the crowd; slowly:
</DIRECTION>
<JOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As a person of faith... I am bound by a different covenant than Dr. Arroway -- but I believe our goal is one and the same: the pursuit of the truth. I think today Dr. Arroway continued that pursuit under the most trying of conditions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his arm around Ellie and hurries away. The crowds, the media watch as the Messiah who failed disappears into the rainy night.

SERIES OF SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A) HOKKAIDO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entombment of the machine has begun. Scaffolding on all sides, swarming with workers in quarantine suits. Helicopters fly overhead, dumping load after load of concrete.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
B) VLA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
boarded up, deserted. Weeds springing up around the now-rusting cyclone fence; the desert moving in to reclaim what it had briefly lost. The radio dishes waiting, silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
C) SMALL COUNTRY CEMETERY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a familiar fishpond in the b.g. Ellie, holding a small bunch of wildflowers, kneels to gently place them on her father's grave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LAKE TIMOTHY (OREGON) - DUSK (DECEMBER 31, 2001)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The small figures of Ellie and Joss walk along the beautiful lake under the forested slopes of Mt. Hood.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer: Why would they send me back without proof?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<JOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe what you experienced can't be reduced to images on a videotape. Maybe they still plan to grant your request, only in their own way, in their own time... Or maybe it's just like you said: ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<JOSS>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In other words.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<DIRECTION>
They stop, look out at the water.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one. It was still searching for meaning...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<JOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does that mean you think it doesn't exist?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it simply exists in the search for it. Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<JOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Meaning...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSS>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something my dad -- they -- said. 'After all the suffering, after all the desolation of the void -- the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other.'
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking up at Joss)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The one thing that makes it bearable is love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
She takes his hand... and then they look up at the sky, where the first stars are coming out.

<BBC_REPORTER>

<REPORTER_3>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and on this last night of the old millennium and the eve of the new one, looking back on a past racked by violence and chaos, we of the human race look ahead to an uncertain future -- a future which, at least for now, seems to promise only more of the same...

EXT. HOKKAIDO MACHINE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The machine stands entombed; silent, inscrutable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All is still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, the first sign: small insects crawl from cracks in the pavement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A stirring. A slight breeze. A subtle HUMMING sound --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A monk stirs in his bed in the nearby monastery; if not awakened by the strange vibration then by the SHRIEKING MONKEYS outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A vibration. Something is happening at the core of the concrete edifice -- it begins to crack --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From inside comes a sound, a terrible, otherworldly ROAR --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The next transformation has begun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM TWO MILES OUT AT SEA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The island of Hokkaido is shrouded by an ominous microclimate... a vortex out of which radiates an awful vibration like the shockwave of a bomb. A Japanese fisherman smoking a cigarette on his shrimpboat looks up in awe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MACHINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is lifting, spinning -- dissolving into itself -- leaving only the vortex of a prodigious wormhole --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWNTOWN TOKYO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A thousand neon signs go dark. New Years revelers look up in fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAN DIEGO ZOO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and the keepers have never known the animals to be so disturbed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIRGINIA SUBURB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Peter Valerian steps out of his front door and stares up at the sky. His wife joins him; he silently puts his arm around her --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WASHINGTON OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael Kitz turns to look out the window at the D.C. skyline -- fear on his face as he looks down at a picture of his family, wife and two kids --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BALKANS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guerrillas look up at the terrifying sky as the GUNFIRE DIES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SERENGETI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stampeding wildebeest wheel around seemingly to form a vast circle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOMEWHERE IN PACIFIC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Great swirling pod of dolphin swim in a frenzied circle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDIA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A circle of dung beetles in the dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EARTH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
from Hadden's darkened viewport. The land obscured by a rapidly growing cloud that fills the ecosphere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELLIE AND JOSS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stand outside a lakeside cabin, transfixed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wind picks up. Grows stronger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A deep RUMBLING sound, felt more than heard: a sound too vast to be any sound at all. The wind grows stronger. The LIGHTNING CRACKLES, flushing birds from trees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then everything becomes perfectly still -- the RUMBLING STOPS --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- a deafening silence -- then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUNDLESS CONCUSSION OF VIOLET LIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
high over Times Square -- Kitz's office -- a solitary farmhouse under the Nebraska sky -- downtown Tokyo -- a lonely freighter in the middle of the Pacific -- EVERYWHERE --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EARTH ORBIT - 250 MILES UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking toward the Earth past the deserted Mir Station -- the brilliant violet flash --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EGYPT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Valley of the Kings. The faces of the long dead Pharaohs bathed in the violet light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAHARA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Children stare up in wonder at the same light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIME SQUARE/PICCADILLY CIRCUS

People stand frozen in awe.

<DIRECTION>
WASHINGTON D.C.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the Lincoln Memorial the great man looks down as the homeless crawl out from their cardboard shelters, bathed in the brilliant light...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELLIE AND JOSS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stare up at the sky at an impossible view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is the view from the center of the galaxy. THROUGH the mouth of the enormous wormhole, we can see the machine returning to Grand Central Station as a dazzling Aurora Borealis fills the sky --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS SHOTS - ALL OVER THE WORLD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All over the world faces of every race and ethnicity stare up at a billion blazing multicolored suns lighting up the heavens, brighter than the brightest day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The citizens of the Earth look up and wonder as the CHIMES of MIDNIGHT RING OUT all over the world --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELLIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes filled with tears of wonder and joy, smiles. She's found what she's been searching for.
