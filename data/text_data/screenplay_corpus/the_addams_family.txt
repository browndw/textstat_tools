EXT. ADDAMS MANSION FRONT STEPS - CHRISTMAS EVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GROUP OF CAROLERS, their eager faces upturned, SINGS an endless and cloying roundelay of "Little Drummer Boy." They sing with self-righteous good cheer. As they pompously begin their umpteenth verse, THE CAMERA SLOWLY PANS UP THE ADDAMS MANSION -- past the black wreath on the front door, past broken windows, weather-beaten shingles, a creaking shutter.

THE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN TO THE ROOF

C.U. AN OVER-SIZED "CUCKOO" CLOCK --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The clock is a perfect REPLICA OF THE ADDAMS FAMILY HOUSE, down to the creaking shutter. It chimes the hour. In ONE WINDOW, a LITTLE MECHANICAL GOMEZ bends a MECHANICAL MORTICIA back until she's almost off her feet and plants a kiss between her clockwork decolletage. One, two, three mechanical kisses, counting toward seven o'clock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN ANOTHER WINDOW, A MECHANICAL PUGSLEY hangs a MECHANICAL WEDNESDAY from a noose on a gallows, up and down. Meanwhile, little BURSTS OF FOG float off the rooftop where a little MECHANICAL GRANNY cranks her fog machine. The front door of the house pops open, and a MECHANICAL LURCH appears and begins sweeping. Just then, THING, the disembodied hand with the full-bodied personality, CLIMBS into view over the back of the clock. Thing leaps to the floor and SCAMPERS down the hall.

INT. FESTER'S ROOM

Gomez wears a fez and a smoking jacket over his pajamas. Even at this early hour, he puffs on his trademark cigar. Gomez is all enthusiasm or all despair. At the moment, he radiates unfathomable woe.

	Think of it, Thing. He's been gone for twenty-five years. For twenty- five years we've attempted to contact Fester in the great beyond...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The room is a dusty, cobweb-filled, long-unoccupied shrine to Gomez's lost brother, Fester. Gomez drifts in from the doorway. The room has remained untouched since Fester's disappearance as a teenager. The thick coating of dust and cobwebs adorns the mementoes of a rapscallion's youth - a football pennant from Alcatraz, headless sports trophies, a high school photo with all the other students keeping as much distance from Fester as possible. As he lovingly and morosely surveys the room:

	Look at her -- I would die for her. I would kill for her. Either way -- what bliss.

<DIRECTION>
Low-voiced, incisive, and subtle, with Morticia, smiles are rare. The ghostly whiteness of her complexion is offset by the red of the pillowcase upon which her hair is spread like a diabolic halo. A dark Garbo, sultry and remote, she's a ruined beauty. Morticia OPENS HER EYES.

This tubby energetic monster of a nine-year-old boy has every chance of growing up to be the public monster his parents would be proud of. He MIXES chemicals in a beaker. The brew steams. Grin- ning wickedly, Pugsley SWALLOWS it down. He contorts, undergoing the beginnings of a transforma- tion, then SHRINKS to the size of a mouse. Laughing, he crawls out of his human-size pajamas.

Though Tully comes here often and Margaret has been here before, they never cease to be startled by "Gate." Tully has a puffy, once handsome face, and an embittered grey aura that is the mark of a middle-age misspent. High-strung and superficial, Margaret is more disap- pointed in Tully than he is in himself. Margaret passes through Gate first.

In a panic, she tries to slam the door on Lurch, but, like the salesman's manual undoubtedly advised, he STICKS his foot in the way. The door partially RIPS off its hinges.

<FESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morticia, please...

Without even looking, Gomez parries Tully's blow from behind. Then he whirls on Tully.

<GOMEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One for you, Tully, and...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Gomez ATTACKS - HIS BLADE FLASHING LIKE LIGHTNING. In a blur of action, Tully's sword is knocked from his hand and he's sent tumbling backwards, finally landing on his knees.

Tully looks up at Gomez with cowardly, pleading eyes.

Gomez turns to see...

<DIRECTION>
ABIGAIL -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who now has a pistol aimed at Morticia. One shot and Morticia will die horribly. Gomez throws aside his sword. Tully scrambles to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<ABIGAIL>
<DIRECTION>
(to Gomez)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right! Now get moving - Addams, take him to the vault. And if you're not back in one hour...

Gomez is near enough now to take Morticia's hand, on the torture wheel.

Gomez reaches for the book that will open the secret panel:
</DIRECTION>
<ABIGAIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can it, Gordon! Stop dragging your feet! You disgust me - you're nothing but a useless, snivelling baby! A stone around my neck! What was I thinking - I should've left you where I found you!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
At Abigail's final words, Fester suddenly LEAPS FORWARD.
</DIRECTION>
<FESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No tricks, Gomez! That's the wrong book!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP
</DIRECTION>

Gomez's hand is on the right book, "Greed," but Fester stops him from pulling it.
</DIRECTION>
<FESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Allow me...

Gomez looks into Fester's eyes -- realizing what he's about to do.

<GOMEZ>
<DIRECTION>
(murmuring)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good show, old man...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Fester reaches for a DIFFERENT BOOK -- "Hurricane Irene: Nightmare from Above." Seeing the title of the book, Tully suddenly panics:

	Put that book down, Gordon! You don't know what it can do! It's not just literture!

He helps her down from the wheel.

ANGLE on Fester, facing off with Abigail, as Tully cowers.

<ABIGAIL>

	Keep the book closed, Gordon - listen to mother!

<FESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll never listen to you - not ever again!

ANGLE on Gomez and Morticia, nearing the bookcase.

<FESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a terrible mother! There, I said it!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Fester opens the book, and blasts Tully out of the window. Then he blasts Abigail out as well. ANGLE ON GOMEZ, who has now pulled the right book, "Greed", to open the bookshelf. Amid the storm, he is leading Morticia behind the bookshelf. He tries to hold the bookshelf open for Fester to follow, fighting the gale force winds.

<GOMEZ>

(calling out to Fester)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Old man! This way!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THING, across the room, struggling across the floor toward the bookshelf. Thing fights the wind, which pelts him with papers and other flying debris. Gomez can no longer fight the storm, and the bookshelf slams shut. Fester desperately tries to close the book to quell the storm, but a HUGE BOLT OF LIGHTNING ZAPS HIM. He falls to the floor, with electricity coursing through him.

EXT. ADDAMS MANSION, NEXT OCTOBER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of little CHILDREN approach the front door. There is a hand-lettered sign on the door reading "HALLOWEEN OPEN HOUSE." The children are dressed in traditional Halloween costumes - there's a witch, a ghost, a skeleton, etc., and they all carry trick-or-treat bags. They giggle and chatter. One of the children is pushed forward, and he KNOCKS on the front door. As the door opens, the children CHANT:
</DIRECTION>
<CHILDREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trick or...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They freeze in mid-chant. We do not see who has opened the door, but the children do. After a beat, they SCREAM IN HORROR and run, terrified, back toward the street.

INT. FRONT HALL - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lurch is closing the front door, looking puzzled. The family is busily decorating the house for their annual Halloween festivities. All the decorations are elegant yet ancient, dusty and faded. The crystal gloves in the chandeliers have been replaced by miniature jack o- lanterns. Skeletons, each wearing a top hat, hang from the sconces by the nooses around their necks. There are clusters of black and orange balloons, covered with cobwebs. Uncle Fester and Thing are draping the banisters and stairway railings with a garland made from crepe paper, dead branches and spanish moss. Skulls, each holding a candle, are scattered about, on the stairs and the furniture. A stuffed, life-size scarecrow leans against the stairway, with a pitchfork through its throat. A banner on the wall reads "HAPPY HALLOWEEN", and the letters drip with blood. Gomez hangs upside down from the balcony. Morticia hands him a decoration. Granny appears from the kitchen, carrying a tray of food.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's their loss. I even made finger sandwiches.

Wednesday and Pugsley come down the stairs. Wednesday is dressed in her usual style, but Pugsley is dressed as a tiny version of UNCLE FESTER, COMPLETE WITH BALD HEAD AND GREATCOAT. The adults are delighted. Gomez flips down onto his feet.

	Oh yes - in the den.

Everyone starts to move toward the den. There is a KNOCK on the door. Everyone turns. Lurch opens the door. Standing outside are Margaret and Cousin It. Margaret is dressed as a fairy princess, complete with wand. Cousin It wears a cowboy hat, a bandanna and a holster. Margaret is radiant, obviously very much in love.

Fester pops a light bulb into his mouth. It lights. Pugsley giggles. Gomez stands up, having finished the pumpkin. He places it on a table, and lights the candle inside. The pumpkin glows. It has ONE EYE IN THE MIDDLE OF ITS FOREHEAD. Everyone oohs and ahhs.
