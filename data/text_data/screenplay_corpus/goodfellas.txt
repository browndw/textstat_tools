A smoky, overdecorated cocktail lounge and nightclub on Queens Boulevard. Sergio Franchi is in full voice on the jukebox. It is after midnight. It has bean a long night.. Balloons and empty glasses litter the place. BILLY BAITS, a 50-year-old hood in an out-of-date suit, court at the bar. WE SEE a younger, more sharply-dressed HOOD walk in with a BEEHIVE GIRLFRIEND and hug BAITS.

WE SEE FOUR OTHER MEN, including HENRY HILL and JIMMY BURKE, standing near BILLY BAITS at the bar, raise their glasses in salute. TOMMY DESIMONE and ANOTHER BEEHIVE BLONDE enter. BILLY BAITS looks up and sees TOMMY.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son of a bitch. Get over here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
TOMMY walks over and BILLY, too aggressively, grabs TOMMY around the neck. TOMMY doesn't like it.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(forcing a laugh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Billy. Watch the suit.

<BILLY>

(squeezing Tommy's

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to him. "Watch the suit," he says. A little pisser I've known all my life. Hey, Tommy, don't go get too big.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't go busting my balls. Okay?

	If I was busting your balls, I'd send you home for your shine box.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILLY>
<DIRECTION>
TOMMY'S smile turns to a glare as he realizes BILLY is making fun of him. The Men at the bar are roaring with laughter. His GIRL is looking glumly at her shoes.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>

	You remember Tommy's shines? The kid was great. He made mirrors.

	Come ooonnn. Tommeeee. We're only kidding. You can't take a joke? Come ooonn.
	</DIALOGUE>

WE SEE that TOMMY is still angry, but begins to relax with BILLY'S apparent apology, but as soon as BILLY sees that TOMMY is beginning to relax, he contemptuously turns his back on TOMMY.

Finally on their way, HENRY is driving. JIMMY, in the passenger's seat, and TOMMY, in the rear seat, embracing the shovel, are dozing off. The sleepy humming of the wheels is suddenly interrupted by a thumping sound. At first, HENRY thinks he has a flat, but the thumping is too irregular. JIMMY awakens. His eyes are on HENRY. TOMMY leans forward from the rear seat. Silence. Thump Silence.

Soon the mattress cover stops squirming and TOMMY stops swinging the shovel. He is exhausted. TOMMY and JIMMY get back in the car. HENRY is facing the open trunk.

	<DIALOGUE>
	They weren't like anyone else. They did whatever they wanted. They'd double-park in front of the hydrant and nobody ever gave them a ticket. In the summer when they played cards all night, nobody ever called the cops.

But after a while, he was mostly pissed that I hung around the cabstand. He said they were bums and that I was a bum. He said I was going to get into trouble. I used to say I was only running errands after school, but he knew better. He knew what went on at the cabstand and, every once in a while, usually after he got his load on, I had to take a beating. But by then, I didn't care. No matter how many beatings I took, I wouldn't listen to what he said. I don't think I even heard him. The way I saw it, everybody has to take a beating some time.

	It was like he had two families. The first time I was introduced to them all at once, it was crazy. Paulie and his brothers had lots of sons and nephews and almost all of them were named Peter or Paul. It was unbelievable. There must have been two dozen Peters and Pauls at the wedding. Plus, they were all married to girls named Marie, and they named all their daughters Marie. By the time I finished meeting everybody. I thought I was drunk.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Jimmy was cutting every link between himself and the robbery, but it had nothing to do with me. I gave Jimmy the tip and he gave me some Christmas money. From then on I kept my mouth shut. I knew Jimmy. He had the cash. It was his. I know he kicked some money upstairs to Paulie, but that was it. It made him sick to have to turn money over to the guys who stole it. He'd rather whack them. Anyway, what did I care? I wasn't. asking for anything and, besides. Jimmy was making nice money with me through my Pittsburgh connections. But still, for months after the robbery, they were finding bodies all over.
