BETH WALKER is driving. She looks younger, but she's twenty- eight. She has a strong face and flashing intelligent eyes. She's wearing a WAITRESS UNIFORM from Friendly's. She's deep in thought.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
INT. CAROL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's neat and smartly furnished -- discount Swedish modern, framed deco posters, some nice plants. The only problem is it seems a little more like a well-designed waiting room than a home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's an empty ice bucket, several empty liquor bottles, and a swinging metal ball thingabobby on a chrome and glass coffee table in front of leather sofa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAROL AND NICK are curled up together on the sofa, drinks in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're both in their late twenties. Carol's dressed in the casually stylish clothes worn by women who work in shopping mall boutiques.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick's clothes are frumpled, a knit tie loose around his neck. They've achieved a state of contemplative drunkenness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carol sips her drink. Nick sips his drink. Carol sips her drink. Nick brings his glass to his lips, hesitates...

Nick opens a cabinet under the sink and tosses the empty bottle in the trash. He begins to pace. Carol shuts the cabinet and follows him with her gaze.

As Nick speaks, he gestures grandly with his drink, liquor splashing unnoticed over the sides.

Sid's pick-up truck is facing her across the intersection. It slowly pulls up beside her and stops.

Without knowing why, she smiles and waves back.

	Too much money. The show. The meal. The slots. Then the hotel -- that's another hundred down the toilet.

As Carol speaks she pokes at Nick. He fends off her blows. By the end of her speech she is on top of him mock-strangling him.

<CAROL>

(jabbing Nick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you skip the hotel. It's night, the highway's empty -- you can make good time. You start speeding. You get stopped in Utah by the cops -- you flunk the breathalizer, they haul you in. The judge is Mormon -- you get fifteen years, you go to prison, but at least your life has taken a direction!

Beth kisses Nick, his mouth still full of donut.

EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
About hundred cars dot the vast parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick swings into a parking spot and gets out of the car. He tosses his jacket on the roof and crouches, tieing his necktie using the car's outside mirror.

NICK'S POV - IN THE MIRROR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHIP, a big redheaded guy in his late thirties, wearing a jacket and tie, is grinning at the crouched Nick. Nick's reflection grins back.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just waiting for the last second to put on the noose.

NICK AND CHIP

Nick straightens up and grabs his jacket. They start walking toward the mall.

CLOSE-UP - NEWSPAPER

Beth's hand comes INTO FRAME and crumples the page.

INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beth stuffs the paper in a glass and wraps the glass in another piece. She's sitting on the floor, surrounded by dishes, newspaper, and cardboard liquor boxes. She adds the wrapped glass to a box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hears the SOUND of a CAR DOOR SLAMMING, looks up, then returns to her packing. She reaches behind herself into the trash, pulls out the blender, and begins to wrap it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the SOUND of the FRONT DOOR opening, followed by a curious METALLIC CLUNKING, she stands and hurries through the swinging door to the living room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The living room is sparsely furnished -- a sofa, a coffee table, a bookcase cluttered with a handful of paperbooks, a couple of boardgames, a dying cactus, etc. A crappy old fifteen inch t.v. on a t.v. tray. WE SEE this for a moment before...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A paint-splattered cloth is unfurled FILLING THE SCREEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It gently floats down, revealing a PAINTER and his shopping cart overloaded with supplies. He's dressed in paint- splattered clothes. A paint-splattered Red Sox cap is pulled low over his eyes, obscuring his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beth stares in disbelief. Without seeing her, the painter backs up, his attention focused on spreading the dropcloth.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>

</BETH>
<SID>

	Painting.

The painter looks up from the drop-cloth, ready to deal with this obstacle. He freezes. His face lights up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Sid.
</DIRECTION>
<SID>
<DIRECTION>
(extremely pleased)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, good morning...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sid. Nice to see you again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<DIRECTION>
Beth stares in agitated disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With his untaken extended hand, he pulls a long strip of masking tape from a roll around his wrist, masking one side of the door frame from top to bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Realty office likes a fresh coat between tenants.

<BETH>

(pointedly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're still here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
He stands on his tiptoes and puts a strip of masking tape on the top edge of the doorframe.
</DIRECTION>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've done this house before.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(admiringly)
</DIRECTION>

	I did a nice job.

He masks the remaining side of the door frame.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>

	Can't you come back tomorrow?

</BETH>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Billings, Montana.

</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
Sid moves to a window.
</DIRECTION>
<SID>
<DIRECTION>
(incredulous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It can't be worse than Enfield, Arizona.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
Sid pulls a strip of tape off the roll.
</DIRECTION>
<SID>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've lived in Enfield my whole life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<DIRECTION>
He holds out the end of the masking tape.
</DIRECTION>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you hold this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<DIRECTION>
Beth takes it. He walks backwards, easing a long strip of tape off the roll.
</DIRECTION>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I use this to mask. Have you ever used masking tape to mask?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<DIRECTION>
He tears the tape off the roll and sticks it to the top of the baseboard in one corner.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I haven't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
Crouched, he waddles across the room toward Beth, applying the masking tape to the baseboard. He gets to Beth, stands up, takes the tape off her fingers, and presses it into place.
</DIRECTION>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A house like this, it's real easy. Hardly needs a paint job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can skip it. I won't tell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It needs a fresh coat...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<DIRECTION>
He hands her the end of the tape again and begins another baseboard.
</DIRECTION>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...a little color.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<BETH>
<DIRECTION>
(naturally curious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What color is it gonna be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Off-white.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<DIRECTION>
He goes along the floor pressing the masking tape to the baseboard.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's already off-white.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It's white. It's just dirty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<DIRECTION>
Beth looks at the walls. He's right.
</DIRECTION>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now if it was my house, I would choose a color...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<DIRECTION>
Beth kneels down, holding the tape, as he arrives at her end of the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would not choose off-white.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<DIRECTION>
Beth holds out the tape. They are kneeling next to each other.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would you choose?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The color of your eyes.

A MAP

</NICK>

Carol circles Billings. Nick's finger starts to trace the route.

Carol's pen follows, marking the route. Halfway to Billings, Nick's finger abruptly stops. Carol stops the pen at the same point.

Beth, enters, hesitates, and then -- consciously ignoring him -- walks by with a packed box and adds it to the stack by the front door.

<NICK>

Carol stops. On her face, the answer to his question is clear -- she was stuck on Nick then and she's still stuck on him now.

But she'd never let him know that.

He takes a pint of scotch from the front seat, uncaps it, takes a slug, takes another slug, recaps it, and drops it back on the seat.

He stares at the road. He looks down to the front seat and finds the map. He splits his attention between the road and unfolding the map. The wind catches the map.

The map billows up, covering his face. Losing control of the car, Nick slaps it down.

It stops facing a battered phone booth -- the engine turns off but the headlines stay shining on the phone booth.

	Well, I'll tell you my number, but there's a problem. My phone's been disconnected, not because of bills, I mean we paid all our bills. We were hardly ever even late.

	Yes it can, it can be done. Someone there can hook the phone back up.

Sid is framed in the doorway of her old home, waiting, trusting that she can't leave, that they are destined.

BETH

Her eyes well with tears. Her face sets with resolve.

THE HOUSE AND DRIVEWAY

The car pulls out and disappears down the road. Sid stands in the doorway for a long moment. He steps back into the house and shuts the door.

REARVIEW MIRROR

<DIRECTION>
Nick's face stares back at him. It's not a pretty sight.

NICK

Nick reaches into the back seat, fishes and comes up with his necktie. He slips the still-knotted necktie over his headdress and tightens it around his neck.
</DIRECTION>

Nick looks back to the road and suddenly swerves off an exit ramp. The CAMERA LINGERS on the Exit Sign -- "Enfield AZ.".

Then Nick, remembering the headdress, rips it off his head and furiously tears it apart -- scattering a flurry of plastic feathers. He hurls what's left of it across the room.

	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA FOLLOWING he races up to Carol's front door and leans on the doorbell -- a loud tight buzzing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pounds on the door, then stops, gasping for breath. No one's home. He turns, leaning against the door for support, staring out at tract house neighborhood.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm too late...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he bolts for his car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick yanks his car door open and disappears into it. In a second he emerges with the bottle of scotch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's empty. He eyes it for a moment then hurls it as far as he can down the street -- it shatters explosively.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He races to his front door and stops dead in his tracks at the open doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NICK'S LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sid has covered the floor and remaining furniture with drop cloths and is applying even strokes to the ceiling with a long handled roller.

Nick steps in and stares at Sid and his own nearly empty drop-cloth covered home.

<NICK>

Sid peels out, driving up onto the lawn past Nick and Carol's cars, out onto the street and out of sight.

A MAN and a WOMAN, both slightly portly Mexican-Americans in their late forties, wearing their Sunday best, step over the threshold and kiss.

</DIRECTION>
<NICK>

</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
He waits, half expecting this statement to be challenged. It isn't.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>

(confidently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The people who left here -- our old neighbors -- left us that t.v.

</DIRECTION>
<CAROL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROL>
<DIRECTION>
Nick looks to make eye contact with Carol. He can't. She's looking back over her shoulder for obstacles. He smiles and glances toward the couple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick and Carol go out the door, lugging the t.v.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>

They're lugging the t.v. across to Carol's -- Carol backing up and Nick going forward. They arrive at the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick takes most of the weight of the t.v., while Carol fumbles with her key into her front door lock with her free hand.

Nick slumps down onto the sofa. Carol watches him, puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>

	He was very tall. He was too tall to be my father. He was wearing a long overcoat, and I thought, "it's a trick, he's on my mother's shoulders".

He smiles at the memory.
