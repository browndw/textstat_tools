INT. COURTROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUDGE GOINES turns to the Jury FOREMAN.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE_GOINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister Foreman, have you arrived at a verdict?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE_GOINES>
<FOREMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have, your honor. We find the defendant guilty of all the charges.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOREMAN>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES BEGIN OVER THE SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE DEFENDANT, BERNIE LAPLANTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Forty, rumpled, cheap suit, cheap haircut. He reacts, turning to the jury, indignant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His attorney, DONNA O'DAY, rises. She's twenty-four, looks younger.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your honor, may I approach the bench?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<DIRECTION>
As BERNIE fumes, the JUDGE, DONNA and the youthful clean-cut PROSECUTOR engage in an earnest, inaudible discussion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frustrated, Bernie is watching them when he notices something that distracts him from his anguish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donna's wallet is lying in her open attache case. The open top of the case screens the wallet from the view of the JURY, THE JUDGE, COURT REPORTERS, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernie looks around, checking the spectators section.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No spectators.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLE CONTINUE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bernie gets the wallet to his lap. In between cautious glances toward the bench where the conference continues inaudibly, he surreptitiously selects some of the twenties and some of the tens from the wallet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE BENCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The conference breaks up, DONNA heads back toward the defense table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wallet still concealed in his lap under the table, BERNIE is indignant.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going on? "Guilty"! What is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got your bail continued.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bail, for Chrissake! I'm innocent!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
The JUDGE gavels for order as BERNIE slips DONNA's "lightened" wallet back into her attache case unseen.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE_GOINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister LaPlante, I have been persuaded in view of your continued employment and your lack of prior convictions, to continue your bail under the same conditions heretofore, pending sentencing six days from now. In the meantime you will make an appointment with the probation officer who will make a recommendation to me regarding your sentence. I urge you to use these six days to set your personal affairs in order in anticipation of incarceration.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE_GOINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	THE TITLES CONCLUDE
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR/HALL OF JUSTICE - MINUTES LATER (DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE and DONNA are hurrying along the crowded corridor outside the courtroom.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Anticipation of incarceration"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DONNA>
<DIRECTION>
(upset)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what he means. I'm not a prison kinda guy, Miss O'Day. I'm a goddamn working man for Chrissake! Maybe I "augment" my income a little with some "business deals," maybe summa the guys I sell to are crooks, how would I know, I'm not an investigator. You can't make it on a wage no more, not in this country.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He gives a good report and I walk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can hope.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(consulting her notes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You still have your job, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I been calling in sick. They think I got the flu.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And a son by your ex-wife? Joseph.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A son, yeah. What about him? Joey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Involved! Christ! She attached my goddamn paycheck! Child support. Why do you think I can't afford a lawyer?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then...)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I mean. Why I got a court appointed lawyer instead of a, uh, more experienced...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand. How often do you see your son?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Often, uh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How recently?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, his birthday, uh, May. I think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's November.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat... beat... beat...)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She don't like me to see him. Says I'm a bad influence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job. You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<DIRECTION>
They have reached the front door. BERNIE nods, about to exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNA>
<DIRECTION>
(with difficulty)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some of it. Right here. I got some of it. I'll get the rest as soon as I can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE pulls out the crumpled bills he took from Donna's wallet and hands them to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNA>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised and touched)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know things are difficult for you, Mister LaPlante. I don't want to take your last dime...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE is already reaching for a twenty.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. I better keep some if I'm gonna see the kid. For gas and stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Then, unable to resist the chance, he snatches another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LION CAGES/ZOO - ANOTHER DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LION lies glumly in his cage, staring balefully through the bars at BERNIE who stares balefully back, contemplating the iron bars. At BERNIE'S side is a ten year old boy, JOEY, whose neat, scrubbed appearance is in sharp contrast to BERNIE'S rumpled, slightly soiled look.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow! Look at that one!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY is indicating the next cage where a BLACK PANTHER is pacing restlessly to and fro.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you were in there, he'd kill you, wouldn't he...Dad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
As Bernie looks at the PANTHER, the muscular beast looks right into BERNIE'S eyes with the furious yellow stare as if to say "I'm waiting."
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, yeah, something like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FLUKY'S RESTAURANT - AN HOUR LATER (DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE and JOEY facing each other in a booth, eating burgers.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This guy, this "friend" your mother's seeing, he's a fireman, huh? He ever... spend the night, whatsisname?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes. His name's Elliot. He saved a guy's life one time. In a fire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah? A hero, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat, then...)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was he in the 'Nam, this guy Elliot?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"The Nomm"? What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was this war. Viet Nam. Doesn't matter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were you in it? In the war?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never saw that picture, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What picture?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me in my uniform. Used to be on the bookcase.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MEN'S ROOM/FLUKY'S - TEN MINUTES LATER (DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deserted except for BERNIE and JOEY side by side at the urinals. BERNIE glances at JOEY.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatcha gotta do there, buddy, is ya gotta get in close so ya don't piss on yer shoes. It don't matter now cause you're wearin' them sneakers but the time's gonna come when you're gonna be wearin' good shoes, expensive ones, and you don't wanna piss on them, you wanna protect 'em. From piss, from tough guys, from everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
-- ALTERNATE VERSION --
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I don't like about public restrooms is how you're always standing in piss. It don't matter to you, you got those sneakers but I'm standing in piss in very expensive shoes. It's a breakdown in custodial services.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY steals a glance at BERNIE, sees him "shake it off" and zip up. JOEY does likewise.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you gonna take me somewhere next weekend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm working on that. It's just I got some business problems and... whatsa matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY is heading for one of the stalls. He reaches underneath and pulls out a wallet.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somebody lost a wallet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE is extremely interested, takes the wallet JOEY holds out and glances inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cash. A couple of fifties.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FLUKY'S - SECONDS LATER (DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE and JOEY exit the Men's Room and head for the door to the parking lot, BERNIE explaining...
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You give it to the manager, he pockets the dough, throws the wallet away. Most people who work in supervisory positions... I'm not saying all... are crooks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY casts a hasty glance at TEENAGER who's wearing the Manager Badge. The youth could not look more innocent if he wore a halo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BAG LADY pushing two shopping carts through the parking lot spots BERNIE and JOEY crossing her path...
</DIRECTION>
<BAG_LAOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, sir, could you spare...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAG_LAOY>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way, lady, not a chance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE hurries past her, notices JOEY looking back at the miserable woman.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gotta resist the urge to be nice to those people, they're con artists, they take advantage of the soft heart. A lot of 'em are financially better off than the rest of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Arriving at an ancient, battered Toyota, BERNIE searches for his keys and then fusses with the lock.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I'm gonna do on this wallet thing is, Monday, day after tomorrow, I'm gonna have my secretary phone this guy up from the name on his driver's license Let the guy come and get his wallet and make sure you get a reward. You deserve a reward. You want one, doncha? A reward? Gwan, get in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOYOTA/MOVING/FREEWAY - TWENTY MINUTES LATER (DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE is at the wheel, the car is gasping, struggling.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatcha gotta do, you gotta look out for number one. It sounds harsh, but it's a goddamn
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(excuse the vulgarity)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	jungle out there, kid. That's why you gotta keep a low profile! Right? A low profile! It's where you don't give nobody nothin' to shoot at, stay outta sight, be parta the woodwork, don't ever tell 'em your name, they'll use it against you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY is looking for the right exit sign. He spots it.
</DIRECTION>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here. Get off here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(a look at Joey)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. Thanks, pal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY looks pleased.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EVELYN'S HOUSE/INT. TOYOTA - LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE is turning onto a suburban street, checking the houses.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, buddy, I'm really enjoying this relationship we got going here. I been missing out on not knowing you better. Thing is, I got all this business stuff...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<JOEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could go to a movie Thursday night. 'Cause we don't have school on Friday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE pulls the car up in front of a single story two bedroom house.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here we are. Yeah, that's a possibility. A movie. Now you gwan in, tell your mother I got you back on time. Point that out to her. She was always on my case for stuff like that. She's still like that, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
(a little grin, his first)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(getting out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see ya... dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<DIRECTION>
JOEY gets out and runs toward the house. BERNIE watches him go. Then he pulls out the wallet, thumbs the cash, glances at the credit cards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHADOW LOUNGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bored, fiftyish bartender, CHICK, is watching the TV mounted over the bar in this unfashionable, nearly-deserted joint. He looks up when the door opens.
</DIRECTION>
<CHICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bernie! Where ya been, Pal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICK>
<DIRECTION>
Arriving at the bar, BERNIE surveys the dimly lit room, checking the booths and tables for customers. Not many.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some guys been looking for me, Chick? Spanish kinda guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<CHICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spanish kinda guys!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICK>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Business thing. Gimme a seven and seven, willya?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE checks his watch, takes a seat, puts a twenty on the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<CHICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it, five days now I don't see you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICK>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Cause I'm up to my ass in shit is why. I'm broke, plus I got legal problems... Nobody was asking for me, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE looks around nervously, peering into the shadowy booths and rear tables as CHICK puts a drink in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<CHICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope. Legal problems, you gotta have a good attorney.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICK>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My attorney, she's just outta law school, about a couple of years older than my kid, for Chrissake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<CHICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gotta kid? How old's your kid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICK>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nine. I think. Maybe ten. Yeah, ten. Nice kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<CHICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got a ten year old attorney, Bernie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICK>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't afford no better. My ex, she attached my pay check for child support payments.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You looking for Bernie LaPlante by any chance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN who's just entered the lounge shakes his head no and heads for a table where he's greeted by the COCKTAIL WAITRESS.
</DIRECTION>
<CHICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't even know you had a kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICK>
<BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(thoughtful)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The thing about kids is, they're so... young! They don't know nothin' yet. When you're a kid, you think you're gonna grow up an' be a "wonderful person" instead of an asshole, like everybody else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<CHICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're all assholes, Bernie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHICK>
<BERNIE>

BERNIE turns.

<DIRECTION>
Two Latinos are right behind him, low lifes, ESPINOSA and VARGAS.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>

	LaPlante. Bernie LaPlante. You the guys Bunny called, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BACK BOOTH/SHADOW LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Credit cards are being inspected. ESPINOSA, seated between VARGAS and BERNIE, in a booth in the nearly deserted lounge, looks the cards over dubiously.
</DIRECTION>
<ESPINOSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three hours is old, man. Very old.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESPINOSA>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, he might not of reported 'em at all yet. He might not know for a couple hours.

</BERNIE>
<VARGAS>

</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JEFFREY BROADMAN is standing against the granite facade of a downtown office building. Three thousand dollar suit, Hermes tie, expensively cut silver grey hair ruffling slightly in the breeze. Charming smile, candid eyes...
</DIRECTION>
<BROADMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To be honest, I can't make sense of it either, Ms. Gayley. Things seem to be on the upswing, our differences with the SEC have been favorably resolved. In a business sense, I believe we've "turned the corner..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROADMAN>
<DIRECTION>
GALE GAYLEY, a TV reporter, is standing close to BROADMAN, a microphone in her hand. She's thirty, attractive, dignified... We can hear SIRENS in the distance and, closer, the CRACKLE of radios and walkie talkies.
</DIRECTION>
<GALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister Broadman, your wife and children are on their way here as we speak. Don't you think -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALE>
<BROADMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel I've done very well in life: good health, wonderful family, much wealth. I guess what we're talking about here is a kind of despair. I just have the feeling that everything from here on is going to be... downhill... At a time like this, I think I'm entitled, as the saying goes, to "look out for number one" and put my own needs first. That pretty much concludes what I have to say. Thanks for coming out here to let me talk to you and your viewers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROADMAN>
<DIRECTION>
A nice smile as he drops RIGHT OUT THE BOTTOM OF THE FRAME!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON GALE

Looking down, horrified.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Suicide number 137 of this year in this city was neither a destitute nor a lonely man, but a successful executive with a loving family and forty million dollars in the bank. If there's nameless "despair" in executive offices, what can there be sixty stories below where the hungry and the homeless, the brutalized and the addicted, fight their daily battle for survival.

VIGOROUS APPLAUSE! GALE has just received the Silver Mike Award, a tastefully small, mike-sized replica of a microphone, from the MASTER OF CEREMONIES. Clutching it, she faces the applauding AUDIENCE across a podium, speaking into a real microphone.
</DIRECTION>
<GALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, very much. I'm grateful for this. Since you're all colleagues here, you know what kind of a team it takes... to put a story on a screen. I don't have to explain to you how much the cameraman, the editor, the assignment editor and the news director, to mention a few did to get me this award.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALE>
<DIRECTION>
GALE pauses. She reaches into her purse and pulls out an onion. She holds it up.
</DIRECTION>
<GALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is an onion.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(dramatic pause, then...)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a metaphor for a news story. Only a few hours ago I was standing on a ledge sixty stories above a street interviewing a man who subsequently jumped to his death. Forty million dollars in the bank, happily married, good health. Great story!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALE>
<DIRECTION>
The AUDIENCE is attentive, mesmerized as they watch her rip off the outer skin of the onion and toss it dramatically aside.
</DIRECTION>
<GALE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's gotta be more. We're pros, right? Some kinda extramarital hanky panky, maybe? Another good story!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she peels another layer of onion)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe the guy's been accused of child molesting. Terrific story!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she peels more off the onion)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then it turns out the accusation was false. Wonderful! More story.

The AUDIENCE watches, captivated as the onion gets smaller.

	Maybe the alleged mistress was lying, setting the guy up. Sensational story!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(the onion is very small)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We keep going, keep digging, keep investigating. We expose the guy's whole life, his family. Why? Because we're pros! Because...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she pauses dramatically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	we're looking for the truth!

</GALE>
<DIRECTION>
GALE considers the tiny remains of the onion in her hand. Then, she peels it down to nothing and lets it fall.
</DIRECTION>
<GALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what if, after all our digging, after all our painstaking investigation, what if it turns out there wasn't any truth? Just stories! One story after another, one layer, then another layer, until there's nothing left. And if it's like that, do we have any. obligation to stop at any point? Or do we just keep going, digging, digging, digging, peeling, peeling, peeling, until we've peeled it all away, until we've destroyed what we were investigating in the first place?

Looking back down the aisle she sees MR. FLETCHER putting his arm around RICHIE'S shoulder, father and son united against fate.

BERNIE frowns. It's getting louder.

AND LOUDER! AND LOUDER! IT'S ROARING.

BERNIE'S eyes bug with the realization that either he's about to take off... OR THAT ISN'T HIS ENGINE THUNDERING, THUNDERING.

A great shadow blurs in the rain ahead.

BERNIE brakes hard, skidding, sliding wildly.

<DIRECTION>
BAWHOOOOOOOOM! HUGE NOISE. IMPACT! GRINDING!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE skids to a halt, eyes shut tight to prevent himself from dying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he's not dead. He opens his eyes. Stares out the windshield.

EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE gets out of his car. Everything is spooky quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tail section of a huge aircraft blocks the road directly in front of Bernie's car. He skidded to a stop two feet short of ramming the twenty-five foot high vertical fin. The rest of the craft is sprawled off the low bridge and into the water, lost for the most part in the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a VOICE calls out... from somewhere forward along the fuselage.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Help! Somebody! Help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE frowns. Helping is not his instinct. Approaching the edge of the bridge, he peers into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The plane is corkscrewed through the bridge at such a freak angle that the tail rear doors are wedged shut by the metal super-structure, the wing exits are blocked by the up-bent wing stubs, and the right forward doors are canted hopelessly toward the sky while the left exit is partially jammed in the mud near the river bank in three feet of water.

Engulfed in darkness except for strings of floor lights leading to the exits, the cabin is a confusion of GROANS, COUGHS, CRIES and the piercing WAIL of a screaming BABY. The floor lights seem to be on the walls, high on one side and low on the other, as the cabin is dramatically canted, making movement along aisles nearly impossible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LESLIE, battered from the impact, her uniform torn, is struggling to open the forward emergency exit. Angled downward, the door will only open six inches before being blocked by mud. Water pours in around her ankles as she shoves furiously.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Staggering from her seat. WHAM! Hand luggage slams into her from an overhead rack. As GALE goes down, a PASSENGER lands on top of her catching her arm at an angle, breaking it. The PASSENGER climbs off her and struggles down the slope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GALE realizes she can't get up, her leg is wedged in the framework of a seat. PASSENGERS are climbing past her, heading forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUSAN is fighting her way out of her canted seats, clutching the terrified KELLY to her.

EXT. BRIDGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE is climbing cautiously down the undercarriage of the bridge toward the water, as OTHER VOICES callout from the twisted fuselage.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on there, hold on there. Just a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE is awkward and... very careful... climbing down, not brave or dashing. He doesn't notice that, behind him, where the plane is corkscrewed through the bridge a BOUQUET OF ORANGE FLAMES IS BLOSSOMING IN THE FUSELAGE OF THE JET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIN CABIN/727 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thick smoke is oozing through the cabin. PASSENGERS are stumbling over each other, clogging the canted aisles while OTHERS slump in their seats, immobilized.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIVER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Having reached the riverbank, BERNIE is reluctant to step in the water. He hesitates, then he takes off his shoes, looks in the darkness for a place to leave them.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help us! Help, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on, buddy. I got hundred dollar shoes here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
More cries. BERNIE steps cautiously into the water. Up to his ankles. Deeper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE wades along the huge fuselage, toward the VOICES, stumbling, landing on all fours in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Struggling to his feet, hands muddy, he blunders toward the Emergency Exit and finds it canted into the water, jammed into the mud so that it only opens a crack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. BROWN is wedged in the crack, trying to force the door open without success. Glimpsing BERNIE'S hands in the crack, he pleads.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help us, please. We can't get out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE makes a tentative attempt to open the door. He has no effect whatsoever.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Push it! You gotta push hard.

</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Reluctantly BERNIE digs his feet into the mud, puts his shoulder into the door and shoves with all his might. Because he has a better angle on the door and better purchase, he's actually able to move it several inches.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harder. Push it harder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE leans back into the door again and pushes with all his might. It gives ever so slightly. Another inch. MR. BROWN is trying to squeeze out.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Again! Harder. Come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BROWN>
<BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(grunting with effort)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm... pushing... it, buddy.

</BERNIE>
<MR_BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harder!

<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIN CABIN/727 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PASSENGERS stumble over each other while a flashlight makes panicky stabs at the darkness, RICHIE cries out for FLETCHER to wake up, the BABY screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Someone's trying to get out the overhead exit, others are hammering at an aft exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GALE slumped in her seat, fades in and out of consciousness. Above her, across the canted aisle, SUSAN is calling out for help... Then, GALE'S eyes flicker with awareness at the sound of an urgent shout...
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	THERE'S A GUY OPENING THE DOOR. HE'S OPENING IT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
A sudden shadowy surge of movement in the darkness, PASSENGERS urgently scrambling over seats toward the exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AIRPLANE/RIVER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE gives a great heave and goes down in the river face first.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's opened the door just wide enough for MR. BROWN to squirm through the narrow opening, then pull MRS. BROWN through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE, sputtering, is trying to get to his feet when the BROWNS knock him down again in their frantic rush to get as far away from the burning plane as they can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As BERNIE struggles to his feet yet again, more PASSENGERS are oozing out the door. They brush him aside, splashing toward the river bank, while orange flames are flickering wildly now in the tail section.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIN CABIN/727 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LESLIE is beside the exit, using her flashlight to guide people. Her face is bruised and bloody, her uniform torn, but she is courage itself...
</DIRECTION>
<LESLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Once you're outside, immediately move as far away from the aircraft as you can. If you see someone who needs help...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Scared PASSENGERS are struggling to get over the seats that are close to where the floor ought to be.
</DIRECTION>
<LESLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, everybody, one at a time. Please, one at a time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Just then the young RICHIE, caught in the surge of PASSENGERS, bumps into her.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Miss, my father can't move. He can't move.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<DIRECTION>
LESLIE grabs him and shoves him bodily out the narrow exit as she speaks urgently...
</DIRECTION>
<LESLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll try and help him, you wait outside. Get as far away from the plane as you can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Just then LESLIE sees the bloody PILOT and CO-PILOT staggering toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She helps them out the narrow opening, half pushing them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIVERBANK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE'S face is smeared with mud! He staggers out of the water in the flicker of firelight and starts searching for his shoes on the muddy riverbank.
</DIRECTION>
<PILOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PILOT>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gonna bUy me a new pair a shoes, pal?

The sound of approaching SIRENS cuts through the rainy night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AIRPLANE/RIVER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RICHIE is outside the plane, struggling in chest deep water. He looks back at the plane, sobbing...
</DIRECTION>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad! Dad!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't know what to do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIVERBANK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Muttering curses, BERNIE is floundering around on the riverbank when a hand clutches at his sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE whirls, his face a mask of mud. Finds himself facing RICHIE.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir! Please, sir. Sir, my father can't move.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<DIRECTION>
Where? BERNIE looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's in there! He's hurt!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<DIRECTION>
In the plane? In there? BERNIE looks at the plane, reacts...
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In there? Listen, kid, the cops are coming... and the firemen. They, uh, they got equipment and stuff for this kindathing, they're, uh, experts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of SIRENS, still. a ways off. RICHIE clutches at BERNIE.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, sir! Please! It's on fire. He can't move.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHIE>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE stares into the desperate face... and suddenly, recklessly, BERNIE loses it, forgets he's BERNIE, acts like someone else.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<YOUNG_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Inside! He's in the plane, he...

INT. NEAR THE EXIT/MAIN CABIN/727 - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chaos and confusion. The smoke is thicker, LESLIE is upset...
</DIRECTION>
<LESLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, you can't go back in. Sir, you're blocking passengers. Sir, no...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESLIE>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE, his muddy face unrecognizeable, is pushing his way into the plane, shouldering coughing PASSENGERS aside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE finds himself standing in the choking darkness, PASSENGERS pushing past him. Holy smokes! This is ridiculous! What's he doing here? Thicker smoke, can barely see anything, VOICES cry out in pain and fear. Just then he spots something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A flashlight lies on the floor sending a useless knife of light ' into the smoky darkness. He grabs for it, drops it urgently.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
The light is in a hand! He reaches again, snatches the light and points it revealing FREDDY, the other Flight Attendant, lying semiconscious on the floor, bloody, GROANING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE hesitates. Then he leans down, still gripping the light and half hauls FREDDY toward the nearby exit where LESLIE is supervising PASSENGERS.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, somebody, grab him, willya? Help this guy, willya, goddamnit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN reluctantly turns and, with the help of LESLIE they manage to shove FREDDY out the exit. LESLIE instructs the MAN...
</DIRECTION>
<LESLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get him away from the plane, help him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESLIE>
<DIRECTION>
LESLIE turns back in time to see BERNIE heading back into the darkness, struggling around the stream of PASSENGERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For half a second, LESLIE'S face reveals her amazement at seeing somebody go back into the the nightmare a second time. Then she's helping the next passenger out... SUSAN and KELLY...
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(cough cough)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	a woman back there. She's caught.

</SUSAN>
<LESLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get as far away from the plane as you can.

</LESLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Urgently LESLIE shoves them through the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. "UP THE SLOPE"/MAIN CABIN/707 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE is struggling aft, up the steep slope of the nose-down plane, coughing and cursing in the dark, calling out...
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MISTER FLETCHER! HEY, MISTER FLETCHER! MISTER FLETCHER, HEY BUDDY, WHERE ARE YA, GODDAMNIT?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE pans the flashlight ahead of him. The blade of light only cuts a few feet through the thickening smoke, revealing only empty seats.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	FLETCHER! HEY
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(cough cough)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HEY, FLETCHER, SPEAK UP, WILL YA? DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
No answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE pans the light, turns and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHARP GROAN!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE stumbles. He stepped on someone.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fletcher?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Pans the light down.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
A woman! GALE. Semiconscious, in pain, she opens her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GALE P.O.V.: BERNIE'S MUDDY FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking up, all GALE can see is a vague vision of a muddy face dimly visible in the spill of the flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<GALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My leg's caught.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALE>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE points the light toward her leg, overpans the leg, the blade of light discovering her purse. Then he corrects the beam back to reveal her leg wedged between two seats.
</DIRECTION>
<GALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you... can you get me out of here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALE>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE pans the light back to the purse again.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, sure. I think.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE puts down the light and struggles her leg loose while GALE groans in pain. Her head is near the floor lights, her eyes open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment BERNIE'S face passes through the stationary beam of the flashlight and GALE gets a glimpse of a smoky, muddy face leaning close to her...AN OBSCURE VISION!
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, lady. You gotta make an effort here. I don't happen to be a goddamn bodybuilder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE retrieves the flashlight lying near her purse. It's out of her line of vision, behind her head. He only hesitates for half a second before his hand shoots out for the purse, conceals it under his jacket, and gets to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EXIT/AREA/MAIN CABIN/727 - SECONDS LATER (NIGHT)

LESLIE is helping ANOTHER MAN out the exit.
</DIRECTION>
<LESLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get away from the plane quickly. It may explode.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Now she's alone. Heroically she turns back and probes the smoky interior with her flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blade of light is blunted by the smoky darkness. There's nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LESLIE hesitates. Should she run, save her own life or...?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly BERNIE steps into the beam of her light, emerging from the thick smoke hauling GALE over his shoulder, his face smudged, unrecognizeable, AN HEROIC VISION SHE'LL REMEMBER!
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>

	Gimme a

EXT. BRIDGE/HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIRENS scream and lights FLASH as more Emergency Vehicles join the ones already parked close to the bridge at a safe distance from the burning tail of the plane. A FIRE CAPTAIN shouts "Move that piece-a junk" at three FIREMEN who are already pushing BERNIE'S Toyota off the bridge and away from the airplane while a confusion of PARAMEDICS and POLICE hurry to the aid of dazed PASSENGERS in torn and bloody clothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIREMEN train hoses on the fiery tail of the plane while the FIRE CAPTAIN shouts...
</DIRECTION>

A dazzling worklight shining down from the bridge illuminates the fuselage and the partially opened exit as TWO FIREMEN in asbestos fire suits splash through the water carrying GALE from the plane.

FIREMAN DENTON stands at the narrow exit, too narrow for him to enter in his bulky asbestos suit and shouts through his helmet.

</DIRECTION>
<GALE>

</GALE>
<DIRECTION>
BANG! The PARAMEDICS slam the door behind her.
</DIRECTION>

CONKLIN shakes his head as CHUCKY lowers his camera and the ambulance pulls away.

ANGLE ON RICHIE AND FLETCHER

ANGLE ON BERNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reacting with sudden horror at something he sees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE BRIDGE

</STATE_POLICE_OFFICER>
<BERNIE>

</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE is urgently concerned with the purse poorly concealed under his jacket.

	<DIALOGUE>
	How about coming over to the ambulance, sir, let the medical people check you out.
	</DIALOGUE>

<BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(pulling away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I don't need no ambulance. I'm just looking for my car... It musta burned up or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
The purse is visible though the OFFICER hasn't yet noticed it. He's patronizing BERNIE, insisting.
</DIRECTION>
<STATE_POLICE_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You weren't in your car, sir, you were in an airplane crash. But everything's going to be okay, we'll just go see the doctor and...

As she pulls the OFFICER away, BERNIE hides the purse deeper under his coat, breathes a sigh of relief... and notices something!

Virtually unrecognizable, moved to the side of the bridge, buried under a mountain of fire retardant foam.

</BERNIE>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's in bed! You're not gonna wake him and make him crazy, do you understand? He comes home from the zoo, he wants to know if Elliot's a "war hero" like you... he wants to know how many people you killed...

<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Elliot"? The heroic goddamn fireman?

</BERNIE>
<EVELYN>

<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three weeks, Ev. I didn't tell him I killed anybody...

EXT./INT. BERNIE'S TOYOTA/PARKED - A MOMENT LATER (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As BERNIE gets in the car he notices the purse sticking out from under the passenger seat where he hid it.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM/EVELYN'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)

BERNIE holds out a twenty dollar bill.

<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, Ev, to bother you again. This is for Joey, his reward... for this wallet he found. When I, uh , returned it I told the guy he hadda give my kid something for finding it, for the honesty. So the kid would learn how honestly pays.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>

Eyes meet. She doesn't believe it for a moment and he knows it.

A blonde GIRL tosses an empty beer can from the window of a speeding car full of laughing TEENAGERS.

Looking for the VOICES, we MOVE IN on a single lane of crawling traffic and finally FOCUS ON a battered, rusted 76 Chevy with a crumpled fender, a trunk tied closed and cracked windows...

	<DIALOGUE>
	And you pulled people out? You're... a hero.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUBBER>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

BUBBER brakes for traffic and a cardboard box from the back seat hits BERNIE and cascades crushed cans all over him.

<BUBBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry about that. Just toss them in back.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(very serious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

BUBBER glances at the shoe BERNIE'S waving.

<BUBBER>

BERNIE drops the shoe on the floor, shakes his head, disgusted.

DAYTON'S P.O.V.

<DIRECTION>
A group of PRISONERS have just been led in the side door from a holding cell and a BAILIFF is removing the handcuffs that tied the PRISONERS together. One of the PRISONERS is BERNIE LAPLANTE. DONNA approaches him as the BAILIFF uncuffs him. She speaks to him but her words are inaudible to DAYTON.

<DONNA>

EXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the door to the restaurant opens, BUBBER finds himself blinded by winking electronic flashes and sun guns. A CROWD OF FANS and MEDIA engulf him and GALE. It's overwhelming. WE SEE EAGER FACES and BLINDING FLASHES from BUBBER'S P.O.V. and HEAR the CACOPHONY OF QUESTIONS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GALE too is adrift in a churning sea of MEDIA and ONLOOKERS.

POLICE OFFICERS move close to help guide GALE and BUBBER to a waiting limo.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON BUBBER'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again we see the chaos from BUBBER'S P.O.V., A POLICEMAN is reaching to help him. Just then BUBBER glimpses something else... beyond the CROWD in the fringes... HOMELESS PEOPLE in the shadows, some applauding him, too shy to come forward. In particular, BUBBER'S eyes fall on an ungainly MAN, his own age, dressed in rags and carrying a big garbage bag and another net sack full of cans. IT'S A STUNNING IMAGE! It's as though BUBBER is looking at himself!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door to the limo is open. GALE and several POLICEMEN are trying to get BUBBER into the limo and out of the clutches of the enthusiastic CROWD.
</DIRECTION>
<GALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, John.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALE>
<DIRECTION>
But BUBBER isn't paying attention to her. He's turning to face the eager CROWD, raising his arms.

<BUBBER>

	Hey, hey, uh, take it easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUBBER>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON GALE
</DIRECTION>

looking alarmed, then amazed.

The CROWD is still alive and buzzing, but they're respecting BUBBER'S space as he accepts an autograph book from a young woman, SYLVIA, and speaks shyly.

	You, uh, want me to sign this? Uh, what's your name?

See, when you're out there in the cold like I was, on the streets or sleeping under bridges or in your car, the worst thing, even worse than the hunger and the cold, is the... feeling... that you're just plain... useless.

	I guess when I... did what I did... I was trying to save my own life more than anything else. Trying to connect myself with people again and be... part of the whole. You have to help others to do that, you need a role to, play... even if it's a very humble role, it gives you self worth.

</GALE_TV_VOICE_OVER>
<BUBBER_TV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As far as the medal goes, well... that medal's for something me and my buddies did almost twenty years ago in Viet Nam. So if I'm a war hero today then I was a war hero last week when I was selling cans and sleeping in my car... when I didn't have a medal. I don't think a medal makes a hero. You don't need machinegun fire or burning planes to be... brave. People do heroic acts every day only there's nobody around to take their picture or decorate them. Little things can be heroic. Helping someone day in and day out, giving up your life a little every day instead of all at once... to help. Maybe... maybe we're all heroes.

BERNIE charging through the crowded Waiting Room having just been released on bail.

He doesn't look back as he speaks rapid-fire. He's really pissed.

Limos are parked out front of the hospital and there is a gathering of TV vans as BERNIE exits a cab and charges toward the entrance of the hospital, a tiny figure dwarfed by the huge building. He disappears inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR/CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We discover BERNIE wandering around, lost. A NURSE gives him a glance in passing and BERNIE suddenly is aware that his appearance is unusual. Disheveled. Unshaven. He tries to smooth his hair a little as he turns into a doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SPECIAL CHILDREN'S WARD/CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stepping through the door BERNIE is immediately horror stricken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rows of beds. A room full of seriously SICK CHILDREN. Palsied. Eyes out of sync. Motor disorders, spasms. Terrifying paraphenalia... tubes, machines, monitors, bags of fluid. A place of sUffering. To BERNIE it's a vision of a leper colony!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SEVEN YEAR OLD spots him, clutches at him with clawlike hands, jerky movements.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE recoils in horror, backing away.

<DIRECTION>
A FIVE YEAR OLD, "blinded" by the gauze wrapped around his face "looks" toward BERNIE and speaks.

Just then a couple of CAMERAMEN back through the door shooting. It's the head end of an entourage of REPORTERS, CAMERAMEN, HOSPITAL PERSONNEL and a couple of SECURITY GUYS that are traveling with BUBBER.

BUBBER nods and turns back to SICK KIDS who seem transfigured from BERNIE'S gruesome vision to children radiant with hope. Much of their appearance, at least, was attitude, despair.

A 14 year old ALLEN lies comatose in an intensive care room, tubes in his nose, arms, and chest, monitors all around him,his arms and legs in casts and traction.

BUBBER leans over the unconscious boy speaking intensely while a DOCTOR hovers next to him and REPORTERS and CAMERAMEN jockey for position at the foot of the bed.

As he leans closer to ALLEN, BUBBER puts a hand out without turning away from the boy,and waves away CHUCKY who has oozed in close with his camera. This is private. Understanding, GALE puts a hand on the lens and pushes the camera aside.

<BUBBER>

GALE can't hear what BUBBER is saying as he leans even closer to ALLEN and grips the boy's hand.

<BUBBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you don't know it, but you're a hero. Sometimes you don't know how brave you are... and sometimes you don't know... you can do something... until you... until you surprise yourself and... do it.

THE CAMERAMAN is turning to consider BERNIE when there's a sudden EXCITEMENT. The CROWD surges toward the hospital entrance. VOICES cry out "He's coming! Here he comes!"

A sea of shining faces filled with love and admiration surges in front of him. And yet, that VOICE again, a sour note of contraction...

Hearing it, looking around urgently, but all he sees are ADMIRERS thrusting at him as he's borne, as if on a tide, toward his limo. Nobody else seems to have noticed BERNIE'S VOICE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAITING LIMO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the door slams shut, the cheering is suddenly faint. BUBBER sinks back in the opulent seats while FACES distort themselves against the smoked glass, trying to peer into the sanctuary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, as the limo pulls away, BUBBER hears the VOICE again muffled by the thick glass. He turns, looks out the rear window. He sees the CROWD receding behind him, a confusion of SPECTATORS and... is that that hitchhiker (BERNIE) being restrained by a COP?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON BUBBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shaken and frowning with concern, he turns away from the scene now out of view behind the moving limo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alone in the luxurious leathered sanctuary, he realizes his hands are shaking as he reaches for the manila envelope GALE gave; him and tears it open.

<DIRECTION>
He stares at the script titled THE ANGEL OF FLIGHT 104.

Behind the deserted bar, CHICK looks from the TV set as BERNIE enters, weary and bedraggled, the strut gone. Bernie holds up his hands defensively.

EXT. VIDEO STUDIO - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sign over the door says "STAGE ONE/CHANNEL 4." Further down, on the door itself a sign says "NO ADMITTANCE/ AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNIFORMED POLICE linger around the door, surrounded by FANS and BUBBER'S limo waits at the curb, his DRIVER lounging by the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAYTON (we saw him earlier in the courtroom), is making his way through the knot of ONLOOKERS and MEDIA PERSONNEL gathered around the limo and in front of the entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Approaching as if to enter, he is confronted by one of the several UNIFORMED POLICEMEN guarding the doorway.

DAYTON enters the sound stage and sees the mock-up bathed in hot light in the middle of the darkened stage, surrounded by shadowy cameras and TECHNICIANS. The SURVIVORS are visible in the skeletal plane, rehearsing.

DAYTON settles in the shadows, out of earShot, watching.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON BUBBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Approaching GALE who's lying "helplessly" among the seats. He looms over her, his face obscured by "mud" make-up, hesitates. She whispers helpfully...
</DIRECTION>
<GALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you lean down and free me from the seat. I was caught and... that's it. Good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALE>
<DIRECTION>
BUBBER bends down, starts to "free" her, a troubled look on his face. He is struggling with something emotionally.
</DIRECTION>
<GALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you help me up. Boy, you seem... taller. It must be psychological... now that I know you saved my life...

<GALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're doing fine. You didn't actually lift me though. It was more like you supported me.

(a beat, then...)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	UH, ALSO, JOHN, MAYBE YOU COULD LIFT HER MORE, SORT OF CARRY HER. I KNOW THAT MAY BE BENDING REALITY JUST A TEENSY BIT, BUT IF YOUR JOURNALIST'S INTEGRITY CAN HANDLE IT, GALE, I THINK IT WOULD "PLAY BETTER" ON THE SCREEN.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's no big deal, it just looks better carrying me. Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time.

<DIRECTION>
GALE has a purse under one arm.
</DIRECTION>
<GALE>

</BERNIE>
<CHICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a character thing, Bernie. I mean, you wouldn't do it. No offense. Me neither. I mean, a guy like Bubber, he's a certain kinda guy. Heroic. You and me, we're not... heroic. It's not our nature. It don't mean we're bad or nothing. We're just not so inclined. What about it?

</CHICK>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<CHICK>

	The thing is, Chick. I'm goin' down.

<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not jail. Prison. And not that credit card bullshit, that's nothin'. I got a conviction. Sentencing tomorrow. Some cases of paint I got involved with. Latex. I see this parole officer, he writes a report to the judge says I'm "anti-social."

</GALE>
<DAYTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	LaPlante? Ha! Which version? This bozo has more stories than a newspaper. In one of them, he's "the angel of Flight 104!" He pulls you off the plane, saves your purse for you, but forgets to return it. That's Version 63. In Version 64, he kept it to pay for his "hundred dollar shoes." The guy's a bullshit artist, he's already got a sentence pending for dealing stolen goods.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(leaning forward, whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, I know. this is pretty off the wall... that guy, the hero, Bubber... he was a homeless guy, right? Down on his luck? He couldn't have swiped the wallet, could he? While he was rescuing you? And sold it to this guy LaPlante?

	John Bubber risks his life to save me and fifty-four other people and... swipes my purse?

</GALE>
<DAYTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too far-fetched? I mean, I'm not trying to make problems for John Bubber, I just want to make sure this creep LaPlante does some meaningful time. If we can't figure out how he got the cards, it makes it more difficult.

TWO FIREMEN have almost secured a rope around BERNIE while BUBBER continues to hang on to BERNIE, speaking to him through gritted teeth.

INT. LIVING ROOM/DRAKE SUITE - LATER (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The suite is jammed with MEDIA PERSONNEL, many standing on sofas, tables, and chairs, all of them (and their cameras) focussed on JOHN BUBBER who's standing behind a bank of mikes making a "statement" that sounds sincere (perhaps because it is halting, awkward, painful...)
</DIRECTION>
<BUBBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a moment of terrible weakness. I was feeling... I guess you'd call it "overwhelmed" by all the pressures and... the expectations of... fame... celebrity. I just didn't feel... adequate... to everybody's image of me... so... I took my despair out on that ledge with the intention of... jumping...

ANGLES ON REPORTERS, CAMERAMEN

	<DIALOGUE>
	In doing that I endangered the lives of hardworking policemen and firemen who attempted to rescue me, not to mention the life of my dear friend, Bernard LaPlante...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUBBER>
<DIRECTION>
BUBBER pauses and the room erupts in a chorus of REPORTERS' VOICES...
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTERS>

	Who is Bernard LaPlante? Did you know that LaPlante is a convicted criminal? What is your relationship with Bernard LaPlante...?

<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess Bernie's made some mistakes. I know I've made plenty myself. In fact I don't know anyone who hasn't. I think Bernie wants to be a private person and I I'm going to respect that.

glances idly at the TV remote control... and pockets it almost automatically, still watching TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE TV (INT. SUITE/HOTEL - NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REPORTERS erupt again in a CACOPHONY of QUESTIONS.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd he say to you? What'd you talk about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTERS_TV>
<BUBBER_TV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what he said to me was private. But he gave me confidence in myself. He told me I had a special opportunity, the chance to do some good in the world.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON BERNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He raises his eyebrows. I said that? On impulse, he pulls the remote from his pocket to return it. He's setting it down when he turns suddenly to find he's not alone.
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! How'd you get in? Nobody's supposed to come in here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
GALE has just entered the room. Did she see his action?
</DIRECTION>
<GALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I snuck in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALE>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You media people, you think you can just go anywhere you want, spy on people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<GALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALE>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who am I? You're asking me? You're the big expert for Chrissake! I'm what? The "Scumbag," right? The sleazebag something or other, the blackmailer, the...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<GALE>
<DIRECTION>
(very intense)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was it you? In the plane? Who saved my life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALE>
<BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(rattled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me? Listen, I don't give no interviews. That was John Bubber. You wanna ask me questions, you could talk to my attorney, Miss O'Day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<GALE>
<DIRECTION>
(imploring)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister LaPlante... Bernie... I... just for a few moments... I want to be a human being, not a reporter. I'm somebody who was going to die in a burning plane and I looked up, and some man came out of the smoke, his face smeared with mud, and soot and... and he... saved my... life. Off the record. Was it you? Why would you deny it if it was? Because you took my purse? Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALE>
<DIRECTION>
BERNIE looks at GALE. She looks very human, very real, the reporter's veneer completely gone! He hesitates. How can he not tell the truth at a moment like this? He takes a deep breath...
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lady, do I look dumb enough to run into a burning plane and save a bunch of strangers? I ain't the type.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>
<DIRECTION>
GALE stares at him. BERNIE tries to hold her look, daring her to doubt him. But he can't. His eyes "run." He's not a good liar this time. But just then CONKLIN'S VOICE on the TV saying Evelyn's name distracts BERNIE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TV SCREEN (INT. LOBBY/HOTEL - NIGHT)

CONKLIN is hovering over EVELYN and JOEY who are standing in a pool of TV lights while a CROWD presses close around them...

INT. HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>

Chaos. BUBBER is trying to get to the bedroom door, the news conference over, but he's being mobbed by MEDIA PERSONNEL who are SCREAMING questions, scrambling over furniture, blocking his path, jamming CAMERAS and MIKES in his face...

	Were you afraid? Look this way, John. John, over here. Mister Bubber, do you believe in God?

	Mister Bubber! Mister Bubber! JOHN!

BUBBER turns, sees GALE through a "forest" of heads. Their eyes meet, she shouts a question.
</DIRECTION>
<GALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John Bubber... how does a person know when he's a hero... and when he's not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALE>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes are locked, as if they're the only two in this very crowded room. A private question in a public place. The room becomes quiet as everyone realizes BUBBER is going to respond. BUBBER speaks soberly, directly to GALE.
</DIRECTION>
<BUBBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, like. I said, Miss... uh, Gale, I think we're all heroes. If you catch us at the right moment. We all have something noble and decent in us trying to get out... and we all have moments of weakness.

BUBBER continues to CAMERA, GALE off screen.

	It's the media that notices one moment and one person and not another. I'm just another human being like the next person, full of frailty with some courage and decency mixed in.

BERNIE and JOEY appear, passing in front of the monkey cage, deep in conversation...
</DIRECTION>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You remember where I said how I was gonna explain about life, buddy? Well, the thing about life is... it gets weird. See people are always gonna be talking to you about "truth." Everybody always knows what the truth is, like it was toilet paper or something and they got a supply in the closet. But what you learn as you get older is, there ain't no truth. All there is is bullshit
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pardon
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	my vulgarity here). Layers of it. One layer of bullshit on top of another. So what you do in life, like when you get older, is you pick the layer of bullshit you prefer and that's your bullshit, so to speak. You got that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERNIE>

<DIRECTION>
(totally confounded)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOEY>
<BERNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmmmm. Well, it's complicated. Maybe when you're older. Anyhow, what I'm gonna tell you here is in strict confidence, okay? It don't go no further. What happened is, you remember that night I was gonna take you to the movies an' it was raining like a sonofabitch,

BERNIE puts an affectionate arm around JOEY'S shoulder as we NOTICE that BERNIE is wearing brand new shiny shoes very much like his former good shoes, but different colors. As he and JOEY walk off, BERNIE still talking, JOEY puts an arm around his father and an audience of MONKEYS fills the foreground. MONKEYS.
