INT. DRESSING ROOM - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bed has been formed by a chair and three benches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A STRIKING AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN in her twenties lays across it. Her face and clothes are covered in sweat. Her skirt is stained.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She holds something wrapped in a soft sweatshirt on her chest. We can't see it, but WE HEAR THE BABY CRYING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's just given birth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are three frazzled saleswomen in the dressing room with her. They watch her with quiet smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fourth SALESWOMAN arrives ushering in the man with the shopping bags.
</DIRECTION>
<SALESWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Mr. Mathison. He's a doctor.

DR. MATHISON looks over the scene and then directly at the striking woman.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_MATHISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_MATHISON>
<DIRECTION>
The woman nods, "Yes." Sweat trickles down her face. THE BABY'S PIERCING CRIES ECHO IN THE SMALL ROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<SALESWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An ambulance is on the way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALESWOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Mathison puts down his shopping bags and moves to her. He kneels down and gestures for the bundle of sweatshirts in her arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_MATHISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there a name yet?

<DIRECTION>
Beat. The woman smiles for the first time.

<WOMAN>

</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
She hands him the wrapped child. We can't see the baby, but THE PIERCING CRIES SEEM TO GET LOUDER.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he supposed to be crying like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The doctor lowers the baby to his lap and unwraps him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman can't see her baby anymore. She watches Dr. Mathison as he looks down and examines her child. Beat. Dr. Mathison doesn't look up for the longest time.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I have him back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
THE BABY'S CRYING IS RELENTLESS. UNNERVING. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doctor finally glances up. He looks shaken. He makes eye contact with the woman for only a second. It's enough. A chill goes through her body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks to the three saleswomen who were in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_MATHISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened during the delivery?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_MATHISON>
<DIRECTION>
His hard stare unsettles the women. The OLDER SALESWOMAN speaks up.
</DIRECTION>
<OLDER_SALESWOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. It was very quick. The baby just wanted to come right out. There was no problems.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_SALESWOMAN>
<DR_MATHISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you drop him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_MATHISON>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone becomes very still. The mother looks like she stopped breathing. THE BABY'S SCREAMING ENGULFS THE ROOM.

<DR_MATHISON>

	Did you drop this baby?

The BABY SCREAMS.

LEGEND "PRESENT DAY"

<DIRECTION>
A fountain of humanity bubbles up from the escalators to the train platform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Businessmen take their last desperate drags of their cigarettes... Women traveling with children herd their luggage and offspring into tight shapes as they move... College students with backpacks look around dazed at the various track numbers.

<DIRECTION>
ANNOUNCER(o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last call track three, Amtrak Clocker making it's final stop at Philadelphia's thirtieth street station. First two passenger cars only. First two cars only.

<DIRECTION>
A face inside the train watches the stream of passengers emerging from the escalators. DAVID DUNNE, a man in his early forties, rest his temple against the glass and quietly observes the movement outside.

The train starts to pull out.

INT. PASSENGER CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David sits with his coat on his lap. He's wearing a tie. He doesn't look very comfortable in it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He feels a stare. He looks up to find a girl, six or seven years old, peering at him from over the seat in front of him. She just gazes at him blankly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gives her a small forced smile. She doesn't react. David returns his head to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes begin to shut with the lulling movement of the train.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WOMAN(o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You alone?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
David looks in the direction of THE VOICE. A WOMAN with dark hair and light blue eyes stands in the aisle with two bags over her shoulder. She's wearing a tight white t-shirt and jeans. She's beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David nods "yes."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman starts putting her bags on the shelf above the seats. She stretches to get them up. Her toned stomach is exposed. She has a silver ring pierced through her navel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David has a gold ring on his hand. He fiddles with it. Beat. He gently slips off his wedding band. It goes into his coat pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman takes the seat next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. A LOUD VIOLENT BURST OF SOUND. The passenger car shakes as a passing train barrels by two feet from David's window. It passes in a few seconds. The car returns to a QUIET HUM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David pulls a magazine out from the seat pocket in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He holds the woman's fashion magazine out.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone left these. You want one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
The woman looks over the one being offered and then points to the Sports Illustrated peeking out of the seat pocket.

David pulls the magazine out and gives it to her.

<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You like sports?

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my field. I represent athletes. I'm an agent.

WOMAN(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that right?

<DAVID>

Beat. David studies the excitement in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER LOUD VIOLENT BURST OF SOUND. David waits till the opposing train passes. The woman goes back to her magazine. Beat.

<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm David Dunne.

She holds up her hand. Taps the diamond ring on her finger.

KELLY(soft)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
An awkward silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you got the wrong idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
The woman stares at David. She looks down. Beat. Closes the magazine.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to find another seat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly gets up. She balances herself against a headrest as the train rumbles. She starts to the back of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David sits alone. He looks like he's drowning, but there's no water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He feels a stare. He glances up. The little girl spies on him from between the seats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David leans towards the window to avoid eye contact. His hand reaches into his coat and slides out his wedding band. He puts it back on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His temple touches the glass. The vibration of the train begins to lull his eyes closed... Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David's head bounces lightly against the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shaking of the glass never allows David's eyes to completely close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits up when he realizes the shaking is getting stronger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks out the window. The scenery blurs as it flies by. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David turns. Some of the other passengers start to react as they realize the train is picking up speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The normal bumps of the tracks become amplified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WORRIED VOICES OF THE TRAVELERS START FILL THE CABIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train goes faster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND THEN THE HIGH PITCHED METAL ON METAL SCREECHING STARTS AS THE TRAIN BEGINS TO TAKE A CURVE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David's eyes move to the seat in front of him. The little girl is no longer watching him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID LOOKS TO THE PASSENGERS ACROSS FROM HIM. He sees the ground slowly drop away in the windows behind them as THEIR SIDE OF THE TRAIN STARTS TO RISE...

<DIRECTION>
THE PASSENGERS SCREAM AS THE AMTRAK PASSENGER TRAIN BEGINS TO TILT OFF THE TRACK...

INT. FAMILY ROOM - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A boy, age ten, sits on his head on the family couch and watches television upside down. His floppy brown hair spreads out in a circle in front of his red face. He changes channels with a remote control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves past the upside down cartoons and the upside down talk shows. He stops on an upside down picture of a crashed train. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His knees come forward as he flips over. He tumbles slowly off the couch and onto the carpet. JEREMY DUNNE gazes at the television screen... A LIVE AERIAL VIEW OF A TRAIN WRECK SMOULDERING BELOW IS SEEN. Two trains are tangled like snakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeremy gets up and moves to a small table with a phone. Next to the phone is a notepad. On it is written...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Dad - Amtrak 177 - 3:40pm."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeremy looks at the television. At the bottom of the screen in red block letters that move from right to left are words and numbers..."The 3:40 Amtrak 177 has derailed... Amtrak Emergency number is 1-800-777-4322... The 3:40 Amtrak 177 has derailed...Amtrak"

An elderly woman can't hold back any longer and SCREAMS. An embarrassed, tortured helpless scream.

MEGAN DUNNE continues applying pressure to her arm which is being pushed back as far as it will go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She counts to three and eases off. She lays her arm back in her lap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE ARE IN A PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER. About a dozen people are on specialized weight machines.

The elderly woman is seated on an exercise table and breathes slowly.

</MEGAN>

Megan reaches up to the t.v. monitor mounted on the wall. She turns it on and starts flipping channels. She stops on ESPN where a swimming meet is underway. Men in bikini swimsuits line the edges of the pool.

Virginia starts watching with great interest.

Megan's eyes move to the tiny print moving across the bottom of the screen. Her face goes still as she reads the train number... 177.

DAVID DUNNE'S EYES SLOWLY OPEN. THE DULL WHITE OF THE OVERHEAD TUBE LIGHTING BLINDS HIM AT FIRST.

He blinks his vision back. He realizes he's in a bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE HEAR AGITATED VOICES, MOVEMENT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David looks around. He's in an emergency room. There are a half dozen prep areas and beds next to him. They're all empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID FOLLOWS THE URGENT SOUNDS OF ACTIVITY TO A PREP AREA DIRECTLY ACROSS FROM HIM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He can only see glimpses of activity through the drawn curtain. A group of emergency room personnel are treating a man whose body is twitching violently on a gurney.
</DIRECTION>

One of the group is a man who glances through the opening in the curtain. He notices David sitting up from across the room.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets back into the shower and turns the water back on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He closes his eyes. His face tightens up. He slowly hunches down and takes a seat on the tiled floor of the shower. Water pours over him. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His muscular body begins to shake. Then we realize he's crying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FAIR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LEGEND "1969"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hazy afternoon. A fair has come into town. They have set up in the vast parking lot of the local high school.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A line of women has formed in front of the portable bathrooms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The striking African American woman we saw giving birth is now standing in line. She is older and somehow more beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stands with a skinny, almost ethereal looking African American boy. The boy wears a metal brace on his leg. THE EIGHT YEAR OLD ELIJAH holds two oversized stuffed animals in his arms. He looks back over his shoulder as THE SOUND OF VOICES YELLING IN EXCITEMENT FILL THE AIR. His eyes dance over the many colorful rides in the parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens to one of the portable bathrooms. A woman steps out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah's mother touches his head and enters the three foot square plastic bathroom. She turns back and gives him a look.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll play the water pistol game next.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah nods, "Yes" happily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mother closes the cubicle door. Elijah is left alone amongst the line of women. They stare at him blankly. Their eyes moves over his leg brace. Elijah doesn't like it. He moves away from the line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CRESCENDO OF CHEERS RISES IN THE AIR FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE FAIR. Elijah follows the voices. He carries the stuffed animals through the crowds of people. CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. His metal brace sounds as he walks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment, he sees nothing but bodies all around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He emerges amongst a huddle of teenagers who wait at a turnstile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man in a red and white striped coat takes their tickets and waves them in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah looks up and sees the sign above the turnstile... "The Hurricane."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He watches the teenagers giggle as they each into a grey cup-like seat. They pull the metal bars down in front of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man in the red and white stripes leaves the turnstile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah stares up at the multi-colored sign. Beat. He moves quickly. Ducks under the turnstile and climbs onto the platform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah finds and empty circular seat. He slips inside the gray metal compartment and sits. He pulls down the rusted metal bar in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around at all the excited faces. His eyes fill with excitement too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His small hands feel the cold metal of the interior of the compartment. His expression changes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah looks to the stuffed animals in his arms. He presses them to check their softness. He places the stuffed animals on either side of him on the seat. He's wedged in between them. Feels good.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches out and touches the hard rusted metal bar in front of him. Elijah looks a little anxious. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls off his sweater and wraps it around the bar. It goes around twice before he ties the arms together. He checks its softness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah looks around the customized cup-like compartment he sits in. He smiles an eight year old smile of pride.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND THEN HE HEARS HIS MOTHER'S VOICE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He searches around and finds her walking in the waves of people. He hears her calling.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elijah...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
She moves in his direction by chance. She finds herself at the entrance to The Hurricane ride. She looks up at the sign above the turnstile. Her worried eyes immediately start searching the young faces in the gray circular compartments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes meet Elijah's. He waves. Her face goes very still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HUGE ROAR OF MACHINERY as the ride starts up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah yells to his mother as the platform starts running.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't get hurt momma! I'm safe!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH>
<DIRECTION>
HIS WORDS GET EATEN UP BY THE CHEERS OF THE TEENAGERS AND THE GRIND OF MACHINERY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The platform spins. He sees a glimpse of his mother and the red and white striped man. She's pointing at Elijah.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The platform turns... Elijah sees a flash of the red and white striped man's angered face as he yells at the frantic woman next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then the ride speeds up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gray circular seats start to spin on their own. The teenagers CHEER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah's eyes fill with joy as the wind plays against his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the ride changes directions. The cup-like seats get jerked. Everyone grabs the metal bars to hold on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah laughs as he smashes into the stuffed animal on his right. It cushions him and then falls to the floor of the compartment along with the other stuffed animal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah's expression becomes tense as his compartment spins. His hands slide over the rusted metal bar as the sweater unravels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah looks around... a sudden panic enters his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BLURRING IMAGE OF HIS MOTHER NOW IN A GROUP OF RED AND WHITE STRIPED MEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SOUND OF MACHINERY GRINDING IS HEARD as the ride changes directions suddenly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah's hands rip away from the bar as he gets thrown to the side of the compartment. His shoulder and arm takes the brunt of the impact. WE HEAR SOMETHING CRACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TEENAGERS SCREAM IN EXCITEMENT. ELIJAH JOINS THEM WITH SCREAMS OF HIS OWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ride spins its passengers. Elijah's small face looks up at the swirling clouds in a mixture of agony and terror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ride changes directions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah is thrust forward. He hits the rusted metal bar square against his chest. WE HEAR MORE CRACKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The world spins. Giggles and yells fill the air. Elijah slumps down onto the floor of the compartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then finally, the grind of the machinery slows and then comes to a gradual stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TEENAGERS MOAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah is facing directly up at the sky. The clouds now move slowly over him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE HEAR COMMOTION. AGITATED VOICES. HIS MOTHER'S DESPERATE VOICE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOTHER(o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His bones... He's not well...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
HER VOICE GETS LOUDER AS SHE MOVES CLOSER TO THE PLATFORM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOTHER(o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elijah baby...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Then her face appears as she finds the cup-like seat Elijah is in. She begins to scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah lays on the bottom of the compartment. One arm is clutching his chest. The other is curved horrifically like an "s". His mouth is open. His eyes are bulging. The last thing we HERE ARE THE SHORT DESPERATE BREATHS of an eight year old child about to black out from the pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRESENT: EXT. CHURCH - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE EMERGE FROM BLACK to find news vans and reporters lining the street across from a church. They have been cordoned off by a handful of police. Mourners are recorded as they emerge from their cars and enter the church.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David is among the arriving crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAN(o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David Dunne!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
At hearing his name, David turns back as he walks. He can't tell which reporter called his name because all of them seem to react. A storm of camera movement as the group jockeys for the best angle of his troubled face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David passes a magnetic board as he enters the church. It reads, "Services for the families and friends of train 177."

<DIRECTION>
David sits amongst the mourners in the standing room only church. His eyes drift to a woman two rows ahead of him. She's turned around, looking at him. Her eyes are red from crying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David looks away. His eyes stop on an old man far to his left just a few seats away. Father, mother and daughter stare silently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David surveys the entire church... Desperate inconsolable eyes question his existence from every direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David has to look down.

INT. BACK OF CHURCH - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David and the priest who conducted the mass are alone in the mass preparation room. The priest looks in his fifties, eyes tired, blood shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I used to play football in college. In my first year as quarterback, we went on this winning streak. It just went on and on. It didn't matter who we played... I'd always win.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You get superstitious when something like that happens. You give things meaning. Like you wear the same color socks each game or you listen to the same B.B. King song before you leave the apartment. I wouldn't even untie the shoelaces on my cleats. I'd just slip them on and off so nothing would change... I gave things meaning that had no meaning.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

	I'm here to make sure I'm not making shoelaces into something they're not again.

<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you a religious man, David?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<DIRECTION>
David nods, "No."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The priest removes the sacred stoll from his around his neck and kisses it before folding it carefully.
</DIRECTION>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. Because I'm going to talk to you as a man. Not as a man of the cloth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. The priest turns to David.

Beat.

<DAVID>

</DAVID>

	Luck... Random... Without meaning.

</PRIEST>
<DIRECTION>
David just sits awkwardly.
</DIRECTION>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three years ago, my cousin died on a plane that crashed on take off at Philadelphia International airport. Do you remember that crash?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<DIRECTION>
David nods, "Yes."
</DIRECTION>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I prayed and prayed and finally found some meaning in the event. It gave me peace... And then not quite a year later, an entire family from my parish burned to death in a hotel fire downtown...

David is shaken. Beat.

<DIRECTION>
DAVID(soft)

	<DIALOGUE>
	The metal of the watch I was wearing was crushed like a sledge hammer hit it.

<DIRECTION>
Beat. The priest's eyes fill with emotion.

INT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No cameras greet his exit. No people anywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David walks across the now empty parking lot. His car is the only one left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks to the driver's side. Pulls out his keys. That's as far as he gets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes catch sight of the GRAY ENVELOPE tucked under the windshield wiper of his car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David moves forward and gently pulls it out. His name is typed on the front. He turns it over. Two embossed words on the back.
</DIRECTION>
<Limited_Edition>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the envelope. One line, handwritten, gazes at him from the gray index card.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The line reads...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"How many days of your life have you been sick?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing else is written.

David Dunne looks around the empty parking lot quietly.

INT. EMPLOYEE LOCKER ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A poorly lit changing room. A row of metallic lockers sits against one wall. A bench splits the room. A brown folding table with Dunkin Donuts boxes and bagels on it is crammed in the corner. A puke colored concrete floor sets the tone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David and three other large men are changing out of their street clothes. They all put on the same yellow short sleeve shirts. The same two words are written on all their backs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Stadium Security"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This ritual goes on without a word.

INT. MAIN STADIUM CORRIDOR - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David walks along the massive curved wall around the outer rim of the stadium. As he passes the different walkways we get glimpses of the enormous and empty sixty-thousand seat football stadium on the inside.

<DIRECTION>
David stops at a door marked "PERSONNEL".
</DIRECTION>

INT. PERSONNEL OFFICE - MORNING

David knocks on the door as he steps into the cramped reception room to the personnel office.

The SECRETARY, an ancient woman with thick flabby arms never stops typing and never looks up as she talks.

<ANCIENT_SECRETARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think you could ask Noel something for me?

</DAVID>

The ancient secretary's right hand immediately picks up a pen and positions it over a blank pad. Her left hand keeps typing. She never looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<ANCIENT_SECRETARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Proceed.

EXT. STADIUM FIELD - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rain falls in sheets in the stadium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David stands at the entrance to a tunnel that empties out onto the field. He stands in an imposing dark green rain poncho and hood. The poncho almost touches the ground. The word 'security' on the back has almost faded away. We can barely see David's face under the hood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a football game in progress on the enormous field. The players seem unusually small. There is no one in the stands. About four hundred people are on the sidelines of the field watching the players. A soggy limping banner stretched behind them declares, "The Pennslvania Elementary School Championships."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David's eyes scan the tiny figures on the field. His eyes come rest on a surge of activity on the sidelines. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David steps out into the rain.

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDELINES - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A handful of red faced fathers are yelling at each other. They're in each other's rain soaked faces. The scene feels on the verge of physical violence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David and another security guard jog over. David steps in the middle of the tight circle. The men stop yelling in the presence of stadium security. Everyone just stands in the rain glaring at each other. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I think about to calm down? I think about those big fat, hundred and twenty pound turtles that live in the islands. Those suckers never get angry, never get in fights and live longer than all of us and all they do all is sit on the beach and hump other turtles.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't we take a second and think about the turtles?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Nobody moves. Rain washes over the agitated faces. A father breaks the moment.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah Jerry why don't you think about the fat ass turtles... Like your fat ass son on the field jeopardizing the rest of our chances at a fucking championship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER>
<DIRECTION>
David tenses. Everyone looks to JERRY. A bald man who stands just a foot away. Jerry nods to himself. Looks like he's going to say something. Instead he lunges forward and smashes a HEADBUTT to the man who spoke to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David tackles Jerry hard and fast. He drives him into the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blood starts rushing out of the nose of the dazed father who took the headbutt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other fathers start yelling and pushing each other. The remaining security guard calls on his walkie for assistance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David keeps Jerry immobilized in a powerful arm and head lock that holds the man's enraged face hard into the wet surface of the field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David's eyes are not on Jerry. They gaze out onto the field where twenty two elementary school boys have stopped playing and are standing frozen, helmets off, rain washing over their faces. They watch in horror as their parents attack each other on the sidelines.

David is the last one left. He's showered and back in his street clothes. He sits in the dimly lit room on the bench, lost in his thoughts when the door opens.

He turns to find a somewhat pregnant looking man with a tie step in. This is NOEL.

David seems lost in his thoughts.

	Maybe you should go up. Jeremy might see you're gone and get frightened.

	The train thing, really shook him up. He's scared something's going to happen to you. He doesn't want to let you out of his sight.

David stares at Megan. Beat.

LEGEND "1974"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A thirteen year old Elijah sits in a chair with his arm in a sling. He watches a small black and white television in the corner of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS. Elijah's mother walks into the room. She looks around for a moment, and then moves to the television. Turns it off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room GOES SILENT.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH>
<ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't do anything about that. You might fall between that chair and this television. If that's what God has planned for you, that's what's going to happen. You can't hide from it in your room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah just sits staring at the dark television screen.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They call me Mr. Glass at school. Cause I break like glass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah's face is tense. Unyielding. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah's mother says the next words in almost a whisper.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...You make this decision now to be afraid...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you'll never turn back your whole life. You'll always be afraid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah's eyes move from the television to his mother. He sees the emotion in her face. Neither says anything for a while. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I got a present for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

<ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget why. Do you want it or not?

Elijah thinks it over. He nods, "Yes."

<ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>

	Well, go get it then.

</ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH>
<ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On a bench, across the street.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>

Elijah looks at his mother with disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You calling me a liar?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
She points to the window. Beat. Elijah gets up and moves to the only window in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The view from his room looks out over a narrow street. On the other side of the street is a public playground. A handful of children are playing on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are three benches to one side of the swings. On one of them is a THIN PACKAGE wrapped in brown paper with a bow on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah looks to his mom who has joined him at the window.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone's gonna take it.

<DIRECTION>
Beat.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLAYGROUND - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah walks across the playground. He's very wary of the other children running about him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks towards the bench with the present on it. Takes a seat. Puts the package on his lap. It's flat. The edges of the bend down over his thin legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He undoes the white bow. He peels off the clear tape holding the brown paper together. He unfolds the paper. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah stares down at the single comic book in his lap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He feels the shadow of his mother. She takes a seat next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bought a whole bunch. They'll be one of these waiting for you, every time you want to come out here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They said this one has a surprise ending.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah looks to his mother. His intelligent piercing eyes take her in for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks back down at his lap. He opens the first page...

<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same intelligent piercing eyes, twenty-five years older. Elijah has grown into a handsome, regal looking man. He leans on a walking stick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's looking at an impressively framed charcoal sketch on a wall. Two figures are depicted on the top of a building locked in fierce battle. One figure is extremely muscular with a mask. The other is half human, half animal.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is from Fritz Champion's own library. This is before the first issue of the comic book hit the stands in 1968.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah glances at the BUSINESS MAN standing next to him and then back to the sketch.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a classic depiction of good versus evil. Notice the square jaw of Slayer - common in most comic book heroes. And the slightly disproportionate size of Jaguaro's body to his head. This again is common, but only in villains... The thing to notice about this piece... The thing that makes it very, very special... is its realistic depiction of its figures. When the characters eventually made it into the magazine they were exaggerated... as always happens.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is vintage.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
The business man rubs his face. Gazes at the sketch. Beat.

<BUSINESS_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wrap it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUSINESS_MAN>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've made a considerably wise decision.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah starts to the back of the store which we now see is some type of art gallery where all the framed pictures are images and sketches from comic books.
</DIRECTION>
<BUSINESS_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My kid's gonna go berserk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUSINESS_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah jams his walking stick into the extra thick carpet and stops. He turns.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Once again please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH>
<BUSINESS_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My son Jeb. It's a gift for him.

</BUSINESS_MAN>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How old is Jeb?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH>
<BUSINESS_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four.

</BUSINESS_MAN>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

</ELIJAH>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah starts back to the businessman shaking his head strongly.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, no, no no... You need to go now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH>
<BUSINESS_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did I say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUSINESS_MAN>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you see any Telletubbies around here?... Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?... Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it?... No?... Well that's what you see at a toy store? Any you must think this is a toy store, cause you're in here shopping for an infant named Jeb. One of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person's valuable time...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah's eyes pierce through the shaken man.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is an art gallery my friend. This is piece of art...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah points at the sketch.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is one of seventeen original drawings by Fritz Champion remaining in the world. It's value will triple every year... This piece is to be treasured. To be cherished... To be coveted by every single one of your banker friends that think they're better than you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH>

The business man stares at the sketch with large eyes. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<BUSINESS_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if I kept it?

</BUSINESS_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.

<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm listening.

	I'll keep it in my office room.

	What about Jeb?

<BUSINESS_MAN>

	I have a lock on the door.

Elijah just stares.

<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will it be near a window?

</ELIJAH>
<BUSINESSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No direct sunlight will fall on it.

Elijah eyes the man for many seconds. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come back in three days. I'll think about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah starts to the back. He passes the front door as two customers walk in. Elijah talks over his shoulder to them.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're by appointment only.

	I received a card from your store.

	Congratulations, you have a mailbox... The sale isn't for two weeks.

	This one was under the windshield of my car.

Elijah turns and faces the customers for the first time. David Dunne stands with Jeremy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah just stands staring for the longest time. Beat. He walks closer to them. When Elijah speaks, his voice has a whispery quality to it.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH>

	You've never been sick?

David and Elijah quietly look at each other. Beat.

EXT. LIMITED EDITION - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three chairs have been placed on the walkway in front of the bay window of the store. The words, "Limited Edition" are etched in the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David, Jeremy and Elijah are seated watching the people stroll by. Elijah's cane is on his lap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeremy sips a drink in a paper cup.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So let's get some of the usual questions out of the way. Why am I using a cane? Raise your hand if you were thinking that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH>
<DIRECTION>
Jeremy raises his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I fractured my leg. It's the fifth time I've done that particular bone. It didn't really heal well this time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Raise your hand is you're wondering who the hell breaks the same bone five times?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH>
<DIRECTION>
Jeremy and David raise their hands.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have something called Osteogenesis Imperfecta. It's a genetic disorder. I don't make this particular type of protein very well and it makes my bones very low in density, very easy to break. I've had fifty-four breaks in my life. I have the tamest version of the disorder... Type one.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	There are type two, type three, and type four. Type four's don't make it very long...

<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How certain are you that you haven't been sick in your life?

</ELIJAH>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seventy-five percent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seventy-five percent? That's not nearly good enough for me. I'm extremely skeptical.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Skeptical about what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your answer to my question. It's one thing to have never been injured in your life, but to state that you've never taken ill, well that's a whole new level.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH>
<JEREMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad's been injured.

David nods.

	I assumed because of the train.

	You assumed wrong.

Elijah closes his eyes. When his eyes open, the life force in them has diminished. Beat.

David and Jeremy enter the store. Elijah leans on a walking stick before one of the framed sketches. He gazes at it quietly.

	I think you skipped a couple steps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You forgot the "Now I'm going to tell you what the hell is going on" step. See usually that comes before the, "It's over" Step. And it always, always comes before the "You can go" Step.

</ELIJAH>
<DIRECTION>
David stares at Elijah impatiently.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are probably only four or five individuals in the world who can claim more knowledge of comics than myself. I've spent a third of my life in a hospital bed with nothing else to do but read. I have studied the form intimately. I have seen the patterns in them... The references to social and cultural events and the atmosphere that surrounded them. I've come to believe that comics are our last link to the ancient way of passing on history.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Egyptians drew pictures on walls about battles, and events. Countries all around the world still pass on knowledge through pictorial forms.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe that comics, just at their core now... have a truth. They are depicting what someone, somewhere felt or experienced. Then of course that core got chewed up in the commercial machine and gets jazzed up, made titillating - cartooned for the sale rack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah gazes at David.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This city has had its share of disasters. Well publicized ones. It was around the time of that plane crash, when it first entered my head. And there it stayed, as I waited and watched the news over the years...

	And then one day I see a news report on a train accident and its sole survivor who was miraculously unharmed.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A person who can't be hurt like the rest of us. A kind of person they were talking about in those stories.

<DIRECTION>
David glares at Elijah.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this about? This is obviously some scam. Is this where you tell me one of those pictures is like an investment?

</DAVID>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've misunderstood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see guys like you all the time in my work. You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story, utterly convincing... and somewhere in there, you slip it in... 'I just need your credit card number','I just need a small down payment.'

David shakes his head. He smiles out of frustration. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you know that this morning was the first morning I can remember, that I didn't open my eyes and feel that sadness... Do you know what I'm talking about? That little bit of sadness?

	But I guess that's what you were counting on.

David opens the door. He looks back at Elijah.

David moves to the darkness of the corner of the room. He opens a closet door.

A NAKED HANGING BULB GOES ON as David yanks a chain. David steps inside the narrow closet and closes the door slightly so the LIGHT FROM THE BULB DOESN'T FALL ON JEREMY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's just enough room to stand and look around. David reaches up and pulls a small travel bag out of the way. David stretches as he feels on the top shelf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His hand comes down with something wrapped in a t-shirt. He unwraps it. It's a handgun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at it for a beat before wrapping it back up and replacing it to the highest shelf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stretches even more. Reaches farther back. WE HEAR SOMETHING SLIDE ON THE SHELF AS HE PULLS IT FORWARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls down a folder jammed with clippings. He opens the folder to reveal a young David in football uniform holding his helmet in the air victoriously. The word "Champion" is written over his head. David flips through the top clippings - all are images and stories of David and football.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns the pile over. Goes to the last clipping. This piece of paper is folded over three times, unlike the others. He opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a newspaper headline. It reads...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"CAR ACCIDENT LEAVES TWO INJURED"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David puts the new headline next to the old one... They look like a set. Even the font is similar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David stares at the old headline. Stares hard at the photo of the bent and heavily damaged car laying upside down in the middle of the highway... The bulb seems to flicker. David is utterly still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOMEONE KNOCKS AT THE BEDROOM DOOR. David gets startled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He puts back the clippings. Stuffing the new one inside with them. He replaces it back to the top shelf and leaves the closet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER SOFT SET OF KNOCKS as David moves across the bedroom. He opens the door.

Megan stands in the darkened hall. Beat.

Megan's face starts to tremble. She starts crying. Tears roll over her very affected face. She tries to wipe them away, but there's too many. Beat.

David Dunne stands to one side with two other security guards.

The fans moving through the turnstiles are clad in all types of Eagles paraphernalia. A group of girls carries a homemade banner that David reads as he tilts his head sideways. "We sleep with quarterbacks," is written in block letters.

David stares at a woman carrying a newborn infant in her arms. The baby is wearing an eagles uniform.

The GREEN ARMY JACKETED MAN moves forward in the line. His face is blank as he watches the pat down ahead of him. He's twenty people from the turnsstile.

David eyes him. Fifteen people away... Ten...

We are inside a customized car. The dashboard is covered in some sort of thin foam padding. The steering wheel and gear shift have the same padding. Every corner and hard surface has been safe guarded. Elijah sits behind the wheel of his car in the parking lot of the stadium. He sits as thoughts crash at his head. Beat.

He finally reaches for the keys and starts up the car. He looks into the rearview mirror and sees the man in the GREEN ARMY JACKET pass behind his car.

Elijah quickly turns and sees the man moving through the parked cars heading out of the parking lot.

Elijah's walking stick makes RHYTHMIC CLICKS on the concrete parking lot.

The figure in the army jacket seems to move farther away with every step.

Elijah starts breathing harder. He pushes himself to move faster. He avoids the hard chrome bumpers and tailpipes that jut out from the cars as he quickens his pace through the lot.

He gains on the army jacket.

	Hold up for a second!

The man in the army jacket turns as he reaches a subway entrance that marks the end of the parking lot. He looks back at Elijah for a beat. Doesn't like what he sees. He disappears into the subway entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah quickens into a jog now. He hasn't done this in a while and it's painful. He makes it with great strain to the subway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks into the entrance...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A steep flight of stairs leads to the subway floor. The tail of the army jacket is glimpsed before it disappears.

Elijah breathes hard as he takes hold of the railing.

Elijah's VOICE ECHOES down the stairs. No response.

Elijah starts his descent.

THE SOUND OF A SUBWAY PULLING IN ROARS UP THE STAIRS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah has to move fast. He takes the steps with less and less hesitation. He's moving with great agility... and then his foot catches on a step.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His hand slips away from the railing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He falls down the remaining part of the stairs. The FIRST SICKENING CRACK is heard when his hand reaches out to stop his fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SECOND CRACK IS MORE LIKE A CRUNCH AS HIS LEG LANDS AWKWARDLY ON THE METAL STAIRS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes to a stop in a pile on the dirty gum stained floor of the subway landing. His jaw is locked in a HORRIFIC SCREAM THAT GETS EATEN BY THE ROAR OF THE SUBWAY TRAIN PULLING IN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His contorted anguished face sees the turnstiles of the subway upside down. The green army jacketed man looks back at Elijah with a blank expression pushing through the turnstile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The last thing Elijah sees before he blacks out, is the tail of the man's coat riding up as he move through the turnstile. The SILVER HANDLE OF A GUN peeks out from the belt of his pants.

Another deep breath as David heaves. The weight CLINKS as it comes off the arm rest. David is full out straining now as he lowers and raises it. His arms begin to tremble as he lifts it for the second time. BANG the weight lands back safely onto the rest.

Three walls of the locker room are lined with shiny lockers. One side of the room has benches and massage tables. The far end of the room has work out equipment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
About twenty players and trainers are scattered throughout the spacious room lost in their own pre-game rituals.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David watches as a massive muscular player takes a seat on the massage table and removes his dress shirt. His body is covered in old bruises. He lays down, wincing a bit from the pain. A trainer begins to massage him.

David just stares at the battered athlete. His gaze moves across the room. Beat.

David stares at something in the crowded room then he starts towards it.

He moves through the room of players and trainers. He moves to the one area of the large room not occupied by anyone.

<DIRECTION>
David comes to a step at the foot of an Olympic bench press. Racks and racks of free weights sit behind the press.

<DIRECTION>
David looks down at the thick silver bar. Three large black plates are on either side. Six in all.
</DIRECTION>

David looks back and glances at the double doors where he should be standing. Beat. He looks to the twenty or so players and trainers in the room. Some of the players have headphones on. Some are staring into space. A couple are on cell phones...

No one notices David Dunne as he reaches for a forty-five pound black plate off the weight rack.

The huge disc slides onto the bar with almost NO SOUND...

A matching forty-five pound disc goes on the other side...

And then David adds another. He matches it on the other side...

THE BENCH CREAKS just the slightest bit as David takes a seat.

No one notices the security guard lay back on the bench.

David's hands take hold of the shiny bar.

He closes his eyes...

David's arms become tense. He pushes against the weight. It doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His face turns deep red. He opens his eyes and stares at the bar as he keeps training. His face and arms are shaking... He keeps staring... focusing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then, without any fanfare, the bar lifts off the arm rest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The weight hovers over David. He lowers it to his chest for a second time. His arms aren't shaking anymore. He pushes the weights back up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He carefully brings the bar back to the arm rest. It touches down with the smallest of CLINKS.

David's fingers uncurl from the bar.

And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain.

THE PONYTAIL MAN looks at his watch and then to far back of the store where one head is visible behind a low rack.

</PONYTAIL_MAN>

The ponytail man straightens the wheelchair and starts down the aisle again. After a couple of feet, Elijah jerks and grabs the other wheel sending the wheelchair ramming violently into the opposite wall. Comics are knocked free and fall onto the wheel chair and the nearby ground.

David sits on the edge of the tub. His shirt is unbuttoned. He sits in a daze staring at the tiled floor.

His eyes slowly move to a small white and red box laying on its side under one of the sinks.

David rises and picks it up.

David looks through the fence down to the tracks. Just to the side is a construction site. Cranes and lifts and various equipment stand idle in the area next to the section of train wreckage that has been brought to the station grounds for dismantling and salvaging. The bent shapes of the train pieces can only be glimpsed in outlines as they sit in the darkness, hundreds of feet away from the immaculately lit train station.

The passenger car is split in two. Just before the tear, along the window line, the windows have been crushed in. A huge hole has been ripped below the windows exposing the ravaged interior.

David stands before this heavily damaged area of the car. He just stares at the wreckage. Water falls off the rim of his hood in front of his face.

David leans into the car and unbuckles Megan. He works her out underneath the steering column. He slides out. Her leg is bleeding.

The wheels of Elijah's wheelchair move down the hall as he follows the SOUND OF THE PHONE RINGING.

He follows THE SOUND to a PHONE RINGING in the storage room of the store. There are shelves and shelves of comic books. Thousands of them filed away in neat piles.

Elijah picks up the phone a little out of breath.

INT. THIRTIETH STREET STATION PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The interior of the station is a mystical sight. One huge cavernous room, a football field in size, lined on both sides with giant pillars that rise into a misty hand painted ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELIJAH(v.o.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David, it's okay to be afraid. Because this part won't be like a comic book... Real life doesn't fit into little boxes that were drawn for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
David stands in a quiet corner and watches the faces of passengers arriving and departing late night trains. Even at the late hour, there is heavy traffic throughout the station.

ELIJAH(v.o.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Go to where people are... You won't have to look very long.

<DIRECTION>
David stares out at the midnight travelers. Beat. He starts towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He passed the towering black statue standing at the far end of the station. It watches over the whole building. It's in the form of an angel lifting a soldier to heaven.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David moves through the first group of people - a crisscross of arriving passengers from tracks one and two. They brush by him and lightly bump him as they move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH CUT: WE ARE NO LONGER IN THE TRAIN STATION. A BLOND WOMAN IN HER TWENTIES STANDS AT A COUNTER IN A CROWDED STORE.

SHE SLIDES THE SILVER BRACELET AND EARRINGS SHE WAS LOOKING AT OFF THE GLASS COUNTER AND INTO HER PURSE. NO ONE SEES.

David turns and glances at the blonde woman as she walks away from him towards the exit of the train station. He doesn't stop moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David heads towards the densest part of the floor. The area near the information board. Sleepy friends and tired family members stand and wait. A steady spider-like web of movement flows as six tracks let out on either side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David moves to the center. His rain poncho almost touches the marble floor. Lines of passengers emerging from trains below the main level move steadily on either side of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David looks down and gently turns the palms of his hands out as they at his side. His finger tops graze the jackets and clothes of the passengers walking by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dozens and dozens of people pass. Nothing happens. Then a man in a crumpled shirt and slicked back hair brushes by...
</DIRECTION>

THE GIRL MOANS SOMETHING INAUDIBLE AS SHE ROLLS ON HER SIDE. HER SKIRT RIDES UP HER THIGH.

THE YOUNG MAN STARES AT HER AND THEN GETS UP. HE MAKES SURE NO ONE IS LOOKING BEFORE CLOSING THE DOOR. HE LOCKS IT FROM THE INSIDE.

David watches the teenager with baggy jeans hanging off his hip. He walks and greets a group of identically dressed friends.

Beat. David turns his hands back in. He seems shaken. He takes a couple of deep breaths as he gathers himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then David steps back to look around. HE BUMPS the shoulder of a man standing behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David takes a sudden breath like someone punched him in the solar plexus.
</DIRECTION>

FLASH CUT: AN ENORMOUS MAN WITH GLASSY EYES STANDS BEFORE A SCREEN SIDE DOOR. HE'S BALDING. THE HAIR HE DOES HAVE IS SHOULDER LENGTH. HIS ECLIPSING SHADOW FALLS ON THE CONSERVATIVE LOOKING MAN WHO STANDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN DOOR INSIDE THE HOUSE.

<DIRECTION>
David stands frozen in the train station. His face is almost unreadable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David is standing less than a foot away from the man he bumped. They're standing shoulder to shoulder. David's eyes slowly move from the ground over his right and then finally onto the man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's huge. At least three inches taller than David. His shoulders are massive. He's wearing a one piece ORANGE UNIFORM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man in the orange uniform leans over a trashcan next to him and removes the full trash bag within it. He replaces it with a fresh one. He throws the full trash bag into a gray plastic bin with wheels and starts pushing it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David watches the man head across the floor towards a double door marked "Station Maintenance Staff Only".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Four identical gray bins sit outside the door. The huge man disappears with his bin inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David waits. He just stares hard at the double doors. Nothing happens for the longest time... No one comes out. David makes a decision. He starts towards the doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then they open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The huge glassy eyed man in orange emerges carrying a bag over his shoulder. He's wearing a baseball hat with his uniform now. He heads toward a back exit.

David lets him get about twenty feet away before deciding to follow him.

EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man in the orange uniform walks in the driving rain down a residential city block. Almost all the lights in the middle class homes he's passing are off at this late hour. No one is out walking except him and David Dunne fifty feet behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The orange figure turns the corner onto a block of modest stand alone homes. The uniformed man walks slower in this block. He looks around carefully as he moves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns into a driveway of one of the homes. He stops and pulls a wad of mail out of the mailbox.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David stands with the hood of his security coat covering his head and face. He stands in the shadows and watches silently as the man in the orange uniform looks over his massive shoulder before turning a knob and entering the white paneled house through a familiar side door with a screen on it.

The side door opens with almost no sound. The hooded figure of David Dunne steps into a narrow laundry room. THE SOUND OF A TELEVISION IS HEARD FROM ANOTHER ROOM.

A very large pile of unopened mail sits in a mound on the clothes dryer. Two or three days worth.

David shuts the door very slowly.

THE SOUNDS OF CHEERING FROM THE TELEVISION IN THE NEXT ROOM SPILL INTO THE KITCHEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David stares out from under his hood at the mess.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cabinets are left open. Empty cans of food sit on the counter with a handful of unwashed dishes. The breakfast table is the eeriest thing in the room. It sits frozen with a plate of half-eaten, now moldy eggs at one setting and two bowls of colorful cereal in another. The cereal has dissolved in the old milk. Two cockroaches are crawling in the bowl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David moves slowly to a door in the kitchen. It's slightly open. As David gets closer, he shields his face from the strong smell. He pulls the door open quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHAFT OF KITCHEN LIGHTS FALLS DOWN THE STAIRS INTO THE BASEMENT. At the bottom of the stairs is a MAN'S BODY. The same man who answered the door in the flashback lays partly in the shadow, partly in the light. His crumpled tie lies folded over itself on his still chest.

INT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

A BOXING MATCH BLARES ON THE TELEVISION. Empty beer bottles and coke cans sit in a pyramid on the coffee table.

David steps into the unoccupied room. His movements are slow and tense.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUDS OF HEAVY FOOTSTEPS COME FROM THE CEILING OF THE ROOM. David looks up and follows the SOUND AS IT MOVES AROUND ABOVE HIM.

David moves to the stairs as SOMEONE GETS KNOCKED OUT ON THE TELEVISION.

Three closed doors converge on a landing. David opens the closest one.

It's a young girl's room. Posters of boy bands are on her wall. Clothes are everywhere. The room is empty.

A NOISE COMES FROM THE HALF OPEN BATHROOM DOOR ATTACHED TO THE BEDROOM.

INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A slightly overweight girl, probably fourteen years old is tied by her wrists with a phone cord to the metal towel rack in her bathroom. She sits with her arms pointed upward over her head. He knees tucked up to her chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Next to her is her younger brother. A skinny boy, maybe twelve. He's tied and seated in the same way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their heads are leaned back against their arms. They're completely listless. Eyes half mast. They watch as the door to the bathroom opens and the dark hooded figure of David Dunne steps in. His long dark slowing rain poncho still dripping water. He stands in the doorway for a moment before moving towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They don't react in anyway as David reaches for the phone cord and unties them. They're arms flop to their laps as they gaze up at the figure leaning over them. They boy blinks once slowly.

David takes a step back and stares at them from under his hood.

An exercise bike in the corner of the bedroom has been turned into a clothes hanger long ago. The t.v. across the bed has framed family photos displayed on top of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David's shadow passes over them as he moves towards the open bathroom on the other side of the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A woman is tied to the bathroom door handle. She sits on the tiled floor slumped against the door. Her eyes stare blankly at the ground. She has considerable bruises on her face and arms.

<DIRECTION>
David stands before her.

<DIRECTION>
DAVID(soft)

	Where is he?

The woman doesn't answer, but a SOUND COMES FROM THE SCREEN DOOR nearby. The curtains draping the screen door move with the wind from outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David crosses the room and pushes aside the curtain. It leads to a small balcony. An empty lawn chair is the only thing on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David steps onto the balcony and looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rain still pours down unmercifully. It comes down on a black tarp that covers a pool in the backyard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David turns to go back inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BLURR OF ORANGE ATTACKS HIM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The collision is sudden and explosive. The huge man drives his shoulder into David's chest and takes him off his feet. David's body flips over the railing.

The dark green rain poncho flaps in the wind as he falls two stories directly towards the black tarp.

EXT. POOL - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
David lands on his stomach with a TREMENDOUS SLAP onto the nylon black tarp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a thin layer of rain water on the tarp's surface. David is laying on his cheek. Half his face is covered in water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. David's exposed eye looks around in a daze. The surface of the tarp gets pounded by the rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David uses his hands to push his body off the tarp. His hands sink into the water as his pressure pushes the tarp down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FIRST SOUNDS OF NYLON SLIDING AGAINST CONCRETE START.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David stops pushing. His vision catches the corner of the swimming pool as the tarp slides out from under the sand bags that hold it in place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tarp sags. David becomes utterly still. THE SOUND CONTINUES ANYWAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One by one the tarp starts sliding out from under the sand bags all around the edge of the pool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then without warning, the tarp caves in. It folds around David as he and the tarp get pulled UNDER THE COLD DARK WATER.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. UNDER WATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David's body is tangled in the pool cover. His legs and arms thrash against the constricting black tarp. He's drowning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GLIMPSES OF LIGHT FROM THE HOUSE PIERCE THE DARKNESS UNDER WATER. THE BLURRED IMAGE OF A DISTANT FIGURE HIGH ABOVE ON A BALCONY FLICKERS AND DISAPPEARS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The last of the tarp slides out from under the sandbags that old it in place around the edge of the pool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rain keeps falling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tarp moves like it's alive underwater. It shifts and wraps David tighter with every movement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GLIMPSES OF LIGHT AGAIN. TWO SMALL FIGURES NOW STAND IN A BLURRED SILHOUETTE NEAR THE EDGE OF THE POOL. FLASHES OF SOMETHING SHINY THEY'RE HOLDING... A ROD OR POLE... IT'S SHAKY NEBULOUS IMAGE WAIVERS IN THE AIR ABOVE THE SURFACE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David's only free hand reaches for the light. It catches the silver pole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tangled mass of David and the tarp are pulled slowly towards the edge of the pool. David's head and shoulders emerge from the darkness. He takes hold of the pool's edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Huge desperate breaths as he pulls his body out from the water and the grasp of the tarp. He hauls himself onto the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits hunched over in a dark mass, his head down under his hood. The rain poncho covering him like a blanket. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rises to his feet. The water rushes off of him. His breathing is slowing, calming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands in a silhouette from the light of the house. He turns and looks to the two small figures standing near the edge of the pool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The children from the bathroom stand still in the rain. They're holding an aluminum pole with a brush head for cleaning the pool. They stare up at the hooded figure.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man in the orange one-piece uniform stands over the woman tied to the door handle of the bathroom. His back is to us. He's drinking from a beer bottle as he looks down at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't notice the third presence come into the room. He doesn't hear him move closer. Right behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man in orange takes another sip of his beer, not realizing an arm is reaching over him... He doesn't get to swallow the sip in his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David Dunne's powerful arm wraps around the man's thick neck. David's hands clamp together like and iron vise. He squeezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man's beer bottle crashes to the ground as his neck begins to get crushed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David yanks back hard, pulls the man off balance. The man's legs push back violently, sending both of them backwards across the room. They come to a hard stop as David's back gets RAMMED INTO THE BEDROOM WALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The huge man in orange pulls away and then SLAMS DAVID harder against the wall. David's arm remains locked around his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man becomes frantic. His face turning dark red. He clutches at David's arm. He spins, taking David with him into another wall. The IMPACT IS TREMENDOUS. The room shakes. David holds on. His face bent low and hidden under his hood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then the man in orange throws a powerful elbow back. It lands hard right in David's side. David groans. The huge man delivers another one. Savage, desperate blows. WE HEAR THE IMPACT OF EACH ONE WITH DAVID'S BODY. And David never lets go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elbows slow and then stop. The legs of the man in orange start to buckle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David pulls him back onto his heels. He turns him in a half circle. All of his tremendous weight is hanging from David's arm now. David LETS OUT A YELL AS HE APPLIES ALL HIS STRENGTH. The man's legs stop kicking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David keeps turning him. The man's body goes completely limp. David's just dragging two hundred and seventy-five pounds of weight in a circle over the carpet now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David slowly comes to a stop. He stands there with his arm wrapped around the man's neck....The man's limbs dangle down to the ground. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David's hands let go of each other. His arm slips out from under the man's jaw. The man in orange crumples to the ground like a rag doll. The only SOUND IN THE ROOM IS DAVID'S HEAVY BREATHING. Beat.

He moves to the woman slumped against the door. He starts to untie the phone cords that bind her wrists to the handle. He whispers to her.

He stares at the woman whose eyes stare blankly at him. She sits unnaturally still against the door with her arms above her head. The mascara that has run down her face and dried, has tracks where countless tears have rolled down.

David moves his hand near her mouth and nose. He checks for the feeling of breath against his hand. Beat.

The woman turns and looks at David for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am. I'm helping him with the sale.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
David looks across the store at Elijah talking with the customers.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's doing well today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm very proud of him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's kind of a miracle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes he is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
They both watch Elijah from across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell him you're here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH_S_MOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
David watches as Elijah's mother walks across the store and waits for Elijah to finish talking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David turns back to the framed sketch. He looks at it with his hands in his pockets. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David's stare turns into a gaze. His gaze turns into stillness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SKETCH is of a withered man with large tense eyes. He sits in the shadows. He's seated in some type of machine. There are lots of buttons and levers on the machine. The machine has wheels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David turns from the sketch. He looks across the room to Elijah seated in his wheelchair. Elijah's large eyes stay focused on the customer's as he finishes negotiating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David turns back to the sketch. He looks at it with growing confusion. The more you look at drawing, the more the machine the man is seated in looks like a wheelchair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David looks back across the store. Elijah and his mother are talking. Elijah has spotted David.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Elijah starts across the crowded store towards David. He wheels up to him.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you see this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah has a newspaper on his lap. He holds it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a drawing on the front page. It's a hooded figure shielding two huddled children behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELIJAH(soft)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It has begun.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
David stares quietly at the sketch of himself.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I saw it this morning. I felt a part of the world again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah looks down at the newspaper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David hesitates and then reaches forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches past the paper... And TOUCHES ELIJAH'S ARM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHCUT: AN AIRPORT GATE. ELIJAH IS STANDING AT THE WINDOW LOOKING OUT ONTO THE AIRFIELD. HE'S CRYING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIRENS START SOUNDING THROUGHOUT THE AIRPORT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WAITING PASSENGERS START GETTING UP AND MOVING TO THE WINDOWS.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah speaks to no one in particular as he stares out the window with tortured eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A plane just crashed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

FLASH CUT: ELIJAH AND AN ELDERLY MAN IN A UNIFORM ARE SEATED IN A HOTEL BAR.
</DIRECTION>
<ELDERLY_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've worked here twenty-five years. I know all its secrets.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELDERLY_MAN>
<ELIJAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Secrets?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIJAH>
<DIRECTION>
ELDERLY MAN(whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like if there was ever a fire on floors one, two, or three... Everyone in this hotel would be burned alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ELIJAH LOOKS UP FROM HIS DRINK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>

FLASHCUT: ELIJAH LEAVES THE ENGINEERING ROOM OF AN AMTRAK TRAIN. HE PASSES THE ENGINEER WHO HAS JUST ARRIVED WITH COFFEE.
</DIRECTION>
<ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Passengers aren't allowed in there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENGINEER>
<DIRECTION>
Elijah doesn't answer and doesn't turn around as he exits train 177.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David takes two unsteady steps back. Elijah has tears in his eyes as he gazes down at the newspaper. He looks up to David.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELIJAH(low voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I almost gave up hope. There were so many times I questioned myself. I've made so many sacrifices but it's all been worth it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are millions and millions or mediocre people in the world David. Isn't it great that we aren't one of them?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
David looks like he stopped breathing as he backs up in the store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Customers step between him and Elijah. Elijah becomes obscured and then blocked from view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
David emerges from the store slowly. He braces himself against a parked car and then keeps on walking in a nightmarish daze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE PULL BACK as David Dunne blends in with dozens and dozens of ordinary people, walking on an ordinary street, in an ordinary city.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK:
