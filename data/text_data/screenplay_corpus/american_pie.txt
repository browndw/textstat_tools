	Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Now we see a TV...but the picture isn't clear. Or, more appropriately, the picture is scrambled -- it phases in and out. Bars scroll across it. And we get occasional glimpses of what looks like --

<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...oh -- that was a tit, tits...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
As most high-school guys know (but few will admit), it is possible to watch the pay channels while they're scrambled. You just need a decent imagination to fill in the rest of the picture. We PULL BACK to see JIM -- 17, short, horny.

	Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Jim is, uh, physically involved with the scrambled babe. We TILT DOWN to see a small multimedia presentation next to Jim on his bed. "Cosmopolitan" is open to a sexy model...a yearbook is open to the "girl's swim team" section...and a dictionary next to Jim, open to the "Vagina" listing, accompanied by a big vagina diagram.

Suddenly there's a KNOCK at the door, immediately after which JIM'S MOM enters. Jim scrambles and quickly covers himself and the dictionary with a pillow. She's oblivious to his doings.

<JIM_S_MOM>

	Hey, Jimmy. I just wanted to say sweet dreams.

</JIM_S_DAD>
<DIRECTION>
Jim's Dad grabs for the remote, which is sitting on the pillow that's been covering Jim. The pillow gets brushed aside -- revealing the Big Vagina Diagram, Jim with his shorts down, and a very strategically placed tube sock.

We see a Honda Accord drive by a sign at the city limits: "Welcome to East Great Falls, Michigan -- A Great Place To Be"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT OF SCHOOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front of the school. KEVIN drives up in his Accord. He's a good-humored, good-enough-looking high school senior. VICKY rides shotgun -- pretty, smart, confident. She's holding a large, thick envelope, with a big "Vanderbilt" return address on it.
</DIRECTION>
<KEVIN>

	It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<VICKY>

</VICKY>

She tears it open. Pulls out a course catalog, various forms, and a letter which she hands to Kevin.

<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Dear Ms. Hughes. We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected. Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."

Vicky SCREAMS in excitement, like a girl at a Beatles concert. Then she LAUGHS, and gives Kevin a big kiss and hug.
</DIRECTION>
<VICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you!

She hugs Kevin tighter -- as he looks a little frazzled, almost perfunctorily returning the hug.

EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - MORNING

Jim has met up with CHRIS OSTREICHER -- "OZ" -- a cocky senior with a football-player build. He cradles a ball in a lacrosse stick.
</DIRECTION>
<OZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Illegal channels? Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.

	Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night? That Ariel, whew.

Jim and Oz, now joined by Kevin, walk down the hall. Oz bounces the lacrosse ball off a locker, catching it again. Kevin speaks a little distantly, unnerved.

</KEVIN>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think she was serious?

<NADIA>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too.

</NADIA>

	Well...I am going to get another beer. You want one?

He pounds his head with his fist.

She sees that he's lost. Almost feels sorry for him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	...okay...

She's totally enthralled. Nervous, she raises the beer again to take a sip. Then Stifler moves in. Takes the beer from her and sets it down. Starts kissing her. She breaks it off.

<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, I can't believe a fine woman like this produced a guy like Stifler.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>

TWO FRESHMAN GUYS are walking by as Jim says this.

Suddenly, a bedroom door opens a couple inches. Sherman pokes his head out.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(hushed, to guys)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you think you fellas could try a little tact? I've got company. Know what I mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
In the bedroom in the background, we see the Central Girl. Sherman closes the door, leaving the guys there, dumbstruck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - STAIRWAY - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Jim and Kevin are coming down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<KEVIN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dammit! If Sherman has sex before I do, I'm gonna be really fucking pissed.

They turn the corner into the kitchen.

INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUING
</DIRECTION>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, I just gotta get laid already! This blowjob thing is bullshit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<DIRECTION>
He stops. Vicky is there with Jessica. Staring at him. Vicky quietly grabs her purse. Hurt. OTHER STUDENTS watch, silently. Kevin doesn't know what to say.
</DIRECTION>
<VICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jessica, can you drive me home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICKY>
<JESSICA>

</PARTY_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STIFLER'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The next morning. The party is long over. Plastic beer cups and various bottles litter the house, but it's not trashed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim is wandering around in a daze, holding his head. He stumbles over a body. It's Kevin.
</DIRECTION>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ow, what the hell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, I thought you were dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
They walk over to the other side of the room. Finch is sitting on the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning gentleman.

</FINCH>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Finch! Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought a fashionably late entrance would enhance my appearance.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off their looks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I got here, the Bacchanalia was over and the nymphs had left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<DIRECTION>
Oz wanders in, still sullen. Takes a seat, sulking.
</DIRECTION>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Feeling better, Oz?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<OZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm such a loser.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OZ>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the spirit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<DIRECTION>
We hear FOOTSTEPS coming down the stairs. It's the CENTRAL GIRL. She wears a "Central" sweatshirt. Sherman follows behind her. The guys watch in disbelief as Sherman and the girl speak hushed, intimately.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(snippets of conversation)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I'll never forget...thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Central Girl smiles. Notices the other guys watching. Just gives Sherman a kiss on the cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<CENTRAL_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CENTRAL_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She exits. The guys are dumbfounded. Jaws hang. Sherman looks triumphant. Strides over to the guys.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<SHERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fellas, say goodbye to Chuck Sherman, the boy. I am now a man.

The guys are shocked and amazed.

<SHERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was just my time, fellas, it was just my time. Best of luck to you, boys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Sherman exits. Silence. The guys look like they just lost the World Series on errors. They slowly take seats, ruined.
</DIRECTION>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I put in months of quality time with Vicky. Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores? This is just wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<OZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OZ>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, we're all gonna go to college as virgins. They've probably got special dorms for people like us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat as they give this serious consideration. Then, Kevin strides purposefully to the front of the group.
</DIRECTION>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, I got an idea. But it stays between us. Agreed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<DIRECTION>
They do.
</DIRECTION>
<KEVIN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. It's really simple. We make an agreement -- no wait, more than an agreement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like a bet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, a pact. No money involved. This is more important than any bet. Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<DIRECTION>
A beat
</DIRECTION>
<OZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OZ>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is different. This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you. Someone to keep you motivated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Oz nods, getting into it. Kevin smiles and continues, arms outspread.
</DIRECTION>
<KEVIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what we are, we keep each other on track. Prior to this day, we've postured. We've procrastinated. We've pretended. We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pontificated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<KEVIN>
<DIRECTION>
(ignoring him)

	Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!

	<DIALOGUE>
	The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!

</OZ>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here. Now think about it --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Kevin jumps up on a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<KEVIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No longer will our penises remain flaccid and unused! From now on, we fight for every man out there who isn't getting laid when he should be! This is our day! This is our time! And, by God, we're not gonna let history condemn us to celibacy! We will make a stand! We will succeed! We will get laid!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Kevin jumps down off the chair, and puts his hand out in front of him. One by one, the guys pile their hands on top, in between them -- it's a pact! They break with a CHEER. Woo-hoo!
</DIRECTION>
<STIFLER>
<DIRECTION>
(wandering down from upstairs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are you losers doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STIFLER>
<DIRECTION>
They all stop. Stifler has a toothbrush hanging from his mouth. A goatee of dried toothpaste.
</DIRECTION>
<FINCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I might ask, when you brush your teeth, do you spit or swallow?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINCH>
<DIRECTION>
Stifler tries to give a retort to Finch, but turns green and heads back upstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DOG DAYS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guys are finishing up breakfast. Hot dogs & eggs.
</DIRECTION>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, the sex -- it's got to be valid, consensual sex. No funny stuff. And no prostitutes, if you were thinking about that, Finch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Finch gives a wistful "Who, me?"
</DIRECTION>
<KEVIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<OZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dude, prom sucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OZ>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, but think about it -- At the parties that night. Chicks are gonna want to do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. That gives us...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly three weeks to the day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
They take this in with some trepidation.
</DIRECTION>
<KEVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright then. It's official. Any questions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEVIN>
<DIRECTION>
There are none. Kevin raises his Pepsi.

	<DIALOGUE>
	To the next step.

</KEVIN>

The guys raise their drinks.

<ALL>

	To the next step.

</ALL>
<DIRECTION>
They toast. And from this, we go into our STRATEGIZING FOR SEX MONTAGE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KEVIN'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim sits in the room as Kevin goes through the yellow pages. Finds a "Floral Delivery" listing. Kevin dials.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - SENIOR LOCKERS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kevin, Jim, and Oz are pooling a few dollars together, which Kevin takes. They part ways.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oz is watching the Lifetime Channel as Jim looks on in confusion. A Martha Stewart-type thing where they pain pottery with little sponges. Oz looks dubious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finch is unpacking his lunch. He carefully unfolds a napkin to reveal a sandwich, crust removed. Other than that, he's doing absolutely nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim is fiddling with a small, golfball-like camera attached to his computer. The computer screen reads, "E- DATE: We Make Love Happen." As Jim fiddles with the camera, a window on the screen shows his real-time image. He clicks an onscreen-button labeled "FREEZE IMAGE" -- the image freezes, showing Jim with an awkward grimace. The screen reads, "IMAGE SENT."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGHS - LIBRARY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kevin holds a copy of the HOLY BIBLE. We see he's in the "Religion" section. Surrounded by piles of different bibles. No luck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finch pulls out a small mustard packet. He neatly snips the end with scissors. Then rolls the packet, like a tube of toothpaste, economically dispensing every last bit of mustard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim is on his computer. The screen reads "YOU HAVE 00 REPLIES." Jim is nonplussed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - SENIOR LOCKERS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kevin, Oz, and Jim are closely gathered around Kevin's locker, holding their backpacks open. Kevin holds a big shopping bag, which he turns over, and a box of condoms falls out. He hands it over to Jim...and we see that the guys' packs are full of various condom boxes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JIM'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim has unraveled a bunch of condoms and is curiously examining them.
</DIRECTION>

And THE MONTAGE COMES TO AN ABRUPT END with a KNOCKING.

<JIM>
<DIRECTION>

Jim takes a seat next to his dad.

<JIM_S_DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are for you. From father to son.

</JIM_S_DAD>

Jim looks at the bag. Uncomfortable. Hesitantly, he takes it. Slowly, dreadfully, he pulls out a copy of PERFECT 10.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh...dad...

</JIM>

Jim's Dad is doing his best to be the good father.

<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait!

</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
But it's too late. Jim's Dad is face-to-face with the unraveled prophylactics. He sours.

	I'll have to save this speech for another day. I'm too worn out.

<DIRECTION>
The VOCAL JAZZ GROUP is practicing, singing one of those doo-wop, Acapella love songs (i.e. "Love You Like I Do"). Singing with the group is none other than Oz. He's not doing too badly, but mainly he's checking out the various vocal jazz girls. Smiling at them, giving suave little waves.

Kevin, Stifler, and Jim take seats in the back of the auditorium, listening.

There, a bit dusty, is an old book. Many extra pages of notebook paper have been tucked into it, nearly breaking the binding. The original title is now obscured -- over it, someone has written "The Bible."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Remember when Indian Jones found that gold statue? It's like that right now.

Kevin carefully pulls it out. Reverently flips through it. Full of details. Explicit diagrams. Anecdotes. And atop each handwritten page is a year, indicating the date it was added.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim sniffs the pie, taking in the aroma. Then stops...as a quizzical look spreads across his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment of thought, he slides a finger into the pie. Moves it around a bit, studying the consistency.
</DIRECTION>

Then Jim becomes more curious. We can see the gears in his head start to turn. He looks down at the pie like it's... well, not a pie.

As the song ends, Oz continues just a moment more with his shtick -- a little, heartfelt vocal "scat" to tag the number. The thing is, it actually sounds really good.

On the sidelines, we see Heather has shown up. She's watching the game -- and is impressed as she watches Oz's agility and domination. Oz runs up the field, cradling the ball in his stick. A couple CENTRAL PLAYERS try to check him. Heather cringes with each impact, and is then excited to see Oz dodge his opponents.

Oz and Heather are singing with the group, at opposite ends of the room. It's a pop, contemporary arrangement of "HOW SWEET IT IS." It sounds jazzy, cool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oz looks dazed, like the wind's taken out of him. He sings along, distant. Heather, almost defiantly, sings clearer and better than ever. Oz watches her, though she never looks his way. At the bride of the song, Heather breaks into a solo. She sings beautifully. Oz is hooked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Choir Teacher halts the song.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Most students mill about, talking, generally bored. The only people who are enjoying themselves are the OBVIOUSLY DRUNK STUDENTS, slam-dancing with the obviously drunk Stifler in a corner. CHAPERONE PARENTS try to calm them down, futilely.

The band breaks into a CHEESY BALLAD. Couples lock together and sway back and forth like zombies.

Kevin and Vicky. Silently doing it. Curious looks on their faces. The look you get when your waiter delivers your food in a fancy restaurant, and you look at the creation on the plate, and secretly you're not sure if it's really what you ordered. But you don't say anything, and you just eat it.

Jim and Michelle lay on the floor, tangled in sheets and each others' clothing. Exhausted, gasping.
