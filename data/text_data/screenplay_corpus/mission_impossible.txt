INT. KIEV APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're in a large closet. JACK KIEFER, an athletic American in his late thirties wearing a headset, is wedged into a corner, staring at a television screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The television shows a surveillance view of the living room that lies outside the confines of the closet. The TV image is in black and white. JACK shifts, trying like hell to get comfortable but he's been there a while
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bare bulb shines down on the contents of a shabby hotel room. Directly under the blub a man, GENNADY KASIMOV, sits in a straight backed wooden chair in his blood-stained T- shirt. There are a couple of THUGS and a stray HOOKER in the room behind him. A legend:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KIEV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KASIMOV is sobbing. Uncontrollably. A MAN enters the room, ANATOLY, an imperious Russian in his forties, a Russian godfather. The THUGS and HOOKERS are ushered out. ANATOLY looks down at KASIMOV pitiously and urges him to go and sit by him in a chair he picks up for him. KASIMOV does as he is bid, looking gratefully up at ANATOLY. They speak in Russian which is subtitled.
</DIRECTION>
<ANATOLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kasimov, Kasimov, good that you called us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANATOLY>
<KASIMOV>
<DIRECTION>
(sobbing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't remember what happened! We were at the bar, drinking, laughing -- having fun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KASIMOV>
<DIRECTION>
ANATOLY gets up out of the chair and goes to a bed across the room. A WOMAN lies half under the sheets. She's lying in an unnatural position on the bed, and the sheets are smeared with blood. She's dead. ANATOLY lifts her eyelid.
</DIRECTION>
<KASIMOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't even know how I got here. I swear, Anatoly, I never touched her! I didn't lay a finger on her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KASIMOV>
<DIRECTION>
ANATOLY moves away from the WOMAN.

Desperately he tugs at ANATOLY'S jacket. But ANATOLY hits his hand away and smacks him around the head.
</DIRECTION>

Back on screen, ANATOLY places a hand on KASIMOV'S shoulder as if he had just anointed him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CLOSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the closet, JACK types the name into a computer and cross checks -- "MIEDIEV" comes up, then "posting/American consulate/Kiev."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK turns and nods to a WHOREHOUSE WAITRESS in costume in the closet next to him, dressed in traditional Russian tunic and virtually no bottom. She quickly leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHABBY ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We enter the room for the first time as the WAITRESS does. She's carrying a tray with a bottle of vodka and two shot glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<ANATOLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, we drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANATOLY>
<DIRECTION>
He pours them out and hands one to KASIMOV.
</DIRECTION>
<ANATOLY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To friends.

</ANATOLY>
<KASIMOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Anatoly, yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KASIMOV>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cheers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
He drinks. He blinks. Something felt funny about that. Dizzied, KASIMOV swoons and passes out on the floor. ANATOLY moves to the closet door and opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CLOSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANATOLY reaches up to his face --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--and tears away a mask of flesh. He's no middle aged Russian mobster, he's ETHAN HUNT, an American in his early thirties. He gestures to KASIMOV contemptuously. JACK hands ETHAN a hypodermic kit and he goes quickly back into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
(in English now)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get rid of this scum.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Immediately, there is activity, and PEOPLE everywhere. TWO OTHERS come into the room and carry KASIMOV out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN goes quickly to the body of the dead woman. He cheeks the pulse in her neck, shines a penlight in her eye. He strips the adrenalin kit and jabs the long needle into the dead woman's thigh. He checks her pulse again, checking a stopwatch. In about ten seconds, the woman's eyes open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLAIRE is her name, a French woman of thirty or so. She half rolls over, GROANS, and wipes some of the blood from her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did we get it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got it. On your feet.

<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to sleep. Can I sleep here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walk, just walk. Start walking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm walking.

<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ETHAN>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sleeping's better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, MEN in overalls take apart the room. The ceiling lifts right off the walls, and the walls themselves start to come down, revealing the "hotel room" to be an elaborate set in the middle of an empty warehouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK comes into the room from the closet. He hands CLAIRE her jewelry, including a watch and a wedding ring. ETHAN stops what he's doing, noticing. She looks up at him questioningly.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you all right Ethan. What's wrong with you?

</CLAIRE>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

She almost unconsciously slips the wedding ring onto her finger. ETHAN notices. He turns and SHOUTS to the room at large.

<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON WE'RE NOT OUT OF HERE YET?!

</ETHAN>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just waiting for you, tubs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
He walks across the room and out the door. CLAIRE, worried, clutches her hands together, glancing down at her wedding ring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move in on it --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
INT. JET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and come out on another wedding ring, this one on a MAN's finger. One of several he's drumming on an arm rest in the plush first class cabin of a commercial airliner. He shoves some money into his wallet, and as he does so we catch a fleeting glimpse of a photograph of CLAIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pilot's voice makes an announcement.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and gentlemen, we have leveled off at our cruising altitude of thirty-eight thousand feet-and we should be arriving in Prague right on schedule.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
A FLIGHT ATTENDANT makes her way between the seats, passing out menus.
</DIRECTION>
<FLIGHT_ATTENDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like to watch a movie Mr Rosen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLIGHT_ATTENDANT>

A passenger takes one. The ATTENDANT continues on.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like to watch a movie Mr Phelps?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLIGHT_ATTENDANT>
<DIRECTION>
The MAN with the wedding ring looks up. JIM PHELPS is in his mid-forties, good-looking, intense. He's a tired man, and not just now, it's a profound fatigue. He looks up at the ATTENDANT and smiles warmly.
</DIRECTION>
<PHELPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I prefer the theatre.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHELPS>
<DIRECTION>
A look crosses the FLIGHT ATTENDANT'S face; her tone becomes stilted.
</DIRECTION>
<FLIGHT_ATTENDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you consider the cinema of the Ukraine?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLIGHT_ATTENDANT>
<PHELPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps you'd choose one for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHELPS>
<DIRECTION>
The ATTENDANT turns and walks away. PHELPS sits back, shakes a cigarette out of a pack, and taps it nervously on the armrest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE FRONT OF THE CABIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FLIGHT ATTENDANT opens a case loaded with video 8 cassettes of feature films. She opens a panel in the top of the case and withdraws a tape hidden back there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK AT PHELPS' SEAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ATTENDANT returns with the tape and hands it to PHELPS. He takes it without a word and she moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHELPS reaches down and turns a lever on the support between his seat and the empty one beside him. He flips up a small movie screen and angles it toward himself, away from the other passengers. He puts on a headset, opens a door in the armrest, and puts the tape in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He presses play.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE TAPE,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the image of a man comes on. EUGENE KITTRIDGE is fortyish, but seems permanently stuck in the Nixon era -- horn rimmed glasses, short short haircut, rather be caught dead than tieless. But if he catches your eye, he will never, ever look away. He's seated at a desk, looking into the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
(on the tape)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, Mr. Phelps. The man you're about to see is Aleksander Golitsyn --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
The screen winks and shows an image of GOLITSYN, a burly man in his forties. The image is herky-jerky videotape, presumably taken from a concealed camera as GOLITSYN walks down a foreign street.
</DIRECTION>
<KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- a former KGB Line X officer now working the international black market selling intelligence. This morning, we learned that Golitsyn has stolen one half of a CIA NOC list, the list of our non- official cover agents working in Eastern Europe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
The screen shows an image of what such a list might look like, code names and other information scrolling by on a computer screen at high speed.
</DIRECTION>
<KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For security reasons, the NOC list is divided into two encoded halves. Golitsyn already has the cryptonym portion, which contains agent code names and targeting areas. This portion is useless unless combined with the second half -- the true name list that is kept in the CIA station in our Embassy in Prague.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
The Embassy itself comes on screen, a beautiful old building at the base of the Charles Bridge, which spans the Vltava River.
</DIRECTION>
<KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We believe Golitsyn plans to steal the true name list at an Embassy function tomorrow night. Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to obtain photographic proof of the theft, apprehend those involved, and return the stolen list. I don't have to stress the importance of this matter, Jim. We're keeping it internally black. Because of its urgency, I've already sent to Prague a team selected from your usual group.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
Still photographs come on screen, some of which we're already seen -- JACK KIEFER, CLAIRE and ETHAN.
</DIRECTION>
<KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ethan Hunt will of course be your point man, as usual. He's in Kiev; we're getting word to him now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JET - DAY

<DIRECTION>
PHELPS sits back in his seat, closes his eyes, and rubs his tired brow. KITTRIDGE himself comes back on the tape.
</DIRECTION>
<KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As always, should you or any member of your IM force be caught or killed, the Secretary will disavow all knowledge of your actions. This tape will self- destruct in five seconds. Good luck, Jim!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
PHELPS inhales deeply --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the tape in the armrest starts to smolder, sending up a plume of wispy smoke --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and PHELPS exhales, concealing the plume in a cloud of cigarette smoke.

EXT. AMERICAN EMBASSY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The American Embassy glitters beside the Vltava River. Party at the Embassy tonight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AN ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK, wearing black coveralls and slightly odd-looking eyeglasses (they're called Visco glasses), enters an elevator shaft through a small door at the base of the wall. He looks up the shaft, shining a flashlight until he finds what he's looking for --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- a gray metal box, protruding from the wall one floor up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHELPS is at a table in the safe house apartment, watching the bank of monitors HANNAH wired together earlier. The monitors are alive now, showing various views of the inside of the Embassy, where the party is going on, and one view of the elevator shaft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHELPS wearing an IMF headset and speaks into the mouthpiece.
</DIRECTION>
<PHELPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ethan. Jack's inside. Window's open by twenty-three hundred.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHELPS>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EMBASSY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the Embassy, the party is a formal, tuxedoed affair that's in full swing on the second floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SENATOR WALTZER, the man who was on TV, walks up a grand staircase, headed in. An AMERICAN DIPLOMAT in a tuxedo hurries up to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIPLOMAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you do, Senator, I'm Rand Housman, the Ambassador's aide. If I could just steer you through the reception line here --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIPLOMAT>
<DIRECTION>
The DIPLOMAT pilots the SENATOR by one arm, guiding him to a reception line at the base of the stairs to the party.
</DIRECTION>
<DIPLOMAT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Allow me to introduce Jaroslav Reid, the director of the National Gallery -- Petr Brandl, the mayor of Prague --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIPLOMAT>
<DIRECTION>
SARAH, a very attractive young American dressed in an elegant gown, steps out of the reception line and shakes hands with WALTZER.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bet you don't remember me, do you, Senator?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<SENATOR_WALTZER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I do. How are you, Miss Norman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_WALTZER>
<DIRECTION>
He leans in and kisses her on the cheek, and as he does so SARAH whispers something in his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's in pocket. Under the archway behind me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
Her tone, her words -- we realize she's on the team.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SENATOR pulls a pair of Visco glasses from his pocket (and if we didn't know the SENATOR was ETHAN before, this confirms it), puts them on, and looks up, over her shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDER AN ARCHWAY NEAR THE ENTRANCE,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALEKSANDER GOLITSYN, the Ukrainian, has just come in from outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHELPS sees the SENATOR's point of view of GOLITSYN, through the glasses, broadcast back to PHELPS' monitor. He speaks into his microphone.
</DIRECTION>
<PHELPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sarah, mark the package and go to two.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHELPS>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARAH still has the SENATOR's attention.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your advance team mentioned you'd want a tour of the facility, so I've gone ahead and set that up for you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<SENATOR_WALTZER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terrific. Let's get going.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Diplomat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you excuse us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENATOR_WALTZER>
<DIRECTION>
He slips an arm around SARAH and they walk off, not into the party, but the other way, toward a staircase that leads further into the Embassy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIPLOMAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIPLOMAT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK climbs up the elevator shaft, towards the gray metal box. He just begins to remove the cover when he hears a noise from above. He looks up and sees the elevator above him descending.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK quickly pulls himself flush against the wall. The elevator comes down adjacent to him and stops, pinning him to the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. Come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the SENATOR and SARAH pass behind the entering GOLITSYN, SARAH pulls a small bottle of perfume from her purse. But as she sprays, she points it slightly to the left, missing herself and hitting the back of GOLITSYN'S head. He never notices. They move on and down the flight of stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM PHELPS monitors the Visco views of the party. He looks to the fourth monitor and checks a view of the party, a jumpy one, as someone hurrying up stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<PHELPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hannah. He's marked. Lets go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHELPS>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a flight of stairs, HANNAH, dressed for the party and slightly out of breath, hurries up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<HANNAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	En route.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
She also has a pair of Visco glasses, which she trains on the party below. She pushes a micro switch on the side of her glasses, activating an electronic filter, which tints the lenses.
</DIRECTION>
<PHELPS>
<DIRECTION>
(O/S)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hannah, pull the shade
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(or - Hannah go to

	night vision).
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHELPS>
<DIRECTION>
HANNAH'S VISCO POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the party looks the same, but one head in the crowd stands out. That head is GOLITSYN'S, his hair a fluorescent green where SARAH sprayed it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE DENIED AREA/ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SENATOR (let's just call him ETHAN) and SARAH come down the stairs and pass a sign that says "Denied Area -- Political Attaches Only." ETHAN checks his watch. 23:00.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He nods to SARAH, they round a corner, and come to an elevator at the end of the corridor. A sign in front of it says "Out of Order." They head for it anyway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MARINE GUARD appears from behind a side door, catching them by surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Governor's in position. We have the elevator.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, can I help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- which leads directly to the Denied Area, the only limited access area in the whole facility.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
SARAH flashes an ID at the GUARD and keeps talking.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you can see. this area has both a Marine guard and video surveillance, and is strictly monitored at all times.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
She walks up to the thumbprint analyzer on the elevator bank and slides her thumb inside. The panel lights up and flashes a message -- "ACCESS DENIED." SARAH and ETHAN trade a look.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (covering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Senator, don't you have a young man on your staff named JACK?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
She tries the thumb again, Still no soap.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack? I believe we did have a young man named Jack. Not a reliable man, as I recall. Constantly late or behind in his work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Now the GUARD, noticing that Sarah's not being allowed access, comes closer to them.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, let me see that ID again!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK is still pinned to the wall by the elevator, listening to their conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<PHELPS>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack's pinned down Sarah. Should be a second. Keep dancing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHELPS>
<ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (with the Senator's southern accent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were forced to tie him to my best stallion and drag him around the barn a few times.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, the elevator moves down a floor and JACK is freed.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax your crack, Foghorn, I'm workin' on it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
He quickly opens the gray metal box, revealing a maze of circuitry. He patches in his computer, climbs on top of the elevator, and hits the keyboard, beginning to download.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LAPTOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
there's a split-screen of SARAH's thumbprint and the ID picture. JACK downloads her file into the security computer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE DENIED AREA/ELEVATOR BANK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ignoring the GUARD, SARAH turns and slides her thumb into the thumbprint analyzer once more. The panel glows, this time the message flashes --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IDENTITY CONFIRMED .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and the elevator doors slide open briskly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GUARD, surprised, now catches sight of the SENATOR.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Sorry, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
He snaps a salute. ETHAN and SARAH get into the elevator and the doors close behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK looks down at the elevator below. Through a grating, he can see them inside.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>

PHELPS moves from JACK's view of the elevator car to HANNAH's view of the party on his video monitors.

	</DIALOGUE>
</PHELPS>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EMBASSY PARTY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	He's heading to the denied area.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANNAH>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This work room is filled with combination lock filing cabinets and various computer terminals. ETHAN hands SARAH his Visco glasses and she crosses the room, placing them upside down on top of a filing cabinet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN straps on a Visco wrist monitor and tunes it in, switching several times.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Sarah)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Higher. Higher.

</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
SARAH adjusts the glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE GLASSES,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the view of the main computer terminal is upside down, but clear. Anyone sitting there will be recorded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On PHELPS' monitor, we see ETHAN, via his Visco glasses on the filing cabinet, standing next to the computer. PHELPS barks out a warning.
</DIRECTION>
<PHELPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get moving, Ethan. He's rolling to you.

In a split view, we see both sides of the elevator wall simultaneously -- on one side, JACK is lying on top of the rising elevator, on the other side, ETHAN and SARAH are waiting for it to arrive.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack. Jack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	OK. Taking Golitsyn's exit. Jack, open the doors.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EMBASSY WORK ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GOLITSYN steps off the elevator, crosses the room and slides a 3.5 computer disk into the computer in the work room. Through the Visco glasses, we can clearly see him at work, downloading the vital information.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT (BELOW ELEVATOR) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Waiting below the elevator, ETHAN takes off his jacket, starting to reverse it. He checks his Visco wrist monitor as GOLITSYN perpetrates the theft. He smiles and speaks into a microphone.

On top of the elevator, JACK has ripped open the control panel again and is frantically trying to adjust wires to get the thing to stop.

	<DIALOGUE>
	They're covering this frequency, Ethan. Cut all radio communications. Repeat. Cut all radio communications.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHELPS>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN continues to run toward the stairs to the bridge. Past CLAIRE who sits in the getaway car. He looks on his monitor and again sees PHELPS' POV. Only ominous silence. Phelps is looking back over his shoulder. The bridge is deserted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARAH follows GOLITSYN as he hurries toward the shore, where a cobblestone promenade runs along the river. He disappears into the fog at the edge of the river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STAIRS TO BRIDGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN checks his monitor again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MONITOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHELPS' point of view changes radically as his head swivels on the darkened bridge. He whirls again, looking over his shoulder and this time the barrel of a gun is visible, pointing at him and before PHELPS has a chance to react a GUNSHOT CRACKLES over the monitor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The point of view goes crazy for a moment, then over and down to a bloody hole in his own chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His head rocks again, then goes over the side of the bridge and makes the long, hard fall into the river below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STAIRS TO BRIDGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN's face goes white with shock.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	JIM!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHARLES BRIDGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He races up the rest of the stairs to the bridge but there's no sign of PHELPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN runs to the railing and looks down into the river but sees only dark, choppy waters below, now becoming obscured in the gathering fog.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and looks to the embankment. He can faintly see GOLITSYN, hurrying along the promenade. ETHAN gives chase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN runs towards the getaway car, reaching a vantage point on the top of the stairs, he can see CLAIRE'S outline, visible in the driver's seat. But as he descends the stairs --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--the car explodes and bursts into flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The force of the blast knocks ETHAN back.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	CLAIRE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
He watches the burning car in stunned silence for a moment, a stunned CROWD starts to gather.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Remembering SARAH, he rushes down the stairs towards the embankment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARAH comes out of the fog near the riverbank and sees GOLITSYN again, slowing down. A MAN comes out of the fog an seems to ask GOLITSYN for a light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARAH draws closer. Behind her, the DRUNKEN COUPLE seems to be hanging with her for some reason.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STAIRS FROM BRIDGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN continues towards the embankment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EMBANKMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARAH is almost to GOLITSYN. Suddenly, the MAN in front of GOLITSYN pulls him towards him. Sensing something wrong, SARAH quickens her pace. The MAN is now hunched over GOLITSYN, facing away from SARAH, going through GOLITSYN's pockets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure finds what it's looking for -- the disk -- and takes it. SARAH comes closer --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and the figure whirls. It brings a knife up sharply, plunges it into her chest and slinks away out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN races around the corner onto the embankment. He bursts out of the fog, just in time to see SARAH fall to her knees, over GOLITSYN's body. ETHAN sees the knife in her chest and GASPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls the knife out of SARAH, who is close to death. He looks at it -- it is a black Teflon knife with a serrated edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND ETHAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DRUNKEN COUPLE seem drunk no more. In fact, they're watching ETHAN. Through the fog and night, they see him leaning over SARAH, holding the knife in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE BODIES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARAH goes still. ETHAN lays her down, turns the other body over and sees that it is GOLITSYN. He quickly begins rummaging through his pockets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN hear police sirens and sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Prague police boat, SIREN wailing, arrives at the dock in front of the Embassy. The DRUNKEN MAN and WOMAN stop suddenly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As THREE POLICE leap off the boat and race toward the explosion, ETHAN leaps over the gate and races up the alley and out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET -- PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN unscrews the mouthpiece of a payphone receiver. He's holding a flat piece of metal with six prongs on it, a modernist cockroach. He CLICKS the cockroach into the guts of the phone's wiring, piercing it with its little prongs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He screws the mouthpiece back on, holds the phone's tongue down for a second, releases it and listens. He has a dial tone. Now he punches in a fourteen digit number he knows by heart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, a FLAT VOICE comes on the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<FLAT_VOICE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's just bring you in safely, and then we'll worry about that, okay? Were you followed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN closes his eyes. KITTRIDGE'S voice is strong and reassuring and he needs that right now.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)

</ETHAN>
<KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	No sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One hour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up. ETHAN does the same. He stares at the phone for a moment, thinking. He checks his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN steps out of the phone booth and starts down the street. Every face seems to be starring at him now, every sound is menacing. He pulls his coat in tight, shoves his hands in his pockets and walks among the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OLD TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN makes his way past the old town clock, a towering, gothic structure and into a plaza, surrounded mostly by residential buildings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Straight across from him is a glass enclosed restaurant built on the portico of an old palace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brilliantly lit up from inside, the restaurant positively shimmers, every table visible from everywhere in the plaza.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN walks in the glass front doors, right next to an enormous fish tank, part of the restaurant's exterior wall. He scans the clientele carefully -- maybe a dozen PATRONS are scattered around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EUGENE KITTRIDGE is seated at a table in the middle. He and ETHAN make eye contact. ETHAN walks to the table, a couple of quick, seemingly cursory glances around the room as he goes. KITTRIDGE has been working on a pretty good-sized lobster. He rises to greet ETHAN and they sit.
</DIRECTION>
<KITTRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't tell you how sorry I am. I know how much Jim in particular meant to you, Ethan. Personally as well as professionally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTRIDGE>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
He spots a stack of documents on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN picks them up. There's a Canadian picture bearing ETHAN photo and the name Phillipe Doucette, credit cards, driver's license, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<KITTRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Passport, visas - you know the drill. We'll work the exfiltration thru Canada, debrief you at Langley. Throw the Prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects. Follow me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTRIDGE>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I follow you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<KITTRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've lost enough agents for one night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTRIDGE>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean I've lost enough agents for one night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
KITTRIDGE seems to be at the point of saying one thing, then, carefully:
</DIRECTION>
<KITTRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You seem hell bent on blaming yourself, Ethan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTRIDGE>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who else is left?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<KITTRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I see your point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTRIDGE>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why was there another team?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<KITTRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTRIDGE>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of IMF agents. At the Embassy. Tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<KITTRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't quite follow you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTRIDGE>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's see if you can follow me around this room.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(eyes moving around the room)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The drunk Russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...The couple waltzing around me at the Embassy at 9 and 11. The waiter behind Hannah at the top of the staircase - Bowtie, 12 o'clock. The other IMF team. You're worried about me. Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
(a tight little smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. Maybe this'll save some time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
The figures around the room have grown restless. KITTRIDGE tries to indicate that it's okay. He pulls some papers out of his jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in IMF operations. We have a penetration. The other day we decoded a message on the Internet from a Czech we know as "Max."
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTRIDGE>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The arms dealer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<KITTRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. Max, it seems, has two unique gifts -- a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. This time he's gotten to someone on the inside - he's put himself in a position to buy our NOC list. An operation he referred to as "Job 314". The job he thought Golitsyn was doing tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTRIDGE>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the list Golitsyn stole was a decoy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<KITTRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Correct the actual list is safe at Langley. "Golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTRIDGE>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This whole operation was a molehunt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<KITTRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, the mole's deep inside. And -- like you said. You survived.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN stares at him levelly.
</DIRECTION>
<KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to show you something, Ethan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
He now shoves the papers across the table. They're xeroxed copies of a Wisconsin bank account in the name of DONALD and MARGARET ETHAN HUNT. It shows a balance of $127, 000.
</DIRECTION>
<KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub-chapter S and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. Dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account -- dying slowly in America after all, can be a very expensive proposition Ethan. So, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTRIDGE>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and I wash your mouth out with soap - you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ethan, I can understand you're very upset.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTRIDGE>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN takes something from his jacket pocket. While KITTRIDGE talks, ETHAN unwraps whatever is in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<KITTRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, enough is enough Hunt. You've bribed, cajoled, killed - and relied on intimate loyalties to get away with it. You're determined to shake hands with the devil and I'm going to make sure you do it in hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
We see what ETHAN holds in his hand -- it's the piece of bubble gum, half red, half green. He squeezes the gum, mushing the two sides together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN lashes out, swatting KITTRIDGE'S glass of wine off the table in one quick motion. As he does, he hurls the piece of gum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Diners look up, startled at the sound of the breaking wine glass. KITTRIDGE follows the trajectory of the glass --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and sees the piece of gum, stuck to the tank. His eyes widen. KA BOOM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tiny piece of plastique explodes, SHATTERING the fish tank. A hundred gallons of water flow over the MAN and WOMAN, knocking them to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the same time, ETHAN bolts for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OLD TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN races out of the restaurant and takes off, into the deserted square.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAFE HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. ETHAN enters the darkened entry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAFE HOUSE STAIRWELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN glances up at the stairwell. Naked light bulbs illuminate the way up. He slips off his jacket and shirt, then puts his jacket back on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAFE HOUSE STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN unscrews a bulb. He crushes the bulb in his shirt and scatters the glass fragments on the steps. He climbs to the next bulb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAFE HOUSE - DOORWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the now-darkened door to the apartment, there's the soft sound of another bulb being POPPED in cloth, glass fragments dropping and ETHAN'S at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the darkened safe house, ETHAN goes to a vase with flowers, picks it up and unscrews the bottom, retrieving a Sig Sauer automatic. He moves through the rooms, checking them as he goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAFE HOUSE BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN checks the shower, then goes to his shaving kit, pulling out a shaving cream can and a hairspray can. He unscrews the bottoms, retrieving cash in various denominations from various countries and a couple of passports.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he pockets them, he catches sight of himself in the mirror. He's a mess. He splashes water on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAFE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN greedily tears the cap off a bottle of mineral water and proceeds to guzzle it as if he was dying of thirst.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes back into the living room. Still drinking, he notices flickering lights on the other side of the room, the static from the four monitors PHELPS was watching. One by one, he switches them off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LAPTOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK had been using lies closed at his abandoned desk. ETHAN wakes it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The computer emits a DIAL TONE, then STATIC as it hits its connection. It prompts ETHAN along:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

The computer replies:

ETHAN tries again:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
max.com .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The answer:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEARCH STRING NOT FOUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries a few more, quickly -- "job," "jobs," "joblist.com," but nothing comes up. He tries something else -- "scroll usenet groups."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The computer scrolls names of bulletin boards at a dizzying speed, by the hundreds. That's not going anywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN pauses, slaking his bottomless thirst and trying to figure out what permutation of "job 314" he should add to the others on his computer screen. He MUMBLES.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Job three fourteen. Job --

<DIRECTION>
(a realization, the Biblical pronunciation)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Job!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
He rummages around on the desk, checks the bookshelf and finds a Gideon Bible. He turns to Job 3:14 and reads the Bible passage "Kings and Counsellors..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He thinks for another moment, then punches back into the Internet and under the command "Select Usenet Group" he types:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BIBLE.

The computer replies:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
126 ENTRIES FOUND, SPECIFY GROUP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOK OF JOB.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The computer presents a multi-colored screen of religious icons and artwork with an accompanying message:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WELCOME TO THE BOOK OF JOB DISCUSSION GROUP. WHICH CHAPTER AND VERSE DO YOU WISH TO POST YOUR ENTRY UNDER?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN types his answer "Job 3:14" and the screen presents a "stickie" for him to write his message on. He does:
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Max -- Goods tainted. Consider extremely hazardous. DO NOT USE. Fate will be that of kings and counsellors who built for themselves palaces now lying in ruins. Must meet to discuss a.s.a.p.

</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A rhythmic CRUNCHING sound and from the darkness on the other side of the room, PHELPS staggers toward him, wet and muddy, his middle a hopelessly bloody mess. He looks like he's dying on his feet. ETHAN freezes, appalled.
</DIRECTION>
<PHELPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ethan, what are you doing?

ETHAN reaches out to grab PHELPS but can't seem to touch him. PHELPS suddenly vanishes into thin air, ETHAN awakens from the dream and finds himself leaping to his feet, gun cocked and pointed at --

He grabs a sleeve and literally tears the coat off her, half- spinning her around. The coat hits the floor like a dead body. CLAIRE'S instinctive move is to cover her chest.

CLAIRE begins to shiver. ETHAN circles her, runs his hand cursorily across her body. It accentuates CLAIRE'S shivering.

INT. SAFE HOUSE - LATER THE SAME NIGHT

ETHAN sits in front of the computer, staring blankly at it, still waiting for a response. CLAIRE sitting on the end of the bed. Dawn approaches, it's very, very quiet.

	Why haven't they brought us in yet?

</CLAIRE>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been disavowed. They think I killed Jim and everyone else. Somehow a hundred thousand dollars found its way into my parents' bank account. Kittridge assumes I'm a mole they've been tracing and I've been in the employ of an arms dealer, Max, for the last two years, to get him our NOC list.

</CLAIRE>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to get it for him. Whoever the mole is, I think goes by the name of Job, at least part of the time. 1 can't find him, but if he knows 1 have the NOC list, he'll find me.

The computer blinks and makes a noise - ETHAN goes to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE COMPUTER SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blinking -- "MESSAGE WAITING." ETHAN hurries over and clicks on the message box. The screen blinks and the message shows up:

ETHAN arrives at the bus stop outside the Savoy Arcade. A MAN in a black wind-breaker sits on the bench, his back to ETHAN.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, could I trouble you for a match?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>

Without turning, the MAN offers up a box of matches. As ETHAN takes them, TWO MEN from behind take him by either arm and escort him into a car which has just pulled up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN slides into the back seat, between the TWO MEN. MATTHIAS, the man on the left, holds up a black hood. He extends it to ETHAN, who doesn't take it.

Reluctantly, Ethan pulls the hood over his head and the car takes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black hood still on his head, ETHAN has trouble sitting upright. He's before a desk, in an apartment somewhere in the city -- it's impossible to tell where, as the blinds are drawn. The place is roomy and lavishly furnished -- expensive Oriental rugs, well-chosen objects of art.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somewhere down the block, a dog BARKS, steadily, every few seconds. In the hallway outside the apartment door, someone is VACUUMING. MATTHIAS and the OTHER MAN are nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought I was going to see Max.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<MATTHIAS>

	I don't communicate very well through a shroud.

</MAX>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need one hundred thousand dollars.

</ETHAN>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? And you thought if you simply showed up I might give it to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not? You gave Job a hundred and twenty five thousand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The penny drops. You are not Job. Yes, Job is not given to quoting Scripture in his communications. And there was its tone -- aggressive but playful. Job is not playful. So you're something of a paradox.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That depends.

</ETHAN>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On what?

</ETHAN>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why should I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I can deliver the actual NOC list. The one you have is not only worthless, it's certain to be equipped with a homing device to pinpoint your exact location.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's easy to say the disk is worthless when you say I can't look at the information and see if it's worthless. Not a tenable position, sir.

	I can't just hack my way inside. There's no modem access to the mainframe, it's in a stand-alone. I'd have to be physically at the terminal.

INT. CIA CORRIDOR/GUARD STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While ETHAN talks, we see what he's referring to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CIA ANALYST carrying a glass of iced tea and several file folders walks down a long corridor in the headquarters building. He comes to an impressive guard station and rests his chin on a strange-looking optometric device.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They missed nothing in that room. Even the vents have laser nets over them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Apparently the device approves and the ANALYST is buzzed into a "RESTRICTED" area of the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIA COMPUTER ANTEROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ANALYST reaches a curtained area. He shoves the curtain aside and comes to a large, vaulted door. He slides a card- key into a slot, leaves it there and slides a second card-key into the slot beneath it.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Inside, there are three countermeasure systems that can only be deactivated by authorized entry. Which we won't have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
A panel next to the ANALYST says "INTRUSION COUNTERMEASURES OFF." The ANALYST next spins a three digit combination code, CHUNKS the door open and steps into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the secured terminal room. It's not large but it's impressive. A single terminal is bolted into the middle of the floor and the glass and tile walls of the room overlook computer storage towers.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The first system is sound-sensitive, anything above a whisper sets it off. The second system is on the floor and pressure-sensitive --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
The ANALYST closes the vault door behind him and walks across the room. As he walks, the floor tiles light up under his feet, turning off again when he lifts the weight from them.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--and the third detects any increase in temperature. Even the body heat of an unauthorized person in the room will trigger it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
A thermometer on the wall shows the temperature is 72 degrees. The ANALYST sets his glass down, boots up the computer, and starts entering data from the file folders.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All three systems are state of the art.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
The ANALYST turns and takes a sip of his iced tea. A drop of condensation runs down the glass and hits the floor. When it makes contact, the floor panel lights up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN STATEROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other team members gathered around the table look at ETHAN skeptically.
</DIRECTION>
<LUTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you really think we can do this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUTHER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The middle of the night and the train is dark. The team members come out of the stateroom to go to bed -- KRIEGER heads in one direction, ETHAN and CLAIRE in the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN stops. His attention is drawn to the car ahead. There is a window in the door to the car and he looks through it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN'S P.O.V. THRU WINDOW (INT. BUSINESS CAR - NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ethan sees the business car, a plush space for busy executives to get some work done on the train. There are laptops, cellular phones, desks that fold out in front of spacious seats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FEMALE EXECUTIVE, forty or so, is seated at one of the desks, typing away into her laptop.

INT. TRAIN - CLAIRE'S COMPARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN and CLAIRE enter, ETHAN closing the compartment door. He pulls an envelope from his jacket and holds it out to her. She takes it, waits.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's cash. And a second passport. If anything goes wrong when we're inside, if you sense even the slightest deviation don't look over your shoulder, you walk away - you hear me? Just walk away.

<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about me - Jim called an abort - I didn't comply. I lost the team. I just need you to be safe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
CLAIRE's coolness causes ETHAN to hesitate just enough to take it in.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish I'd never laid eyes on you..
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
And they're suddenly, violently in each others arms, kissing and half-falling onto the converted bed. She suddenly resists. He senses it and pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
He rises and goes to the door. He's got his hand on the knob when CLAIRE wraps her arms around him from behind, turns him to her and kisses him, deeply. This time they sink slowly to the bed.

Three FIREMEN stomp into the main lobby of the CIA headquarters building. ETHAN and KRIEGER are among them, in firemen's jumpsuits, carrying packs of equipment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN takes a breath as they cross to the GUARD's desk. He looks up, above him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Etched into the top of one wall are the words "AND YE SHALL KNOW THE TRUTH AND THE TRUTH SHALL MAKE YOU FREE."

They reach the GUARD. ETHAN, who wears Visco glasses, elbows to the front of the group and takes charge.

One fire truck is parked slightly behind the others in the parking area of the headquarters building. Second truck roars past. LUTHER watches it go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LUTHER is in the belly of the fire truck with a ton of equipment -- three laptops, a bundle of phone cable, a mini- dish antenna, a cellular phone, several thick phone company manuals with names like "COSMOS" and "SWITCHED ACCESS SERVICE."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One laptop serves as a Visco monitor, showing a video image in which LUTHER watches ETHAN'S point of view of the stubborn GUARD, who's finishing his sentence.

INT. CIA STORAGE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLAIRE quickly slips out of her fireman's jumpsuit, revealing a business suit underneath. She clips an ID tag to her breast pocket.

She pulls a piece of paper from her pocket, a computer printout of a man's ID photo. She stares at the face, studying it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIA CAFETERIA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLAIRE, carrying a cup of coffee and a muffin, looks for a spot among the tables in the cafeteria of the headquarters building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sees a MAN sitting alone, reading a newspaper. It's the man whose picture she looked at in the storage room. She sits next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up and gives her an acknowledging half smile, then goes back to his paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to pick up the paper and in the moment he is facing the other way, CLAIRE pulls out a small vial resembling a perfume sampler. She dumps the clear liquid contents into his coffee. He turns back and hands her part of the paper. CLAIRE smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COFFEE MAN drinks up. CLAIRE stares at his shoulder strangely. He notices.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches out and flicks something off his shoulder blade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles. But she hasn't flicked something off his shoulder blade, she's flicked something onto it -- a little piece of shiny gray metallic tape. CLAIRE leaves the table. COFFEE MAN drinks up and leaves the table.

</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
The GUARD moves towards ETHAN, who kicks back at him, pushing him back to KRIEGER, who zaps the GUARD on the back of the neck. He twitches and slumps to the ground, unconscious. KRIEGER quickly grabs him around the neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN turns. Holding the GUARD'S head with one hand, KRIEGER pulls a stiletto from the sheath in the back of his belt with the other. He jabs it toward the base of the GUARD'S skull -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- but ETHAN is on him in a flash. He grabs KRIEGER's knife arm shoving it up against the wall. Staring into KRIEGER'S face in warning.

INT. VERTICAL DUCT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Guard is tied up, lying on the floor of the Service Area Room. ETHAN and KRIEGER are below the open vent into the duct system.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first climb is straight up. KRIEGER cups his hands under ETHAN'S foot and lifts him up into the duct as he starts to climb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

ETHAN and KRIEGER crawl quickly through the ducts, moving horizontally now. They reach a juncture and turn right.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN and KRIEGER reach a ventilator shaft in the duct. A laser net protects the ventilator, red shafts of light cris- crossing every which way. ETHAN looks down, through the net.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He can see the computer room below and the top of the TECHNICIAN'S head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DUCT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the duct, ETHAN signals to KRIEGER, making a triangle of his hands. KRIEGER wriggles forward and hands him a multi- sided, pyramid shaped glass object.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN raises the pyramid and intercepts a portion of one of the laser net's beams. The pyramid glows and we realise what it is -- a prism.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The laser beam now captive in the prism, ETHAN carefully moves it out of the centre of the ventilator shaft and directs it toward another prism, clearing a path through the shaft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up in the ceiling above it, one of the screws starts to move in the ventilator shaft, unscrewing. When it appears ready to drop out, a thin strip of metal snakes out from between the bars of the shaft and edges up next to the screw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The screw drops out of its hole but it doesn't drop to the floor, it zips over and clings to the side of the metal strip with a gentle CLICK, as to a magnet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The screw is pulled up, through the shaft. Now the whole shaft moves, down, into the room, held by a hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It turns sideways and is pulled up, into the duct.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A rubber tube snakes down, through the hole, coming to a stop near the thermostat, which says it's seventy-two degrees. A gentle WHOOSH is audible as frosty air blows through the tube, cooling the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TECHNICIAN defaults the security systems outside the terminal room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is eerily still in the locked-down computer room we saw earlier. No-one is there, there's not a sound but for the gentle HUM of the computer as it waits to be put to use.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now ETHAN's head descends slowly into the room, his hair falling in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At first it seems he's just poking his head in for a look, but he keeps coming and coming -- first his head, then shoulders, then waist, then knees, and finally we see his ankles and understand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is lowered to stop in front of the thermometer and temperature read out on the computer. Suddenly ETHAN is lifted back up quickly to hang at ceiling height above the computer as the ANALYST enters the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TECHNICIAN crosses to the computer and sits down, a stack of work to his right.

<DIRECTION>
The TECHNICIAN is working away at the computer. He pauses and wipes some sweat from his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a strange look on his face, the TECHNICIAN looks up. It's almost as if he senses ETHAN above him but instead --
</DIRECTION>
<TECHNICIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TECHNICIAN>
<DIRECTION>
-- he vomits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches for the garbage can and upchucks again. Puzzled, sick and feeling another wave coming on, he drags himself to his feet, hauls himself across the room and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIA - COMPUTER ANTEROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Even sick, the TECHNICIAN still thinks to re-activate the alarm systems with a card-key. They HUM back to life efficiently, a light flashing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTRUSION COUNTERMEASURES ON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIA COMPUTER ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN descends again, slowly but steadily, until he is at the same height as the computer terminal to hang horizontally in front of the computer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A heavy velcro strap binds his ankles together, secured by a rope that leads up into the ventilator shaft and through the set of pulleys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DUCT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KRIEGER holds the rope, his jaw clenched, sweat breaking out on his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unfortunately, he's three feet away from it. He stretches his arms but can't reach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He blinks, unable to believe this. He curls himself into a situp and looks up, into the shaft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DUCT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KRIEGER sees the predicament.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIA - COMPUTER ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN gestures to him, pointing to the floor. Slowly, KRIEGER drops him another few feet. Now ETHAN's lower than the terminal and still three feet away from it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He closes his eyes, summoning his strength and does another situp, bringing himself up right in front of the terminal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FIRE TRUCK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the fire truck, LUTHER, who is watching on the Visco monitor, turns his head upside down to get a look at what ETHAN sees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He cups his hands around the microphone of his headset and begins to whisper. We hear only the moist, airy sound of his breath, not the words.
</DIRECTION>

ETHAN's ear receiver WHISPERS ever-so-slightly. He reaches out, to the upside down keyboard, cranes his head to see it and starts typing, softly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The computer HUMS, activated. ETHAN unbuttons his pocket, withdraws a 3.5 disk and slides it gently into the floppy drive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The computer accepts it with a soft WHIR. ETHAN winces, even that soft sound is deafening in these circumstances.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But no alarms go off.

It's a rat. KRIEGER stares. The rat stares back. Neither moves. Puzzled by KRIEGER'S lack of response, the rat crawls forward, inquisitive.

The 3.5 disk is ejected from the floppy drive. ETHAN pockets it and signals to be raised.

Slowly, his body starts to move up. As it does, a bead of sweat rolls down his nose, balling at the tip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN ignores it. But below him, he sees the floor tiles, four of them lit up under the wheels of the chair at the computer terminal.
</DIRECTION>

His eyes widen as he realizes something --

This barely furnished flat is as nondescript as the row of buildings it's in. ETHAN hurriedly digs through an overnight bag until he finds what he's looking for -- the now-battered bible he's used to contact Max. He flips through the pages and crosses the room to his laptop, which is powered up and waiting on the tiny desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LUTHER, alone in a chair across the room. is seriously preoccupied. KRIEGER is sprawled-on a ratty sofa, hoisting a lager and watching CNN.

ETHAN ignores him, working. His computer jams with static as it connects to a BBS. The screen blinks and displays the familiar Bible group service through which he's contacted Max. When it asks him which chapter and verse for the posting, ETHAN flicks through the Bible, looking for the next code. He begins to type.

--the pale, weary, ghostlike figure of a man standing just inches in front of him. Startled, ETHAN looks up, but what he sees shakes him to the core.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man is JIM PHELPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN SHOUTS and almost falls back into the phone booth. PHELPS leans against the door of the booth and smiles weakly.
</DIRECTION>
<PHELPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a hard man to catch up with.
	</DIALOGUE>

PHELPS falls towards ETHAN. ETHAN tries to speak, but can't even form words.

INT - RAILWAY STATION CAFE (DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN and PHELPS opposite one another in a booth, PHELPS looking clammy and listing to one side. But the banter seems friendly and very quick - two friends and close colleagues able to follow one another's reasoning easily, finishing each other's sentences:
</DIRECTION>
<PHELPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	..the next day I managed to drag myself to the safe house, must've just missed you..anyway, I checked our aliases.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHELPS>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	- and picked us up in the States -
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<PHELPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	- but you left before I could get there and I could check just so many places..
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHELPS>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, smaller countries don't computerize customs records -
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<PHELPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	- so I watched Europe. Once you showed up in England..it was easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHELPS>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You knew I liked the rentals at Liverpool Street.
	</DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</PHELPS>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember..
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
PHELPS smiles warmly, has to steady himself to maintain an upright position. He opens a medicine bottle and takes the pain killers.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jim, who do you think you're kidding? A doctor's gotta look at that. You can't sit up straight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<PHELPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can sit up straight. I just can't..sit up straight very well. It's not important! I saw who shot me. Ethan, I saw the mole. It was Kittridge.

A reprise of PHELPS'S narrative only now ETHAN'S telling it and camera is showing the events as ETHAN sees they actually happened.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN_VO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	- first he took care of Jack in the elevator -

</ETHAN_VO>
<DIRECTION>
At the Embassy PHELPS sends the elevator to the top of the building, watching it go and crush Kiefer.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN_VO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	- he shot you on the bridge -
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN_VO>
<DIRECTION>
On the Charles bridge PHELPS using the Visco glasses aims the gun toward them, fires, cants the glasses and tosses them into the Vltava River.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN_VO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	- he must have had back up take out Golitsyn and Sarah at the fence..
	</DIALOGUE>

There on the embankment, in the night and fog, it is KRIEGER who takes out GOLITSYN and SARAH thru the fence..

	How did he do Hannah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN_VO>
<DIRECTION>
Here it is CLAIRE with back to camera who presses the detonator and turns dreamily to face it, the explosion brilliant behind her...

ETHAN looking intently at him.

<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, Jim? Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Awkward moment.
</DIRECTION>
<PHELPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	..when you think about it, Ethan, it was inevitable..no more Cold War. No more secrets you keep from everyone but yourself, operations you answer to no one but yourself. Then one morning you wake up and find out the President of the United States is running the country - without your permission. The son-of-a- bitch! How dare he? You realize it's over, you're an obsolete piece of hardware not worth upgrading, you've got a lousy marriage and sixty-two grand a year. Kittridge, we'll go after that no good son-of-a-bitch, big time!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHELPS>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't have to, Jim. He'll come after us.

<PHELPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going to make him do that?

</ETHAN>
<PHELPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was sitting in a cafe waiting for you and suddenly there she was, standing in the rain just outside the safe house..alive and beautiful..and thinking I'm dead and gone. God knows what she's had to do forget about me to keep going and get the job done, I..
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHELPS>
<DIRECTION>
PHELPS breaks off abruptly. Apparently some inner struggle over this threatens to overwhelm him. Then, controlling it:
</DIRECTION>
<PHELPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	- no. She can't know about me. No one can. Not til this is over. There's too much at stake, Ethan.
	</DIALOGUE>

	You're probably right.

INT. LONDON SAFE HOUSE - CLAIRE'S ROOM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The door to CLAIRE'S room in the safe house opens, throwing a shaft of light over her form. ETHAN creeps in and closes the door behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is approximately one a.m. . CLAIRE is huddled in the corner. ETHAN enters and stands looking at her.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. PRIVATE HELIPAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly it's bright, broad daylight, so bright it hurts our eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KITTRIDGE and BARNES step off a military helicopter, blinking at the sunlight and hurry down the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO AGENTS immediately flank KITTRIDGE at the bottom and fall into step alongside, ready to brief him. One of them holds out a small package with "for Job" written on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KITTRIDGE looks at him. He rips it open. A note inside simply says:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TGV. LONDON TERMINUS. Noon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KITTRIDGE looks at his watch. It's ten to twelve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he reads the note, something else falls out of the envelope and CLUNKS to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He bends over, picks it up, and looks at it. Cradled in his hand, we can't see what it is. But to him, it's very interesting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He steps up his pace, headed for the car.
</DIRECTION>
<KITTRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>

The sleek front power car, looking like the nose of an SST, gets its 25,000 volt charge from the overhead catenary.
</DIRECTION>

The rear power car gets its jolt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TGV starts to move, pulling out of the station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The business car is similar to the one ETHAN saw on the first train they look across Europe. It's crowded, maybe THIRTY MEN and WOMEN in suits, most of them already immersed in work on their laptops or talking on their cellular phones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One such woman is MAX in her seat, number 27. MATTHIAS and the OTHER MAN, last seen dropping off ETHAN in Prague, sit across from her, her laptop is on the table next to her, in her briefcase.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. REAR CAR - MOVING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN puts a cellular phone and a radio/cassette machine on the bunk-bed. We only see his hands as he proceeds to take the parts of a pistol out of the cassette machine and assemble a wicked-looking pistol from the seemingly innocuous electrical parts inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUSINESS CAR - MOVING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAX is reading the Financial Times. MATTHIAS is looking out of the window. A cellular phone rings inside MAX's briefcase in front of MATTHIAS. MATTHIAS takes the phone out.

<MATTHIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes...

	<DIALOGUE>
	My apologies Max. Couldn't be helped. There's a piece of black cloth under your seat. Tear it away and you'll find the disk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
MAX reaches down and does as instructed, finding the computer disk as promised. She hands it to Matthias who strips off the velcro covering and slots it into the drive next to the computer in the briefcase. He boots it up quickly and turns the briefcase containing the computer toward MAX for her to see.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One half of the screen, with the heading "CRYPTONYM AND OPERATIONAL SPECS" is already jammed with information. The blank second half of the screen acquires the title "TRUE NAME," and information starts filling itself in rapidly -- names, addresses, identities.

As the two sides match up, a legend flashes:

KITTRIDGE and BARNES move through the second class car. They turn around and start working their way back again.

At the front, CLAIRE is getting desperate. A LARGE MAN passes through the door behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The LARGE MAN continues back, nearing KITTRIDGE and BARNES, who are forced to step into empty seats on the side in order to make room for him to pass. As they move by him, their vision is momentarily blocked --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and CLAIRE gets up to follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She follows to the rear of the car and she passes through the door and out of the car, after KITTRIDGE and BARNES talk in doorway.
</DIRECTION>

PHELPS shoots CLAIRE. Struggle between PHELPS and ETHAN. The gun is lost. PHELPS beats ETHAN to the ground. His watch alarm beeps rapidly. He turns, goes up the stairs and...

ETHAN goes to CLAIRE.

CLAIRE dies. ETHAN looks to ladder hatch and climbs ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REAR CAR - ENGINEER'S SECTION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHELPS climbs up a ladder past an inert engineer slumped over the control panel -- an obvious earlier victim of PHELPS. PHELPS puts on a pair of clear goggles, reaches a trap door and climbs through it --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- halfway out onto the roof of the train. He reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a suction cup with a handle on the end of it. He SMACKS the suction cup down on the roof and pulls himself the rest of the way out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls out a second suction cup and SMACKS it down on the smooth surface of the train.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now for the tough part. Using the suction cups, PHELPS slowly pulls himself forward, a foot at a time, pulling and replanting the cups as he goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drags himself over the length of the final car, to the back of the train, where the rear engine slants off sharply, a window for the ENGINEER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Half kneeling on the roof, PHELPS pulls out the clip from his belt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up, scanning the sky behind the train. From out of the fog, a helicopter approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHELPS turns and looks ahead, in the direction the train is going. In the distance, he can see the chunnel approaching the tunnel under the English Channel. His eyes widen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KRIEGER is at the controls. He sees the approaching tunnel as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHELPS crawls like hell to get into position. Looking up, he sees KRIEGER pointing frantically behind him. PHELPS turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN is climbing out the trap door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cable and hook swing down from the helicopter, almost touching the roof of the train. PHELPS crawls closer to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN, behind him, is in a far more precarious position. Without goggles or suction cups, he has to use his fingers to grab small holes on the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is flipped over by the wind, ending up facing the other way. Loses his grip and is blown backwards over the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KRIEGER sees the Chunnel entrance approaching. He gestures to PHELPS and tries to move the cable closer to him, passing over PHELPS and then back to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHELPS grabs the cable and is about to hook the cable onto his belt, ETHAN slides into him and they both crash onto the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN grabs the cable out of PHELPS hand and clips it onto the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHELPS and ETHAN struggle, but they are hurtling dangerously closer to the chunnel entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're now right on top of the chunnel entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KRIEGER sees the tunnel, only seconds away now. He paws at the controls, jerking back desperately on a certain lever.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHELPS kicks ETHAN and he falls off the far side of the train. PHELPS falls off the near side and holding onto the strap manages to pull himself back on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- The train ZOOMS into the tunnel --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- AND THE HELICOPTER ROARS RIGHT IN BEHIND IT!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUSINESS CAR/TUNNEL - MOVING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the train roars into the tunnel, the business car goes nearly dark and the message on MAX'S computer screen changes one last time. This time it says:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CONNECTION TERMINATED. TRANSFER LOST.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAX'S face falls.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REAR CAR/ENGINEER'S SECTION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another CONDUCTOR races into the power car, past his inert companion, and is shocked to see the copter right behind the train. He grabs a radio and SCREAMS into it.
</DIRECTION>
<CONDUCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, it's IN the tunnel!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONDUCTOR>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop the train!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<CONDUCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll crash into us! Accelerate, accelerate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONDUCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN/TUNNEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment, we see no one. No ETHAN. No PHELPS. Moving around to the other end of the car, we see where they've gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're dangling from either side of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHELPS paws for one of the suction cups and pulls himself back onto the roof of the train. ETHAN reaches for the other cup.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The helicopter, fortunate that this tunnel is double track and barely wide enough to accomodate it, pursues, KRIEGER pushing it up to full speed again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But it can't lift up high enough to go completely over the train.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOF OF TRAIN/TUNNEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHELPS, nearing the back, manoeuvers himself to the windshield of the rear power car, trying to grab the skid of KRIEGER'S copter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't see what's headed toward him, coming from the other direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another train.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the last moment, PHELPS notices the reflection of the oncoming train in the windshield and swings back onto the roof of his train, barely avoiding getting creamed by it as it blows by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The helicopter avoids the oncoming train too -- and PHELPS misses the skid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KRIEGER tips the front of the copter, trying to decapitate ETHAN with the rotor. PHELPS jumps onto the skid, but the copter pitches so far forward the blade hits the top of the tunnel. SPARKS and chunks of cement fly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KRIEGER levels the chopper quickly. ETHAN uses the moment to leap from the train onto the other helicopter skid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHELPS and ETHAN now hang on the skids, facing one another. Crouching on the skid, ETHAN digs in his pocket and pulls out --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- a red and green piece of bubble gum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHELPS sees it and SCREAMS at KRIEGER, who scrambles frantically for his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Red light, green light. Asta Lasagna mother fucker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ETHAN>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN mashes the red into the green, slaps the gum onto the copter's underbelly and turns away from it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHELPS kicks vainly at the gum, SCREAMING --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- but the gum EXPLODES. The force of the blast rockets ETHAN forward, he lands on the train's windshield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The helicopter whirls and BASHES into the tunnel, veers wildly, then pitches forward and down, smashing PHELPS under the skid and EXPLODING in a giant fireball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN, stuck on the windshield, can only watch as the wreckage of the copter tumbles down the train towards him. It stops just short of him, with its bent and broken rotor blade barely missing his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ETHAN lays his head against the windshield glass, utterly drained.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUSINESS CAR/TUNNEL - MOVING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KITTRIDGE comes back into the business car and is joined by BARNES. LUTHER, only slightly bruised, stands up next to them and gestures to MAX and her laptop.
</DIRECTION>
<LUTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think this is what you're looking for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUTHER>
<DIRECTION>
MAX looks up, stunned. KITTRIDGE leans over and peers at her screen. He just smiles and sits down next to her, content to wait for her to speak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she finally does, she's almost charming.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lawyers will have a field day with this. Entrapment, jurisdictional conflicts --

KITTRIDGE leans closer to her and lowers his voice, just as friendly.

EXT. LONDON PUB - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LUTHER sits on a high stool, his PowerBook next to him, while he sips a beer. A television screen is featuring follow-up coverage of yesterday's dramatic helicopter-train wreck in the chunnel. Aside from emphasizing that it was the work of a lone, crazed character in a helicopter who was killed in the crash, there are comments about how miraculous it was there were no other fatalaties. There are intermittent sounds of aircraft taking off and landing, announcements of arrivals and departures. ETHAN into shot. He sits beside LUTHER.
</DIRECTION>
<LUTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>

<LUTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. They want me back in so I won't break in! They still can't figure out how we did it.

<ETHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't tell 'em at the debriefing?

	Well, Luther - if it makes you feel any better I'll always think of you that way.

The two men understand one another and LUTHER will say no more. The two exchange slight gestures of farewell and in a moment ETHAN disappears from the bar, leaving a contemplative LUTHER looking after him.
