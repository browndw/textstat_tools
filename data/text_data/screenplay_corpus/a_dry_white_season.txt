:SC: EXT. DAN PIENAAR SECONDARY SCHOOL FOR BOYS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dan Pienaar school is a typical Johannesburg Afrikaan school. The students are mainly from middle-class families. School athletics are in progress. The stu- dents, in their smart school uniforms, are cheering enthusiastically a relay race on the immaculately-kept sports ground. GORDON NGUBENE, a 47-years-old African laborer is work- ing in the school garden. A few feet away is his 15- years-old son JONATHAN leaning against a wall watching the games. BEN DU TOIT, a 50-year-old Afrikaaner history teacher, is enthusiastically cheering his son JOHAN, a 15-years-old, who is leading neck-and-neck with another boy in the last leg of the race. The excitement increases as they approach the tape. Ben is beside himself, egging his son with shouts. The young teacher, VIVIERS, standing next to Ben, is shouting "come on Johan," and slapping the father on the back. Johan breasts the tape just ahead of the other boy. The ground is invaded by boys running to congratulate Johan. Ben hurries towards his happy but exhausted son; the proud father pushing his way through the animated boys. As he reaches Johan he pats him on the back.

	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
They walk happily towards the school buildings in conver- sation, Johan being slapped on the back by friends. Ben stops to talk to Gordon who jumps to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be expecting you. There isn't much to do, only weeding the marigolds and watering the lawn and flowers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll be there, Mr. Ben'sir, Jonathan come to help me.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you both later.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon returns to his work a little distance further. A group of students are laughing and pushing each other boisterously. As they near Jonathan, two nudge each other and giggle. Then, one of them trips Jonathan. He falls to the ground and jumps up aggressively, about to attack the boy. Gordon shouts "Jonathan." The headmaster, MRS. CLOETE, aged 65 years, has observed the incident, but takes no action.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jonathan stands panting with rage. He suddenly strides away towards the gate in a rage.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting angrily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	U ya phi?

:SC: EXT. SOWETO BEER HALL - AFTERNOON The beer hall is a large complex with a drinking area with long rows of low benches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Men sit drinking African beer in one-half and one gallon plastics containers. The place buzzes with noise. Several people are touting wares for sale. Suddenly a group of about twenty youths walks into the drinking area, obviously to cause trouble. The LEADER starts to address the clients.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your children are starving and you are drinking. We demand freedom and our fathers are drunk. We ask you to boycott these beer halls. Revolution and drink don't work together!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
A large MAN WITH SIDEBURNS, obviously drunk, stands up, a stick in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_WITH_SIDEBURNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since when do children talk like this to their fathers? They need thrashing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The man and several others advance on the boys. The boys run into the serving area, close the doors and start breaking up the place. Two police Land Rovers SCREECH to a halt outside. The boys run out through a side en- trance. They are chased by the police who are black. Jonathan and his best friend Wellington, also 15 years, are walking towards the beer hall when the boys come running out chased by the police. It is prudent for them to run down the street. The boys and police are bearing down on them. Their escape is cut off by the apperance of another police Land Rover. Two policemen, two blacks and two whites join in the capture. Jonathan, Wellington and about ten of the boys are arrested. As they are hundled into the vehicle, they protest their innocence without success and are driven away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SOWETO POLICE STATION - CHARGE OFFICE - AFTERNOON The charge office is sparcely furnished with a long bench along a wall. There is a reception counter with Sgt: Van Zyl in charge. The boys are lined up against a wall. The sergeant stands with a tall blond man with a scar on his chin, CAPTAIN STOLZ.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sergeant reads out a name and looks at Stolz; if he nods the boy stands aside. After this ritual, the ones that Stolz has chosen are marched to a waiting police van and driven away. The others are taken to the cells at the police station, these include Jonathan and Wellington.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DUTCH REFORM CHURCH - DAY The MUSIC STOPS. The doors open. The 40 years-old- minister Bester comes to the door, then stands and greets his parishioners as they file out of the church. Amongst them, Ben Du Toit -- his wife, SUSAN, a clean- cut, immaculate, "toe-the-line" beauty and his son, Johan -- the blond, blue-eyed, tanned and torsoed fourteen- year-old every father dreams of. Susan greets friends and acquaintances, pausing to chat... mostly formalities. Johan, his eyes on a girl his age. She is with her father, Mr. Cloete, the headmaster -- she smiles at Johan from a distance; he waves awkwardly as she drives off with her parents. SUZETTE his daughter, sophisticated -- groomed. She takes her baby from the black nanny waiting in the car, carries the child to the group chatting with CHRIS, her husband. She shows it off proudly. Ben is chatting, concerned, to a WOMAN. She looks drawn and worried.

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She's waving impatiently at him. He crosses back to her. Suzette's BABY is HOWLING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She rocks it back and forth, holding it at arm's length. The BABY SCREAMS. The nanny comes forward -- Suzette hands it over.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Coetzee. She looked worried.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>

She smiles and walks him to the car affectionately. :SC: EXT. BEN'S HOUSE - BARBECUE - DAY The Du Toit family.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Susan is bringing out the salads. Chris, her son-in-law, is at the barbecue, stinging his eyes. Ben is bouncing his grandson, little Hennie, in a small, portable pool. The black nanny sits in attendance in the shade, a towel at the ready. The good life... ... Suddenly disturbed by... Gordon and Jonathan standing uncertain at the far side of the garden; Gordon's hat pressed flat against his chest, Jonathan defiant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Susan looks up -- as do each in turn -- curious at the intrusion... then the black nanny -- and finally Ben. After a moment, Ben walks up to Gordon.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben is shocked by the severity of the canning.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not why I'm complaining, Mister Ben, sir. If he did wrong, I'd beat him myself. But he didn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He did nothing and they wouldn't listen. They wouldn't believe him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Gordon. But there must be a reason.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says he wasn't doing anything wrong, Mister Ben, sir. And I believe him, I know my son! It's an injustice!
	</DIALOGUE>

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the court? Didn't he state his case?

	<DIALOGUE>
	What does he know about court? Before he knew, it was all over.

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think there is anything we can do about it now.
	</DIALOGUE>

Outside, peering through the half-opened door, is Johan, shocked at what he sees. Ben tapes Jonathan on the head, he pulls up his shorts painfully, yet fiercely, anxious to cover himself up again.
</DIRECTION>

	We can get a lawyer to appeal.
	</DIALOGUE>

She nods, ushering Johan away from the door back outside.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't understand, Mister Ben, sir. I don't want him to have a police record. It will be there for the rest of his life and make it difficult for him to get a job in the future.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, Gordon. I'm sure there'll be no record, it's such a minor case. Please don't worry.

FURTHER UP STREET Three police Jeeps block the route of the march. A little distance behind are police troops carriers ('hippos'). About six police-dog-handlers in camouflage uniforms stand across the road waiting for the march to approach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the march gets closer the students' singing increases in volume. The Soweto police COMMANDANT steps forward with a loud- speaker in hand. He confronts the lead of the march. He signals for them to stop. The dogs are straining at their leashes and their handlers taunt the leading group.
</DIRECTION>
<COMMANDANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now listen to me, this is an illegal demonstration. I order you to disperse immediately.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>

Camouflauged police scrambling out of Jeeps with guns and tear gas grenades. They stand with the rifles pointing at the marchers. The singing continues.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tear gas canisters are thrown into the crowd, the dog- handlers attack. There is panic with Students running in all directions, several choking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some of the students start throwing stones at the police, hitting one in the face; he is helped away by a black policeman. Without warning, SHOOTING STARTS. Children drop, wounded; friends trying to help the dying and seriously wounded, others helped away.
</DIRECTION>

They belong to children, some in torn, dirty clothes, others naked, some mutilated, others whole and seemingly unharmed, as if asleep, until the small, neat hole in temple or chest and the small crust of blood is brought to our attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A woman behind them starts to scream. They look around to see her holding onto a drawer, her legs buckling. Another woman pulls her close to grieve with her. The assistant approaches them and after a soft exchange he writes a name on a tag and ties it onto the body. The woman can't, won't leave her dead child. Her friend has to pull her away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd parts to let them through. Other women reach out to touch her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordon looks into the last drawer, Jonathan is not there. They make their way out past the other parents and a group of mourning women sitting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MORTUARY - DAY Gordon, Emily and their friends cross to Stanley's great white elderly Dodge, this "etembalami" with the big butter- fly. For, amongst other things, he is the owner and driver of a pirate taxi. They get in. Stanley pauses -- looks across at a small red VW Beetle parked nearby, waiting. He shakes his head -- the VW flashes its lights and drives off. :SC: INT. STANLEY'S TAXI - DAY Inside they sit in silence... recovering from the ordeal. Only Emily silently whispers "Thank God, thank God." After a while...

He dials a number. :SC: INT. DAN PIENAAR SCHOOL - STAFF ROOM - DAY Tea break for the teachers, Ben among them. He is enjoy- ing a laugh with his colleagues -- maybe in Afrikaans -- we should hear the language here where we need not com- prehend. An African serves the tea. There's a KNOCK -- a monitor comes in and talks to Ben who follows him outside. :SC: INT. SCHOOL - DAY Ben at the phone.

<BEN>

</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister Ben, sir. If it was me, all right. And if it was Emily, all right. We are not young. But he's out child. My time and your time, it's passing. But the time of our children is coming. And now if they kill our children -- if we let them -- what is it that we lived for?

<BEN>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can we do, Gordon? You or I... We can't change it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That day, Mr. Ben, sir, when they whipped Jonathan, you also said we can do nothing. But if we had... if someone heard what we had to say this would not have happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what they say. But I got to know for certain. How can I have peace? I must know how my son died and where they buried him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
The game on the next pitch finishes with a pierce of the whistle. The kids run off past Ben and Gordon. Gordon climbs onto the small lawn mower and STARTS the ENGINE.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gordon. The police -- if they've said...
	</DIALOGUE>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care what they say. He is my child. God is my witness today: I cannot stop before I know what happened and where he lies. His body belongs to Emily and me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And drives away -- chugging across the field... leaving Ben -- helpless -- behind him -- watching. From his: OFFICE WINDOW

And drives off, leaving Ben watching him, shaking his head at the man's obtuseness. :SC: EXT. NGUBENE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON Emily is watering a tiny vegetable plot in the yard, with a bucket and a pierced tin. Robert is playing nearby with the youngest child. Robert sees Gordon walking slowly to their house and says playfully to the baby:
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look who's coming? It's baba!
	</DIALOGUE>

Emily turns to look. She immediately realizes that some- thing is wrong. She drops the tin and walks a few steps toward the gate.

Gordon sees her and stops. Emily starts to break down.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no... oh no, Lord.

	Take it easy, boys. Hey Wellington!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Wellington comes to the car. He's limping, wearing sunglasses. As he's approaching the car, Stanley opens the back door for him.

He enters and removes the glasses. Stanley notices a deep scar from the forehead to the cheek.

<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't that tragic? Jonathan was such a nice boy. Even played with my Johan when they were small, God.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he was such a nice boy, well- mannered.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said he was very bright at school.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Chris helps himself to more. Suzette looks at the paper.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, this kind of journalism doesn't help the situation. Look at her face? What does she look like?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Rand Daily Mail always exaggerates.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZETTE>
<DIRECTION>
She passes the paper to Ben. He looks at Melanie's pic- ture: she looks 30 years old, long black hair, large dark eyes with a fierce, unsettling, uncompromising stare, a small nose and a generous and sensual mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks quite attractive to me.
	</DIALOGUE>

Chris and Johan laugh.

	'... Is only the latest in scores of black youths who have disappeared whilst in police custody.'
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does she expect? They're out of control. Give then an inch and they take a hundred miles. It's in their nature. The only language they understand is force.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chris, Jonathan was fifteen, like me. Would you use force on me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not a terrorist. If you were -- like an increasing number of them, you'd deserve it. Look, every time you pick up the newspaper...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God, one hundred shot! They didn't have to kill them.

<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This bloody Bruwer woman reports one hundred shot, but the radio said only twenty and the police were attacked first.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SUZETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought the idea was to give them their own areas, banstustans. Let them live with their own kind. No chance of conflict then. Everybody's happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<JOHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And who would do the work?

:SC: INT. GORDON'S HOUSE (SOWETO) - NIGHT The small dark room is crowded. The one oil lamp -- on the table -- At the table sits Gordon... his glasses on the end of his nose. Emily is sitting by the stove. Robert stands beside her chair, watching, listening. The youngsters are sleeping in opposite directions on the iron bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wellington is sitting beside Gordon at the table. There is something wild in his manner. He looks everywhere as if he is scared of being attacked unawares. The black cleaner from John Vorster Sq. stands near the table. Gordon is reading aloud from a handwritten document.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'On the second day of our detention at John Vorster Square we were taken to one of the top floors. We were ordered to undress and they started to beat us with fists and sjamboks. This for a long time.'

Wellington nods and gets more paranoid. The black cleaner puts an understanding hand on his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>

Gordon pauses... steadies himself... pushes his glasses up his nose... clears his throat...
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'... We were asked questions for the whole day and night by Capt. Stolz and different policemen -- they never stopped. They tried to force us to say we were the leaders at our school, that we were working for the A.N.C. and got money from overseas. Capt. Stolz wanted to know the names of the students committee and where he can find Toni Mtimkulu -- Everytime they asked question, they beat us. It was bad beating.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</GORDON>
<DIRECTION>
Wellington nods again. Emily closes her eyes to shut out the image.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'We told them we had done nothing and didn't know about all the things they are asking us; on two occasion they put a wet bag over my head and I -- couldn't breathe -- I thought I was going to die. One day I heard Jonathan being beaten. He was screaming and crying, and then a noise like tables and chairs being knocked down, and Capt. Stolz shouting "you bastard, get up, do you hear me?" Ngubene, don't pretend here, get up." Then the next day I heard he had gone to hospital and I never saw him again.'
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
There's a long silence. Gordon closes his eyes and struggles with his grief. Emily sobs, Robert looks on in anger. Then, finally, Gordon offers a pen to Wellington, who is about to sign the foot of the state- ment, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Suddenly there is the sound of a TRUCK APPROACHING. Wellington rushes to the front window and peers outside; then panics, fear in his eyes, he runs into a bedroom and jumps through the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone in the room is bewildered. The front door bursts open. Emily sits impassively look- ing at the five policemen (two whites and three Africans).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The youngest child startled from his sleep starts to cry. Emily goes to the bed and picks the child up and returns to her chair.

He notices the papers on the table and picks them up. He looks at them and realizes their importance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Capt. Stolz walks into the room and surveys the room and its occupants. Lieutenant Venter hands him the papers. He goes through them, nodding to himself as he reads silently. He folds them neatly and puts them into his inside jacket pocket. He walks up to Gordon.
</DIRECTION>
<STOLZ>
<DIRECTION>
(to Gordon)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On your feet! So, you must be Gordon Ngubene?
	</DIALOGUE>

Gordon doesn't answer. He turns to the cleaner who automatically stands.
</DIRECTION>
<STOLZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We know each other, don't we?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Calmly, he paces round the room looking around, then when he reaches the bed where the 10-years-old girl is watch- ing terrified, he pulls off the blankets, yanks the girl off the bed by her arm and frantically searches the bed. The child cries. Robert the brother goes to his sister and hugs her as he glares at Stolz with anger and hatred.

The other policeman appears from the other bedrooms empty- handed. Gordon and the cleaner are roughly handled as they are handcuffed by the African Security Police.

Over his shoulder Gordon manages to give Emily one last look, as he's hustled out of the house.
</DIRECTION>

Behind Ben's house, are the servants' quarters attached to the garage. Ben has adapted what would have been a maid's room into his study and the adjoining room into a do-it-yourself workshop. The study has photographs of Ben's past as a provincial rugby player, of his family, school staff and TRECHIKOFF reproduction. On a cupboard are trophies of individual sports at university. He works off a plain desk on which is a handsome pipe- rack with several pipes. His indulgence is a comfortable easy chair. Ben's study, containing only the figure of Ben. He's hunched over his desk, looking blankly at the newspaper. His shirt is unbuttoned, his jacket slung across his chair. He draws heavily on his pipe, wreathing his head with smoke in the beam of the single desk light. He sits in his chair:

Johan is entering, knocking on the half-open door. He's in his pajamas and dressing gown, ready for bed. Ben looks up at him. Johan kisses his father who suddenly clasp his son hard, clinging to him for dear life. The boy throws his arms around his dad's neck.

Susan appears at the door with a cup of coffee. She's had a bath -- her hair is wet -- and she's in her housecoat. Ben and Johan don't notice her approach.

She watches sympathetically for a moment, then...

	Coffee! Come on, Johan. Time for bed.

Johan pulls back from his father's arms.

Ben walks through the aisles and from time to time oppor- tunities to glance at the window at Gordon's motionless tractor sitting in the field. He turns back and notices a boy focusing on the ceiling. His pen in his mouth, trying desperately to find the answers. Ben has a smile, then crosses to him, bends down and strikes a similar pose.

Johannes goes to wet the bag in a bucket in a corner.

Lieutenant Venter grabs Gordon, throws him onto a chair and handcuffs his hands behind the chair.

Just then, a 20-year-old African girl, Afro-style hair, is brought in held on both sides by two white policemen. She is taken into a lift. Ben watches them enter the lift and follows the progress of lift to the 10th floor. The Policeman stamps the slip and gives it to Ben.

Captain Stolz nods correctly, unsmiling, comfortably dressed, English-style. He shakes hands with Ben. Then walks toward the window and stands there.

As he's watching Ben, he begins to clean out his pipe with a silver penknife;

	<DIALOGUE>
	Do sit down.

	And you feel you know him enough to vouch for him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, after so many years... 10 years. Gordon's not the type to get himself in trouble. He's an honest, hard-working, church- going man.

<VILJOEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha! You'd be surprised how many honest, decent, church-going men we come across during a working day.

He leans back comfortably in his chair.

<VILJOEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's routine, Mr. Du Toit -- a routine enquiry. Cleaning up these townships we must leave no stone unturned.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I appreciate that -- but Gordon would never...
	</DIALOGUE>
<VILJOEN>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not an easy task either -- the press screaming blue murder -- especially the English. And they'll be the first to squeal if the Reds took over, make no mistake. Rushing back overseas clutching their bloody British passports. Have you any idea what will happen here if we don't follow every lead? We have a duty -- obligation. You have your job -- we have ours.

</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Ben hastens to reassure him. He looks directly at Ben, frank, open, trustworthy.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Colonel -- believe me, I'm with you all the way. But in this case -- I'm sure that in your worthy pursuit of the guilty you have, unwittingly, involved the innocent. After all, we're all human. We all make mistakes sometimes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Viljoen laughs again.
</DIRECTION>
<VILJOEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are indeed, Mr. Du Toit -- we are indeed. Though there's many who might need persuading as to that fact.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Then... authority.
</DIRECTION>
<VILJOEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Du Toit. While you're here, would you mind if I asked you a few questions about Ngubene?

	Colonel, I'd welcome it.

<VILJOEN>

	Good!

There's another pause. The Colonel takes out a fountain pen -- unscrews it -- and arranges a sheet before him before speaking.

The noise stops behind.

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing, Colonel.

<VILJOEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did Gordon ever discuss the death with you?

</BEN>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course he did -- he was upset.

<DIRECTION>
The Colonel pauses.
</DIRECTION>
<VILJOEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he accepted the truth?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is a religious man... in the end he would have resigned himself to it.

<VILJOEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would have? You mean he didn't? Was he angry? Rebellious?

	Come on, Colonel! If one of your kids died...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(nods to family picture on desk)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and nobody would tell you how it happened or where his body is buried, wouldn't you be upset?

</BEN>
<STOLZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We told him how his son died, Mr. Du Toit.

Ben turns back, surprised.

<VILJOEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a son, Mr. Du Toit?

The Colonel looks up at him... the first sign of steel in his eyes... then back to the papers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The noise starts again behind Ben.
</DIRECTION>
<VILJOEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does he burn and destroy -- everything he can lay his hands on?... No -- and neither does mine. That's what I can't understand... after everything the government does for them.

	I've never doubted it, Colonel. It's you who appear to be doubting me. These questions. You're making me feel like a criminal.

There's a moment's pause -- then a burst of laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<VILJOEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Mr. Du Toit... I'm sorry. It's force of habit. Once a policeman, always a policeman, eh?

CHILDREN'S POV On the doorstep of the funeral parlor: Stanley and Ben run into a young woman coming out with a shoulder bag and a camera. The young woman and Stanley exchange a quick, friendly greeting -- it's MELANIE BRUWER, the Rand Daily reporter -- and keep moving. BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben turns back for a moment. Her face seems familiar to him. He would like to talk to her, but there is no time. Stanley is already inside. :SC: INT. FUNERAL PARLOR - DAY Ben and Stanley follow the proprietor who is expensively- dressed in a dark suit. Gordon's coffin stands as one of many in the room. Inside the casket, brass fittings, white satin, lies Gordon, incongruous, ludicrous in a black Sunday suit. His hands are crossed on his chest like the claws of a bird and his face, barely recognizable, is gray, the left side distorted, blackish purple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are rough stitches of the postmortem across his skull and a scar on his lips. Stanley speaks in an African language to the undertaker. The man opens Gordon's shirt and reveals the bruised and battered chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley observes Ben who looks at the wounds with horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then another command from Stanley and the undertaker opens the shirt to the waist. Ben's ashen. Stanley thanks the man and turns to leave. Ben remains a minute. He shuts his eyes tightly. Now he saw it. Now he must believe it. He must accept that this battered corpse is Gordon. As he follows Stanley, he thanks the undertaker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. FUNERAL PARLOR - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Outside the "sunlight," the children's laughter and Stanley, hands in pockets, waiting for Ben by the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same two little girls approach Stanley who gives them some coins -- they run off happily. Ben is coming outside blinking in the glaring sunlight. Stanley glares at Ben, who is pale, shaken and silent. They get into the car in silence.

	You know, Lanie, when you run a taxi, especially a pirate taxi like me, you have eyes and ears everywhere. Even when a policeman farts in his bed you know. People want a reference book, a permit to stay in Soweto, a house, anything, we taxi drivers know the routes. I'll tell you something...

:SC: EXT. SOWETO CEMETERY - MORNING The large Soweto cemetery has scores of graves ready for burials. The chief mourners, Emily, Robert, his sister, Margaret, four relatives and Stanley are standing on either side of the PRIEST. Gordon's coffin is in the grave; several wreaths are on the side of the grave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are about fifteen hundred mourners, and half are youths. There are several local reporters and overseas television reporters. The police are in attendance in large numbers at the edge of the crowd, some in battle dress and some with dogs.
</DIRECTION>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before I conclude, I have to say we are tired of making this journey every day, sometimes twice in one day, burying our children, and those, like our departed brother, Ngubene who were merely seeking the truth; and those who have been denounced by traitors amongst us; and those who have been brutally killed for no reason, yes I shall say it, by the police. Let those who rule this land of ours listen to the word of God; let them listen to our peaceful and just demands; let them be humble and go down on their knees and seek forgiveness, then listen to God.
	</DIALOGUE>

The crowd roars: "Amanda! Amanda!" The Priest starts a short hymn and the crowd joins in.

At the end of the hymn.

The crowd starts singing a freedom song with arms raised. The funeral has now become a political demonstration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Pilani, who is a dignified, educated 70-years-old, walks slowly and waits beside the chief mourners. He is handed a loudspeaker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SENIOR POLICE OFFICER threads his way through the crowd, a loud hailer in his hand. As he reaches the grave he turns. The crowd is quiet. He says something to the Priest then addresses the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<SENIOR_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The funeral is over. I order everyone to go home. This is not a political rally. I repeat, disperse.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As though by signal the police start attacking the mourners with truncheons and dogs. There is pandemon- ium, women screaming, people falling into graves or covering in them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Priest and Stanley lead Emily and the family away in the opposite direction. The press and television are recording the scene. The police start throwing tear gas canisters. There is no confrontation, the crowd is fleeing in all directions. One television cameraman is purposely pushed into a grave by a very young policeman, his round recordist is pulled up into the adjourning grave by the connecting cord. Melanie stands on a tombstone watching and making notes. :SC: INT. BEN'S LOUNGE - NIGHT Ben, Susan watching the main evening news bulletin on TV. On the screen a sequence of rioting.

Stanley looks around, then goes back to the car, opens the back door, leans and says something. Suddenly, to everyone's astonishment, Ben crawls out of the car; Stanley hustles him into Emily's house.

The black section is filled to capacity with a few stand- ing. In the front row is sitting Stanley next to Margaret. At the entrance, a white policeman. In the press section are several reporters; amongst them Melanie Bruwer the Rand Daily Mail reporter. Colonel Viljoen and several policemen are sitting around the court.

	You are sure about the hanging? This pressure on the neck, could it also have been exerted in other ways?

	<DIALOGUE>
	It could, but it is not for me to speculate.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DE_VILLIERS>

	Of course not, Doctor. The list of injuries found on the body was horrifyingly long; bruises, swellings, abrasions, broken rib, lacerations, etc. How long before death do you estimate he received these injuries?

<LOUW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You arrested Gordon Ngubene. Could you describe what happened?

</STOLZ>
<STOLZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Acting on information we had received, I went to the house of the deceased, accompanied by Lieutenant Venter, Lieutenant Botha, and three native members of the security force. This was about 10 P.M. I informed Ngubene that he was under arrest under Article 6 of the Terrorism Act. He then became violent and resisted arrest. A certain force had to be applied to restrain him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOLZ>
<DIRECTION>
ON Stanley listening. ON Ben listening.

</DIRECTION>
<LOUW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was the deceased ever assaulted to your knowledge?
	</DIALOGUE>
<STOLZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never. He was always treated with courtesy and correctness. But, one time we had cause to use force against him. It was the day before his death. The deceased suddenly showed signs of aggression. He tried to jump through the open window of my office. He was acting like a mad man. It took six of my men to restrain him, and he had to be manacled hand and foot, for his own safety. But once he calmed down, he was ready to make a statement about his activities. The next morning we found him dead in his cell.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MAGISTRATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is the statement in evidence?
	</DIALOGUE>
<LOUW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Your Worship. It can't be disclosed in court without damaging our investigation, but I would like to offer into evidence a suicide note written by the deceased.

<STOLZ>

</DIRECTION>
<DE_VILLIERS>
	<DIALOGUE>

<MAGISTRATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have listened to all the evidence and the arguments. To begin with I have to say that there was no conclusive evidence offered to prove beyond doubt that members of the Security Police had been guilty of assault or any irregular conduct on the deceased. There were indications that Ngubene was aggressive and on more than one occasion had to be restrained with force. There was sufficient evidence to conclude that death had been caused by a trauma following pressure applied to the neck, consistent with hanging. Consequently, I find that Gordon Ngubene committed suicide by hanging himself and that on available evidence his death cannot be attributed to any act or omission or amounting to a criminal offense on the part of any person.

:SC: EXT. MELANIE'S HOME - DAY Melanie drives into the yard. The house is an old Colonial style house amidst flowers, bushes and trees, a controlled wild garden. A figure is bent over a beehive. A large brimmed old hat with a net hides his head and features. Melanie stops the car in the driveway.

<MELANIE>

(pointing from the car)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There he is by the eucalyptus tree, on the left. That's old Bruwer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They get out of the car and walk towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long have you lived here?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, about twenty-one years. I love this house.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BRUWER>
<DIRECTION>
(without looking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that you, Melanie?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, Dad. I want you to meet a friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<BRUWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does anyone have a friend nowadays?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUWER>
<DIRECTION>
He straightens up and throws the net over his head and studies Ben. MR. BRUWER is seventy years old; an interesting face with a goatee beard.
</DIRECTION>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Du toit, Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BRUWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you like bees?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have nothing against them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MELANIE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Ben)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be careful, I can see philosophy coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BRUWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shut up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Ben)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me tell you about bees, and for that matter ants: a bee has a completely altruistic sense of purpose -- based on the common good. A course from which he cannot be deflected. Greed, ambition, they mean nothing to him. He lives solely to serve his fellow bee.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about individuality, Dad?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BRUWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's the rub, my girl. There's the rub. One of these days I'll ask the bees. I'm sure they have the answer. Now, you two run along!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUWER>
<DIRECTION>
He replaces his net and continues with the hive.
</DIRECTION>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A drink, Dad?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BRUWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been peeing too much this morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUWER>
<MELANIE>
<DIRECTION>
(as they walk toward the house)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my Daddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Melanie and Ben enter the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MELANIE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY The Bruwer living room is a profusion of piles of papers, of books on shelves, on tables, on the floor, paintings -- records, African sculptures. On the floor tangled lengths of flex leading from a record player to two voluminous speakers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A settee, a chess set. The furniture is old and well- used, dominated by a large leather club chair -- two big cats sleeping on it. It's civilized pandemonium.
</DIRECTION>
<MELANIE>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing to the room)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you see in what environment I was spawned.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Ben looks at the shelves and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please sit down, on that chair.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to club chair)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Dad's. Drink?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. A...

</BEN>
<MELANIE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	A brandy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at her surprised, then smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thanks, a beer will be fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Melanie goes into the kitchen leaving Ben. He cannot forget what he heard and what he saw in the court!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She returns barefooted, with two beer mugs, and hands one to Ben.
</DIRECTION>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The mugs are the few things that Dad brought from Germany. He studied philosophy in Tubingen and Berlin before the last war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought they were German?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Melanie sits, her legs propped up on the settee, hugging her knees.
</DIRECTION>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Du Toit, tell...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, call me Ben.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, Ben, tell me, why are you so depressed? You really expect a different verdict?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(disgruntled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you ask? Can you understand it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I understand it. What could they have. I'm not cynical. I'm only trying to be realistic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me, Miss Bruwer...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ben and Melanie, that's fair.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me, do you believe in the notion of justice?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MELANIE>
<DIRECTION>
(lighting a cigarette)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll never stop believing. But in this country I've learned it's pointless to look for it in certain situations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What use is a system if justice does not apply to all situations?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. And you cannot fight for justice unless you know injustice very well. You've got to know your enemy first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a tall order: 'know injustice... know the enemy.' it seems I have a long haul ahead of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at all, Ben. You have already taken the first steps.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome to South Africa!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles. :SC: INT. BEN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT Susan is sitting at the dressing table. She is applying cleansing cream to her face. She is relaxed. Ben is getting ready for bed.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you enjoy the 'bobotie?' When I heard the verdict on the news I knew you'd be upset.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(softer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted to make you something special.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(thoughtful)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, darling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. Susan starts to remove the cream.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad it's all over. You take things to heart too much.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Ben comes and stands behind Susan -- looking at her through the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to keep control of himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They killed Gordon -- first they kill Jonathan, and then him. How can they get away with it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<SUSAN>
<DIRECTION>
(soothingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now come on, Ben. Gordon's death upset me, too. But the Magistrate had all the facts. He must know what he's doing, he's had years of experience. The case has run its course, and nobody can do anything more about it! It's all over and done with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not so sure about that, Susan!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Susan swivels around and faces Ben.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm damned well sure! It's over, Ben! You better get that into your head.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Ben just stares at her with seething anger. She stands up and starts being hysterical.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A teacher, always a bloody teacher. You never moved yourself for us. But for the blacks, oh yes. Whose side are you on, Ben? And I'm sick and tired of those natives coming here. Why don't you bloody well go and live in Soweto?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ben strides out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
<DIRECTION>
(following and shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(without looking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soweto!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Then shuts the door behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Susan stands stupefied. There's the sound of the SPARE ROOM DOOR. :SC: INT. SPARE ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben is standing in the middle of the room, in the dark. On the wall behind him is a young Suzette's picture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a few seconds, Ben moves slowly to the bed and sits on it still in deep thought.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOW MOVE TO a: CLOSEUP ON BEN

<DIRECTION>
And: FADE OUT. FADE IN:

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. NEWSPAPER AND CONFECTIONARY SHOP - MORNING It's a Saturday morning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shopping center in a white suburb. Ben goes into a newspaper shop. There are two children buying sweets and a woman leaving. The PROPRIETOR is an Afrikaner in his middle age.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More meneer Van de Merwe.

	Our boys gave the Eastern province a thrashing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PROPRIETOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Ben realizes that the man is not his usual conversational self.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is anything wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<PROPRIETOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROPRIETOR>
<DIRECTION>
Ben goes to pick up an Afrikaans newspaper and the Rand Daily Mail.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(walking up to counter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And a packet of tobacco and pipe cleaners.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The man gets them and takes a note from Ben and gives him his change. By then a man is waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
As he walks out the other man turns around to watch him. :SC: EXT. STREET - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben walks out of the shop. The newspaper under his arm. A group of three middle-aged women turn to look at him. Ben didn't see them. A little further on, he meets Mrs. Coetzee. He tries to greet her but she walks straight by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Further on, he notices two men obviously talking about him. Then a couple of boys on bikes snigger as they pass him. He begins to wonder what's it all about, and spontaneously checks his clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. BEN'S HOUSE - VERANDA - MORNING Susan and Suzette sit there. Suzette's holding a news- paper -- the Ossewa -- Susan's thoughtful, her face is red and discomposed -- obviously she had cried. The PHONE RINGS but they deliberately ignore it. Ben appears with the newspapers under his arm, sees Suzette's sports car and hurries to join them. Suzette doesn't even give him a chance to kiss her.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZETTE>
<DIRECTION>
(jumping up and showing the cover of Ossewa)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, Papa, this is going too far! How could you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's that, Suzette?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Ben takes the newspaper and looks at the cover. A picture of himself and Emily outside the courtroom. The two faces are close together with the notes:
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"EMILY NGUBENE, wife of native who died in detention, comforted by a friend of family, Mr. BEN DU TOIT."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And in parenthesis "see page two." He throws the Ossewa on a chair and checks into the Rand Daily Mail. Inside there is a long article with Emily's picture, titled "the Face of Grief."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben folds up the newspapers, and shakes his head. He suddenly realizes why the people reacted like that outside.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't stop to think of the family. Poor mother, how can she face anyone? And tomorrow is Sunday!
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now listen...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZETTE>
<DIRECTION>
Johan steps into the veranda.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's everybody yelling about?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SUZETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You listen, Papa, just tell me, why?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Recognizing his father in the photo, Johan has picked up the newspaper from the chair.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you really think I specially arranged for the photographers to take that picture? And what's more it's distorted.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SUZETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's distorted about it? Your face is practically touching that meid's face, like you were about to kiss her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(disgruntled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suzette, pull yourself together!
	</DIALOGUE>
<SUZETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Today the whole country has seen that photograph. We, your children, are going to suffer. At this very moment Chris is negotiating with the Provincial Council. Would you like to see them cancel it? You have no feeling, Papa!
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(shocked)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suzette!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She leaves in rage.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHAN>
<DIRECTION>
(conciliating)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's Papa done, anyway? If something happened to him, wouldn't you be upset?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SUSAN>
<DIRECTION>
(standing up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not enough, Johan, to throw myself into the garden boy's arms.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That goes without saying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<JOHAN>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There must be easier ways of getting your name in the paper.

<DIRECTION>
Before she can stop herself, Susan slaps him across the face, although not hard. Johan leaves without a word. She clutches her hand, shocked at having it against him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PHONE starts to RING. Susan runs out sobbing. Ben looks at her then walks into the living room to pick up the phone. :SC: INT. BEN'S LIVING ROOM - MORNING

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?... I don't know you and have nothing to say to you... No thank you for your advice!

<DIRECTION>
He puts the phone down. The PHONE RINGS again. Ben picks it up and waits.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's you, Viviers... I appreciate it... of course... Not yet... Any thank you. Tot siens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>

He replaces the receiver and is about to light his pipe when the PHONE RINGS again.

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Morning, Mr. Cloete... I'd like to say...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(impatiently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Mr. Cloete, may I ask what on earth has the picture to do with politics?... I'm sorry Mr. Cloete, I have to go.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. BESTER'S FARM - COUNTRY - DAY The farm is a typical transvaal farm covering thousands of acres. In the distance there's a range of mountains. Several cattle are grazing, herded by a poorly-clad African and his son, aged 8 years. Bester and Ben are leaning on the wooden fence of the cattle kraal with calves penned in.
</DIRECTION>
<BESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything was examined in depth in court.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BESTER>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you read the papers, Dominee? Were you happy with what came to light? And is it the Magistrate's work to pretend that the facts which came to light didn't exist?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was it really facts, Ben?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Just then the African "HERDBOY" walks up to them taking off his lattered greasy hat.

<BESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bought a bull last week.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, Gordon. What they said about him, that he was plotting against the government -- is a downright lie. He was only doing what I would have done as a father; searching for his son.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one but God can see what's in our hearts. Isn't it presumptuous to pretend we can speak for someone else?

	Wait a minute, instead of criticizing blindly, don't you think we have reason to be proud of the judiciary we have? suppose this had been Russia; what do you think would have happened then?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the use of reaching a court when a handful of people have all the power to decide what is going to be said in that court and by whom? The one man they allowed to speak for himself, that young Archibald Chigorimbo, didn't he immediately deny everything they forced him to say in his statement? And the girl who spoke of her own torture?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BESTER>
<DIRECTION>
CUSTOMER PAGE 99 MISSING

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That did not refer to our situation in this South Africa. Do you know what I believe in, Dominee, that once in one's life, just once, one should have enough faith in something to risk everything for it.

:SC: INT. DAN PIENAAR SCHOOL - MORNING The staff is having coffee during morning break in the staff room. The room has several easy chairs, a table with the morning newspapers on it. The walls have pictures of South African scenes. There are several conversations in Afrikaans. This is the first morning since the photograph.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben walks into the staff room. The conversations stop. Everyone looks at him with hostility. The teachers all place their cups on the table and quietly file out of the room. Ben pours himself a cup of coffee; as he takes his first sip, Cloete looks in, sees him. He walks in.

Ben looks at him calmly.

</BEN>
<BRUWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the world coming to? It's herbs, can't you see? Thyme there, oregano over there, feunel next to the tomatoes, sage here and rosemary somewhere. Poor plants, they re not in their ideal soil or climate. Next time, I'll bring some soil from the mountain of Zeus. Perhaps the old man's holiness will do the trick.

	Not bad, in fact quite good. Now where was I... Oh, I was going to say after decades of philosophy, I find myself being forced back to the earth. Do you know, Ben, we're all living in the spell of abstractions. Hitler, apartheid, the great American dream, the lot?

	Of course you have a choice. Damn it. One always has a choice. Only thank God you made the choice you did. But all I want to say is, keep your eyes open, young man.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's encouraging.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BRUWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are both Boers, Ben. We know how hard our people worked to get a toehold on this land; it was a good life. Now look at the mess. It's all systems and no God! Sooner or later people start believing in their way of life as an absolute: unmutable, fundamental, a precondition. Saw it, with my own eyes in Germany, a nation running after an idea. Sieg heil, sieg heil. I left there thirty years ago because I couldn't take it any longer. And now I see it happening in my own country, step by step. Terrifyingly predictable. This sickness of the great abstraction.

</BEN>
<BRUWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take for example the way the government is handling the electorate; like a bloody donkey. Carrot in front and kick at the backside. The carrot is apartheid, Dogma. The kick is quite simply, fear. Black peril, red peril, whatever name you want to give it.

<LEWINSON>

<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for the compliment. But remember, you're an Afrikaner, you're one of them. In their eyes they regard you as the worst kind of traitor.

	You are an Afrikaner too, and your articles, in a liberal English paper?

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of loyalty? Blind loyalty. Until the deaths of Jonathan and Gordon, I gave all the loyalty I could give, laager loyalty. You know, Melanie, we Afrikaners have always lived in our laager, we have not seen what's beyond the mountains.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>

(uncomfortable)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The first one two days after they took him away. And the other one came later.

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, Emily, why didn't you tell me long ago?
	</DIALOGUE>
<EMILY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had given my word to the man -- who brought them to me --
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Emily, I have to meet the man.
	</DIALOGUE>
<EMILY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said he didn't want anybody to know who he is. I cannot make trouble for him in his work.

	He has to be persuaded. He is very important to us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<EMILY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Julius)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You as a lawyer will understand. We intend starting a civil suit against the police, to do that it is necessary to have as many affidavits as we can from people who have any information about Gordon since he was arrested. And this man is vital and so is the Indian doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JULIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean Dr. Hassiem. How are you going to do that? You know of course that he is detained.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, with luck they may release him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JULIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With luck.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, Emily, this man is important, please try to tell him we will protect his identity. No one will know. Nothing will be done without his approval. I only want to talk to him.

	Why don't you leave it to Stanley and I? What do you say, Stanley?

	Sure.

<BEN>

	This case must be reopened and we must win. We have to dig up everything. We need your cooperation, Julius.

</JULIUS>
<JULIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where do I start? Don't forget my restrictions.
	</DIALOGUE>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They did not ban you so you could sit on your backside and have a Soweto holiday.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could help with the affidavits. Lewinson the lawyer has stressed their importance.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JULIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We know each other. He's a good lawyer for this kind of case. Of course I'll do what I can. My commitment forces me.

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad.

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BEN'S GARAGE - EVENING Ben is standing by the workbench, the new drawer he and Johan built for the toolbox, open before him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's rereading Gordon's letters to Emily. Sound of approaching FOOTSTEPS. Ben quickly puts the letters into the drawer and shuts it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Susan appears at the door -- she looks ten years older.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ben, it's Johan. You'd better come.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BEN'S KITCHEN - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johan sits, Ben crouched before him. The boy's shirt is torn, his eyes swollen, his lip cut. He looks at the floor. Susan hovers.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He won't tell me why it happened
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Ben holds his son's arms, gently.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Johan. Was it because of me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't answer for a moment. Then he nods.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see! It's gone too far, Ben. You've got to stop it...
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOHAN>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting at his mother)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care! It doesn't hurt me!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Susan stares at him, at Ben, turns abruptly, walks out of the room. Johan looks at his father.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was my friends, Dad. They're so stupid... They won't listen. They don't even want to know what you're trying to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He's crying.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<JOHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHAN>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does it worry you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>

Johan looks at his father through his tears.

SHOTS. Three! Loud, sharp, terrifying. :SC: INT. BEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATE EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WINDOW, a LAMP and a MIRROR SHATTER -- Susan screams, standing, her hands -- clamped over her ears -- eyes tight shut -- hysterical -- the TELEVISION CHATTERS on an Afrikaans' play.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben bursts in, holds her tight, as she screams into his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay, stay there, please!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Gently, he leads Susan who is sobbing now, out of the room. :SC: INT. KITCHEN - LATE EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
<DIRECTION>
(in disbelief)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God. They were trying to kill us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She's seated at the kitchen table. Ben has poured her a brandy which she cups in her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They were trying to scare us, that's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Her fear turns into anger.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, is that all... What the hell more do you want to happen... we're ordinary people for God's sake -- and you've pitched us into this -- this nightmare. I can't take any more, Ben... I can't take any more!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<DIRECTION>
She drops her head and sobs. Ben sits beside her, and takes her hands to comfort her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Susan puts her head on his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
<DIRECTION>
(in a quiet pleading voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Ben, stop. Just stop... please.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Ben is obviously moved. He squeezes her hands, then takes her in his arms. :SC: INT. VILJOEN'S OFFICE - DAY The colonel, amiable, cool, behind his desk. A dishev- elled Ben, pitched angrily forward in his chair.
</DIRECTION>
<VILJOEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you must be exaggerating, Mr. Du Toit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My house has been searched. My phone is tapped. My mail is opened. And last night three shots were fired through my window -- close to killing my wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Viljoen reacts.
</DIRECTION>
<VILJOEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Du Toit, if shots were fired into your premises, we will investigate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VILJOEN>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I want to know, Colonel, is why don't you leave me in peace?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<VILJOEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now wait, wait a minute, Mr. Du Toit, you're not trying to blame me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me, Colonel, why is it so important to you people to stop my enquiries about Gordon Ngubene?
	</DIALOGUE>
<VILJOEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that what you are doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he pauses)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, now. If you possess any information that may be of use to us, I trust you won't hesitate to discuss it with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He leans forward towards Ben, his tone darkening.
</DIRECTION>
<VILJOEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because if there are facts you are deliberately hiding from us, Mr. Du Toit -- If you give us reason to believe that you may be involved in activities that may be dangerous to both yourself and us -- then I can foresee some problems.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that a threat, Colonel?
	</DIALOGUE>
<VILJOEN>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling and sitting back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's call it a warning. A friendly warning. For God's sake, open your eyes, Mr. Du Toit! Don't you see you're being used!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VILJOEN>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(sarcastically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By the Communists, I suppose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Ben gets up to go. The colonel doesn't rise to see him out.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, Colonel.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(at the door, turning back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He leaves. The colonel immediately picks up the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. BEN'S KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING A 40-year-old African woman walks up to Ben's kitchen door. She knocks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben opens the door in pyjamas and dressing-gown. She hands him a note and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben reads the note and goes back into the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. STREET IN VREDEDORP - MORNING Vrededorp is a colored section of Johannesburg. It's rundown area vacated by whites. There are children play- ing in the street. Some unemployed men are sitting on old chairs outside a doorway; a vendor is serving two women from his milk churn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben drives into the street searching for an address. He stops outside a house. As he gets out of the car the children and everyone stop to look at him with interest. He walks up to a door and knocks. A COLORED WOMAN appears as the door opens. She is young and obviously educated.
</DIRECTION>
<COLORED_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Du Toit?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Ben nods, hesitatingly.
</DIRECTION>
<COLORED_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Ben walks into the living/dining room. It's a very tidy room with a three piece sitting room suite, a sideboard with a clock on it. At one end of the room is the dining area. The floor is linoleum and covered with a rug in the middle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley is lounging on a settee, beer in hand. On the chair next to him a black man in a brown striped suit, drinks orange squash. Thirtyish, pleasant face but very tense. He rises as Ben walks in.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(rising and shaking hands with Ben)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's it? No trouble finding this place? You met Sadie. She's one of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Ben nods to her.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this is Johnson Seroke. The man of the letters.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding in greeting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Johnson.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Please sit down, Mr. Du Toit. A beer, tea or orange squash?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SADIE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A beer would be nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Sadie goes to a cupboard and brings out a bottle of beer and a glass. She opens the beer and hands it to Ben. She disappears into the bedroom with a curtain at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know they call this place Vrededorp, but we baptize it Malay Camp. Your first time in Malay Camp, Lanie?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've driven through here many times.
	</DIALOGUE>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The main road, eh?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ja.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The woman re-enters.
</DIRECTION>
<SADIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll excuse me. Stanley, you know what to do with the key.
	</DIALOGUE>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, Sadie. And thank you. Can I help myself to another beer?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SADIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know it is. Goodbye, Mr. Du Toit, and you, be careful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SADIE>
<DIRECTION>
To the Seroke.
</DIRECTION>
<SEROKE>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Sadie.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sadie leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That woman can die for you. We mustn't be long, Johnson has to be back on duty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, let's get on with it. Stanley tells me, you work at John Vorster Square.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<SEROKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had no choice, they transferred me there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you do if a man asks you, and he's in trouble?
	</DIALOGUE>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If they find out he'd be in very big trouble.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know that. Tell me, what do you know about Gordon?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SEROKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very little.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did talk to him from time to time?

</SEROKE>
<SEROKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He gave me the letters.

<BEN>

</BEN>
<SEROKE>

</SEROKE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you attend any of the interrogations?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<SEROKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I'm not a member of the Special Branch. But once I had to deliver a letter to Capt. Stolz, Gordon was there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(concerned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How were they interrogating him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEROKE>
<DIRECTION>
Seroke hesitates and looks at Stanley.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay. Tell him what you told me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(anxious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SEROKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They were using the pole.

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The pole, what's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(demonstrating)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They handcuff you and manacle your feet then they put a pole between your arms and the back of your knees. Then you're like a chicken ready for the oven. They hang you between two tables. Then they do what they like with you. The S.B. call it the aeroplane.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Ben is horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see. Who were in that room? Stolz...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<SEROKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lieutenant Venter and a black S.B.

</SEROKE>
<BEN>

</STANLEY>
<BEN>

	It's very interesting. When was the last time you saw him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<SEROKE>
<DIRECTION>
(nervous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw them take the body away to the cells. He was limp.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEROKE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did! Johnson, why do you stay with the police? You don't really belong there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SEROKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a job. And how can I go away? I love my family.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He jumps up and faces Ben with a look of anger and panic.
</DIRECTION>
<SEROKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They must never know I told you anything. Right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand. I promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is strictly between the three of us. Don't worry, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Seroke shakes hands with them as he's leaving.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(slapping his back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Stanley goes to the cupboard for another beer.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A beer, Lanie?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, thank you. You know, Stanley, after what happened the other night I was about to give this whole thing up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(intrigued)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened, man?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My wife nearly got killed. Three shots were fired into the house. What right have I to expose my family to harassment and actual physical danger? That's what I asked myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three bloody shots and you crawl on your hands and knees to people like Stolz, and say 'I give up.' What is the beginning for you is a version of what we suffer all our bloody life. Shit, I thought you had more guts than this, man!
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't say I'm giving up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you thought about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Johnson has revived my determination.
	</DIALOGUE>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a hell of a time, Lanie, but we'll survive. You and me. I tell you!
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think we may still win in the end, Stanley?
	</DIALOGUE>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course not, Lanie -- but we needn't lose either -- what matters is to stick around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Ben nods.
</DIRECTION>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By the way, man, I'm off on a trip -- Botswana -- thought I'd tell you in case you get worried.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you going there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Business. Tell you next week. Now for the bad news I've been saving to the last.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Julius has been arrested. He broke his banning order and visited his sister. You know what that means? At least a year's imprisonment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANLEY>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A year in jail just for visiting his sister?
	</DIALOGUE>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the chance he took. And he'll be the last to complain.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you think the real reason for this arrest was that they found out he was helping us?
	</DIALOGUE>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what? Lanie, you're not getting guilt complexes now, are you? That's a luxury only liberals can afford. Julius will be back, man. All refreshed by a spell in the deep-freeze.
	</DIALOGUE>

:SC: INT. BRUWER KITCHEN - AFTERNOON This is a medium-sized kitchen with two doors leading from it, one to the dining room and the other to the living room. It has not changed since it was furnished twenty years ago, the only modern appliances being the electric stove and a modern mixer on the working table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben is leaning against the wall next to the door leading to the living room, drinking coffee. Melanie, bare-feet, her long black hair tied up in a ribbon, is washing up. She looks younger and fragile with this hair-style.

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean not married...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And living in this chaos with my eccentric father? I love him and we get on perfectly. We have been together since I was a year old. My mother could not adapt to South Africa. She went back to London and we've never heard from her since.

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Being a professor and bringing up a child, how did he manage that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dorothy, dear Dorothy, she was a fantastic mother. In fact she had two families, me and her three children in Alexandra township.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this little girl grew up to be a tough journalist. Why a journalist?

	Sometimes I ask myself the same question.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She leans against the sink and picks up her mug of coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright. I'll tell you. I was brought up in a sheltered way, not that Dad was possessive, not openly anyway. I think he'd just seen enough of the mess the world was in, to want to protect me as much as he could. Then, I went to university. I don't know what you'll think... being a teacher.

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. He must have been young.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifteen years difference. He too protected me like Dad. Then one day I visited Dorothy in Alexandra and saw her home and the appalling conditions in that township. I was shocked, Ben, and ashamed.

	Go on.

Melanie pours him another mug of coffee and starts to wipe up.
</DIRECTION>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That made me think that I was a parasite, something white and maggot-like... just a thing... a sweet and ineffectual thing. I felt more and more claustrophobic. Poor Brian, who loved and pampered me. Had no idea what was happening. I left him for a whole year and we divorced.

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you manage that on a South African passport? We South Africans are white devils in Africa.

<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mother was English, remember? So I get a British passport. It comes in handy even for the paper.

	You really are your father's daughter!

Four Africans in khaki overalls are loading the truck -- super- vising the eviction of Emily are a white Soweto official, Captain Stolz and Lt. Venter. In the b.g., a hundred yards away is a "hippo" with black and white armed policemen. Behind the truck are two police Land Rovers.

Emily is sitting outside on one of her chairs as neighbors walk up to her to comfort her and say their goodbyes.

A woman in the crowd starts singing a freedom song: "UMZIMA LOMTHWALO" ("THIS BURDEN IS HEAVY"). The song is taken up by the other women.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Venter tries to stop them and disperse them. Stolz signals to him to leave them alone. One of the Africans then walks up to her for the chair. She refuses to get off the chair. The man looks at the white official as though to ask "what do I do." The official looks at Stolz. Venter walks up to Emily and, about to pull her off the chair.

Ben stops at a corner for a car and again the FOOTSTEPS stop.

He turns furtively and sees the man, stopped, turning his head. Ben decides to turn the corner, and listens to the FOOTSTEPS. The man is still following.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A very tense Ben is sitting on Professor Bruwer's chair. Melanie is curled up on the old settee.
</DIRECTION>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They don't know what you've got and you're a danger to them. I know there's a point of no return, but with our system, one has to plot the route with care.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the main reason for coming here tonight. Melanie, I need your help. Without Emily, we can't pursue our civil suit. The only thing left open to us is to expose them through the press, and the media here and abroad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And your safety also, Ben, lies in the press.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That way the world will know the brutality and power of our security services; here questions can be asked in Parliament. And the white public can appreciate the implications of the fascist laws of this country.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, Melanie, I'm discovering that the enemy is not in Soweto. The enemy is ourselves. Our bigotry, our laws, our system. We have our own fight and it's just beginning.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We better win before the blacks have won.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Ben and Melanie laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, before going to the press, I have to have all the documents. I must have two vital affidavits; Dr. Hassiem's, he's detained and Jonathan's friend, Wellington has fled to Zambia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zambia? I'm going to Rhodesia... I can go to Zambia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I can use my British passport. I know my way around Lusaka.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That would be very useful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Melanie jumps off the settee.
</DIRECTION>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This calls for a drink. Gin and tonic?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As Melanie walks away, Ben looks at her with admiration and tenderness... her dress swinging around her legs... her bare feet soundless on the floor... the quiet grace of her movement. On the way to the kitchen to get the drinks, Melanie goes to the record player. There's a record already on the turntable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly as if rising from a dream, Ben murmurs:
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Melanie. Be careful.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MELANIE>
<DIRECTION>
(as she plays the record and flippantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, Ben.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She goes into the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Melanie hums to herself to the BLUES MUSIC, in the kitchen, Ben walks over to the window and furtively glances out, to assure himself that nobody is watching. He takes then a book on a pile next to the settee and pages slowly through it. Melanie returns with two glasses, still in her happy mood. She places Ben's glass on the side table next to the settee, takes the book from him and makes him sit down.
</DIRECTION>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cheers!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<DIRECTION>
Ben raises his glass and touches it with hers.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do be careful. I wouldn't want you hurt.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches for his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MELANIE>
<DIRECTION>
(with gentleness)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And hurry back.

<DIRECTION>
A new track starts on the RECORD.
</DIRECTION>
<MELANIE>
<DIRECTION>
(excited)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my favorite, Ben.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Jumping up and taking Ben's glass and placing it on the side table, she pulls him to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't dance.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rugger player?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They laugh as they start to dance to the slow BLUES MUSIC. The laughing subsides as they hold each other closer. The dancing starts to lose the beat of the music. They look into each other's eyes and Ben envel- ops her tenderly in his arms hugging her as close as possible against him. They stop dancing. Ben kisses her. A long, warm and tender kiss. :SC: INT. MELANIE'S BEDROOM

He is kissing her and fondling her passionately. During the love play, Ben reaches for the lightswitch of the bedside lamp, and knocks it over. They make love.

:SC: INT. LOCAL SUPERMARKET - MORNING Ben is shopping at the local supermarket. He is pushing a trolley. As he places some groceries into his trolley, he notices a man standing near the check-out counters. The man is similar built as Jamie and similar hairstyle. He's reading a newspaper, his face concealed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben drops the package he was inspecting, back on the shelf and pushes his trolley towards the man to try and see his face. The man moves away. Ben follows him and has decided to confront him. Man picks up a pack of ham. Ben is about to remonstrate with him.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>

Just then a LADY and her daughter hurry to the man, push- ing a trolley. Man turns to look at Ben.

ON Johan looking at Suzette then at Ben with concern. :SC: EXT. INDIAN TOWNSHIP - DAY Ben has parked his car in a street corner of the upmarket section of the Asian township. He peers around him, then walks away. Ben knocks at a door. The door is opened cautiously by DR. HASSIEM, a tall, handsome Indian, aged 35 years. His clothes are casual but expensive. His six-year-old daughter, large dark eyes, is clinging to his leg. We recognize the little girl of the photograph near the telephone, from earlier.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Hassiem? I'm Ben Du Toit. I'm a friend of Gordon Ngubene's...

	Not for me, Doctor. I've got to know what happened to Gordon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Hassiem looks shaky, nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HASSIEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I only came home yesterday. After three months in detention and now I'm banned and confined to the house. There's nothing I can do for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The little girl still clinging to his leg, watching Ben.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know it may be painful to you, Doctor, but I need to talk to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DR_HASSIEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can I be sure you weren't actually sent by them?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ask Emily. Doctor, we are in the process of filing a civil claim. And your help is vital.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HASSIEM>

Hassiem gives Ben a long look. He picks up his daughter and opens the door fully.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HASSIEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come in.

Ben walks into the large living room, tastefully furnished.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down.
	</DIALOGUE>

Ben is still looking 'round at the opulence. He sits in a chair.

	Thank you for inviting me in.

<DR_HASSIEM>
<DIRECTION>
(the little girl on his knees)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want to know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HASSIEM>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just one thing, Doctor. Why did you sign the State Pathologist's report on the autopsy if you drew up your own report as well?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DR_HASSIEM>
<DIRECTION>
(disconcerted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What makes you think I signed Dr. Jansen's report.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The report produced in court had both your signatures on it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DR_HASSIEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Impossible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HASSIEM>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you write in your report?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DR_HASSIEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Jansen and I didn't disagree on the facts. After all we examined the same body in the same time. But just on the interpretation. For example, if Gordon, had really been hanged, the marks on his throat would have been concentrated on the front.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he touches his larynx)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But in this case, the bruises were more obvious on the sides.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. Ben nods, silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HASSIEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something else really upset me, perhaps it isn't important.

</DR_HASSIEM>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Hassiem puts down his daughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HASSIEM>
<DIRECTION>
(leaning forward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see, through a misunderstanding I arrived at the morgue too early for the autopsy. There wasn't a soul around except a young African attendant. When I told him I'd come for the autopsy, he let me in. The body was on the table dressed. I noticed blood on the clothes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DR_HASSIEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As I examined the clothes more closely, a police-officer came in and said I wasn't allowed in the morgue before Dr. Jansen arrived. When I returned with Dr. Jansen, half an hour later, the body was naked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HASSIEM>
<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(excited)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doctor, we've already got the African attendant's affidavit. He testified that Capt. Stolz ordered him to burn the clothes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you mention what you said in your report?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DR_HASSIEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. I found it most odd.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doctor Hassiem would you be prepared to put that in writing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Hassiem thinks it over for a while then:
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HASSIEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please excuse me for a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Ben watches him leave the room, the little girl following him. He gets up from the chair, walks to the window, glances through it, then steps to look at some family photographs on the mantlepiece. Amongst them a photograph of Dr. Hassiem before "Big Ben." Dr. Hassiem returns with a file, the daughter still following.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HASSIEM>
<DIRECTION>
(opening the file)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is my report. I only have one copy.

	You have a copy of the report?

Hassiem grins.

<DR_HASSIEM>

<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's fantastic, man.

	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<STANLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Are you going soft, Lanie? We must keep going even more so now. And for every bloke who's going to die of bloody natural causes in their hands. And for our children's future.
	</DIALOGUE>

On the photograph a naked man and a girl on a bed and a bedside lamp on its side. The man is Ben and the girl is Melanie. Stolz in sports jacket, standing next to the desk is speaking... patronizing.
</DIRECTION>
<STOLZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're all made of flesh and blood, Mr. Du Toit -- we've all got our flaws. And if a man likes to sample the grass on the other side of the fence, well, that's his own business. But it would be unpleasant if people found out about it, especially if he's a teacher.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean, if I cooperate, if I stop digging, embarrassing you, threatening you... these photographs will disappear.

Ben answers by a gesture.

<STOLZ>
<DIRECTION>
(after lighting his cigarette)

<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I think so and there's more to come.
	</DIALOGUE>

A pause.

	It's not possible, Captain. Not between you and me.

<STOLZ>

	It's high time, Mr. Du Toit, we allowed the dead to rest in peace. I'm offering you a chance.

<STOLZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that your final answer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOLZ>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before you go. I'll tell this, Captain. I have a pretty good idea of what I will eventually uncover. I mean the truth. And I won't allow anyone or anything to come between me and that truth.

Ben walks up to the door to see him out. There's no response from Stolz. He calmly takes a small card out of his pocket and rests it on Ben's desk.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What now, Captain?
	</DIALOGUE>
<STOLZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Word came to me that you were asking after your very good friend, Miss Bruwer. You know, subersives come in all guises and can be very resourceful. Now let's take your friend, she has been using her privilege as a journalist to endanger the security of this country. But you know something else? She has been secretly holding a British passport. A South African passport and a British pasport. Now you tell me, where is her patriotism? Her allegiance? The minister telexed to the immigration officers here declaring her an undesirable immigrant. So she is being put on the first available plane to London. This must be heart- breaking for you. Good afternoon, Meneer Du Toit, Johan.

Ben and Johan arriving at the house. An unsympathetic small crowd is there waiting... They react, murmuring in Afrikaans, watching them with hostility as Ben and Johan get out of the car and discover the chaos. The wreckage. The garage and Ben's study have been bombed. Johan leaves Ben and rushes to the house. The crowd starts to disperse. The entire tools cupboard has been methodically ripped apart and the contents strewn on the garage floor. Everything is half-burnt... charred... Ben has sunk onto the stool in total defeat. There's silence. Then Johan appears at the door. He hands Ben a large envelope -- in it, the file with all the papers. Ben looks up at Johan.
