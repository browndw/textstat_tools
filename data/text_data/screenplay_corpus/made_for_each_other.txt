EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - NEW YORK - MORNING LONG SHOT - SHOOTING DOWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pedestrian and vehicle traffic crowd the street in front of the office building. CAMERA CENTERS on one figure in the crowd, Johnny, who walks slowly along the sidewalk gazing steadily at something he carries in his hands. CAMERA MOVES DOWN AND SHOOTS OVER JOHNNY'S SHOULDER at what he is gazing at. It is a large photograph of Jane. CAMERA MOVES BACK TO A MEDIUM SHOT as Johnny continues on his way, still absorbed in the picture. A vicious bump from a passer-by yanks Johnny back from dream realms to the work-a-day world.

<DIRECTION>
By now he has reached an open elevator which is filling with people. The door of the elevator next to it opens and starts to discharge its passengers. A starter is stationed between the two elevators. A definite reaction from the starter as he sees Johnny. Johnny is about to enter the first elevator, then, seeing that the second one is empty, starts toward it. He finds his way barred by the starter who warmly grips his hand.

CLOSE SHOT - AT DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Judge Doolittle has entered and stands, frowning, in the midst of rice and old shoes. He's a formidable old codger who has terrified many a witness. Doolittle is somewhat deaf and wears an acousticon arrangement to facilitate his hearing. He has a habit of speaking in a very low voice, while all his employees have been trained to raise their voices in talking to him. Throughout the entire scene between Doolittle and Johnny, Doolittle will speak in a low voice and Johnny will speak loudly, almost shouting at times.

	No, sir! I mean -- well -- I don't know. It all happened rather suddenly. You see, we met on Boston Common the night I arrived, and I'd had a bite at Thompson's Spa -- and then I took a little stroll around the Common and -- and I saw her standing there -- she was just standing there -- she had a cinder in her eye.

	Don't you think marriage is a career in itself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<MRS_MASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, indeed! Emphatically! That's why one mustn't rush into it pell-mell. Marriage is a business -- a very serious business. A partnership in the strictest sense of the word. One must prepare for it. There are so many things to learn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MASON>

Jane looks at Johnny.

<JOHNNY>

	Well, Jane'll learn all of those -- after we're married.

	Well, Mother -- What do you mean -- do you mean we shouldn't --

</JOHNNY>
<MRS_MASON>

	Emphatically not! There's no reason for Jane to develop into a little household drudge. Oh, I hope you understand I have nothing against Jane. In fact, I like her -- I like her very much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MASON>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm glad you do, Mother, because... You remember a little while ago you asked Jane whether she'd come to New York to visit relatives?

Jane waits breathlessly.

	Well, as a matter of fact, she has come to New York to visit relatives. She's visiting some right now -- you see --

Mrs. Mason stares at them uncomprehensively for an instant. Her mouth opens and her hands go convulsively to her chest.

She rushes over and starts to chafe Mrs. Mason's wrists. Mrs. Mason is gasping for breath like a fish out of water. Johnny hovers over her, agonized and scared.

Mrs. Mason is stretched out on the divan. She looks as if she has just been brought home from the hospital. She speaks in a weary, martyred voice.

	Ohhhh... What's done is done. You'll have children of your own, I suppose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MASON>

CAMERA DRAWS BACK to take in Johnny and Jane sitting in chairs which face the divan. They are haggard and dishevelled.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MASON>

	And you'll love them and devote your life to them, and then they'll grow up and leave you and you'll say to yourself, it's all right, that's the way it is, you've served your purpose.

	I'll find a place to live, of course.

in the midst of a similar group bidding farewell to friends and relatives. All through the scene there is a constant movement of people in the background. Mrs. Mason tightly clutches a paper wrapped bag. A hoarse blast from the steamer and Mrs. Mason goes rigid.

	Take good care of him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MASON>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at Johnny an instant as if to fix his image in her mind, then throws her arms around him. Her embrace is much different than the one she gave Jane. She holds onto her son as if she never expected to see him again. Johnny is touched and embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, Mother. Aw now, Mother -- it's only two weeks, you know.

</JOHNNY>
<MRS_MASON>

She finally lets him go.

<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye.

She gives them what she thinks is a smile, but it's really a tense twisting of her lips. She starts to go, then she remembers something.

	Oh.

EXT. DOCK - CLOSE (MOVING) SHOT - MRS. MASON

INT. CORRIDOR - MED. SHOT

Johnny and Jane come into the corridor glancing at doors. Johnny has the heating pad under his arm. They find their stateroom and go up to the door numbered 504.

</JOHNNY>
<JANE>

Johnny lies on the other side of the bed, puts his arm around Jane and they sink back on the pillow.

<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's see. That's not so bad. Why there's oceans of room here.

INT. DINING ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her face grim, a large serving platter in her arms. CAMERA DRAWS BACK and we see she is serving Doolittle, squeezing up against him so that he is in a very awkward position. An appalling silence hangs over the table. From the condition of the various plates, we can see it is Annie's second time around. Doolittle manages to spear a slice. He puts it on his plate and is about to reach for another when he finds that Annie has moved on to Jane. A little bewildered, Doolittle places the serving fork and spoon on the edge of the platter. He has to reach across Jane to do this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP - EUNICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With one prong of her fork she spears the very end of a stalk of asparagus and pops it into her mouth -- with an expressive look at Carter, as if to say: whatever made me come here tonight?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP - CARTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shrugs, sticks his tongue against his cheek, looks ceilingward and makes cabalistic marks on the tablecloth with the end of his knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP - MRS. MASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She ignores her food and beats with her finger tips on the edge of the table. She seems to be nursing some secret grievance and stewing about it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP - JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He saws away at a piece of meat that is making a bum out of his knife. He gives up and leans forward with a gesture of his hand as if he is about to make a desperate effort to renew the conversation -- but the effort is abortive. He finds he has nothing to say.
</DIRECTION>

She turns to Doolittle.

Doolittle decides to start on his salad. He can't find a salad fork. With a crucified expression, he uses his meat fork. Annie starts toward the kitchen.

	But my business is cooking. You get somebody else to wash the diapers.

She turns and starts to exit. Jane calls after her, almost tearfully:

<JANE>

	You're --

<DIRECTION>
(with a wail)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	you're fired!

Over this comes the sound of a clock starting to strike twelve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ENTRY HALL - JANE AND JOHNNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hall is lighted only by a dim light from the living room. The sound of the clock striking continues. The sound of a key turning in the lock, the door opens, and Johnny enters. He is in dinner clothes, black overcoat, and scarf. He seems unusually dejected. He softly closes the door behind him and starts on tiptoes toward the bedroom, CAMERA TRUCKING WITH HIM. Attracted by the light from the living room, he stops in the doorway and looks in at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - JANE ON DIVAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(from his angle) Jane, in a warm bathrobe, is curled up asleep. On the floor by the divan is an open book, face up. A lamp on a nearby table is the only light in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tiptoes into the room, taking off his hat as he crosses and sits down on the floor near the divan, looks at Jane a moment, moody and licked. Then he notices the open book on the floor. He puts his elbows on his knees, cups his chin and stares at the open book.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT: BOOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a year book of Johnny's college, open at the page bearing Johnny's picture. Over Johnny's picture, the words "Class of 1928" and under Johnny's picture:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Most Likely to Succeed" JOHN HORACE MASON

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - DIVAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane stirs and opens her eyes, sees Johnny.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP - JOHNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(from Jane's angle) Unaware Jane has awakened, his expression still moody and despondent, staring at the book.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP - JANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From her expression we know that now she understands Johnny's mood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEDIUM SHOT

Smiling, Jane sits up, puts her arms around Johnny and kisses him.

<JOHNNY>

	Oh, just the same old crowd, only ten years older.

</JOHNNY>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who spoke, Johnny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ed O'Malley made quite a speech -- all about how he bought that seat on the stock exchange. And then Joe Kendall -- just got back from opening up a London office --

</JOHNNY>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you make a speech?

</JANE>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you tell them that funny story you told me yesterday?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- no, I didn't think of it. All I could think of was my achievements -- What I've accomplished and how far I've gone. I suppose I should have told them how I used your money -- all of it -- to buy the furniture for this apartment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, that's silly. Your money -- my money -- what's the difference? It wasn't much anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should have told them how the baby has to sleep in the dining room --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what of it? And it's only temporary -- till we get a new apartment --

Johnny and Jane enter. Jane proceeds to the ice box, opens it and starts to pry into it, taking things out.

	Now let's see. Here's some cheese you like. And a whole cold chicken staring us right in the face. Which?

</JANE>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chicken.

</JOHNNY>

Jane takes the platter and puts it on the kitchen table.

<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The trouble with you is you let people step on you! You do all the work in that office... Coffee?

</JANE>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Milk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Jane takes milk from the ice box and sets it on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've forgotten more about law than Carter'll ever know. How do you expect people to recognize your value if you don't recognize it yourself?... White or rye?

	Rye.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, Jane, how could I? What about --

</JANE>
<JOHNNY>

	If I lost my job --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you wouldn't! They'd never let you go! You're far too valuable! If you left, Doolittle would crawl to you on his hands and knees and beg you to come back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(wry laugh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On his hands and knees! You don't know Doolittle.

He reaches for her hand and looks at the simple wedding band on one finger.

	Remember the day in Boston when I got you this ring -- I promised to get you a better one later?

	I don't want a better one later.

</JANE>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You liked the platinum one with the diamonds.

</JOHNNY>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That can wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the mink coat can wait too, I suppose. Probably in about three hundred years I can afford to buy you one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you -- a man or a mouse?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A mouse!

</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Jane grabs the kitchen knife and waves it in front of Johnny as she talks:
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John Mason, you know what's the matter with you? You're too modest. You don't appreciate yourself... I do want that platinum ring! And I want a fur coat -- not the mink -- but a fur coat! And I want a honeymoon on the Normandie! And I want an apartment that's big enough for your mother and the baby -- so the baby wouldn't have to sleep in the dining room! You can get them for me! You can get everything I want -- everything that's coming to me! But first you've got to get what's coming to you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I only knew how to go about it --

</JOHNNY>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's easy.

</JANE>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think it's easy.

</JOHNNY>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just walk right into the office and you say --

</JANE>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jane, you don't walk into Judge Doolittle's office. He sends for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, this time you walk in. You go right up to him and you say: "Judge Doolittle, there's something I've got to say to you right now."
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't talk to him like that though.

</JOHNNY>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever tried?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now Jane, you don't understand. If I barged in there like that he'd -- he'd --

</JOHNNY>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'd say -- "What is it Mason? Sit down."
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He never asked me to sit down in his life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well then stand up. But don't let him interrupt you. Speak your piece.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah -- well now that -- speak your piece. It's easy to do here in the kitchen. You get downtown...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, downtown or uptown, what difference does it make? You're not asking a favor of him. You're demanding your rights. He'll listen. Make him listen.

<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right -- okay -- all right -- what'll I say?

Johnny stands there, gets a grip on himself and knocks timidly. Of course there is no response. Doolittle couldn't possibly have heard the knock. He knocks again, just as softly, and hearing no answer, turns and is about to go back to his office when Doolittle's voice comes through the door.

	I don't want to cut down the personnel of my staff if I can possibly help it. -- Wouldn't be constructive. So the only way out -- as I can see it -- is to tighten our belts. I'm asking everyone to take a twenty-five percent cut. I'm starting by taking a substantial cut in my own personal drawing account. It's a sacrifice, but it hits all of us. These are days of sacrifice!

INT. ENTRY HALL - CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny enters. We can see at once that our hero has sought comfort and slight consolation in the grape. He has had a few drinks and his courage has obviously been falsely bolstered by the liquor. He is slightly tight but in no sense drunk. He glares defiantly ahead, then slams the door violently shut.

Making as much noise as possible, Johnny goes into the living room, turns on the switch which lights the central lighting fixture, and goes from lamp to lamp turning them all on. Then he stomps into the dining room, still making as much noise as possible, turns on all the dining room lights, and stomps on out to the kitchen.

Now the sound of running water from the bathroom. Jane looks toward the bathroom with lowered lids, shakes her head, thinking what to do.

CLOSE SHOT - JOHNNY

Johnny sits upright -- flings the blankets off and stares at his feet. He has forgotten to take off his shoes. He swings over and sits on the edge of the bed, bending down to take off his shoes. His fumbling fingers have trouble with the shoe laces. Jane enters.

There is a silence. She looks up to find Johnny staring at her. His face is such a mask of misery she can hardly stand it. She rises from her kneeling position, sits on the edge of the bed alongside of him, takes him in her arms and hugs him tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>

	Johnny, Johnny, look at me and tell me you don't feel bad!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Another second's pause, then Johnny slowly lifts his head with a grimace he thinks is a smile. His eyes are wet. Jane sees his expression and starts to cry. He is completely ashamed, puts his arms around her, and attempts to comfort her.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>

INT. LIVING ROOM - MASON APARTMENT - FULL SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(New Year's Eve)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room presents a sorry contrast to the gay revelry going on outside. There is a distinct aura of let-down and depression. Sitting in an easy chair is Mrs. Mason a shawl over her shoulder, sniffing at a tube of benzedrine and quite miserable from a cold. Johnny, in evening clothes, is sprawled on a window seat playing with the baby's toy cat, winding it up and listening morosely to the music-box tune. The only sound, except for what drifts in from the celebration in the street, is the tune from the music-box. Jane's wrap and Johnny's overcoat are draped over a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP - MRS. MASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She opens her mouth, fights it a moment, then sneezes violently.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure Carter has our telephone number?

</JANE>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If he hasn't he certainly has a telephone book.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why do you suppose he hasn't at least called up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<MRS_MASON>
<DIRECTION>
(sniffing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps he forgot all about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MASON>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mother, a man doesn't invite you to a New Year's Eve party and then just forget about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we ought to go join him at the party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(a little exasperated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jane, I told you I don't know where the party is. He said he'd call for us here in his car at nine o'clock sharp.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's almost eleven now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<MRS_MASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't the party also to announce his engagement to Eunice Doolittle?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MASON>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<MRS_MASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, perhaps he thought it might be a little awkward to have you and Jane at his engagement party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MASON>
<JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(sharply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, Mother! How could it be awkward?

</JOHNNY>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Awkward or not awkward -- are we going to sit here all night waiting for him? Let's call him up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny drops the cat to the floor, rises and exits to outer hall.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MASON>

<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why should it be awkward?

Before Mrs. Mason has a chance to go into detail, there is the sound of a little sneeze from the direction of the dining room. Jane quickly starts in that direction.

Johnny viciously dialing his number. Jane passing in b.g. on way to dining room.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - JANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses the baby on the cheek, then puts her hand over his forehead, and straightens up, CAMERA PANNING WITH HER. She looks off toward Mrs. Mason in the next room, presses her lips together and shakes her head disgustedly. Johnny's voice drifts in from off scene as he calls Carter's house.

First Johnny enters from the hall, then Jane enters from the dining room.

	He caught his cold from you, Mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<MRS_MASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's simply ridiculous! Matter of fact, I caught my cold from the baby. He's had sniffles all day. When I took his temperature --

</MRS_MASON>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's when he caught your cold.
	</DIALOGUE>

</MRS_MASON>

	Now, Mother, that's silly. You don't have to do anything of the kind!

	Oh, Mother, please -- it's New Year's Eve!

INT. LIVING ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - JOHNNY

He stands a moment, defeated and miserable -- then the flame of revolt registers in his face. He looks down at the floor and sees the baby's white cat where he had previously dropped it.

</JANE>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm crazy about him!... And about you too! I'd die for either of you. Jane, everybody that passes this table stops and looks at you. It's because you're young and so beautiful -- your whole life ahead of you --

Jane leans back in her chair. She tries desperately to seem matter-of-fact.

	Well -- you ought to know all about contracts.

	Well, anyway, I suppose this is what you'd call starting the New Year right!

</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny is too miserable to say anything. Jane tries to make her smile breezy and gay. She reaches for her glass of wine.

<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least we've finally got something we can celebrate.

	Happy New Year.

</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
He clicks glasses with her. Jane sips the wine and then bends her head forward to hide her face from him for an instant. He looks helplessly across the table at her and is about to say something when she lifts her head. Her eyes are wet but she flashes him a dazzling smile.

CLOSE (MOVING) SHOT - JOHNNY AND JANE DANCING

They dance silently. A thunderous roll of drums comes into the Shot and all the dancers stop to turn toward the musicians.
</DIRECTION>

CLOSE SHOT - ORCHESTRA STAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trap drummer plays a rolling of drums to usher in the New Year.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - CAFE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A crescendo of sounds -- whistles and other noise-making devices from the outside blend with the increasing shouts, yells of HAPPY NEW YEAR within the cafe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights go out -- a whirling crystal ball from the ceiling of the cafe starts to turn -- various colored flash-lights play against it and cross each other, creating weird lighting effects. From above a bunch of colored balloons tumble down. Everybody in the near dark starts exchanging New Year's kisses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - JOHNNY AND JANE IN THE CROWD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look off at all the other revelers exchanging kisses. Johnny and Jane seem to be the only ones who aren't kissing. They look at each other embarrassed, and Jane, as always, takes the initiative, looks into his eyes and then kisses him tenderly. Johnny starts to put his arms around her, but doesn't. The orchestra off scene strikes up "Auld Lang Syne." The people sing. Johnny and Jane, holding hands, start to sing with frantic efforts at a gaiety that they try to wring from their leaden hearts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After the first four lines, Jane can no longer control her emotions, and she turns and starts away to keep from bursting into tears. The singing continues.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>

	I think I'll go phone the house and wish the baby a Happy New Year.

(her face in Camera)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Auld Lang Syne" still continuing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane fights her way quickly through the crowd, tears streaming from her eyes. A hundred balloons come from the ceiling -- bibulous gents stretch arms out to stop her, but she proceeds, fighting her way up toward a telephone booth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People call to her as she presses through, but Jane pays no attention. One woman, seeing the tears in Jane's eyes, calls:
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Crying Jag!

A happy drunk brushes past her:

One of the balloons floats in front of Jane's face. A man's hand with a cigar comes in, and pops the balloon.

Serpentine and long paper whistles unfold in front of her face.

MED. SHOT JOHNNY AND JANE'S TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny edges his way past people and sits down at the table, leaden-hearted and miserable. At an adjoining table a party is in progress, singing and chattering and having a particularly good noisy time. A blonde at this table, looks over and sees Johnny. She moves her chair an inch backward, tilts it, so her face is nearly in Johnny's.

A chorus of hilarious greetings from the people at the table, with invitations to join them and have a drink. Johnny is resisting the efforts to make him take a seat at their table when Jane rushes up, wild-eyed, panicky.

The ambulance is lined up at the curb. Out of the sounds of the New Year's Eve revelry back of this comes the starting of an ambulance siren. CAMERA PULLS BACK FARTHER as the ambulance pulls away from the curb and with the noise of the siren increasing, starts away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the same time the ambulance starts away we see a taxi pull in to take the place of the departing ambulance. As it comes to a stop with a grinding of brakes, from it emerges Johnny and Jane. Fear-stricken, they look after the departing ambulance, then rush over to Doctor Healy and Mrs. Mason who stand at the curb. Doctor Healy carries his satchel.

Without it, we don't stand a chance. With it, well, perhaps we have a ghost of a chance. We must get some of that serum as soon as possible. Every hour counts. I don't know whether we can locate any of it in the city or not. I'm going to check up on that right away.

JOHNNY - BIG CLOSE UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking at Jane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE TWO SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny gently strokes her hair. He speaks with a strange, new-found serenity.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll always be together, Jane -- no matter what happens -- like this, always.

He continues stroking her hair, and we hold on this a moment, then.

SLOWLY DISSOLVE OUT:

EXT. FIELD - CLOSE SHOT - THE PARACHUTE TANGLED UP IN THE LOWER BRANCHES OF A TREE - NIGHT - FOG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS DOWN the tattered chute to the body of Conway, limply sprawled out on the wet ground. We hold for a moment. CAMERA MOVES UP to a CLOSER SHOT. We hold a moment on his motionless figure, then we see the body stir.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP - CONWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His face is scratched and filthy. He opens his eyes, lifts himself up with a grimace of pain. He stares for a moment at his left foot, then starts to disengage the harness of the chute. He remembers something and sticks his right hand frantically on the inside of his coat. His hand comes out with the package of serum. It is safe. He manages a grin through his pain and puts it back inside his coat. He looks around, tries to get to his feet, and realizes he can't walk. His leg is broken. CAMERA TRUCKS WITH HIM as he starts to crawl along the muddy field through the fog.

LONG SHOT - CONWAY

Crawling along the field. As his body is lost in the fog, we

LONG SHOT - FARMHOUSE - (FOG)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The farmhouse stands alone. Conway's figure is dimly seen on his knees knocking at the door. From o.s., the sound of a dog barking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A light goes on in an upstairs window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FARMHOUSE - CLOSE SHOT - AT DOOR - NIGHT - FOG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Conway on his knees before the door, pounding on it with his knuckles. From o.s., the sound of the dog barking. The door opens and a sleepy, bewildered farmer with an overcoat over his full-length underwear in which he has undoubtedly been sleeping is seen. Behind him, carrying a kerosene lamp, is the farmer's wife with a shabby robe over her nightgown.

Farmer and his wife go to Conway, half lift him up and drag him over the threshold.

INT. FARMHOUSE - MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Farmer and his wife helping Conway into the room. They stare, frightened, and bewildered at the strange figure they have let in out of the night.
</DIRECTION>
<FARMER>

Suddenly Conway sways and his eyes close. He falls to the floor in a dead faint.
</DIRECTION>
<FARMER_S_WIFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, for mercy sakes alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FARMER_S_WIFE>
<DIRECTION>
The farmer drops to his knees beside Conway. He turns the unconscious form over and looks down into Conway's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the farmer catches sight of the package of serum which is protruding from the open front of Conway's flying suit. The farmer pulls the package out and stares at it.
</DIRECTION>
<FARMER>
<DIRECTION>
(reading the label)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	St. Francis Hospital, New York City. Rush.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FARMER>
<DIRECTION>
The significance of the package dawns on him. He rises and hurries to the telephone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The phone is an old fashioned one, used only in rural districts. The farmer turns the handle and the bell rings the signal for the operator; he then takes down the receiver and speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<FARMER>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello -- hello -- operator, I want the St. Francis Hospital, New York City.

He reaches the door to the waiting room and throws it open.

INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - CLOSE SHOT

Jane is sitting near the window, asleep, worn out with worry and strain. She hears Johnny coming in and wakes up with a start.

Jane looks at Johnny -- a silent question in her eyes.

INT. DOOLITTLE'S OFFICE

CAMERA DRAWS BACK to reveal Johnny pacing before the two brothers. He is orating great guns. At his desk, Doolittle is seated, and standing behind him are several other members of the staff, which include the hitherto nebulous, Messerschmidt, Hutch and the other Doolittle. They are all watching and listening to Johnny with the greatest respect and attention. It is obvious that Johnny is now the fair- haired boy of the firm.
