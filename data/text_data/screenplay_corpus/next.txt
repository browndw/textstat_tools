Thirty feet square. CRIS JOHNSON, wearing a jail uniform, sits in a HEAVY CHAIR that is bolted to the floor. Mid- twenties, jaded, rebellious, handsome as a statue, Cris radiates a serene, if somewhat scruffy, charisma.

He faces a PLASMA SCREEN MONITOR on a bare wall. To the left of the screen, an unframed MIRROR; to the right, a DIGITAL CLOCK-CALENDAR.

Cris strides crisply through the casino. Sees another PAIR OF BLACK SUITS, scanning for him. He ducks into the maze of slots. Zigs and zags from aisle to aisle, seemingly at random. A moment after each turn, a Black Suit appears ahead, behind, or to the side - where they would have spotted Cris.

Cris studies the gamblers playing the machines nearby, then heads to a particular spot - where he is sure to be spotted - except that a TEXAS-SIZED MAN repositions himself, blocking the Black Suit's view.
</DIRECTION>

The Black Suit moves on. Cris shifts to another spot just as a different Black Suit arrives at the other end of the aisle. This time, THREE FRAT BOYS change machines and obscure Cris from his gaze.

Cris continues into the...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kitchen area
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Passing a room service cart, he rolls it in front of him. A few steps on, he takes the bottle of OLIVE OIL on the cart and pours some in front of one random closed door. Cris then shoves the room service cart down the hall toward an empty intersecting corridor. A Black Suit barrels into the empty intersection just as the cart arrives - and tumbles over it. Behind Cris, a door swings open; a Black Suit charges out; steps precisely into the puddle of poured olive oil - and falls on his ass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cris slips by him, but gets cut off by an arriving group of FOUR MORE BLACK SUITS. Big guys. They try to grab him. He evades their grasp almost magically and, like a Shaolin Monk, somehow leverages them into each other until they are in a pile on the floor. Cris darts around them into the...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lobby
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He co-opts a luggage cart that is loaded up for delivery. Rolling it to the left, a Black Suit on that side doesn't see him - and moves on. Cris switches to the right side of the card - just as a second Black Suit would have seen him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abandoning the cart, Cris sets off across the lobby in a herky-jerky rhythm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks four quick steps without being seen. Then stops behind a column just as Black Suit 1 turns his way. When Black Suit 1 looks on, Cris resumes his journey, cutting across the lobby at an acute angle. In this way, he avoids being seen by Black Suit 2. Cris now backs up three steps and avoids being seen by Black Suit 3.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By precisely choosing his movements and knowing where his hunters will be looking, Cris achieves something like invisibility.
</DIRECTION>

The last obstacle to daylight is Ferris. She sees him. He makes a run for the door. She dashes after him.

As if on cue, both Laundry Guys turn and bend to pick up another sack of clothes. Cris walks right by them without being noticed -- and climbs into the truck. A moment later, the Laundry Guys pivot back around, toss sacks of clothes in after Cris, and slam the rear doors. They get in the truck and drive off just as Ferris, Davis, and several Black Suits arrive to find a cold trail.

Puzzled, Cris looks up and around to see the object that's being reflected. He can't find it. Cris turns back to the display case, but the reflection is gone. The DONUT GIRL gives him his order.

Cris takes it, turns, and notices LIZ COOPER sitting by herself at a booth, circling items in the classified section. He recognizes her as the future mother of his future child.

Cris gazes at her face, which is both childish and mature, shy yet indomitable.

Cris lays some money on the bar, and they head for the door. But before they get there, Randy sees Liz and bounds after her, holding a pool cue. He's much bigger and taller than Cris.

	Easy, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Randy hauls off to slug Cris. Cris easily ducks the blow and answers with a solid punch to the belly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Randy recovers and realizes he's up against a skilled opponent. He takes a stance, ready to get serious. He sticks a few jabs at Cris, who easily slips from each one, like he saw them coming a mile away. Randy goes for a hook. Cris feints and lands an uppercut to Randy's chin. Most men would go down, but Randy is so big, he stays up to take more punishment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cris delivers an elegant beating that humiliates the big guy and makes him look like an oaf. Cris puts an end to it by breaking Randy's nose. The big guy falls to his knees, bleeding.

Liz rushes to Randy's side, holding her ex and glowering up at Cris like he's a sadistic brute.

He lowers himself onto the sofa next to the table lamp. She comes close and gingerly wipes the blood from his nose and lips.
</DIRECTION>
<LIZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never minded that I was the more devoted one. Somebody's gotta be more this or more that.

He looks in her eyes.

Cris comforts her. She looks up into his eyes expectantly.

Fighting the pull, he looks away for a moment to see where this is going - then glances back at her, almost dizzy.
</DIRECTION>

He kisses her with a quiet intensity that quickly ignites.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their lovemaking unfolds as it would be experienced by Cris. Effect before cause. The pleasure, then the gesture that elicits it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cris explores her body until she sighs, then snapsback and goes directly to the sweet spot. He strings together a perfect melody of shudders and moans, without striking any false notes along the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moments are superimposed, diaphonous, played against each other in counterpoint.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Visual harmonics, elastically out-of-sync. Rising to a crescendo. Until all the futures resolve into a single now.

<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:

<DIRECTION>
AFTERWARDS - nIGHT

Floating in bed. Her head on his chest. His eyes open, sadly content, like he wishes he could stop time here forever. Like he's afraid it will all disappear if he takes his eyes off her.

Cris grows distracted. Out the corner of his eye, he sees a SPORTS CAR gunning it down the street, passing a SUNDAY DRIVER to beat a red light. At that moment, a kid misses a catch and a BASEBALL rolls into a street, where a twenty-ish WOMAN JOGGER runs over to get it, just as the sports car passes the Sunday driver, sees the jogger, and skids, forcing A BUS to swerve and plow into a GROUP OF PEOPLE standing at the corner.

Ignoring them, Cris turns toward the street where he saw the accident take place. He sees kids, but they're jumping rope. Wrong group. He scans around and finds the kids who are playing softball. Someone misses a catch. The ball rolls toward the street. The sports car is now coming fast. The woman jogger sees the errant ball and runs to fetch it.

She's wearing earbuds and can't hear him. He's too far away to grab her. He's closer to the approaching sports car. Cris picks up a rock, prepares to throw, hesitates a beat, squints....

He throws. Misses. Snapback. Throws. Misses. Snapback. Again. Again. Scores a hit. Snapback. Opens his eyes and hurls the stone.

Liz and the bystanders watch, appalled, as the rock SHATTERS the driver side window of the sportscar, which instead of skidding, screeches to a halt. The bus drives by without incident, injuring no one.

Tries the window. Bars across it - that weren't there before. Shakes them. Solidly bolted. Looks outside. No one's around. He's about to shout, but stops himself.

MED TECHS perform a battery of tests on Cris and Liz. Wisdom, Baines, and Ferris watch through glass in an adjoining room.

WHITE VESTIBULE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Size of an elevator. Cris stands there, bound ankle and wrist. Click, the metal shackles open automatically and drop to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cris reaches down for them. Possible weapon. Struggles to lift them. Can't.

Ferris, Baines, and Wisdom peer down into the White Vestibule through a window. Technicians operate a control panel.
</DIRECTION>
<WISDOM>

	Aren't you being a little over- cautious?

Cris gives up on the chains and sullenly steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHITE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Size of a squash court. Cris enters gingerly and peers around. Twenty feet up, an OBSERVATION WINDOW, opaque. On the other walls, RIFLE BARRELS poke through NARROW SLITS. The door slides shut behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Observation room

Ferris leans forward and speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cris, we'll be firing at you with live ammo. Are you ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<WISDOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're shooting your secret weapon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WISDOM>
<DIRECTION>
Ferris signals Wisdom to be patient. Cris just stands there, flatfooted, arms folded, unafraid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ferris nods. A Techie presses a button. The THREE RIFLES FIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cris is hit square in the chest!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By THREE BLUE PAINTBALLS.
</DIRECTION>
<CRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you've got more than that.

<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now we are going to use live ammo.

</FERRIS>
<WISDOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not on my watch, you're not.

</WISDOM>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I promise you, he won't be hit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Wisdom looks her in the eye. Sees her certainty.
</DIRECTION>
<WISDOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's your experiment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WISDOM>
<DIRECTION>
Ferris leans toward a microphone, but before she can speak...
</DIRECTION>
<CRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"From now on, Cris, the bullets are real."
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Ferris sits back and nods to the techies to proceed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BARE WHITE CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cris balances, at the ready, as the three rifles take aim at him. He LUNGES at the very instant that one rifle FIRES. A bullet ZINGS by his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the second rifle fires, Cris contorts -- and a bullet parts his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the third rifles fires, he tumbles away, almost a blur.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More shots, in rapid sequence, erratic rhythm. Two at a time. Three at a time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like a pinball, Cris pivots, crouches, dodges every bullet. Then suddenly stops. Stands there. An easy target. Click, click, click, the guns are out of bullets.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's almost impossible to shoot, hit, surprise, capture, or contain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<WISDOM>

	Mind if I try?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WISDOM>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be my guest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Wisdom takes out his handgun, carefully aims, and discharges six shots at Cris - doesn't score a hit.
</DIRECTION>
<WISDOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know it's prevision? Maybe he's reading minds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WISDOM>
<DIRECTION>
Ferris shows the aiming gantries to Wisdom.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No minds to read. The guns are aimed automatically by infrared.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<WISDOM>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What other tricks can he do?

Ferris pushes a toggle, and a pocket door slides open in a wall.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please step into the next room.

</CRIS>
<BAINES>

</DIRECTION>

	The floor is electrified. He must have tried resisting and foreseen the result.

</BAINES>
<DIRECTION>
Cris walks through the doorway into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SMALLER WHITE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
which is familiar from the opening sequence, but not exactly the same. Because it's not exactly the same future. A HEAVY CHAIR, bolted to the floor, faces a PLASMA SCREEN MONITOR on the wall. To the left of the screen is a MIRROR; to the right, a DIGITAL CLOCK-CALENDAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ferris' FACE appears on the monitor.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
(ON MONITOR)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cris, it's time to get started with the next test. This won't be unpleasant. We just need to you sit in the chair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Cris eyes the chair with suspicion.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
(ON MONITOR)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to look ahead, tell me the time on the clock and then tell me what film clip you see playing. Let's start with five minutes from now. Then we'll press ahead as far as you're capable of.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Wisdom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The clips have been assembled at random by a computer, so nobody knows what'll be playing next.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Cris looks into the mirror and sees his face reflected - as an old man. He turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<CRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I'll stand here and tell you what I see.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<CRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You tie me down and never let me out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Wisdom looks at Ferris. She shrugs, sheepish.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's only because you won't cooperate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<CRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because you're trying to force me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRIS>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Work with us, Cris, and you can be a hero. Fight us, and things will get worse and worse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Cris squints, frustrated, looking for a way out.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
(ON MONITOR) (severe)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now sit in the chair. One. Two. Three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Ferris switches the toggle. The sizzle of electricity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cris hops and jumps in agony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ferris turns away, then makes herself look.
</DIRECTION>
<WISDOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa, you are one tough bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WISDOM>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're still in a Code Red if I'm not mistaken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
She turns off the juice.
</DIRECTION>
<WISDOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He knew he'd get shocked, but he chose to resist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WISDOM>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's almost never had to face consequences.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(flips toggle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cris, are you ready to get in the chair?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Cris, recovering, shoots her the finger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She switches the toggle again - and leaves it on. Wisdom doesn't have the stomach to watch.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need information, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Cris collapses, unconscious.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave him there. We'll start again when he recovers.

INT. Wisdom's office - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wisdom and Ferris are both traumatized by the torture.
</DIRECTION>
<WISDOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, how do we use him to find the bombs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WISDOM>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Simple. We make him watch the news and tell us about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<WISDOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How far ahead can he see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WISDOM>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. But I suspect we can increase his range with practice. Especially if we restrict his future to only watching news. Then he'll be like a timescope.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Wisdom nods.
</DIRECTION>
<WISDOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were right. This is huge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WISDOM>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is just for starters. You want to stage a pre-emptive strike, he can tell you if you'll hit the target and whether they hit back and what went wrong. And you can do this over and over until you get it perfect before you begin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Wisdom chuckles at the enormity of the potential.
</DIRECTION>
<WISDOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And all he's ever done with it is a little gambling and securities fraud?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WISDOM>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, it's amazing; but he's not ambitious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<WISDOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn, how will we control this guy when he figures out what he's capable of?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WISDOM>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We control him now. We just have to keep it that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<WISDOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right now, sweetheart, we can't even get him to sit in a chair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WISDOM>
<DIRECTION>
Dread suddenly washes over Wisdom.
</DIRECTION>
<WISDOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got to think this through. Your friend could be more dangerous than the terrorists.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WISDOM>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you running ahead of yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<WISDOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With this guy, you have to. Or it'll be over before it begins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WISDOM>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So we'll keep him in chains.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<WISDOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That may not be enough. We may have to cut off his arms and legs. Then I might start to feel safe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WISDOM>
<DIRECTION>
Ferris grins uncomfortably.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not serious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<WISDOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think about it. What we're talking about here is the next step in human evolution. And I'm not gonna make the same mistake the Neanderthals made when they ran across this good-looking Homo Sapien fellow and all the lady Neanderthals said, "He's so cute. Let's keep him around."
	</DIALOGUE>
</WISDOM>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we deal with your sexual insecurities at another time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FERRIS>
<WISDOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean after it's too late?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WISDOM>
<DIRECTION>
Ferris seems to come around to Wisdom's logic.
</DIRECTION>
<FERRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish you'd given me a chance to chain him up before you decided to prune him into a stump.
	</DIALOGUE>

They are both filled with dread.

Cris rises from the floor into a crouched position, like an animal ready to pounce.

The door flies open and A DOZEN ARMED MP's charge in, rifles at the ready, and surround Cris. Cris checks the time on the digital clock. It's 5:12 PM.

</WISDOM>
<DIRECTION>
WHITE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Motionless, in a crouch...Cris suddenly dashes between two MP's, shoves them aside, makes for the door. He gets smashed by the RIFLE BUTTS of the nearest ones, then stomped by the full contingent. [Attempt #1]
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AREA OUTSIDE THE White ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ferris and Wisdom arrive and look through the window.
</DIRECTION>

Cris is alone in the room, in that crouched position. No MP's. What we've just seen...hasn't happened yet.

Baines arrives with THE DOZEN ARMED MP's we saw in the previous scene.

	Wait for my signal, then go in and surround him.

</WISDOM>
<DIRECTION>
Wisdom and Ferris hurry upstairs into the Observation Booth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We pass through the wall into the...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
White room
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where in some future Cris is once again surrounded by the Dozen MP's who are actually outside, waiting to charge in. Suddenly, Cris pounces low at one soldier's hips, shoving him into the soldier next to him, which knocks over a third soldier. Cris dashes for the door, but four MP's pull him away before he can get out. [Attempt #2]
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Observation ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ferris and Wisdom enter and look down at Cris, who crouches alone, motionless, in the White Room. Ferris prepares to speak to him. Wisdom interrupts.

	I'll do the talking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WISDOM>
<DIRECTION>
Wisdom goes to the microphone.

	Cris, this Eric Wisdom. I'm the director of this facility. We're in the middle of a Code Red, and we'd like your help in preventing a major catastrophe.

White room
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cris, once again surrounded by the same Dozen MP's, suddenly punches one of them, kicks another, and now has the mobility to start using his Tai Chi moves. But the other MP's gang up on him and pile on, burying him under their weight. [Attempt #3]

Cris runs to the door and tries to bar it so they can't enter. He gets shoved aside by the force of the MP's as they charge in. [Attempt #4]

Faster and faster, over and over, Cris relives the attack, perfecting his movements, finding new opportunities. His skill increases with each iteration as he anticipates every soldier's action and counters it with the greatest economy of means. [Attempts #7-12]
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fight takes on the quality of choreography as the MP's seem to step right into Cris' punches and kicks. Cris flips and throws them into each other, leveraging their movements to achieve his goals with perfect efficiency.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elegantly slips past all the MP's into the hall - and slams the door behind him, locking them in!

The escape has the quality of magic. It takes a beat for the MP's to realize what has happened.

Cris. Running. MP's and general Security Police close behind. No place to hide. Soldiers open fire. Cris dives for the floor, tumbles, gets to his feet, serpentines, and ends up behind a door that opens at the moment, as if by mental command, shielding him from gunfire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Security Police pour out from the other side. Cris reaches around and grabs someone's gun. He opens fire, buying himself enough cover to get to a doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cris stops, thinks, then charges out shooting, fighting, running -- completing a condensed burst of four impossible tasks that get him to the next point of refuge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He waits, thinks, charges and, with another burst of choreographed action, makes it into an elevator whose doors conveniently open at that moment. He darts inside, keeps shooting, presses certain buttons - starting several stories up, and waits for the doors to close.

Cris takes a deep breath and crawls forward. Remarkably, he seems to be CRAWLING OUT OF HIS MOTIONLESS BODY like a snake shedding its skin! - In fact, Cris 1 lies there in deep concentration, while Cris 2 creeps onward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXPLORATION SEQUENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cris drops down from a ventillator shaft into an office. He opens the door, walks into a corridor, and strides forward, preternaturally calm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He advances through an unfolding panorama of "stage sets" on which different hypothetical scenarios play out, one at a time, several simultaneously, or layered in like the melodic themes in a round or fugue, creating the visual equivalent of harmony and counterpoint.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cris encounters Security Police searching for him. When they discover Cris, they aim their weapons at him. He checks the time. Snapback a few seconds. He hides before they arrive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes through a door into a room. People are there. Snapback. Hides in a different room. It's empty. Cris searches the room. Looks in the desk drawers. Puts things in his pockets. The door flies open. Security Police find him and shoot. Snapback.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cris treads down empty corridors. He multiplies into a legion of Cris Johnsons, duplicated again and again, as he explores room after room, searching them sequentially. Simultaneously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He spends much time in a Handyman's Storeroom, while other Cris Johnson's fade away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cris 27 finds the surveillance room with Leo in charge. Cris scans the room. He is seen. He waits to see who will shoot him first. He is hit in the chest. Fade out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cris 35 gets caught by two Security Police. He fights them, takes their guns, but gets killed by reinforcements.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cris 63 waits in a room and peers through a crack in the door as his POV FAST FORWARDS, and he charts the comings and goings of the search parties, until they discover him, at which point he snapsback and hides in a different room. He's hiding in many rooms simultaneously. Spying. Piecing together the schedule of the patrol in that corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same situations repeat. Scanning for security cameras. Fighting. Winning. Losing. Dying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes down a stairwell. One version of himself exits at a landing. A second iteration of himself continues to the next floor down. At that landing, two iterations of himself turn in different directions, left and right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow the one that went to the left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees MP's taking Liz from her holding room and escorting her somewhere else.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He follows. Gets seen. By her. By them. Snapback.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is waiting in several locations, watching to see where the MP's will emerge with Liz. The MP's and Liz emerge from an elevator in one of the locations. The other Cris' fade out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liz is ushered into a room and locked inside. Four guards depart. Two guards remain posted outside. They see Cris.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He runs down stairs. Into the corridor. Into the room directly under the room where Liz is being held.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cris enters A FORENSICS LAB where the captured bomb is being studied. There is a barrel of C4 PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE. MP's in the room turn on him and open fire. Cris is blasted and falls to the floor, dead. Snapback to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

int. ground floor of facility - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guards stand in a solid line. No way out. Cris off to one side, in a niche just inside the door. Camera pans and finds a second Cris standing back, away from an exit. Pans and finds a legion of Cris Johnsons, duplicated again and again, trying each exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At one dim exit, he lies on the ground, charred and dead, next to the gauntlet of MP's he has tried to outrun.

INT. NEAR THE LOBBY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cris is still trying to get out the front door, but there's one Soldier, call him CRACK SHOT, who kills Cris repeatedly. Cris snapsback and tries various tactics, but he can't get past Crack Shot alive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gives up. Turns and runs back into the heart of the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cris' mental pov expands to include the entire facility, like a crystal doll house. Simultaneously, he is observing every room, present in every room, charting the place, testing possible actions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The facility is a bee hive of activity. A bee hive that accelerates to fast forward -- until all times are simultaneous. Until the simultaneous activity is made even denser by the accumulated layers of possibility.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cris-134 spies Ferris and Wisdom walking together. He follows them for a while, until he is discovered. Cris-134 fades out. The Ferris and Wisdom who saw him fade out. But another Ferris and Wisdom continue through the building, and their trail gets picked up by Cris-62, who has detoured in order to encounter them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Cris' goals are accomplished, superfluous versions of himself fade away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The surveillance of a sequence of Ferris-and-Wisdoms is continued by Cris-91, then Cris-14, who watches as Wisdom and Ferris approach two guards standing outside an INTERROGATION ROOM. We recognize them as the MP's who are guarding Liz, inside. Wisdom is let into the Interrogation Room by the MP's. Ferris proceeds into a nearby office alone.

SNAPBACK TO:

vENTILLATION duct

Cris comes out of his trance. Checks his watch. Sixteen minutes have passed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cris composes his thoughts, takes a breath, then crawls forward, leaving no Cris behind. Now it's for real.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment after he rounds a corner, A FLASHLIGHT BEAM stabs into the duct that he vacated. It scans around. Withdraws.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOTE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The situations that Cris has just previewed from the Ventillator Shaft constitute the raw material that he will now re-craft into a single narrative: the story of his actual escape attempt, staged in long takes, unfolding in almost- real time. When appropriate, to illustrate Cris' ability, we will portray several locations simultaneously via split- screens which change in number, size, shape, and placement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HANDYMAN'S STOREROOM - DAY

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CORRIDOR

Empty. A door opens. Cris steps out into the hall carrying the backpack and a foot stool. He stays close to a wall, steps on the foot stool, and spray-paints over the lens of a surveillance camera.

SOLDIER KYLE and his TROOP charge out off the stairwell. Each one steps directly into the polish and slips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they fall, Cris punches them out or puts them in chokeholds, utilizing the elegant minimum of force or violence. Child's play. As soon as they are unconscious, Cris takes their guns, tear gas, and a gas mask.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens fire at the video monitors, shattering every one.

By the time the MP's are ready to respond, Cris reaches and grabs Baines' handgun. He swings out into the corridor with Baines' gun in his hand...Without looking, his hand aims and shoots several times.

Emerging into the hallway, Cris looks down at the end of the hall and sees two MP's falling to the floor, wounded.

We expect them to find Cris. But they don't.

Outside, in the hall, a pencil rolls on the floor toward Liz. She notices it and looks where it came from. Sees Cris, hiding behind a janitor's cart. He puts his fist over his heart. Gesture of love.

The two MP's in the room signal for Liz to be brought inside.

Two MP's outside the room bring her in. Baines stays on guard outside.

While the Guards stand on alert, Liz sits in a chair and discovers a piece of paper on a side table, placed exactly where her hand has come to rest. On the paper, in pencil, a square with a square cross within. She flips over the note. It reads, "GO CRAZY!"
</DIRECTION>

She considers, then SCREAMS as loud as she can while running around wildly.

Near lobby, where Crack Shot repeatedly nailed Cris. This time Crack Shot's shooting arm is in a sling, and he crouches next to a substitute sniper, who lies in wait.

They flee. Cris locks himself and Ferris inside.

Cris goes over to the bomb. Squints for a beat. IN FAST FORWARD, CONDENSED TIME, MULTIPLE SNAPBACK, he goes through the whole learning curve on bomb detonation, blowing himself up - and snapping back to life -- several times before figuring out the right way to set it off.

As Wisdom prepares to the pull the trigger, the bomb explodes in a giant cataclysm.

<DIRECTION>
Smoke and dust

<DIRECTION>
Roiling. Opaque. Then clearing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The center of the building

is gone. A jagged raw atrium extends several stories down and up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To the side, on a narrow ledge of floor extending from a wall...crouches Liz. The only person remaining. She has survived by inches. Very precise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she recovers from the blast, a door opens behind her. Cris appears, extends a hand and helps her from her perch.

They continue into the main cabin, where Neal, the Showgirl, the Pilots, and the Flight Attendant are glued to the television. Neal sees Cris and Liz, but hardly acknowledges them. He's in shock. They all are.

Cris and Liz turn to the TV.
