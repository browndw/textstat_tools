EXT. ROOFTOP - APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PARTY. ROCK MUSIC BLARES. DRUNK TEENS dance around BURNING BARRELS. GROUPS lounge on ratty couches and turned over boxes skulling cans, making out, talking shit. A BOY, 17, lights a MOLOTOV COCKTAIL and hurls it off the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luba and Raya join THREE GUYS. ONE of them pisses onto a cloth, stuffs it in a bottle, and tries to light it. It FIZZLES. Everybody bursts out laughing.

He lunges in for a kiss, but she dodges him, laughing. Luba gives him the finger, pulling Raya toward the dancing into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TEEN MAYHEM: Raya lets herself go. She gets lost in...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WHIRL of drunk and happy teens. It's tribal. They dance, silhouetted against the fire and the black sky, their backs to the run-down Soviet buildings... Tonight, they don't want to think about what life holds in store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raya stops. Dizzy. She looks at her watch, suddenly aware of the time. Yelling over to Luba...

POLICE OFFICER LEEDS scans the side of a house. Rounding to
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FRONT PORCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes his head at his partner, KATHRYN BOLKOVAC, 38. Earthy and athletic. She is in great shape, but her eyes tell of a life fully lived. She's looking at a HUSBAND and WIFE standing in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<HUSBAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It just got a bit heated, you know how it gets. I'll apologize to the neighbors tomorrow.

<WIFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really. It was nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIFE>

The husband shifts his weight. Kathy flits a look behind him, noticing... Jackets hanging from the wall. Her gaze lowers to a hook hanging much lower than the rest of the jackets.
</DIRECTION>

The wife moves out of the way. The man panics. Leeds heads up the porch. Kathy steps over the threshold. When...
</DIRECTION>
<HUSBAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not coming in my house!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUSBAND>

He blocks her, but Kathy pushes past him, and then he...

Kathy winces.

CAPTAIN HAWK, 50s, African American, walks in, noticing her exposed shoulders, and turns, uncomfortable. Kathy covers.

	Frank, I'm nearly forty. I can't be on the streets much longer. Not if I don't know there's something on the other end.

She looks up at Hawk, but he's staring past her at...
</DIRECTION>

The door. Kathy turns, seeing... A young, scared GIRL, 15. This is ERIN. Kathy's daughter. She's heard everything. Hawk eyes Erin, sympathetic.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just think about it, will you?

He leaves, passing Erin, who pushes down tears. Kathy eyes Erin, full of love, but not knowing what to say.

SMASH CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
In the opposite direction, a U.S. MILITARY TANK ROLLS past. A SOLDIER looks out from the HATCH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathy turns to see the only other woman on the bus, Carmen, 20s, Latina. She smiles cheekily, giving Kathy the `peace' sign. Kathy smiles. IMMEDIATE SOLIDARITY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the opposite direction, two other UN BUSES pass, one flanked by a CANADIAN FLAG, the other with a FRENCH TRICOLOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bus cranks around the corner, entering...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SNIPER ALLEY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The final stretch into Sarajevo. Famous from so many war reports, site of many deaths. The broad, pock-marked avenue is barren. SHELLED HIGH RISES lean like hungry faces, gouged from their once-solid structures. Living rooms are exposed to the elements, wallpaper blowing in the wind like torn skin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BUS: Carmen taps Kathy, pointing out the window...
</DIRECTION>
<CARMEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sniper Alley. See, the bullet marks are at eye level. People just running to the store.

All the walls are splattered at head level. Kathy is overcome by the stark reality of war. Worse than she ever imagined.

The refugees turn their haunted eyes to the fresh faces of the NEW RECRUITS. Kathy extends a parcel to an OLD MAN. He hesitates. Then she sees... He has no arms. She's unsure what to do. A young boy takes the package, leading his grandfather away. Kathy stands: WHERE AM I?

KATHY and THREE NEW RECRUITS are led down a path along a mountainside. They move toward an UNDERGROUND BUNKER. CHILDREN play at the edge of an overgrown field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BOY hops up on a post, about to jump over, when the leader, TODD MYERS, 30s, a seasoned pro, YELLS at him, points out...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sign closer to the BARBED WIRE, fringing the field... A SKULL AND CROSSBONES. "LANDMINES NOT SWEPT"

</BILL_HYNES>
<DIRECTION>
The recruits are hyped, the rhetoric is working. MOVING OVER THEM, MAN by MAN, we REVEAL in the back:

Kathy. In her crisp navy blue IPTF flack jacket. Her blonde hair makes her stand out. She is one of the only women in the room. Her eyes ablaze. She is completely fired up.

Kathy sits at the table spreading stuff on dark bread. Carmen across from her. Kathy takes a bite and grimaces.

He points to BIG NEON SIGN: THE INTERNATIONAL BAR. Tiki lights illuminate a broad patio. A PIG roasts on a spit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathy follows Carmen through DOZENS of off-duty IPTF, SFOR and UN workers who drink and trade stories with machismo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a palpable sexual tension in the air. BOSNIAN WAITRESSES flirt with OFFICERS. Guys paw GIRLS with trays.

They make their way through the crowded bar, feeling the officers' double-takes. Carmen smiles coyly at Kathy, then zeroes in on JAN VAN DER VELDE, 35, handsome. He is surrounded by a group of IPTF with Dutch flags on their shoulders. Carmen throws her arms around them, jovial.
</DIRECTION>
<CARMEN>

	Okay, fine, if you insist. Mine's a Jaegermeister.

AT THE BAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathy moves to Todd and the Americans, catching Todd's eye, but is distracted by a WAITRESS writhing on an ITALIAN SOLDIER's lap. The Waitress darts Kathy a look, contemptuous. And the soldiers notice. One leers at Kathy...

Kathy moves through the now-hopping bar. She's ready to leave. She searches for... Carmen. She's IN A CORNER. Still with the group of DUTCH OFFICERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathy approaches, concerned, when Jan cuts her off. He's watching Carmen, who's teetering, drunk.
</DIRECTION>
<JAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should probably get her home.

EXT. STREET - ILIDZA, BOSNIA - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Industrial plants dominate the skyline of this Sarajevo suburb. Kathy drives frantically past bombed-out buildings. Carmen studies a map beside her. They hit A RED LIGHT. And stop. A GROUP OF MUSLIM WOMEN cross the street. One questions Kathy with a lingering gaze. Carmen stares at her map...
</DIRECTION>
<CARMEN>

An abandoned CLASSROOM. Shabby corkboards with yellowing PSA posters, ragged kids' drawings, and tired sticky tape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathy skims through the training binders. The DOOR OPENS and a GROUP OF LOCAL POLICE file in. They whisper, exchanging lascivious glances. Kathy straightens her uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHY>

The interpreter shakes her head benignly. They take their seats. The interpreter looks at Kathy.
</DIRECTION>
<BOSNIAN_WOMAN>

	They like to be difficult. They understand if you're clear. Mostly they have trouble speaking English. But let's see if you can get them to talk at all.

Kathy looks out, suddenly daunted. She presses on, opening her binder as authoritatively as she can.

The cop scoffs, and sits.

</DIRECTION>
<DANIK>

INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clarkson leads Kathy and the BOSNIAN POLICE through the hall. Gurney's and IVs suggest it's a hospital, but you wouldn't want to be examined here. Some windows are still covered with wood slats, and paint barely covers old bullet holes. The floors still hold the stains of old blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clarkson grabs a file, and speaks without looking back...
</DIRECTION>
<CLARKSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seems we have two stabbings, one shooting, and a man with a broken leg and a bad hangover who can't remember what happened... Average night back in Brighton.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARKSON>
<DIRECTION>
The cops stare at him, lost. As they file into a SMALL ROOM filled with tightly drawn curtains. They all squeeze into the center together. Kathy is pressed against the large cop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clarkson pulls back a curtain, revealing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZLATA SEHIK, 40, Muslim. Her face is covered with wounds. She avoids the gaze of the police who stare with contempt. She pulls her bed-sheet up to her chin as...

	<DIALOGUE>
	"facial contusions from repeated beatings with fist", "lacerations on the eye caused by the edge of an iron"...

He pauses. Looking at Zlata, he moves her sheet up to expose her leg. Zlata's eyes tear. Clarkson reads...
</DIRECTION>
<CLARKSON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"The right hand was the first entry point of a large kitchen knife"... "The second entry point in the upper left thigh"... It went through her hand and into her leg... Who's going to take this report?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARKSON>
<DIRECTION>
Kathy looks out at the Bosnian cops, but they stare at the ground. One cop peeks into the next cubicle. Kathy looks at Clarkson for a cue. He holds out the clipboard.

<CLARKSON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARKSON>

No answer. Clarkson looks to Kathy to take control. She turns to her group, but they have even less respect for her. She goes to speak, when... VIKO, 25, looks up, hesitant.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKO>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. HALLWAY - HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER

Clarkson leads the group. Kathy pushes up toward him.

<VIKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zlata Sehik has been to the hospital eight time because of her husband. Every time she try to file a complaint, my bosses send her back. They always laugh at the woman... They laughed at my mother. They do not make prosecutions of domestic violence. I want to get enough evidence to do this.

Viko and Kathy sit behind a pile of Legal Books. Viko shows Kathy a page, a questioning look on his face.

Viko turns to see a LIBRARIAN at the main desk.

He leaves her. Kathy runs her eye over the place. The reality of her office less exalted than she imagined. But she's raring to go. She eyes a name plate:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KATHRYN BOLKOVAC - HEAD OF GENDER AFFAIRS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathy stands in her office doorway, glancing up the hall.

<DIRECTION>
THE HALL is empty. The EXIT door at the end swings shut in the flickering fluorescent light.

EXT. OLD TOWN TURKISH QUARTER - SARAJEVO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Black cobbles. Merchants line the narrow pathways. Open- doored cafes serve coffee to UNEMPLOYED YOUTH. Kathy and Jan walk along. He's delighted. She's restrained.
</DIRECTION>
<JAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was wondering when you'd ask me out.

</JAN>

He grabs her by the hand, ducking into a SMALL ARCHWAY. A NARROW PASSAGE opens up onto a charming restaurant.

EXT. CAFE - OLD TOWN - LATER

Kathy and Jan sit at a table, watching a WAITRESS put down a carraffe of wine and 'Cevapcici' (lamb dish).

Kathy stacks unpacked boxes out of the way. She organizes a BIG BULLETIN BOARD into 12 CANTONS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EIGHTH CANTON - AFTERNOON

Kathy follows an IPTF monitor, BARRY, 30s, Irish past the front of a UN BUS. A DOZEN MUSLIM WOMEN disembark and look up, their hands over their mouths, keening.
</DIRECTION>
<BARRY>

	This is the first time they've seen their homes in years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARRY>
<DIRECTION>
IPTF MONITORS help with unloading battered suitcases and belongings. THREE carry a couch up the steps of a building as a YOUNG BROTHER and SISTER watch. Standing back, an ELDERLY WOMAN weeps in disbelief as the monitors lay final touches on makeshift storm windows on her aparment.
</DIRECTION>

Kathy watches, Barry by her side.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're all widows?

</KATHY>
<BARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why they were so frightened to come back. They couldn't believe they'd be safe. That what happened before wouldn't happen again. Except now with nobody to protect them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Kathy shakes her head. The women enter the building, their past lives in shards at their feet. One WOMAN, 40s, stands numb, a bundle of books in her arms, tears running down her face, as her TEENAGE SON beckons her to come in the DOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Except us.

INT. IPTF FIELD OFFICE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The field officer leads Barry and Kathy round a corner, to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A YOUNG GIRL nearly passed out on the couch. Her face bloody and swollen. Kathy runs up to the girl, who can barely sit up. Softly waking her. The girl comes to, taking in her surroundings, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUMPS UP. An unmistakable look in her eyes. TERROR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathy eyes the field worker. He shrugs, lost. Kathy turns back to the girl, and slowly places a hand on her shoulder. The girl flinches, then inches back... shaking her head.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay, it's--
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHY>
<DIRECTION>
But the girl holds out her hands, stopping Kathy. She looks around, completely disoriented. Desperately searching for an exit. She eyes them all, realizing she's surrounded and then... SHE WAILS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Losing control. Slapping at all of them. Kathy moves to her, trying -- gently -- to hold her tight. The girl sobs. Hopelessness in her eyes. And then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She faints. Kathy and Barry bend to catch her.

</FIELD_WORKER>
<DIRECTION>
Looking at the girl, Kathy pushes a strand of hair from her face. And as we stay a moment longer, we realize this is...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raya. A long way from home. But then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DOORS OPEN. A frantic HUMAN RIGHTS WORKER carries IRKA, 17, into the room. Her clothes torn, her body and face bruised. Kathy looks up...
</DIRECTION>
<HUMAN_RIGHTS_WORKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was further back in the woods.

Kathy drives up a winding mountain road, checking directions on a hand-drawn map. A LOCAL POLICE CAR swerves by in the opposite direction.
</DIRECTION>

INT. UN SUV/EXT. FLORIDA BAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathy's SUV throws up gravel. Out her windscreen, she sees
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FLORIDA BAR: A dilapidated two story building, painted a garish pink. Crude palm trees painted on the side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathy jumps out of her SUV, and moves towards...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOCAL POLICE smoke by POLICE CARS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LOCAL COP leads a CLUSTER of YOUNG WOMEN out the door. They blink in the glaring light, pale, out of place, lost...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the end of the line, is Luba. Her eyes darting between Kathy and the Local Cops, helpless.

Kathy rushes towards the cop. He eyes her, dubious.

The Local Cop talks at the girls. They don't understand him, but his tone is clear: total disrespect. Kathy moves toward them, protectively, then sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO UN SUVs parked on the other side of the bar.
</DIRECTION>

TWO IPTF MONITORS emerge from the bar. Kathy approaches them. They seem surprised.

Fred seems confused. Kathy pulls out a clipboard.

	Yeah. Local police have been watching the place for a while. This whole thing happened pretty fast. I guess those girls must've run for it.

	Well, the girls in our field office seemed pretty scared. I should follow up with these ones.

The Local Cops start to move, stubbing out cigarettes, getting in cars. The Local Cop shuts the doors of the van.

	You can see where they're taking them, but I can't intervene. You know the drill.

She rushes after the van. Fred eyes Kathy confer with the Van driver. He and the other Monitor, drive off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathy is left alone in the silence. She turns to the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FLORIDA BAR - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathy moves inside. The place is rank and dingy. A small stage with a POLE in the centre. Tables fanned out around it. CUT WIRES hang over the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BAR AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is filled with PHOTOS: YOUNG GIRLS in various poses with men, IPTF SOLDIERS. They range from the illicit to the obscene.
</DIRECTION>
<KATHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHY>
<DIRECTION>
Kathy stops on a photo of a NAKED GIRL on stage holding the two open wires over her head. Behind her, SOLDIERS applaud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathy takes down the photo, horrified. Turns it over. Scrawled in marker: SARAJEVO FIRECRACKER!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to the stage. Plugs in one of the wires. A HUZZ of electricity. Tiny sparks fly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns, and under the bar sees... A SAFE, SMASHED OPEN. A handful of U.S. bills scattered about. And...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PASSPORTS. Romanian, Ukrainian, Polish. All for young girls. She gathers them, surprised, and stuffs them into her file.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes are drawn to a back wall. She stops at a panelled door. And pushes. It opens onto...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STEPS: She shines her flashlight up the dark passage...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BEAM of the flashlight finds a DOOR. A glint off metal... At the door handle, a large PADLOCK, smashed open. Kathy darts the beam over the other TWO DOORS... both equipped with PADLOCKS. Smashed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathy pushes through the first door into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIDDEN BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathy's flashlight over: Hanging BEDSHEETS separate the room into cubicles. Putrid mattresses. Condoms on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eye catches MARKINGS UNDER A MATTRESS. She pulls it away. And sees GIRLS' NAMES scratched into the floor... Under each name, etched in, a list of amounts: 50, 100, 30, 200, 20... Some kind of RECORD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathy PULLS back other mattresses. Dust. Some FAMILY PHOTOS. And... a ragged PIECE OF PAPER: Crude drawings of sexual positions. A NUMBER by each one: $20, $30, $50, $100, $200...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The amounts correspond exactly with the table on the floor.

Kathy looks around, sickened.

INT. HALLWAY - WOMEN'S MEDICA SHELTER - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shelter is a converted gymnasium. Peeling wallpaper. Long- forgotten notices from before the war, postcards. Patchy linoleum curls at the edges. A soft hum. Voices in rooms that Kathy can't see. She walks down the hall with MILENA, 40s, Bosnian, down-to-earth, forthright.

Kathy in the doorway. The place is dark but lit by lamps along the walls. MUSIC pumps. The place is hopping. A scantily-clad GIRL dances on the stage, her body writhing but her eyes dead. Along the edges, girls - the very SAME GIRLS Kathy saw released at the raid - 'socialize' with customers.

Many of the CUSTOMERS... in IPTF UNIFORMS, others with off- duty IPTF SWEATSHIRTS, and INTERNATIONALS in civilian casuals. A few LOCALS at the bar, where...

That raid was a punishment bust, because the owner stopped paying. But he must've settled it because the girls are right back where they started. Locked up in the hills.

EXT. U.S. AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE - SHORT TIME LATER

An elegant WOMAN comes to greet them. She is...

Bill Hynes

<MADELEINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your help with Irka's case can really raise awareness in the Mission around the issue of trafficking.

Sun over the hills. A DOG follows a YOUNG BOY, 5, through a field. The boy stops, seeing a BROWN VAN down the road.

BASEMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO MEN stand guard. Tanjo walks past them. Opens a door. Ushering Ivan INSIDE where...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GIRLS are huddled together. Luba, and THREE OTHERS. They look up... PETRIFIED... Offscreen, the cries swell.

They jump back. His scream echoes. They move
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To a door on the other side. Tanjo nods. A guard opens the door onto A HORRIFIC SITE... Luba closes her eyes. But Tanjo pushes the girls in, one by one they go through into a
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BARREN ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And see... Raya... NAKED. HELD DOWN BY FOUR MEN. SPREAD EAGLE ON HER FRONT. WAILING. HER FACE SHOWS UNIMAGINABLE PAIN. And we see that...

Two of the men holding her down are EXTINGUISHING LIT CIGARETTES INTO THE BALLS OF HER FOOT.

	Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYA>
<DIRECTION>
But we realize... this is not the greatest cause of her pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luba's face whitens. Eyeing one MAN at Raya's backside. A flash of shame in his eyes as he steps away from Raya, and drops... A PIPE onto the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men step away. Leaving Raya. Collapsed into a ball. Now the girls all understand... there is no hope at all.

Madeleine stands before a small group of REPORTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<MADELEINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The young woman, who shall remain anonymous, arrived in Bosnia as a victim of sex trafficking and has survived horrific abuse. Ordinarily she would be repatriated to her country of origin. But because she is an orphan, she finds herself without a home. I'm pleased to announce that we have found a foster family in the United States. I want to thank Janet Wells for her assistance in making this happen. I believe this can stand as a signal that the International community in Bosnia and beyond is finally ready to recognize the growing epidemic of sex trafficking, a human rights abuse as abhorrent as the war crimes that drew the International Community to intervene in Bosnia in the first place. Thank you.

	Now that the UN is finally recognizing sex-trafficking, how are you going to monitor it?

ALL EYES ON KATHY. They disperse, passing her, camaraderie obliterated. Kathy walks, livid...

	<DIALOGUE>
	They are SLAVES. By any American or International law.

INT. LONG CORRIDOR - UNMHQ - MORNING
</DIRECTION>

Kathy, reports in hand, turns a corner, and... bumps into an OFFICER. She drops some files. He moves around her, as she bends to pick them up. She walks the rest of the hall, focused, and stops at a brass plaque: INTERNAL AFFAIRS.

<DIRECTION>
INT. OFFICE - INTERNAL AFFAIRS - UNHMQ - MORNING

Kathy is led in by Peter Ward. She comes inside, tentative, unsure who she's dealing with. Peter smokes furiously, a burned-out mission lifer, who's bright, intelligent eyes betray a last spark of the idealism that brought him into this world. He seems nervous.

	Dyncorp's contract with the State Department in Bosnia alone is worth 52 million dollars. We're paid ninety, a hundred grand, right?. But it's a drop in the ocean compared to their profits. This is a global corporation, top five defense contractors in the states after Halliburton and KB&R. You think they're gonna let some sex scandal threaten that?

Kathy. Unstrung. She crosses the labyrinth of WHITE SUVs. She looks up at the OSCE towers. Feeling watched.

TWO SFOR SOLDIERS walk toward her. Eyeing her. She slips a car key between her fingers, arming herself. Watching them as... They pass. Kathy picks up her pace. Getting to...

THE FILE CABINET. She pulls out EVERY FILE. Photocopies them. Then... Opens the bottom filing cabinet -- pushes files to the front -- placing the copies in the back. She steps away... Closes the Cabinet. And locks it...

Knowing she is operating outside of protocol now.

It's more of a medium-sized hall. A bar, some tables and a few `home touches'. Maps of Yugoslavia. Pictures of Tito.

And FULL OF IPTF. Raya walks through, ogled. She sees...

Luba, sitting on Mara's lap. Surrounded by TEN IRISH SOLDIERS. The soldiers ply them with drinks, `winning' them with charm. Luba blends in with remarkable ease.

They walk through a BACK DOOR into a ROOM FULL OF BEDS SEPARATED with CURTAINS. We barely make out the shapes of various soldiers with girls in each cubicle. All busy. Until

Bill shakes his head.

	These girls--

<BILL_HYNES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are Collateral Damage. Whores of War. It's nothing new. Every conflict produces them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL_HYNES>
<KATHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know as well as I do, those girls aren't a product of the war. They're a product of the peace. For the peace-keepers.

<DIRECTION>
Kathy is repulsed. Bill takes a seat.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL_HYNES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is your first mission. You're eager. But we work in a very grey area and that can get messy. Everybody wants the UN to take the gloves off but they don't want us to get our hands dirty. It's a fucking Catch-22. So what do we do? We prioritize. We do our best and we always look at the bigger picture. You're a mother. Fine. I see what you're doing with these girls. Maybe that's why you're thinking with your heart not your head. But you have a chance at a career in the international sector. Ride this out. Get a promotion. Human Rights in Liberia, Afghanistan... I don't give a shit. And then, when you're running the show, you can implement whatever changes you see fit. But right now be smart and shut this bullshit down!

Girls turn from the bar, the stage, the seating area -- disoriented -- eyes darting...

Local police spread around the bar, slamming, pushing clients outside. Kathy pulls off her helmet and SCANS the room.

<VIKO>

	We have a warrant to search this premises. The owner of this bar Ivan Bladzic has been arrested and taken into custody for human trafficking.

<BARMAN>

</BARMAN>

Kathy eyes the girls. Their confusion, their fear...

Danik, hesitates, confronted with the vulnerability of these girls... His face softens. He looks to Kathy for direction.

Kathy looks out -- Stunned -- Because she sees...

	Fakes. Bad ones.

The barman is dragged outside. Kathy scans the girls. Ending on Raya... her faith awakening.

But the girls still don't move... Raya. Fractured with despair... After all she has been through, all the punishment, all the pain...

<DIRECTION>
Raya holds Luba's gaze - Maybe even she could be convinced...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Raya starts to step to Kathy... When...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind Kathy, an IPTF officer removes his helmet. Mike Sears. He stares at Raya. Petrifying her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kathy sees it in her -- WHIPS around. Mike Sears avoids her gaze. Kathy turns back to Raya. Moving closer, quietly, out of earshot of the others...

The girls all return to their positions behind the bar, cleaning, sitting around the edges... Not one will catch...
