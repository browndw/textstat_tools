EXT. METROPOLITAN CITY - DOWNTOWN - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hot summer night. The flesh district - hookers working the sidewalks, stopping cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE REILLY, 20s, paces a corner, restless, looking for action ... wet hair, three-day beard, trenchcoat, sneakers, heat-seeking weary eyes. He flashes a wad of bills in an effort to get some attention... no one notices.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the street, BILL RICE, 50's, a ragged transient, strolls over.
</DIRECTION>
<RICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Know what the problem is, kid? You're too ugly to get propositioned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICE>
<REILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look who's talking, old man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REILLY>
<RICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, it's a quiet night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICE>
<DIRECTION>
Rice starts away. Reilly pauses, then trudges after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDESTREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rice and Reilly pull donuts and coffee out of a bag, talk with their mouths full as they walk.
</DIRECTION>
<RICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next week we work the park.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICE>
<REILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta get back on top. Get off the sleaze detail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REILLY>
<RICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will, one day at a time. I'll be old and grey when it happens...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICE>
<DIRECTION>
They share a grin, pass a BAG LADY who wears a pie-tin crown, holding her hand out to a PIMP getting into a Cadillac.
</DIRECTION>
<BAG_LADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A small gift, sir, for the Queen ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAG_LADY>
<DIRECTION>
The Pimp ignores her, screeches off. The Bag Lady pulls out a pad, adds his license number to a list, glances up at Rice and Reilly.
</DIRECTION>
<BAG_LADY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I keep a record, see? They don't pay, I don't forget.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAG_LADY>
<DIRECTION>
Rice fishes some change out of his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<RICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here you go, your Highness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICE>
<BAG_LADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, officer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAG_LADY>
<DIRECTION>
She pushes her shopping cart away. Rice and Reilly look at each other, crack up, surprised she knew he was a cop.
</DIRECTION>
<REILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what'll you do? After they give you the gold watch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REILLY>
<RICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell, I got a gold watch... it just don't work. Maybe they'll give me a new fishing pole, or something useful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICE>
<REILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't fish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REILLY>
<RICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How hard can it be? The grand kids been buggin' me about taking them camping.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICE>
<REILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You outta the city... that's a fish out of water. What's with all this family talk lately, anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REILLY>
<RICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One of these days you're gonna get tired of fighting the shit. When that happens, you'll wish you had family.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICE>
<REILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thanks. I got close but it never woulda worked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REILLY>
<DIRECTION>
They stop beside a dirty, beat-up Studebaker parked in the alley, climb in, Reilly behind the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE STUDEBAKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cluttered with debris - clothes, boxes, personal items. Reilly jiggles the ignition - the engine coughs and sputters, finally turns over.
</DIRECTION>
<RICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you just shoot it and put it out of its misery?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICE>
<REILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about, it's purring like a kitty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REILLY>
<RICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you said what's-her-name's brother was going to fix it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICE>
<REILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She didn't work out, had to cut her loose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REILLY>
<RICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was it this time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICE>
<REILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She wanted to cook me breakfast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REILLY>
<DIRECTION>
The White Van appears up ahead and turns into a seemingly deserted building's garage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reilly and Rice exchange a glance as they wait to see lights come on in the building. They don't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two flashlight beams criss cross through the windows of the building briefly, then disappear. They hear a brief heated argument, that is cut short abruptly. Then silence.
</DIRECTION>
<REILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, let's check it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REILLY>
<RICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're vice, I didn't see no pimps or hookers in that van. But if you're so gung-ho, we'd best call it in for some back-up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICE>
<REILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah, let's just take a look-see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Reilly jumps out and heads for the building. Rice rolls his eyes, follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge, old, battered machine shop. Spooky darkness, dead quiet. Moonlight filters in through dirt-smeared windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door CREAKS as Reilly and Rice slip in, stop, eyes scan. Nothing. Just rows of glistening machines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rice gestures for Reilly to spread out. They head in, footsteps echoing, shadows washing over them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still nothing...deeper, deeper... then, glancing over, Reilly sees a shape hiding behind a machine. He steps towards it. The shape whirls - a beautiful spitfire of a GIRL with piercing blue eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to bolt. Reilly grabs her. She struggles, pulls a knife, slashes his arm, drawing blood through his trenchcoat.
</DIRECTION>
<REILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ow! Son-of-a-bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REILLY>
<DIRECTION>
He punches her full force in the face - she collapses, knocked out cold. Rice rushes over.
</DIRECTION>
<RICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICE>
<REILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, just a nick ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Then, over Reilly's shoulder, Rice sees a dark SILHOUETTE emerging from behind a machine. Rice draws his pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<RICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Freeze! Police!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICE>
<DIRECTION>
As Reilly whirls, the Silhouette raises a Mac-11.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rice shoves Reilly aside as the Silhouette OPENS FIRE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Diving for cover, Reilly flings back his trenchcoat, whips out his 9mm and RETURNS FIRE at the Silhouette, blowing the shit out of windows behind, sparks showering off machines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence for an instant, Reilly looks for Rice and finds him bleeding to death on the floor nearby - he is completely exposed to the line of fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Silhouette and another FIGURE OPEN FIRE on Reilly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SWAN, 40s, crazy-brilliant, manic eyes... and one of his men, pale, sweaty, wearing an EARRING, 30s, continue the barrage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Swan fires ONE SHOT at a time at Rice, deliberately aiming not to kill him, trying to flush Reilly out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rice screams as BULLETS RIP into his legs. Reilly tries to reach him but can't, shots forcing him back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dark-eyed man with a BEARD appears in the b.g. and stealths towards Reilly from behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reilly' face is in agony as Rice moans in pain. He glances urgently from the gunmen to the exit behind them, to The Girl lying next to him -- what's keeping them there? Obviously The Girl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stirs. Desperate, Reilly grabs her by the hair, shoves his 9mm to her head. Using her as a shield, he drags her in front of Rice to protect him.
</DIRECTION>
<REILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(to gunmen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drop it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Swan's eyes flare. He steps out into the open, gun aimed at Rice, eyes locked murderously on Reilly.
</DIRECTION>
<SWAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let her go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWAN>
<DIRECTION>
Reilly cocks his hammer, fingers trembling. The Girl stiffens, terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beard emerges behind Reilly. Deadly silent, he raises an automatic, trying to get a clear shot between machines...
</DIRECTION>
<SWAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, the girl!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWAN>
<DIRECTION>
Reilly whirls, sees Beard, shrinks back to stay covered.
</DIRECTION>
<EARRING>
<DIRECTION>
(to Swan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We gotta get outta here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARRING>
<REILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Swan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell them to drop it - now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REILLY>
<DIRECTION>
A deadly stalemate. Faraway SIRENS WAIL.
</DIRECTION>
<SWAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have no idea how sorry you're going to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to The Girl)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SWAN>
<DIRECTION>
Beard smolders, Earring sweats. Keeping their guns up, the three men grab tool bags, work their way to the alley door and slip out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The moment they're gone, Reilly quickly handcuffs The Girl to a machine, kneels, cradles Rice.
</DIRECTION>
<RICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mike...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICE>
<REILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REILLY>
<RICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take your time... one day at a time, kid...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICE>
<DIRECTION>
Rice takes Reilly's hand and pats it on his wristwatch.
</DIRECTION>
<RICE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all I got... it's yours.

</REILLY>
<RICE>
<DIRECTION>
(grinning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ain't that a shit--
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICE>
<DIRECTION>
Rice's eyes go blank, he exhales his last breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reilly winces, eyes welling up. His gaze moves at the Girl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Girl stares uncomfortably, a blink of sympathy stealing past her hard exterior ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking numb, out of place, Rice's blood still on his trenchcoat, Reilly walks in, weaves through a chaos of ringing phones, overworked cops, suspects being booked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cops look up, whisper about him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Turning a corner, Reilly bumps into a bulldog of a cop, HARRY, hustling The Girl out of a booking room. She's got a shiner where Reilly hit her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Girl and Reilly make eye contact, intimate somehow, a flash of vulnerability and fear in The Girl's face...
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Reilly, Captain's looking for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Reilly snaps out of it, continues on. Reilly nods as Harry hustles the girl away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind his desk, a work-weary captain, WINTERS, 50s, sucks coffee as he grills ARTIE PLUCHINSKY, 40s, a slick suit-and- tie homicide detective.
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prints?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<PLUCHINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing so far.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLUCHINSKY>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the ballistics report?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<PLUCHINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lab's backed up, we're still waiting for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLUCHINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
Reilly walks in.
</DIRECTION>
<REILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REILLY>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reilly, what the hell happened out there? Why didn't you call for back-up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<REILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(at a loss, sad)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I--
	</DIALOGUE>
</REILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Reilly looks at his watch (we notice he's now wearing Rice's watch). He taps it, listens to see if it's ticking.
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
(contíd) (softening)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dammit, Rice was a good man,
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<REILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to work this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REILLY>
<PLUCHINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're vice, not homicide. Besides, you don't have the experience and you're too personally involved.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLUCHINSKY>
<REILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But sir--
	</DIALOGUE>
</REILLY>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know the rules. You're off the street `til I.A.D. clears the investigation. Now go home and clean yourself up, get some rest...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
Harry barges in, dumps a bag of personal effects on the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She won't talk. Look at this shit, no I.D., nothing...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Reilly picks up a twisted plastic-wire bracelet.
</DIRECTION>
<PLUCHINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLUCHINSKY>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bracelet she was wearing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<REILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like the stuff my dad used to use to blow up tree stumps back in Scranton.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REILLY>
<PLUCHINSKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe she knows your old man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLUCHINSKY>
<DIRECTION>
Reilly sears into Pluchinsky.
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it down to the Bomb Squad, Artie-
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<REILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Winters eyes him for a beat, relents...
</DIRECTION>
<WINTERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, kid. Run this down to the Cave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINTERS>
<DIRECTION>
Reilly spins and exits quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE STATION - BASEMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emerging from a dingy back staircase, Reilly enters a hallway and moves to a door a door marked "BOMB SQUAD."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE STATION - "THE CAVE" - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reilly enters into another world - a dungeon cluttered with bomb paraphernalia, defusing equipment, a dog house, ping- pong table, Sheryl Crow pin-up, Chicago Bears posters, Yassir Arafat dartboard, a photo-shrine to dead Bomb Squaders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A plain, fresh-faced assistant, BEV, 30s, looks up from her computer station.
</DIRECTION>
<BEV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEV>
<REILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm looking for the Bomb Squad.

</REILLY>
<BEV>
	<DIALOGUE>

</REILLY>
<BEV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There out on a call, perhaps I can help you-
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEV>
<REILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-Where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REILLY>
<BEV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	2600 block of Lakefront. A limousine. But, I-

</BEV>
<REILLY>

</REILLY>
<DIRECTION>
Reilly sprints out. Bev tries to finish but he's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Studebaker coughs and smokes in and out of traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LAKEFRONT STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A young, uniformed police OFFICER stops Reilly in front of a cordoned-off section of the street.
</DIRECTION>
<REILLY>
<DIRECTION>
(flashes badge)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bomb Squad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REILLY>
<DIRECTION>
The Officer nods and moves the barricade out of the way, Reilly hits the gas, rumbles through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Studebaker swings past a fire truck, an ambulance, and two squads cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two OFFICERS stand near a building with a worried BUSINESSMAN and his CHAUFFEUR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reilly parks 50 yards from a limo stopped in the middle of the street. A Bomb Squad van and sleek black Harley Davidson parked beyond it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reilly hops out, heads cautiously for the limo
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POOCH, 50s, a barrel-chested ex-football player is on his hands and knees looking under the limo. Red rubber ball in hand, Hawaiian shirt half-tucked in, he leads around an equally scruffy Labrador Retriever, SCHNOZ.
</DIRECTION>
<POOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smell anything, Schnoz? Me, neither.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POOCH>
<DIRECTION>
T.J., 20s, a country boy inspects the open trunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GLASS, 40s, clean-cut, straight-laced, easy-going smile, brilliant leader of the team, steps lightly around the open driver's door.

<T_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quiet!
	</DIALOGUE>
</T_J>
<DIRECTION>
Glass and Pooch step lightly to the rear of the limo where T.J. has discovered a shoebox wedged next to the spare tire. T.J. leans down, puts his ear to it, nods.
</DIRECTION>
<T_J>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ticker.

</T_J>
<DIRECTION>
Pooch lifts up Schnoz and holds him over the trunk. Schnoz sniffs the shoebox, whines.
</DIRECTION>
<POOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Schnoz says it's loaded. Good boy, Schnozzie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Pooch lowers Schnoz back to the ground throws him the red ball, and trots back to the van, climbs up inside and sits, watching.
</DIRECTION>
<GLASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright boys, look close. Let's assess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLASS>
<DIRECTION>
Glass, Pooch and T.J. take a beat just to look at the shoebox. Then, Glass nods for Reilly to move away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reilly takes a few steps back, watching as the team works together - Glass in charge - a psychic connection between them as they pass tools back and forth like surgeons.
</DIRECTION>
<POOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whadaya think, "boy" or "girl"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Glass puts on magnifying spectacles -- precise, organized, a detail freak as he uses a wooden probe to test the box for wires, sensors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the others watch, Glass rubs his fingertips ritualistically and carefully eases the top off the box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches in... Grabs something... Slowly pulls it out ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a Mickey Mouse alarm clock doll, a clump of unlit firecrackers taped between Mickey's legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bomb Squaders whoop and howl - all except Pooch who pulls out a pack of Tums, shoves half of it in his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<GLASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a "girl" !
	</DIALOGUE>
</GLASS>
<DIRECTION>
They all crack up, hysterical. Reilly stares in disbelief -- these guys are nuts!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOMENTS LATER - AT THE BOMB SQUAD VAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the b.g., the Officers finish getting a statement from the Businessman as the still-worried Chauffeur inspects the limo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
T.J. and Pooch load their equipment into the van as Glass fills out paperwork.
</DIRECTION>
<T_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That guy's wife must be pretty pissed off to play a trick like that.

<POOCH>

Glass whips out a blasting cap from his utility belt, cuts off a piece of the bracelet, plugs it in.
</DIRECTION>
<POOCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fire in the hole!
	</DIALOGUE>
</POOCH>
<DIRECTION>
Glass tosses it into a sewer drain. A beat, then a small EXPLOSION, smoke billows out of the gutter drain. The nearby Officers jump, alarmed. The Bomb Squad guys laugh. Glass waves to the Officers.
</DIRECTION>
<GLASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry about that.

Cars pass. People stroll by. Nothing happens.

Chaotic aftermath of the bombing... sirens, flashing red lights. Police hold back onlookers, Firemen clean up, Paramedics carry corpses and moaning Victims out of the charred, smoking ruins, into waiting ambulances.

Pluchinsky starts to laugh as Reilly pops him once hard in the face. Pluchinsky staggers backwards, grasping his bleeding nose. Reilly is ready for more as Pluchinsky starts at him. They exchange a few body shots before several cops swarm in and pull them apart.

INT. POLICE STATION - INTERROGATION VIEWING BOOTH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wearing headphones connected to a tape recorder, a BORED COP flips wearily through a comic book in front of a one-way mirror. Through it can be seen a bare interrogation room where The Girl sits stubbornly at a table across from Harry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stubbing a butt into an overflowing ashtray, Harry rubs the back of his neck, gets up and goes through a door, into the viewing booth. The Bored Cop looks up, shuts off the tape recorder.
</DIRECTION>
<BORED_COP>

Harry exits. The Bored Cop eyes Reilly suspiciously as Reilly crosses to the other door, yanks it open.

As Reilly enters, The Girl stiffens at the sight of him.

	You remember me.

Reilly shuts the door, she doesn't respond. The Girl catches a glimpse of his 9mm under his trenchcoat, she's unfazed. He paces, circling her.

The Bored Cop doesn't notice, he's engrossed in his comic.

<DIRECTION>
INT. INTERROGATION ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reilly sits, the Girl eyes him like a trapped prey. They're enemies, yet there's a strange chemistry between them.
</DIRECTION>
<REILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me be very clear about this. The police won't let you go. When your boyfriend realizes this, I have a feeling a lot of innocent people are going to die. Kids, families. I know you don't want that to happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REILLY>
<DIRECTION>
She stares, eyes dark, barely registering any emotion at all. A flicker of fear, indecision. Her lips part, fighting it, then she looks away, letting the fear win. Reilly flushes with anger, frustration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CAVE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Glass squints through a microscope. Pooch sniffs and fumbles dirt samples. T.J. rocks to a Walkman as he inspects the charred briefcase handle fragment. Bev is at her computer searching luggage websites on the Net.

Reilly comes in, still frustrated.

Glass and Reilly climb out of the car, flashlights in hand. Reilly glances around, bad memories stirring up.

Nearly pitch dark inside, shafts of late afternoon sunlight glistens on the battered machines. Shadows wash over Reilly and Glass as they retrace the path Reilly and Rice took the night before, Glass searching intensely, Reilly getting more and more uncomfortable.

He played linebacker at Boston College, worked a K-9 unit - that led him to the Bomb Squad... great nose, lousy fingers, we try to keep him away from the tickers. T.J. is a heck of chemist, Texas A&M engineering degree. Found him in a Militia chat room - turns out we were both monitoring the same groups. Bev is the natural born hacker, we stole her from dispatch. She had the Cave reorganized and ultra-high-tech in two months. Captain has no idea how much hardware she's "found" for us.

An army of cops and squad cars out front, Pluchinsky silently directs a SWAT team to the door. Reilly and the Bomb Squad watch from a distance as they break down the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOUTING, mayhem as the team floods into the room. Pluchinsky brings up the rear. After a beat, Pluchinsky re- emerges, shaking his head.

<DIRECTION>
Reilly and Glass are visibly disappointed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the others grumble about it, Reilly notices someone across the street - the Bag Lady with the pie-tin crown, holding her hand out to a MAN getting into his car. The Man ignores her, screeches off. The Bag Lady scribbles down his license number in her pad. Glass follows Reilly's stare.

He turns back. The Bag Lady flips through her pad, stabs an entry with her finger.

<BAG_LADY>

Swan stands discreetly in a phone booth, watching as...

ON THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beard steers towards a parked Squad Car next to the Station - on collision course. At the last second, Beard dives from the moving car, hits the pavements and rolls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Grenada CRASHES into the Squad Car... but no explosion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bomb Squad Van SKIDS to a stop as two uniformed Officers rush out of the Station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beard has rolled to his feet and is now sprinting off down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pooch and T.J. jump out of the Van (leaving a BARKING Schnoz inside) and sprint towards the Grenada, guns drawn. Pooch is quickly huffing and puffing. T.J. continues after Beard as Pooch moves towards the Grenada. The uniforms follow T.J.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Glass on his Harley appears from behind the Van. At the far end of the street the Studebaker rumbles into view, followed by a Squad Car, lights flashing. Everyone closing in on Beard.

Reilly jumps out of his Studebaker as Beard turns his FIRE on him, BLOWING OUT his windshield.

Back at the Grenada, Pooch ducks for cover by the open driver's door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Glass runs his Harley behind a parked car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Squad Car behind Reilly SKIDS to a stop and as Beard shifts his aim, T.J. and Reilly each PUMP TWO SHOTS into Beard's torso.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beard spins around, drops - dead silence on the street. Relief all around. Everyone stands back up. T.J.'s jaw drops at the sight of actually having hit the suspect with his bullets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE GRENADA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pooch exhales in relief, then hears BEEPING coming from the front seat of the car. He looks in to see the briefcase open, countdown ticking away.

Reilly stares off into space. Surreal silence, like a dream... Reilly looks at his watch, keeps his eyes low as he steals a glance at Glass in the other chair, face wracked with pain, loss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They both look through the glass office at the squad room outside, the sounds of reality fade in... phones ringing, voices shouting... a tense, chaotic emergency atmosphere.

Reilly looks at Glass, there'll be no stepping in this time. He glares at Winters, reaches into his jacket, pulls out the badge and tosses it on Winter's desk. He pulls out his 9mm, pops out the clip and open the chamber, sets it down.
