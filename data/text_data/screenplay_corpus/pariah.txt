EXT./INT. NIGHTCLUB- EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A disembodied gaggle of jersey clad shoulders, jeans, and hats crosses a narrow street. Lights flare, hands are stamped, torsos are patted down. Money exchanges hands. We descend into a black, throbbing tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Explicit music booms from bassy club speakers. Hips, legs feet dancing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GO-GO DANCER struts and wiggles around a brass pole. Hoots and cheers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dancer marches in place, rolling her thonged bottom. More cheers, greedy hands stuff dollars into her waistband.
</DIRECTION>
<FEMALE_DJ>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go! Where all my sexy Sagittarian ladies at?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEMALE_DJ>
<DIRECTION>
Arms go up. A collection of whoops ripple the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dancer wraps her legs around the pole and oozes upward headfirst. The CAMERA ROTATES as she stretches her booted heels into the crowd. We realize that she has been dancing on the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<FEMALE_DJ>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEMALE_DJ>
<DIRECTION>
ALIKE (pronounced AH-LEE-KAY), 17, covers her mouth, laughing and wide-eyed. She tries to back away from the stage, but is pushed forward by a torrent of eager arms waving dollar bills. Among them is LAURA, 18, worldly and smooth.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where your singles at?!! Where your singles at?!! Yeah, baby!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
Laura strains over Alike's shoulder to tuck a bill into the dancer's boot. Alike drops her beer in all the jostling.
</DIRECTION>
<FEMALE_DJ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn I love my job!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEMALE_DJ>
<DIRECTION>
Laura stuffs a bill into Alike's now empty hand and forcibly waves Alike's wrist in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alike pulls free just as the dancer takes notice and begins to direct her attention at her.
</DIRECTION>
<ALIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop! Chill!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALIKE>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatchu' come here for?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
Alike shoves the dollar bill into Laura's chest and shoulders her way past the wall of onlookers surrounding the stage. Laura shrugs, puts the bill in her teeth and lays her head at the edge of the stage. Alike looks away and breaks through a snarl of clubgoers just as the dancer begins to descend.
</DIRECTION>
<ALIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me. Sorry. Excuse me. Oof, sorry ladies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Finally free of the throng, Alike takes a breath and looks at the clock on her cell phone.
</DIRECTION>
<ALIKE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALIKE>
<DIRECTION>
She rolls her eyes back to the stage where Laura is no longer visible. Not daring to risk another plunge into the throbbing crowd, she retreats for the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<FEMALE_DJ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEMALE_DJ>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHTCLUB BAR- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alike beaches at an empty spot at the bar. Her gaze settles on a CUTE GIRL a little ways down, staring out at the dance floor. Alike jerks her eyes away and smooths the front of her shirt and adjusts her hat as she edges toward the girl.
</DIRECTION>
<ALIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALIKE>
<DIRECTION>
The girl ignores her. Alike clears her throat and speaks a little too loudly.
</DIRECTION>
<ALIKE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Umm... Hey! How are you?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALIKE>
<DIRECTION>
The girl jerks around and frowns at Alike, looking her up and down.
</DIRECTION>
<CUTE_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUTE_GIRL>
<ALIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Umm...sorry. I was just sayin' Umm...hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALIKE>
<CUTE_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUTE_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
The girl dismisses Alike and turns back toward the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<ALIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. You wanna drink or something? Hey! Hey! Over here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Alike strains, snapping at the bartender. A CONFIDENT WOMAN swaggers up close to the girl and extends her hand. The cute girl takes it and allows herself to be lead to the dance floor. Alike looks around just in time to see her leaving. The bartender finally materializes, and Alike slinks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHTCLUB BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alike slumps into a long line of women waiting to squeeze the cramped, 2 stall bathroom. A COUPLE in front of her makes out vigorously, and she folds her arms and looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A buff 30-SOMETHING WOMAN with locs smiles and winks at Alike. Alike smiles and fidgets with her eyebrows and looks away. The line inches forward. Alike glances around searching for the woman. The 30-something has already lost interest, her attention now fully directed at a much more FEMININE WOMAN strutting out of the restroom. Embarrassed, Alike faces front again. Two androgynous gangsters (AGs) who have witnessed the whole thing nudge each other and sneer. Alike squares her shoulders and widens her stance. One of the AG's breaks out in laughter and they turn around as the line inches forward again. Alike pretends not to notice and slumps out of line and retreats for a lonely oasis of couch along the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHTCLUB COUCH - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alike dozes on the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<FEMALE_DJ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give it up for Sin-A-Min ladies!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEMALE_DJ>
<DIRECTION>
Alike wakes with a start. She checks the time on her cell phone. Cursing, she scrambles up from the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NIGHTCLUB BAR - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laura dances with a cute SHORT HAIRED GIRL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alike spots the pair from afar and heads in their direction.
</DIRECTION>
<ALIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, we're late.

	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ALIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Laura spins the short haired on the dance floor and the pair continue their wobbling, uneven groove. Alike endures several moments of invisibility as a sea of women, both "feminine" and "butch" push past her without a second glance. Alike tugs at Laura's jersey. Laura, happily tangled in her dance partner's embrace rolls her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop pulling on my clothes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUS STOP- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laura sulks, frowning out at the night. Alike extends the olive branch.
</DIRECTION>
<ALIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many numbers you get? One?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALIKE>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Tonya, Denise, Shelley. No wait that's old, I can delete that one. Tonya...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Laura snatches the phone from Alike. Alike swipes at it but misses. Laura fends her off with one hand and scrolls through the numbers with the other.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ain't Shelley that chick from your math class?! Denise... What? These are your damn study group numbers! Why you frontin'?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
Alike snatches the phone and wipes the screen with her sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<ALIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't see you with no list of numbers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALIKE>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ALIKE>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trying to help your ass. I'm sayin', whatchu waitin' for?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
Alike shrugs it off, her smile fading a little. Laura elbows her and sneers.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kickin' that same `ol quiet shit since 6th grade. I don't need to press, I gets plenty. Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ALIKE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alike becomes more quiet and less playful as the ride wears on. A middle-class Bronx landscape, well-lit with a newly constructed Starbucks and renovated condos flits by the window. Alike reaches over and presses the tape. Laura elbows Alike.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quit playing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ALIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</LAURA>
<ALIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why you gon' walk all the way back down for? That's stupid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALIKE>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make sure you get home okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
The bus pulls to the curb. The light flicks on over the back door.
</DIRECTION>
<ALIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ain't big, nigga. Trying to protect somebody. Hurry up, man, get off!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALIKE>
<LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
(to bus driver)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's alright man--next stop. Next stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
Alike elbows Laura sharply. The bus driver frowns in the rear view.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ain't gotta push me, why're you beastin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ALIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not beastin'.

</ALIKE>

Laura climbs over Alike and swings toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got a problem. Call me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<ALIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'ma call you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Alike turns and watches Laura stroll away. Laura drums a little beat on Alike's window as the bus pulls off. Alike waves and faces forward again. An OLD LADY sitting nearby shoots her a disapproving look. Alike rolls her eyes and moves to a seat farther away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alike studies her reflection in the window, and takes a breath. She unbuttons her bulky men's shirt to reveal a fitting baby doll shirt that reads "Princess." She stuffs her baseball cap and durag into her backpack and jabs a pair of small gold hoop earrings into her ears. She slumps back against the seat and stares into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bus stops at a lonely island of curb. Alike is a dark silhouette sprinting around the corner and into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALIKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alike cracks open the front door just wide enough to slip through. The house is dark except for the flashing microwave clock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alike takes off her sneakers and pads down the hallway. Her younger sister, SHARONDA's door cracks open as she passes.
</DIRECTION>
<SHARONDA>
	<DIALOGUE>

</SHARONDA>
<ALIKE>

</ALIKE>
<SHARONDA>
	<DIALOGUE>

Sharonda puts a hand to her head and does a little dance.
</DIRECTION>
<ALIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Alike eases Sharonda's door shut. Sharonda swings the door open wide.
</DIRECTION>
<SHARONDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night Lee!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHARONDA>
<DIRECTION>
Sharonda slams her door. The light clicks on underneath Alike's parent's door.
</DIRECTION>
<AUDREY>

<DIRECTION>
INT. ALIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alike rushes to shove her stuffed backpack under the bed. She tosses her shoes in the closet just as her mother, AUDREY appears in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<AUDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice to know you still live here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDREY>

Alike peels off her socks and slumps on the bed.

<ALIKE>

</ALIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Audrey gets cozy in the doorjamb. Alike turns her back on her and slumps into pajamas.
</DIRECTION>
<AUDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least you were cute. Where'd you get that shirt? `Princess'. I like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDREY>
<DIRECTION>
Alike winds the princess shirt around her fist and launches to the top of the closet.
</DIRECTION>
<ALIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's old.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALIKE>
<AUDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDREY>
<ALIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodnight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Audrey stiffens and pulls her robe tighter. Vinegar replaces honey in her demeanor as the warmth drains out of her voice.
</DIRECTION>
<AUDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really don't care for that young lady you run around with anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDREY>
<ALIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, okay!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALIKE>
<AUDREY>
	<DIALOGUE>

Alike snags a satin headscarf from the nightstand and slaps it around her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AUDREY(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's your head. And you really should wash your face, too.

<DIRECTION>
(Beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's your skin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUDREY>
<DIRECTION>
Audrey leaves. Alike is still. She listens for the door to her parent's room to shut before snatching off the scarf and storming to the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alike turns on the faucet, wets the soap and puts it back in the dish, wets her wash cloth and puts it back on the rack. She plops down on the toilet and looks up. A crucifix frowns down at her from the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She averts her eyes and stands to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<AUDREY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ALIKE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SCHOOL - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alike, bundled in an oversized hoodie edges up to the perimeter of campus and waits against a bus shelter. STUDENTS horseplay and mill about the entrance in groups, chugging their morning Fantas and munching on snack cakes. The school bell rings and the lawn slowly empties into the building. Alike shifts her weight and checks her watch as the last STRAGGLERS finally trickle in. She yanks her hoodie tighter and launches across the lawn and into the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A second school bell sounds and the din of slamming lockers and jubilant chatter dies to a hush as students shuffle into classrooms. Alike cracks the back stairwell door and peeks out into the mostly empty hallway before tearing for the bathroom. One last straggler BINA, a 17 year-old girl with mature, but down-to-earth good looks rushes past Alike. The two exchange a brief, confused look then mutually dismiss each other as they hurry in opposite directions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCHOOL BATHROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alike hurtles into the handicapped stall and snaps it shut behind her. She rips off her hoodie and the "girly" shirt beneath and flings them to the floor. She pulls out a pair of wife-beaters from her bag and pulls them over her head. She unwads a polo shirt and yanks it over her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at her reflection in the window and tries unsuccessfully to smooth her shirt. Her eyes scour her reflection again and again for any imperfections. She spots the earrings and yanks them out of her ears. The late bell beckons and Alike stuffs her "feminine" clothes into her backpack and bolts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MATH CLASSROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MATH TEACHER glides up and down the aisles passing out graded tests. A chorus of groans follows in her wake.
</DIRECTION>
<MATH_TEACHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As promised, I will be grading these on a curve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATH_TEACHER>
<DIRECTION>
Alike is folded into the backmost corner of the classroom. The desks in front her and beside her are empty. She is ignored as the rest of the class chatters and passes notes.
</DIRECTION>
<MATH_TEACHER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the highest grade on the test was a 98.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATH_TEACHER>
<DIRECTION>
The math teacher puts Alike's test on her desk and gives her a little smile. Alike doesn't smile back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lunch bell rings and the class is a tornado, clearing the room in a rush of limbs, shouts, and backpacks. Alike jabs her headphones into her ears and packs her bag very deliberately, letting the eye of the storm pass over her before heading toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCHOOL CAFETERIA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cafeteria is a whirl of activity and social jockeying. Clusters of girls and boys loud-talk, flirt, fight and horseplay at tables and in tight little groups against the walls. Alike walks alone, staying at the fringes of the crowd and shrugs through the cafeteria line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alike flees the cafeteria, tray laden with rubbery cuisine of dubious nutritional value. She raps on the door of a classroom and slips in.

</ALIKE>
<DIRECTION>
MRS. ALVARADO, a middle aged Californian ex-hippie type reclines with her feet on her desk, munching on celery sticks and sunflower seed paste. Her small desk radio plays alternative rock. Sun beams into the empty classroom and Alike squints as she yanks the headphones out of her ears and pulls up a chair next to her desk.

INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Audrey is a heat-seeking missile, whipping through the sparse hallways of the trauma wing, her clipboard and pen in constant motion. NURSES and AIDES scatter in her wake, suddenly busying themselves with little bits of chore work to avoid her caustic gaze. She barks at a cluster of CLERKS chit- chatting in the elevator bank and all but one manage to escape. Audrey drills her.
</DIRECTION>
<AUDREY>

INT. HOSPITAL BREAK ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Audrey whisks her lunch bag out of the fridge and heads toward a table. A few lounging AIDES wad up their garbage and flee the break room. Audrey settles down at the table and pulls a fashion magazine from her work tote, pretending not to be hurt. She peels open a cup of vanilla yogurt and begins reading. A big red department store bag sits next to her work tote. The television suspended over the table mumbles corporate healthcare infomercials. MRS. SINGLETARY, one of Audrey's co-workers swoops in and plops a plastic grocery bag on the table across from her.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_SINGLETARY>

Audrey's steely exterior melts away and suddenly she is all butterflies and giggles. She rifles through the bag and hoists out a pink ribbed v-neck sweater.

<MRS_SINGLETARY>

</MRS_SINGLETARY>
<DIRECTION>
The co-workers hoot in unison and descend upon the various parts of the breakroom. Audrey shoves the sweater back in the bag and nestles it between her feet. Somebody cranks on a small radio and a frisky R&B beat invades the air. Mrs. Singletary pats Audrey on the arm.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_SINGLETARY>

Alike plucks the headphones out of her ears, watching them leave. Mika casts a parting glance over her shoulder at Alike. Remnant's of Alike's grin return reflexively. Mika's friend jerks her elbow around.

A picture of a girl making a kissy face with the name "Tasha" underneath blinks onto the screen and Laura snaps the phone shut and tosses it aside.

EXT. THE PIERS - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pier is a parade of mohawks, curly weaves, tight jeans, and rainbow belts as groups of baby dykes, young queens, and gender queer youth of all shades of brown stroll cavort, and strut seeing and wanting to be seen. Equally bedecked observers hoot and yell from bench and rail perches on both sides. Laura jabs numbers into her cell phone. Competing threads of house music throb across the boardwalk in muffled bursts as groups of ballers vogue and prance behind her.

Laura scowls at her cell phone screen. She shoves the phone in her pocket and pulls her hoodie up against the chill of the evening. Brake lights bathe Laura and her circle of AG's in red as late-night predators cruise the strip for fresh meat. Laura catches sight of shady sexual encounters in an alley across the street and looks away. One of the entourage passes Laura a joint and she inhales deeply. A few of the girls have backpacks and the group is pensive as they break off and scatter into the night one by one.

Bina studies Alike's profile. She leans in and pecks Alike on the cheek. Alike lets the kiss soak in, glancing at Bina sidelong. Bina leans in again, this time planting a long kiss on Alike's lips. Alike pulls away. Bina tenses for the verdict.

INT. LAURA'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laura and a group of friends play a rowdy game of spades. A cute Puerto Rican girl is draped around Laura's neck like a PERSONAL CHEERLEADER. Music blasts from the TV but doesn't drown out the hoots and banter of the rollicking entourage. There is a knock at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll get that for me?

One of the friends breaks away from the pack, opens the door without greeting and walks away. Alike is left alone to escort herself in. Laura hardly looks up as Alike stops at the fringes of the pack.

Audrey slaps the sandwich off Arthur's plate and storms to the bedroom. Arthur sees Sharonda peeking from her bedroom door but can't summon any words. Sharonda skitters into Alike's bedroom.

INT. HOUSE PARTY/POETRY SLAM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MOHAWKED WOMAN yowls into a microphone atop a coffee table turned stage. Kids roam from room to room nursing plastic cups. Some in elaborate ensembles, some in thrift store duds, others in plain old jeans, but no two people the same. Alike clad in simple shirt and jeans looks especially comfortable as she and Bina ease their way through the crowd. In between performers, guitar riffs rock the large loft apartment and render their voices practically inaudible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MONTAGE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--Bina introduces Alike to different people, Alike is welcomed
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--Alike & Bina point out different performers, they laugh and talk in each other's ears
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--Alike and Bina dance wildly in the middle of the crowd, surrounded by dozens of other clamorous bodies
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--One performer beckons Alike up onto the table, Alike demurs at first, then leaps on top of the table. Bina cheers.
</DIRECTION>

--Alike drags a giggling Bina out of the party and they crash into the open night

EXT. THE PIERS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lights glisten across the Hudson River--distant orbs reflected in a thousand shimmering faux stars in weak defiance against the night sky. A sodium vapor glow veils everything in generous haloes, making the night more beautiful than it really is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dancing silhouettes, laughing, playing, yelling, flying, always dancing silhouettes punctuate the summer breeze with clapping set to the rhythm of soulful house. Like Puck on a midsummer's night, like Peter Pan and his lost boys. Among the silhouettes is Laura, enthroned atop a railing. Laura, smoking a joint grandly, surrounded by an adoring circle, a sycophantic harem of four.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laura, completely miserable as she watches two other silhouettes drawing closer, spinning, collapsing, now righting, always connected. Alike and Bina. Bina smiles and snakes her arms around Alike's neck. Alike too shy to react, giggles and folds. Laura watches the pair spin and passes to the left before stalking off toward the connected shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE PIERS- CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laura cuffs Alike on the neck, pulling Alike's hoodie up over her face. Alike's laugh is tentative at first, not sure whether this is play or for real. Laura chuckles, breaking the ice. The pair slapbox and rough house, both missing with wild arcing blows. Laura aims a mini charge at Alike that lifts her off the ground and deposits her a short distance away. Alike swipes Laura's hat. Laura claps Alike on the shoulder and Alike waves to Bina. Bina waves and smiles.
</DIRECTION>

<LAURA>

Alike waves it off, oblivious and intoxicated with the night.

Alike is stopped cold, as the light bulb finally goes off. Laura takes a long drag on the joint. Bina and Mika stumble over giggling. Bina hooks Alike's arm. Mika kisses Laura on the neck. Laura snaps out of her gaze, her familiar smirk creeping back.

INT. LAURA'S KITCHEN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laura stands over the kitchen table shuffling through the mail. She pauses at a stiff envelope with her name on it. The return address reads "NYS Educational & Testing Services". She flips the envelope over and looks around, she rips the top off and eases the top of a slip out of the envelope. The top of the slip reads "'Campbell, Laura' GED TESTING RESULTS."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BRONX HOME - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laura shifts her weight on a painted concrete porch outside a small wooden frame home. The paint is peeling and the flowers in the window-box are dead. A rusted metal mailbox next to the door overflows with circulars. Laura lifts the circulars out of the box and trashes them. She picks up a discarded fast food bag and tosses it too. A dog barks from a neighboring yard. Laura pulls open the screen door and tries to peer in through the diamond shaped window in the main door, but it's covered over in aluminum foil. More barking. Laura surveys the street and bangs hard on the door. She snaps the screen door back and takes a big step backward. Laura shifts her weight and smooths her shirt. LAURA'S MOTHER, 54, and no-nonsense opens the door and frowns down at Laura through the screen.

INT. BINA'S BEDROOM - MORNING

Alike recruits the discarded stuffed moose and dances it around on the bed. Bina recoils and snatches it away. Recognition seeps across Alike's pained face. Bina moves away from the bed and turns her back on Alike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alike finds her pajama pants on the floor and yanks them on. She pulls on jeans over her pajama bottoms and hauls a sweatshirt down over her nightie. She flings her backpack open on the bed and hunts around the room wildly gathering her things. Alike goes in the bathroom and reappears with an armful of toiletries, dumping them in the bag. Bina watches her, arms folded. Alike takes one last look around the room and heads for the door, running a sleeve across her face.

EXT. BINA'S HOUSE/STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alike rages outside, weaving blind fury down the sidewalk. She kicks over a cluster of garbage cans and cyclones out into the street, narrowly missing getting hit by a car. She continues her zag to the other sidewalk, her pace quickening. She rips open her backpack and launches a baseball cap into the air. She tears a handful of wifebeaters from the bag and flings them into the street. Spinning and thrashing she wrenches out a football jersey and jams it into another garbage can. She circles back and kicks the can over. She hurtles her backpack into the trees like a discus and sheds her hoodie like a skin before disappearing into the scream of a subway station.

Alike attacks her closet, ripping all the "girly" shirts from the hangers and hurling them toward a small vanity trashcan. She plunges back in and slams an armful of blouses to the floor. She launches a pair of pumps into the wall, followed by a chunky pair of Timberlands. Silent sobs rack her body as she tears off her own shirt and slings it at the mirror. She strips off her jeans and kicks them brutally into a corner. Alike considers her unclothed form in the mirror before collapsing onto the bed. She writhes against the pillows and covers her eyes with her elbow as darts of grief twist through her body. Blackout.

Alike jerks awake in her bed, a pillow pulled down around her ears. The sound of a muffled argument leaks from her parents's bedroom.

Audrey sits at the edge of her bed in a housecoat. Her hair is ruffled and flyaway. Her ankles are crossed and her hands are dead birds in her lap.

Audrey, still in her housecoat, stares into the refrigerator, transfixed by the mountain of foil-covered plates. Her eyes are cried-out buttons. Suddenly she remembers to breathe, and her breaths come raggedly tearing out fresh tears. She yanks a foil-covered plate, dumps its contents into the trash can and tosses the plate into the sink. She dumps another and another, her composure returning with each plate tossed. By the time she gets to the last one, her breathing slows and returns to normal. She disappears into the bedroom and reappears with the red shopping bag. She calmly lifts out the pink blouse and stuffs it into the garbage. She wads up the shopping bag and stuffs it in too. She takes a deep breath and wipes her sleeve across her nose.

Laura hears a noise at the door and gets up to investigate. Arthur is standing in the doorway. Laura calls out to Alike. Alike looks up and the smile fades from her face.
