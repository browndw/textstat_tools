INT. TRIBECA LOFT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA TRACKS slowly through clouds of moving dust. Shafts of muted light pierce the dense atmosphere. An eerie netherworld envelops us. Strange ghostly forms appear and disappear in the distance. They seem like apparitions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Broken timbers and dangling cables emerge from the smoky light. We see hints of a huge demolished space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An old white plaster wall FILLS THE SCREEN. Momentary blips of light flash across it. SOUNDS of street traffic are heard dimly in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With startling impact, the SOUND of a sledgehammer explodes out of nowhere. The wall shudders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAMMER BLOWS assault the audience. They are loud and jarring. The wall buckles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chunks of plaster CRASH to the floor. The air fills with new swirls of white dust. The SLEDGEHAMMER smashes INTO VIEW. Beams of sunlight cut through the cracks, piercing the atmosphere like searchlights in a fog. A huge section of wall falls toward camera as more plaster billows into the air. We hear voices talking.

Through jagged holes we can make out three dim figures on the other side of the wall, all wielding SLEDGEHAMMERS.

One of the figures adjusts something over his face. Isolated rays of sunlight dance around him casting long shadows in the air.

ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA MOVES IN and for the first time we see them. MOLLY JENSEN, in her late 20's, has a bandanna around her hair and a workman's mask over her nose, but we can tell from her eyes and cheekbones that she is beautiful. SAM WHEAT, in his late 30's, is also hidden behind a mask, but he has a strong forehead and handsome features. Sweat is dripping down his brow, leaving streaks in the dust. CARL BRUNER, early 30's, removes his mask revealing a good looking young man with a fashionable two-day stubble. Both men have their shirts off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACKNESS AND A LOUD THUD. Suddenly a shaft of light penetrates the darkness. Another thud and more light. We see a hole. The hook of a crowbar enters it, grappling with something around the edges. Then, with a tug and a loud yank, a huge section of tin ceiling crashes to the floor. Huge clouds of dust fly into the air. Molly looks up, astonished.
</DIRECTION>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam, look, there's a whole eight feet up there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And about eighty years of dust.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have all this height, Sam. We could add a second floor and put our bedroom upstairs. That would leave all this space.

<SAM>

(eyeing her curiously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what?

<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For space. Just space.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Carl laughs as he looks at Sam. Their bodies, covered with white powder, appear as strange, ghostly figures.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam, this may be none of my business, but I'm concerned you're doing too much coke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
Sam glances down at his white body. They all laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Sam, turn around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
Sam obeys. Molly doodles on his chest, drawing a bow tie and the outline of a tuxedo jacket. Her lines are quick, accomplished, and subtly erotic.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
<DIRECTION>
(offering his body)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How 'bout me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
Molly nods. She reaches out and superimposes an armless female torso over his. His stomach jumps sensually as she touches it. Molly pulls back to admire her work. He looks like a Greek statue.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll never wash again.

Molly laughs.

<DIRECTION>
give)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
In unison, they hit it once more. A massive section of plaster and metal topples to the ground. New clouds of dust fill the air. Suddenly, Sam spies an old jar lying on the floor. Something rattles inside it, a penny.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, look what I found. There's a penny inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he hands it to Molly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For luck in our new loft. It's a good omen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<MOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking her head, disagreeing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the good omen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
She glances at him lovingly. Carl looks at the two of them and grins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the dust settles we see, for the first time, the outlines of the space they are working in. It is a huge loft over four thousand square feet. Banks of windows run east and west. Molly steps back and admires the room.
</DIRECTION>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's gorgeous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys lucked out. Hell, I bet you could sell it tomorrow and double your investment.

It is morning rush hour. Sam and Carl, both wearing suits and ties, exit the Wall Street subway station and approach the Headquarters of Market Security Bank & Trust.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, by the way, Sam, I had to move your 3:00 with Bob Kahan to 4:00 so you could squeeze in Gary Alan. He called yesterday and said he has to see you today about the Danway stuff. Three o'clock was the only time he could make it. Also, the board meeting in L.A. has been confirmed for the 12th. I got you on a 9:00 a.m. flight.

<DIRECTION>
Sam and Carl are standing on a crowded elevator. It is deadly quiet. Suddenly Carl elbows Sam and winks. There is something he wants him to do. Sam hesitates a moment, annoyed, and then relents. He clears his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So Carl, what did the doctor say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said it was contagious. Very contagious. I shouldn't be going into work today.

Sam and Carl, laughing, walk through a large office area bustling with activity. Employees, in various cubicles, are talking on telephones and punching information into computers.

Sam heads into his executive office. Carl steps into a cubicle across the aisle. ROSE, Sam's secretary, approaches him.

</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid that's the only Japanese I know. But I realize it's not our language fluency, or lack of it, that brings you to Market Security. Rather, I'm sure, it is our banking expertise, our ability to represent and anticipate all of your banking needs. As you know, we are not the largest banking establishment in New York.

A CARVED WOODEN ANGEL

eight feet tall, ascending into an afternoon sky. As the CAMERA PULLS BACK we see that we are inside a building and that the angel is dangling outside an open doorway high above the street.

A group of workmen grab for the angel, but have difficulty bringing it in. Suddenly Molly steps INTO the FRAME.

Sam jumps up, grabs hold of the door's top molding, and swings out over the sidewalk. Molly gasps. Sam's feet push at the angel and send it swinging away and then back toward the loft. Quickly he jumps back, grabs hold of it, and brings it in. The workmen applaud. Molly eyes him with admiration.

As the angel pulls away from camera, we see the newly decorated loft for the first time. It is painted now in lovely pastels. The floor, a huge gymnasium-like expanse, is lacquered with polyurethane. Furniture and boxes are piling up along the walls. Dominating the space, with a kind of surreal presence, are a large number of Molly's sculptures and ceramics. There is also a vintage jukebox.

Molly runs her fingers down Sam's naked back. The moment is sweet and erotic. We watch as Sam slowly draws his fingers down over Molly's face, gently caressing her forehead, her eyes, her lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam slides his hands under Molly's T-shirt, slowly moving them toward her breasts. Her breathing slows. They dance silently, her hair swaying in the soft light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the sounds of their bare feet on the highly polished floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sensuously, Molly's shirt lifts above her navel as Sam presses into her. Their stomachs touch and part and touch again. She bites her lip. Sam eyes her moonlit form as she strokes his chest, slowly moving her fingers down his torso, around the curve of his hips, and then digging into the back of his jeans.

Sam leans into Molly and nips at her neck. She stops dancing. Her eyes close. She stands absolutely still. Sam's hands move to her backside. He pulls her closer.

AN INTENSE LOOKING MAN

The two men run down the dark street, but the Mugger is already a full block ahead and disappears into the shadows.

Sam gives up. Slowly he turns and begins walking back toward Molly.

It is Sam's dead body she is holding in her arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam's ghostly form, still solid to all appearances, stands beside Molly. His eyes are awash in horror and confusion. He seems unable to move. THE CAMERA HOLDS on his face as the full impact of his situation dawns in his eyes.

<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he lets out a blood-curdling scream.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!!!!!!

</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
He jumps down toward his body and reaches out to grab hold of his motionless form. His hands make a strange SOUND as they pass right though it. It is terrifying. Sam jumps up, crazed, frenzied, and begins circling Molly. It is as though he is trying to undo what has been done.

Sam watches helplessly as they reach his body. Molly looks up and begins screaming hysterically. One of the Men grabs her as the other goes for Sam's wrist. There is no sign of life.
</DIRECTION>

The first Man holds Molly back as his friend stoops down and begins some form of cardio-pulmonary resuscitation. There is no response. Sam bends down, trying desperately to help. It is a futile gesture.

There is no response. Sam, deeply troubled, hesitates for a moment. He is torn between Molly and the light. Then, in a painful, but conscious gesture, he turns from the light and walks toward Molly. At that instant, the light behind him disappears with the sound of a pneumatic door closing. There is a sense of terrible finality as the tunnel evaporates into the void. Sam is left on the dark pavement. He stands there a moment, as if in shock, and then begins running toward Molly. An AMBULANCE is rounding the corner.

Sam doesn't want Molly to go and begins to follow her, but then seems torn, afraid to leave his body. He turns back just as his corpse, covered in a green sheet, is wheeled into the corridor and parked alongside the wall. Sam seems stunned and inconsolable as he sits down beside it.

SAM'S P.O.V.

as the stretcher begins to roll right through him. The penetration of his physical space is horrifying to Sam. He stands, almost paralyzed, as the body of the Orderly intersects with his. It is a stunning moment of extraordinary strangeness as we witness the atoms and molecules of the Orderly's body passing through his. It is like a glimpse of ultimate chaos, the universe within.
</DIRECTION>

Then, in a flash, the Orderly has passed through, but Sam is still shaking. He stares up at the ceiling.

EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, images begin to emerge out of the blackness. It takes a moment to realize that they are scenes from Sam's funeral.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA TRACKS along rows of mourners as seen from SAM'S P.O.V. He seems to be floating among them. We hear snippets of conversations. It all seems strangely odd and disjointed. Time seems unfixed, malleable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a MINISTER standing beside the grave.

<MINISTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As we say farewell to our friend Sam Wheat, we are reminded of his kindness, his generosity, his buoyancy of spirit...

<DIRECTION>
Sam notices a WOMAN in a fancy print dress comforting one of the mourners. The woman looks up at him, smiles, and waves. Sam is surprised. He looks behind him, but no one is there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he turns back, the woman is walking away. She appears just like any normal person until she approaches a large gravestone and passes right through it. Sam is shocked.
</DIRECTION>

Suddenly, Molly ENTERS THE FRAME. Sam spots her. The CAMERA STOPS.

<SAM>

	Molly.

</SAM>

She does not respond. RUTH, her sister, leans over to her. Tears form in Molly's eyes. A hand reaches out to give her a tissue. Molly looks up. It is Carl. She gives him her hand. He squeezes it with affection.

<DIRECTION>
The casket is lowered into the ground. Molly approaches the grave. She us a little unsteady. Carl takes her elbow. A shovel is placed in her hands. With great emotional effort she lifts a shovelful of dirt and tosses it onto the casket. It lands with a REVERBERATING finality. Sam shudders.

INT. LOFT - DAY

Molly is sitting on the couch in the middle of the loft surrounded by FRIENDS and WELL WISHERS. A young GIRL, her niece, cuddles in her lap. People are eating and milling around. Slowly THE CAMERA BEGINS TO PAN. It ends on Sam, standing alone in a corner. In the midst of all the activity he is lost and alone.

ANGLE

<DIRECTION>
Raw clay on a potter's wheel spins hypnotically, sensuously. Molly's wet hands press in, shaping it, molding it. A bowl begins to appear. The camera pulls back and reveals Sam. He is sitting on the floor behind her, knees pressed to his chest, rocking aimlessly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Molly looks away from the bowl she is forming. It distorts and bends. Angry, she digs her finger into it. The bowl disintegrates. Tears form in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank jumps up on the bench beside her. Molly stares sadly around the room. Quietly, she begins talking to herself, to the air.

Sam walks over to Molly. Desperate for contact, he reaches out to touch her cheek, but then hesitates and pulls back.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I think about you every minute. It's like you're still here, like I can feel you, Sam.

Suddenly, as if hearing Sam's voice, the cat begins to hiss. Molly spins around. The cat scans the room. Unexpectedly, Sam's and the cat's eyes meet... With a wild SCREECH, the cat jumps from the bench and takes off running. Sam recoils. Molly stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank, what's wrong? Frank?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>

The cat is nowhere to be seen. All of a sudden, Molly freezes. Sam is standing right beside her. It is almost as though she senses his presence.

<MOLLY>

(continuing; whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
She holds very still for a moment. Sam watches breathlessly, loving her, wanting her. Then quietly, hopefully, he reaches out. It is a useless gesture. In a moment of great poignancy, Molly shakes her head and walks right through him. He remains IN THE FRAME, alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam, stands in the corner of a large, walk-in closet, watching as Molly goes through his effects. Boxes, scattered underfoot, are filling up with his life's possessions. Molly reaches for a shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, Moll. Not that one. That's my favorite...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
She tosses it into a box and then takes down a sweater. It is obviously handmade, about four sizes too big. Sam recognizes it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Molly holds the sweater tenderly and presses it to her cheek. After a moment she puts it back. Then, in a surprising outburst, she cries out and begins flailing at the shelves. Everything comes flying off. Sam reaches out to console her.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY

Molly and Carl are standing over the kitchen table folding piles of Sam's clothes and placing them into boxes. As Molly lifts one of Sam's jackets, something falls from a side pocket. It is his small black leather address book. Sam stares at it with recognition. Carl sees the book fall and stoops to pick it up but Molly gets it first.

<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam's address book.

</MOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
She skims through it a moment, but the memories it evokes are too powerful for her. She places it carefully into a box labeled "Sam's Things -- Valuable" and continues packing. She finds the old jar with the penny in it. It's marked "For Luck". She holds it tenderly for a moment and then places it on the nightstand beside the bed.

Carl discovers some old ticket stubs in another of Sam's jackets. He examines them.

The door slams shut. Sam is locked inside. Frightened and desperate, he rushes for the door knob. His hand sinks through it. There is a strange sound, like ELECTRICAL STATIC, as it penetrates the metal and wood. Frightened, he yanks it back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam circles the space several times and then returns to the door. Clenching his teeth, he reaches out again. As his hand pushes up against it, we sense that he experiences a subtle resistance. The hairs on the back of his hand vibrate as his ghostly form presses into it. We sense Sam's fear as his entire arm DISAPPEARS FROM VIEW. The grating ELECTRICAL SOUND shudders up his spine.

The sight of his amputated limb is unsettling but Sam does not pull back. Slowly he edges in and presses his face into the molecules of the wood.

He stops, realizing the last word of the song. He sits silently, staring at the wall.

Suddenly, there is a SOUND at the door. Sam's eyes shoot up. The door begins to open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam stands up. His face begins to tighten. We know instantly that something is wrong. His eyes fill with a fury we have not seen before.

Entering the bedroom, the Mugger goes to the dresser and quickly examines the drawers. He is very neat, careful to leave no sign that he was there. He seems to be looking for something but cannot find it.

ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly we hear a KEY TURNING in the front door. The Mugger seems startled. He dashes from the bedroom and hides quickly behind one of the large sculptures. We hear the door OPEN. Molly is standing there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam goes crazy.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Molly, no! Get out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Molly closes the door and locks it shut. Sam freezes as she heads for the bedroom. She walks right past the Mugger. To Sam's horror she stops and turns to look around. There is a curious expression on her face. Seeing nothing she continues through the loft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mugger pulls out his gun. Sam looks on in absolute terror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Molly's purple blouse hits the floor as she begins to remove her clothes. She turns on the radio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam doesn't know what to do. The Mugger seems excited by Molly's semi-nudity. He begins skirting the edges of the loft, moving toward the bedroom. Sam is crazed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, out of nowhere, Frank appears at the Mugger's feet. Sam's eyes light up. He drops to his knees, crawls over to him, glares into his eyes, and screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - THE CAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCREECHES and jumps straight up. His claws shoot out at the mugger's face, ripping into the flesh near his eye.

Blood appears. The mugger sees it dripping through his fingers. The sight of it upsets him. He grabs the cat angrily by the neck. It SQUEALS. Molly in her bra, peers from the bedroom.

The Mugger holds the cat's mouth shut. Seeing and hearing nothing, Molly steps back into the bedroom.

The Mugger takes the cat and throws it across the floor. Holding his eye, he gets up and rushes for the exit. Sam runs after him, but the door closes before he can get through. He is left inside.

EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mugger steps out onto the sidewalk and hurries toward the subway. A patch of sleeve soaks up the blood from his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam starts after the man but instantly freezes. Hordes of people crowd the sidewalk. The crush of humanity is frightening. Two lovers, holding hands, are coming right at him. Before Sam is able to move, we hear the sound of their arms cutting through his ghostly form.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam tries instinctively to dodge the crowds but people approach him from all angles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a BABY CARRIAGE roll through Sam's feet and he nearly falls over trying to avoid it. His instincts will not let go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A barrage of images and SOUNDS assaults Sam. It is more than he can handle. Still, he refuses to give up. He stays close to the Mugger.

The Mugger gets onto a crowded subway car. Sam stands near a corner of the train watching him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Sam notices that something odd is happening. One of the riders at the other end of the car is walking toward him. As he approaches the Mugger, he does not stop, but passes right through him. It takes Sam a moment to realize what is happening, but then it is too late.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - THE OTHER GHOST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With unholy fury the New Ghost charges into Sam. The attack is so unexpected and ferocious that Sam has no sense of how to defend himself. With unexpected power, the Ghost grabs hold of him and slams him into the subway door. Sam's head plows right through it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE

</DIRECTION>

Sam surges through the door at the end of the train and finds himself on the bridge between the subway cars. The subway Ghost stares at him through the window with a wild, insane look.

Sam follows the Mugger down a long covered staircase to the street.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. 321 PROSPECT PLACE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mugger heads toward 321 Prospect Place. The streets are lined with old apartment buildings. Many windows are boarded up. TWO MEN, standing on the corner, are slamming a piece of heavy machinery onto the pavement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam hears GOSPEL MUSIC coming from a storefront church and notices a sign, "SISTER ODA MAE BROWN, MEDIUM, SPIRIT READER, ADVISOR." He looks up to a third story window and sees a similar sign with day-glo arrows pointing to the entrance on the street. He seems curious, but then realizes that the Mugger is nearly halfway down the block. He turns and rushes after him.

Sam enters Willie's apartment. It is a squalid affair. Peeled paint chips litter the floor. The bed is unmade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie pulls open a drawer in a small nightstand and drops in the keys to Molly's loft. Sam sees his wallet. His driver's license, bank ID, and a photo of Molly are there, too. Furious, Sam lunges for Willie but then holds his punch, knowing it will have no effect. He turns instead to a window and, like the Ghost on the subway, smashes it with his fist. Nothing happens.

Sam storms down the street. His movements seem undirected, utterly aimless. He is seething inside.
</DIRECTION>

Suddenly Sam looks up. An old BAG LADY is walking down the street talking loudly to a SHORT WOMAN tagging along beside her. As they approach a street pole, the Bag Lady swerves to the side. The Short Woman, however, walks right through it. Passersby laugh at the Old Lady talking to herself. Sam, unsettled, rushes away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Sam rounds a corner, a sudden blast of MUSIC explodes out of nowhere. Sam jumps into the street, gasping. A phonograph needle SCRATCHES across a record and the MUSIC STOPS. A woman's voice booms out:

PANNING SHOT

Sam looks up. He is back in front of the storefront church with the sign for SISTER ODA MAE BROWN, MEDIUM, SPIRIT READER, ADVISOR, hanging overhead. Below it is another sign. "Contact the dearly departed. $20.00".

Sam stares at the sign with curiosity. The MUSIC is compelling. After a moment's hesitation, he goes in the open door.

A record player is sitting near the storefront window, a makeshift microphone placed in front of it.

Several rows of folding chairs face a raised platform with nothing on it. A number of people are sitting there, mostly women. One gets the sense that this is a cross between a waiting room and a meeting hall. A black WOMAN steps up on the platform and calls out:

In the center of the room is a round seance table. Two heavyset sisters, CLARA (39), and LOUISE (36), are standing beside an open closet. It is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>

Mrs. Santiago sits at the table. She seems apprehensive. Clara steps into the closet and taps on each of the walls as though demonstrating that they are solid.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My sister will be with us soon.

She steps back out and closes the door. Louise inserts a tape into a boom box and then steps forward.

ANGLE FAVORING CLOSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns back to the closet and opens the door. Like magic, ODA MAE BROWN, 41, appears standing inside. She is a black woman in a white tunic. The whiteness of her garment makes it look as if she is glowing in the dark. Mrs. Santiago is wide-eyed. Sam smiles as Oda Mae steps into the room.

She takes a twenty dollar bill from her purse and hands it to Oda Mae. Clara graciously intercepts the money.

Tears well up in her eyes. She crosses herself several times.

Mrs. Santiago, utterly fascinated, nods understandingly.

Oda Mae's eyes glance up curiously for a second, as though she heard something, and then she continues.
</DIRECTION>
<ODA_MAE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, let's get ready then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ODA_MAE>
<DIRECTION>
Sam steps back as the sisters get up and position themselves behind Oda Mae. The moment feels rehearsed, theatrical. Oda Mae raises her hands into the air and closes her eyes. There is a hush in the room. Her body begins to tremble. Mrs. Santiago clutches her chair. Suddenly Oda Mae breaks out of her trance.
</DIRECTION>
<ODA_MAE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got a problem here. I don't think he's in. Wait. I feel something. Did he know someone who's passed over, someone named Anna... Mary... Consuela... Maria?

<ODA_MAE>

<DIRECTION>
Oda Mae jumps up and stares at her sisters. They look back at her curiously. They can't figure out what's wrong. Neither can Oda Mae.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Santiago reaches into her purse. A twenty dollar bill changes hands. Sam watches, amazed at it all. Oda Mae sits down and goes back into her trance. Her eyeballs roll up into their sockets.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARA_LOUISE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus.

Oda Mae is beginning to shake again. The two women grab her shoulders to keep her from falling out of the chair. Suddenly her whole body stiffens.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARA_LOUISE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Have mercy! Have mercy!

Mrs. Santiago stares on in amazement. After a moment Oda Mae's body collapses in a heap. Then, like a phoenix rising from the ashes, she pulls herself up in her chair and assumes a normal pose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After several seconds to get her bearings, Oda Mae begins to speak. Only now she has an entirely new voice. It sounds deep and hoarse, like an old man's. For all its put on theatricality, it is strangely convincing.
</DIRECTION>
<ODA_MAE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	A black suit? Oh yes, yes. He was buried in that.

Mrs. Santiago begins to cry. Sam looks around the room with growing disgust. Then he leans over to Oda Mae and yells into her ear.
</DIRECTION>

Oda Mae nearly falls off her chair. She spins around.

Sam is stunned. Clara and Louise look at one another in total confusion. This is obviously not part of the act. Mrs. Santiago seems frightened.

	They've got a million cons. A lot of times they read the obits. All she had to do was see the word "banker". Hell, they even go through your garbage to find things they can use, letters, old papers. They don't need much.

Molly begins to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<SGT_BEIDERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I know this is hard. People want so much to believe. They're grieving, vulnerable. They'd give anything for one last moment... money, insurance policies. Believe me, these people know what they're doing. Look, I know how you must feel. You know, you can press charges.

Molly shakes her head no. Sgt. Beiderman closes the file. Molly sits for a long time. She is in terrible pain.

INT. BEDROOM - LATE AFTERNOON (THE SAME DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Molly is sitting in her bedroom. The glow of the late afternoon sunlight casts long shadows across the bed. She seems deeply depressed and alone. Gradually her gaze falls on a jar sitting on the nightstand. In it is the penny Sam found when they were first working on the loft. A label on the jar says, "For Luck!" In a moment of sudden rage, she picks it up and throws it against the wall. It SHATTERS on the floor.

Carl picks up the phone and punches a number. Someone answers.

INT. LOFT - THE SAME NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Molly, in a short terrycloth robe, is sitting in a chair. A magazine is on her lap but she is staring vacantly into the loft. She seems lost in the vast space. Sam is pacing back and forth. There is a melancholy look in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>

Sam freezes. Molly is surprised. She hesitates a moment and then pushes the buzzer to let him in. We hear Carl bounding up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't open it. He's a murderer, Moll!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
There is a KNOCK. Molly opens the door. Carl seems buoyant, almost celebratory. He has a bag of fruit in his hand. He is still in a suit and tie.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. Thanks. I know it's late. I'm sorry to disturb you. I felt bad about last night. This supernatural stuff just makes me so uncomfortable. I don't even read horoscopes.

<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. It's okay.

<DIRECTION>
(he poses sadly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then on top of it all... it's the responsibilities. They've given me my own accounts, but I've had no time to adjust. My mind has been reeling.

Molly reaches out and pats his arm. There is an awkward pause.

Sam looks at her, amazed. Carl, on the other hand, stiffens. He laughs nervously.

	You're kidding. You really did it? I don't believe... What did you tell them? What did they say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<MOLLY>

	You were right, you know. I felt like such a fool. They brought out a file on this psychic woman ten inches thick. It was awful.

Sam is devastated.

(milking it)
</DIRECTION>

	It's hard to face reality, Moll, the hard cold facts of it. What you have to remember is the love you felt. That's what's real. You have to remember how good Sam was. How much he loved you.

Molly holds back tears. Carl reaches out tenderly and strokes her hair.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Let your feelings out.

</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
Almost imperceptibly, his hand moves down to the nape of her neck. As she moves, her robe opens slightly. Carl notices, glimpsing her nakedness beneath it. Sam notices, too. He freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Life turns on a dime, Moll. People think they have forever, that they'll always have tomorrow. But it's not true. Sam taught us that. We have to live for now, for today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
Molly can barely contain her tears. Carl moves toward her moist cheeks and kisses them gently. Slowly, he guides his lips to her neck and kisses it, too. It is all hateful and sensual at the same time. Sam turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Molly feels Carl's tenderness, needs it. She does not notice his hand reaching for the cord on her robe and slowly pulling it toward him. With a little tug the cord unravels and the robe falls open. Molly is confused, aroused, not sure what to do. She starts to pull it closed. He holds her hand. For a moment they do nothing. Then his fingers reach for her thigh. Her body quivers. Carl feels her openness and pulls closer, his hand rising gently up her naked body.

Molly's eyes close. She says nothing.

<DIRECTION>
Molly jumps up, the mood suddenly broken. She sees the photo and recoils. Carl reaches for her. She backs away.
</DIRECTION>

Sam is stunned by what has happened. He jumps up and tries kicking over another picture but nothing moves. His foot goes right through it.

Molly looks at Carl, drying her tears.

Sam does not have to stand there long. Within seconds, the terrifying Ghost he had seen before comes charging at him. We notice him more clearly now. He is wearing a dark blue pea coat. There is a grizzled look about him. He has stained teeth and seems perpetually unshaven.
</DIRECTION>
<GHOST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get off my train!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GHOST>
<DIRECTION>
This time Sam does not back away. He holds his ground. The Ghost lets fire every trick in his arsenal. Posters come flying off the walls. A bag of groceries topples from a woman's arms, an old man's cane flies across the aisle, a boy's Mets cap flips off his head. People on the train move quickly to other cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unable to frighten him, the Ghost kicks Sam in the stomach. Sam recoils, feeling it, but gets back up again. He is angry now. He begins raging at the other Ghost. The Ghost is shocked.

Looking up, Sam sees an advertisement for Market Security Bank and Trust. He stares at it with great interest. "Special Banking for Special People. We make it easy for you."

Oda Mae reaches into her purse and pulls out a DRIVER'S LICENSE and a SOCIAL SECURITY CARD. Furgeson gets up and walks away from his desk. He seems unsteady on his feet. An OFFICER at the next desk is using a Brillo pad to clean a stain on her desk. Oda Mae smiles.

INT. CARL'S OFFICE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
It is after hours. Almost everyone on the floor has gone. Carl, hunched over his computer, is typing furious commands on the keyboard. He looks haggard and worn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sequence after sequence of coded numbers flash past on the monitor screen. Sam, sitting in a desk chair, watches, smiling.

	Search, you bastard! You'll never find it. It's gone.

</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
In a moment of childish delight, he pushes his feet against the wall and the chair shoots across the room. Carl looks up and sees an empty chair moving. He stares at it in confusion, and then goes back to the screen. He seems desperate. Nothing is working.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Panicked and frightened, Carl flicks off the machine and storms furiously around the room. Sam approaches the computer, hesitates a moment, and then pushes the power switch. The computer CLICKS back on. Carl spins around. He stares at the computer curiously for a moment and then turns it back off. Sam, enjoying this, reaches for the switch and FLICKS it back on again. Carl stares at it.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the...?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Carl watches as the keys seem to depress themselves and letters begin appearing on the screen. He sits down, mesmerized by what is happening. Then his face grows tense. The word "M-U-R-D-E-R-E-R" is emerging before him.
</DIRECTION>

Carl flies out of his chair, frantically running around to see who else is on the floor. He yells out like a madman.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's doing that?

There is no one there. He hears the computer beginning to type again and hurries back to look at the screen. One word appears. "S-A-M".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl gasps and smashes the computer with his fist. It crashes to the floor. Electrical sparks go flying as Carl gasps for breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam cannot hold himself back any longer. With a horrifying scream, he charges at Carl, jamming his fist hard into his ribs.

Sam is flushed with excitement. Carl kneels beside his desk. He cannot understand what is happening to him. His face goes stark white as the attack continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, unexpectedly, the assault stops. Sam, exhausted, stares hatefully at his old friend cowering on the floor. Slowly and dizzily, Carl gets up. He looks fearfully around the office and then, holding his stomach, hurries from the room.

<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's a matter? You believe me, huh? You better believe me! I want my money. I need that money and I want it tonight -- at 11:00. If that psychic lady doesn't bring it here, Molly's dead.

Gently, Molly takes Sam's arm and guides him to his feet. Effortlessly, she draws him to the center of the huge loft. With great tenderness, she puts her arms around him and before he knows what is happening, they are dancing. It is a strange, touching image, reminiscent of their first night in their new home. Sam reaches out and slowly draws his fingers down over her face, caressing her forehead, her cheeks, her lips. She stands motionless. Her face shines. She knows beyond all doubt that it is him.

	I gave it away.

</ODA_MAE>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're lying! Don't lie to me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
He aims his gun at her eye and is about to FIRE when, suddenly, something shoves him to the floor. Carl screams and jumps back, tripping over Oda Mae. Sam is standing there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In total panic, Carl scrambles to get up. Horrified, he SHOOTS his gun blindly into the air. Molly and Oda Mae dive for cover. The bullets have no impact. Sam musters all his strength and shoves Carl again. White with fear, Carl grabs Molly and aims his gun at her head.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll kill her. You touch me and I'll kill her. I mean it, Sam. Just give me the check.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
The gun is cocked at her temple. No one moves. Slowly the camera dollies toward Carl.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam, please. I didn't mean for him to kill you. It's not my fault. Come on, Sam, give me the check. Give it to me and I'll leave her alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing happens. Carl looks nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam? Sam?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
In a wild explosive fury, Sam charges at Carl and smashes at his gun. The weapon flies out of Carl's hand. Empowered by an anger we have not seen before, Sam smashes into Carl with a violent force. Carl's body careens into walls and floorboards. Wiring snaps. Two-by-fours crack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl, crawling desperately to escape, sees his gun on the floor. With a wild rush, he grabs for it and shoots at the door. The lock explodes and the door flies open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl tries to run for it, but Sam cuts in front of him. With growing power, Sam sends Carl flying back into the apartment, colliding into a tall scaffold. Bags of plaster topple to the ground as mounds of plaster dust hurl into the air. The apartment looks like a scene from another world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl, in a state of total unrelieved panic, breaks away from Sam. The dust obscures his escape. Like a trapped insect, he scrambles furiously to the fire escape window. Sam cannot see him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl shoves at the window. It is stuck. With a supreme effort, he grabs a ripped bag of plaster and swings it at the glass. Half of its plaster spews across the room before smashing the window. Shards of glass fly in all directions. Sam turns and sees Carl. He surges after him, but knows he cannot get to him in time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl is halfway out the window when Sam's fist slams into an electrical box attached to a dangling BX cable. It goes flying toward the window. To his amazement, it hits the frame. A huge pane of glass dislodges and comes crashing down. Carl looks up just in time to see the pointed edge aiming for his chest. Before he can move, it pierces him between the ribs and slices into his heart. His body quivers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carl's eyes bulge from their sockets. His body begins to spasm. He can't get up. A look of abject terror flashes through his eyes. He tries to scream. There is no sound. He tries to breathe. There is no breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With one last effort, Carl lurches forward. To his amazement, his body stands up and pulls away from the window. He looks down at his chest and is amazed to see that the glass is gone. There is no blood. Excited and confused, he turns around and sees Sam. For a moment, he cannot comprehend what is happening.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
There is a strange, silent moment between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, seemingly out of nowhere, a terrible CLICKING sound is heard. Frightening black forms are emerging from the darkness. Carl looks behind him and gasps. Past the figures coming toward him, he sees his own dead body. It is pinned to the window sill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before Carl can cry out, the dark figures swoop down and envelope him. In a flash, his spirit is caught and surges with the dark forces back into the shadows. Far in some invisible distance, we can barely hear him scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then it is silent. It is over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Molly is crouched in the corner, her back pressed tightly against the wall. She is staring into space. The room is filled with plaster dust. Slowly, emerging from the dust, we see Sam approaching Molly. He gazes at her with terrible longing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a brilliant light glows from behind the ceiling and the skylight floods the room with a golden haze. Sam turns to look at it. His eyes are full of surprise and wonder. The spirits beyond the ceiling are beckoning to him. As he looks down, he notices that his hands are growing transparent. His body is beginning to fade. A faint smile forms on his face. He leans down toward Molly, staring at her for a long, silent moment.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, Moll.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Molly's head lifts up. She looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam? Is that you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(stunned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Molly?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hear you, Sam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gradually, we notice that the dust in the air near Molly is beginning to shimmer with a subtle glow. To her astonishment, Sam's spirit is reflected in the floating particles.
</DIRECTION>
<MOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
Sam's luminous form appears before her. Molly is overwhelmed by the sight of him. The two of them gaze at one another without moving. They know it is for the last time. It is a silent exchange, charged with emotion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, the two bodies reach forward. As their lips touch, the plaster dust swirls sensuously through Sam's vaporous image and he begins to disappear. Molly pulls back from him as though from a cloud. His voice rises from the mist.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't stay anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Tears roll down her cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The brilliant light intensifies. It is beautiful, like a sunrise, saturating the room with a warm, comforting glow. Molly looks up and sees it all. Oda Mae sees it, too.
</DIRECTION>
<ODA_MAE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're waiting for you, Sam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ODA_MAE>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. Goodbye, Oda Mae.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with deep felt gratitude)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. Your mama would be proud.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Oda Mae smiles warmly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam turns to Molly. She is gazing at the last remaining moments of him. Her eyes brim over with tears and love.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you, Molly. I've always loved you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Molly swallows hard and wipes her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ditto.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
The light inside Sam intensifies. A sweet smile emerges on his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's so amazing, Moll...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
His face fills with joy.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The love inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
He whispers, almost crying.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You take it with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
They are his last words. His spirit dissolves within its ghostly moorings and begins to evaporate. Molly looks up silently for a moment, her face filled with love.
</DIRECTION>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See ya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
We see Sam's spirit rise from the room. It passes effortlessly through the ceiling and, in seconds, he is gone. The room grows dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Molly sits quietly on the floor. There is a look of awe and wonder in her eyes. After a moment, Oda Mae reaches down to help her up. Molly looks at her lovingly and then gently takes her hand. Arm in arm, supporting one another, they walk quietly from the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
