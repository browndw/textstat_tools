INT. BOILER ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEEP, GRIM MUSIC in ULTRA-STEREO, SUPERSATURATED COLORS, CAMERA MOVES SLICK AND OMINOUS, as we BEGIN A SERIES OF CLOSE SHOTS OF GRIMY HANDS. BUILDING --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A STEEL HAND, shining dully in the dark shadows of a filthy boiler room - being assembled slowly over --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
METAL FINGERS -- COMPOSITE SINEW -- the SPARK of hammer on metal -- then -- the thing suddenly flexes as if alive --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE -- clean hands manipulating levers --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE STEEL HAND -- forms into a heavy fist -- thumps on table - - then the GRIMY HANDS of the CREATOR thrust in again -- begin affixing long, shining blades to the end of the steel fingers --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ON BLADES -- gleaming, dangerously long.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUTAWAYS TO FURNACES -- belching FIRE and SMOKE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STEAM PIPES -- hissing and dripping into endless depths of this hellish place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HAND -- fitted with the final claw -- now a super-modern, almost futuristic version of Freddy's glove -- flexing and trembling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MAKER'S RIGHT HAND -- caresses it -- then retracts and lays itself on the filthy work bench -- the MAKER'S LEFT HAND ENTERS FRAME WITH A HUGE CLEAVER and raises it over the wrist of the right hand -- then strikes down hard!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO A CAMERA AND DOLLY -- BEHIND, IN THE SHADOWS -- A SHADOWY CREW GASPS -- we hear a muffled EEUWWW --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE STUMP OF THE MAKER'S RIGHT ARM -- now spurting blood -- raises --

	More blood, more blood!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Nearby, CHUCK and TERRY, two young SPFX assistants, pump fake blood through tubing, using large plastic syringes. It's a messy job, they're covered with fake blood themselves, as their boss, CHASE PORTER, good-looking, early 30's, tweaks the levers of a remote control device.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND THEM, at the edge of the set, Chase's wife, HEATHER LANGENKAMP, 30, dressed in woman's pajamas, and his son DYLAN, 5, watch from their chairs. Heather, appalled by the scene's violence, puts her hand over Dylan's startled eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE STUMP OF THE MAKER'S ARM thrusts now into the cuff of the steel hand, synthetic tendons snake out of the steel hand and bury themselves in the maker's wrists, and the unseen actor flexes the razor-sharp steel blades, wheels and SLASHES INTO CAMERA as we hear

	CUT! Fantastic!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
BUZZER. THE FURNACES STOP BELCHING FIRE. SMOKE, STEAM and WATER stop dead. Instead there's CHATTER, LIGHTS and movement as the crew bustles in to reset for the next take. The director, WES CRAVEN, rushes over to Chase ad thumps him on the back.
</DIRECTION>
<CRAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chase, you're a genius! This makes his old claw look like Mother Theresa's!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAVEN>

Chase waves a 'them too' hand towards his assistants.

Laughter. Craven cracks a bottle of Lipovitan. Chuck walks by with dripping steel hand as Chase rumples Dylan's hair.
</DIRECTION>
<CHASE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want to see some neat stuff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHASE>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan looks up wide-eyed.

<HEATHER>

Chase laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<CHASE>

	Come on, it's only make believe!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHASE>
<DIRECTION>
And lifts Dylan, leading Heather away. STEADICAM WITH THEM as they move off-set through crew and equipment into a work area behind the boiler room flats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sets Dylan on a workbench. The kid's surrounded by SNARLING MONSTER HEADS, LON WITHERED ARMS, EVISCERATED TORSOS, propped in corners and peering off temporary shelves. The handiwork of Chase's SPFX MAKEUP wizardry.

<CHASE>

Chase takes it back from Dylan. Shows it's only a hand puppet. Meanwhile Chuck's brought the claw back from the set and placed it on a work armature.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It should have flexed more. I think the servos got shorted out with blood.

Heather turns, a little confused.

<CHASE>
<DIRECTION>
(putting Dylan on again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Might as well be, Dylan. State of the art animatronics enhanced with bio- organic grafting. Bull tendons, nerve bundles from a Doberman, even half the brain of a homicidal primate was...

</CHASE>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chase...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
heather is looking at the hand again, but now her expression is growing more alarmed. Chase looks over, reacts to
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
flexing. Trembling.
</DIRECTION>
<CHASE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHASE>
<DIRECTION>
Chase reaches out to steady the hand, but with incredible speed it contorts. The claws flick and Chase reels back with a cry, staring at his own bloody fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<CHASE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHASE>
<DIRECTION>
Chase grabs the remote and switches it off. THE CLAW falls still. The other assistant, CHUCK, peers down at it in curiosity.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must've picked up something from an AD's walkie-talkie...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCK>
<DIRECTION>
He flops it over with a screwdriver and pokes at it. The hand lets out a LITTLE SOUND, half machine, half animal. Terry puts his hand near it, palm down, then looks at Chase.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure it's turned off?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<CHASE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHASE>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Funny. It's warm. Like a real hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Chuck leans down and peers more closely at it. Goes to poke it again. But before his finger touches it the clawed steel hand leaps up and glues itself to his neck. Its gleaming talons sinking into his throat!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chuck jerks back. Clawing the thing away. Clutching his throat as blood spurts from between his fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
smacks back on the table and scrambles out of sight with a clatter of steel. Into the warren of tools and equipment. Fast as some spiny creature from a thousand fathoms!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather screams. Dylan draws back, pale and frightened as Chase grabs the remote controller and smashes it. Pulls out the batteries and flings them away. Every furnace in the place suddenly ROARS BACK TO LIFE!

	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell's going on?! Kill the effects!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRAVEN>
<DIRECTION>
FIRE, SMOKE AND STEAM HOWLING as Chuck crashes blindly into Chase and both go down. Terry claws cursing through the jumble atop the toolbench, trying to find where the damn thing went.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE FLOOR - THE CLAW skitters down on one leg of the bench fast as a wharf rat and attacks Terry's foot, slicing through his Achilles tendon!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TERRY shrieks and falls hard, and the instant he slams into the floor, the claw drives straight into his heart! Terry screams as the claw wheels and scrambles straight for the sprawl of Chase and Chuck's convulsing body!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU CHASE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reacting in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHASE'S POV TO CHUCK'S BODY as the CLAW APPEARS over the rim of Chuck's shoulder, inches from Chase's face, spreading its talons wide!

INT. BEDROOM - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Heather convulses in bed. Terror elevated by...
</DIRECTION>
<CHASE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heather!! Earthquake!!
	</DIALOGUE>

Chase's already half out of bed, clawing at her.

That voice jolts her fully awake.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dylan!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
A framed picture falls with a deafening crash, its glass shattering, narrowly missing Chase. Heather sprawls out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAND-HELD and rough, CAMERA grabbing the action as best it can. Heather half runs, half braces against bucking walls while pictures and china shatter. Chase staggering behind her into
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DYLAN'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The child sits upright among his twisted bedclothes staring at the toys swinging wildly from his ceiling. Then it's over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA STABILIZES, but remains HANDHELD. There has not been nor will there be any MUSIC CUES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house has fallen still. The swimming pool, seen outside the window, slaps against its walls. There's a weird ELECTRONIC ULULATION outside, up and down the street, like spaceships landing. Heather looks at Chase.
</DIRECTION>
<CHASE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Car alarms. You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHASE>
<DIRECTION>
She nods, scrambles up and lifts Dylan, who's begun to cry. Hugs him. He's full of jagged energy, soaked with sweat.
</DIRECTION>
<CHASE>

	You have a fever, sweetie?

</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan shakes his head. Heather kisses him.
</DIRECTION>
<CHASE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just an earthquake, Dylan. Every once in a while we get a few.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHASE>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No biggie, really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Chase rumples the kid's hair. Then Dylan says solemnly.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy, blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
Heather follows Dylan's eyes to Chase, to his bloody hand. Chase notices with a start, grabbing one of Dylan's T-shirts and wrapping it, saying a bit too quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<CHASE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing, guys, just a scratch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHASE>
<DIRECTION>
But it's already been dripping through the cotton.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd you...get that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Chase shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<CHASE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The picture, I guess. When it fell. It's nothing, really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHASE>
<DIRECTION>
He gives her a look, like 'cool it in front of the kid, at least', and turns.
</DIRECTION>
<CHASE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll put a bandage on it. Don't worry about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHASE>
<DIRECTION>
And he goes out. Heather looks at Dylan and he looks at her. It's hard to say which is more frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN/DEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather, keeping to herself, tries to make order from the mess in the cabinets. Chase, hand bandaged, brooms broken crockery until the kettle whistles, then abandons the cleanup to make instant coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One of mom's cups got broken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<CHASE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. At least we're in on piece.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHASE>
<DIRECTION>
She says nothing. In the living room, the TV NEWSCASTER drones on about the morning's 5.5 quake, ('...latest of what Seismologists are calling a swarm').
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do we have to watch that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Chase, washing down a fast piece of toast, yawns and blinks.
</DIRECTION>
<CHASE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you turned it on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHASE>
<DIRECTION>
He zaps it off. Heather eyes him, then turns on Dylan who's making a face in his oatmeal. Scary eyes. Gape of mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dylan, it's breakfast. Not arts and crafts
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(feels Chase watching)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

</HEATHER>
<CHASE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You get any sleep last night?

	More or less.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You going away?

</DYLAN>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just for a few hours. Julie'll be with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
He sighs, then goes into his room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHASE AND HEATHER'S BEDROOM - LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two dress, Heather rather smartly. Chase, in jeans and sweatshirt, is packing a small overnighter. Chase again notes Heather's withdrawal.
</DIRECTION>
<CHASE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything other than the obvious bothering you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHASE>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five earthquakes in three weeks is enough.

</HEATHER>
<CHASE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hasn't been another call, has there?

</CHASE>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head. Chase looks relieved.
</DIRECTION>
<CHASE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two full weeks without him. Maybe he got run over by a truck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHASE>
<DIRECTION>
Heather doesn't seem to take any comfort in this.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He feels closer, if anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(low)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's giving me nightmares.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her more closely.
</DIRECTION>
<CHASE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have one last night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHASE>
<DIRECTION>
She finally nods yes. He softens his voice.
</DIRECTION>
<CHASE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just a reaction to the earthquake, Heather.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHASE>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe.

	Or maybe I shouldn't do this interview today.

She give s shrug, like it's silly to even talk about it.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was nothing. We were both working on some movie, and a special effects thing went horribly wrong. Terry and Chuck were...hurt. You were almost...

He kisses her and she kisses back, holding on a moment. Then he grabs his suitcase and exits. Heather closes her eyes. Hears him say goodbye to Dylan downstairs, hears the front door close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then a brittle BREAKING SOUND. Heather looks up and sees
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOUR THIN CRACKS snaking down her bedroom wall. A moment later the TV can be heard again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DEN - DAY

Heather races down to find Chase, but is stopped when she sees Dylan directly in front of the TV screen, impassively watching her. As Nancy in NIGHTMARE I, looking in horror to

	<DIALOGUE>
	Dylan, stop it! What in the world's gotten in to you?
	</DIALOGUE>

THE PHONE RINGS. Dylan instantly falls silent. Heather looks at him. He's eerily still now, just watching her. The phone RINGS a second time and she snatches it up, still distracted by her son's eyes.

She reacts, then slams it down. Stares at it. That sound - and the voice - deep, murderous, mocking. A flawless imitation of...Freddy.

Scared now, she runs to the front door just in time to see

An instant later, something gives the whole house a subtle SHAKE, rattling everything in it. Heather grabs Dylan, but there's nothing more.

Then the DOORBELL rings.

Heather freezes, paralyzed by unspeakable fear. Then

Heather bursts in and stops cold. From Dylan's room comes terrible SCREAMING.

<DIRECTION>
INT. DYLAN'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather runs in and finds Julie by the bed with Dylan. The boy convulsing and screaming with terrifying intensity. She rushes over and holds him, terrified. Strange and alien words are spilling from his mouth. A language ripped from another world not connected with our reality at all. Until suddenly it's English, and he says in a clear and terrifyingly deep voice
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never sleep again, never sleep again!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
Then he starts sobbing as if his heart will break. Heather looks at Julie in shock.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going on? Was he watching the movie on TV again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Julie blinks.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Movie? He hasn't been watching any TV at all. He was taking his nap when I heard screaming.

Julie stops, shaken herself. Heather looks at the child. Dylan turns, catches her eye with his own, and says through his tears.

Dylan pulls a stuffed dinosaur out from beneath the covers, and gives it to Heather. And it nearly falls apart in her hands, its body torn by four deep cuts, its stuffing pouring out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather looks at Dylan.

<DYLAN>

<DIRECTION>
INT. DYLAN'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather sits next to the bed, one elbow on the quilt, reading from the age-old fable of Hansel and Gretel. Dylan's scrunched under the blankets, only his head visible. Calm as you please. The sole light comes from the child's bedside lamp.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"...as soon as the sun was up the witch made Gretel fetch the wood and kindle a fire. 'We will bake cookies first,' she said. 'I have heated the oven and kneaded the dough. Crawl in and see if the fire is blazing high enough now.' And she pushed Gretel toward the oven. The witch meant to shut the door and bake her once she was inside."

Heather sighs. Picks the book back up.

<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"But Gretel guessed what the witch was planning. 'I don't know how to get in,' Gretel said. 'How am I to manage it?' 'Stupid girl!' shouted the witch, rushing up to the oven. 'The opening is big enough. See, I can fit myself.' Then quickly Gretel came behind and pushed with all her might. Plunging the wicked old woman headlong into the flames, banging the door shut and bolting it tight. The witch howled..."

<DIRECTION>
(shakes her head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's enough.

Dylan stares off into the night.

<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"The witch howled like a scalded cat, but Gretel ran away and left her there to perish nonetheless."
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
Heather looks at Dylan in surprise, then at the page. EXACTLY as Dylan said, the words are there. He turns and says the rest straight to her, eyes glittering, almost entranced.
</DIRECTION>

She tucks him in. Then notices something. A bump under the covers, down by Dylan's feet. She pats it, curious.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rex.

</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
He picks a flashlight off his night stand, pokes his head under the comforter and motions for her to follow. She smiles curiously and sticks her head under too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDER THE COMFORTER, a colorful tent. Dylan aiming the beam towards the bottom of the bed and the large stuffed T-Rex there. Snarling in the center of the sheet, its back turned to them. It's been sewn together again, but the body looks much worse for the wear.

scratching his leg, rubbing sore muscles.

REFOCUS TO SEAT BETWEEN HIS LEGS.

Music sneaks back, and with a barely audible RIP, something shiny and sharp pokes up through the fabric. Then another and another, bright spikes of steel. At first just tips, then longer and longer. Until four long claws are thrusting up. Straining to break out of the fabric.

And as he slides deeper and deeper towards sleep. The clawed steel hand from Heather's opening nightmare RISES INTO FRAME. Just beneath his chin now. By his jugular.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Until Chase falls asleep. His eyes closing for good. Head falling forward on a slack neck.

Instantly the claws strike upwards, hard and jerk down through his body. His shirt flies open. The claw buries itself into his crotch as CHASE'S DEAFENING SHRIEK CARRIES OVER INTO

Heather just nods, her heart in her throat. The man's voice is surprisingly compassionate.
</DIRECTION>
<LUNCH_EATER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUNCH_EATER>
<DIRECTION>
He lifts the sheet carefully, just offering a peak at the face. Heather forces herself to look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Chase, and something about the sweet sleep-like quality to his face hits Heather harder than the bloodless pallor, or the slightly broken-egg misshaping of his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man lowers the sheet and fetches a clipboard hanging at the foot of the stainless steel table.
</DIRECTION>
<LUNCH_EATER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just sign at the bottom, that's all we need.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUNCH_EATER>
<DIRECTION>
But Heather is just staring at the sheet, head ever so slightly tilted, as if there's one thing she saw under there she's not yet quite through with.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me see once more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<LUNCH_EATER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUNCH_EATER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lift the sheet again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
He looks, sees she's serious, and lifts it.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
He lifts it a little more. Still it's only down to Chase's chin. But it's enough, and in a deadly still voice Heather asks...
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
She's pointing to a flap of whitish skin beneath Chase's chin.
</DIRECTION>
<LUNCH_EATER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, well, this was a bad wreck, ma'am. I mean, his head's gonna be okay for the funeral and all, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUNCH_EATER>
<DIRECTION>
Heather reaches out suddenly and pulls the sheet back much farther. For one horrendous instant we glimpse a torso sewn back together with rough mortician's stitches along four deep, savage slashes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lunch eater pulls the sheet back over Chase as Heather spins and vomits.
</DIRECTION>
<LUNCH_EATER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, now, there. You okay, lady?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUNCH_EATER>
<DIRECTION>
He offers her a piece of white muslin to wipe her mouth. She does so with shaking hands, then asks with a shaken, terrified whisper.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
The man blinks a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<LUNCH_EATER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ma'am, it was head-on. I heard the truck was torn up something awful. You can imagine how he'd, well, not be exactly in top shape.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUNCH_EATER>
<DIRECTION>
Heather, still crouched, looks back at the gurney looming above her.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It looks like...he was clawed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<LUNCH_EATER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, that's why we don't lift the sheet past the face, ma'am. Sometimes what you don't see is what gets you through the night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUNCH_EATER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Surrounded by her friends, Heather buries her husband. There are several recognizable faces here in addition to Bob and Sara, especially to Elm Street fans - Robert Englund, JOHNNY DEPP, WES CRAVEN, JOHN SAXON among others. There is no media or fans - the funeral has been kept from the press.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather stands apart from the rest, holding Dylan's hand. On his other side is Julie, touching his shoulder. Only a slight twitching of the boy's hand betrays emotion as he solemnly watches the casket lowered. As it disappears beneath the brink, a sudden WIND moves through the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later a SHARP JOLT ROLLS THROUGH THE PLACE. Instantly there are cries of EARTHQUAKE! and the SHOCK CONTINUES - THE GROUND HEAVING - and the men winching the coffin fall backwards. Several grave stones and monuments tumble. The coffin itself tilts wickedly, then falls end- first into the pit, hitting with a sickening crack. Heather lurches forward instinctively. Loses balance. Falls and hits hard, head against the framework over the grave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mass confusion for the rest of the people, ducking, stumbling over gravestones, generally grabbing for something solid. Then that eerie still again. Just DOGS and CAR ALARMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather shakes herself, twists round looking for Dylan. Sees he's not with Julie. Hisses desperately at the girl.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Julie. Where's Dylan?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Julie looks around, dazed. Everyone nearby looks for the child. And for god knows what reason, Heather checks the grave and reacts in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the merest fraction of a second we see the coffin has split open. The lid ajar. And incredibly, the leering face of someone who looks a lot like FREDDY KRUEGER - darker, even harder, but definitely in that mode, ducks back deeper into the dark of the coffin after a split second of eye-contact with Heather. And he's dragging Dylan after him!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without hesitation Heather jumps into the pit. Amid gasps of astonishment from the dazed onlookers, even as Dylan disappears into the coffin with a terrible yank!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE PIT WITH HEATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
wrenching back the coffin lid, seeing Dylan about to vanish down the dark slot at the foot of the coffin. Just like the danger area beneath the blankets!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE COFFIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather diving under the winding sheets and grabbing Dylan's hand. Hauling back. For the briefest instant she glimpses the long arm of Freddy's red and green-striped sweater. The wicked glove and blades. All snaking down out of sight into darkness. As his mocking laughter echoes over her, Heather hauls up with all her might. Pulling the child back and over the bloody remains of her husband. Dylan screaming in fright! And at the sight of Chase's face, his dead eyes staring in horror into her own. Heather passes out!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON HER FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rolling to the side. And now gentler HANDS are touching her. Trying to rouse her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK TO REVEAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather on the ground at the graveside. Robert Englund, Wes Craven and John Saxon hovering over her in concern. She looks around in panic.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dylan!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<JOHN_SAXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's right here. It's okay!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_SAXON>
<DIRECTION>
Saxon points. Heather turns, sees Dylan watching down at her with that intense, eerie look. Held by the frightened Julie. A terrible dizziness sweeps over Heather.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What...happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<JOHN_SAXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quake knocked you off your feet. You got bumped pretty good, actually.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(dabs blood from her forehead)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather turns and sees men already have the coffin back level. The lid is not open - the coffin isn't split.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER NOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sirens and a faint hubbub from the surrounding city. Those gathered are clearly shaken, and the MINISTER raises his hands as a subtle but ominous AFTERSHOCK rolls by.
</DIRECTION>
<MINISTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May he rest in peace, children. And my you all get home safely!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MINISTER>
<DIRECTION>
Immediately several head for their cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ON HEATHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shivering. She stands, turns to go and bumps right into Robert Englund. She gives a start. He puts his hand on her shoulder. And moving in CLOSER, we can just hear him murmur.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT_ENGLUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If there's anything I can do, Heater. Anything...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT_ENGLUND>
<DIRECTION>
And he moves off, pulling a wide-brimmed, not-quite Freddy hat over his head. Heather watches him go as John Saxon puts a big arm around her. Behind, Wes Craven looks up at the sky. It's getting late in the day and the wind is picking up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HEATHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cottage huddled against strong Santa Ana's. A streetlight nearby throws eerie shadows on the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHASE AND HEATHER'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather lies in bed wide awake, listening to the wind howl. She pulls the blankets closer and tries to close her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she becomes aware of another sound, this one from downstairs. A MUFFLED SING-SONG, and a PAD OF SMALL FEET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEATHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stands, listening. Grabs a robe and rushes down to
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather peeks around the corner of the stairwell, and to her dismay sees Dylan circling in the den, eyes closed, mouth slurring something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sleepwalking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather crosses, not knowing whether to wake him or not. He hovers by the TV for a moment. It's also on, this one running silent images of
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather as NANCY in the boiler room for the first time (again from NIGHTMARE I) seeing Freddy step out from behind the furnace, backlit, dark, clawed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON HEATHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reacting. Scared now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan, still asleep, veers away blindly, bumps into the coffee table, then heads for the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather's had enough. She catches up with him. Softly encircles him in her arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ON THE TWO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she shakes him gently.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dylan. Sweetie. Wake up, baby...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Awakening, Dylan's eyes snap wide in fear. His mouth gapes open in a startled cry and he flails out of her arms onto the floor. Heather desperately trying to gather him back up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then he seems to recognize her, and falls still. Only his labored breathing breaks the stunned silence, his eyes staring wide at Heather.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dylan, baby, we're gonna get you back to bed now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
The child shakes his head violently, tears springing.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't sleep there, Mommy. Please!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got to sleep, Dylan, you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
She never finishes the sentence because Dylan suddenly sings a thin, plaintive voice
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One two, Freddy's coming for you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
Heather, feeling her head swim through an unexpected wash of vertigo, can barely find her voice.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dylan, did you hear that in that move?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan looks at her, confused.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What movie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
Heather looks at the TV. There's nothing there. The set is off. And not only that, it's still unplugged from that morning. She looks back at the child.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then...where did you hear that song? Did you answer the phone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In my bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your bed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Under my covers.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off her look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kids singing, and way down there, the man...the mean man...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
And he makes the sign of the claw.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And...what's the man doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trying to get up...trying to get into our world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
Then Dylan stops, startled by the warm run of liquid over his upper lip. His nose has started to coarse dark, red blood.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, shit. Dylan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
He touches his hand to it, stares at the bright surprise, then Heather snatches him up. Rushes him into the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRAMED IN THAT DISTANT DOORWAY she daubs his face, soothes his silent tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHASE AND HEATHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather, back in bed and listening to the wind HOWL. Dylan is curled against her side. Peaceful as a baby now. Breath deep and regular. But if Heather thinks he's asleep, she's wrong.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Daddy now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
Heather gives a start. Looks down. Dylan's looking up at her, waiting for the answer.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy's...in Heaven, Dylan. He's with God now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan thinks a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have to die to see God?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't think so. You just have to...pray, or reach...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
He curls against her, tighter.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why does God let there be bad things?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I honestly don't know. Try to sleep, baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you come with me in my dreams?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
Heather pulls the cover over him farther.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think that only happens in movies. But I'll always be here when you get back.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks under covers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'll make sure nobody grabs your toes, either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
She tickles his toes. He lets out a giggle and closes his eyes. Heather does not close hers. In fact, she reaches over and finds a still steaming cup of coffee stashed on her bedside table and takes a long gulp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDER THE COVERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
we see Dylan's HAND reach down and touch REX. He turns the snarling beast to face the darkness at the bottom of the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLAYGROUND - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sun a warm yellow, CHILDREN playing under the watchful eyes of MOTHERS. Nearby, Dylan runs a stick around the palings of a playground rocket, somber and tentative.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAN TO FIND HEATHER AND JOHN SAXON. The man in immaculate sweats, tan and fit. A reassuring presence if ever there was one, listening intently as Heather speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what he's doing is bizarre, but most of the time he seems so normal, so well adjusted. I just can't believe it's him. I mean, and not something outside, influencing him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(scared)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or is that how denial works?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<JOHN_SAXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When it is denial. I don't think that's the case here, but if you're really worried, have a doctor check him out. You'll see, everything's fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_SAXON>
<DIRECTION>
Heather looks back at him.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not just saying that to help a crazy friend cope, are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Saxon shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN_SAXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All of Dylan's behavior is understandable for a kid dealing with a parent's death. How can a child process such a thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_SAXON>
<DIRECTION>
Heather shakes her head, saying low.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't know. Haven't been able to process it very well myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Saxon looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN_SAXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not crazy, by the way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_SAXON>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thinking I saw Freddy in the grave feels pretty crazy. And jumping in...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<JOHN_SAXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't jump in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_SAXON>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my memory. And it seemed absolutely real.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<JOHN_SAXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seemed, not was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_SAXON>
<HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(looks off, lower)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's in my family, you know. My grandmother died in an institution...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<JOHN_SAXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(unfazed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell, if having a screwy family made you crazy, the world'd be one colossal nuthouse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_SAXON>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him, well? He laughs and she does, too.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN_SAXON>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, you've got a crazed fan after you. That's what's making you crazy, and probably Dylan, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_SAXON>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never mentioned it to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<JOHN_SAXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kids know when something's bugging a parent.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(focusing on it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got no idea who this is calling?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_SAXON>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and watches Dylan.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Freddy, for all I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<JOHN_SAXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Steady...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_SAXON>
<DIRECTION>
Heather tries to smile.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A man, or a boy with a deep, y'know, Freddy voice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<JOHN_SAXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Six weeks of this, and you're surprised you've got Freddy in your dreams? Hell, Sonny Bono says after a while he was seeing his stalker everywhere. Even at Mass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_SAXON>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<JOHN_SAXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely. And how many times has Letterman called the cops thinking that woman was down in his kitchen again? It gets under your skin if you let it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_SAXON>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really think Dylan's okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Saxon gives her a paternal look.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN_SAXON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dylan's fine. You're fine. Hurting, but fine. Definitely not crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN_SAXON>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO THE PLAYGROUND ROCKET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a tall structure standing over 25 feet high. Dylan has unexpectedly made his way all the way to its top level, and has squeezed out through a broken guard band. Right now he's climbing up the outside of the rocket towards its nose cone!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK ON HEATHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
not seeing any of this.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my worst fear, that whatever my mother had, I'll have. And I'll pass it along to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Heather shakes her head and smiles, then looks up and gives a start, seeing
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DYLAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who's climbed to the pinnacle of the rocket and is standing fully upright on its nose cone, way the hell up there, arms stretched to the heavens!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather stands, afraid to move. And now several other parents, even kids are seeing him, pointing, as
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE PAST DYLAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stretches up impossibly far, fingers straining. Heather far below, leaping off the bench and starting to run!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UP ANGLE TO DYLAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he stretches even harder, and then with a cry loses his balance and falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEATHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
running at top speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DYLAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
falling through space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEATHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
barely making it to him. The boy and her meeting with a bone- jarring impact. Heather driven to the sand hard, with Dylan atop her!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By the time Saxon gets to them, Heather's finding out that though she's dazed and bruised, amazingly, Dylan is not only okay, but serenely unconcerned with his close call. He simply looks up at her and says solemnly.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God wouldn't take me.

EXT. HEATHER'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Peaceful, sun-drenched. Never know anything was going wrong. Heather, limping noticeably, fetches her mail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather wipes the sweat off her face with her T-shirt and shuffles through the pile. There's a newspaper with headlines of the earthquake, the usual load of junk mail - and then something that stops her cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she singles out one letter in particular. Grimy, no address, smeared with soot. She opens it with shaking fingers. We see a sheet of filthy paper holding a single cut- out "E" pasted on its center.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEATHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stuffs the letter in a drawer,and as she does we glimpse dozens of other filthy ENVELOPES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather crosses to the phone and dials.

INTERCUTTING WITH:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROBERT ENGLUND'S HOUSE/STUDIO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON ENGLUND, intense, quick, stalking back from the cordless phone's base through the living room of a large, Mediterranean mansion. He talks as he walks, soon ending back where he evidently was when the call came, in a sun-room off the larger room, which features a large easel. Clearly an avid amateur painter, he's surrounded here by jars of brushes, rags and palettes. The large canvas he's working on is seen only from behind.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT_ENGLUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heather? You doing okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT_ENGLUND>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holding my own. You know that guy who was calling me all the time? He's started again. He's been putting stuff in my mail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<ROBERT_ENGLUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must've read about the funeral. Sick mother. That's the last thing you need right now, I'm sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT_ENGLUND>
<HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(almost embarrassed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's actually been giving me Freddy nightmares.
	</DIALOGUE>

Line noise for a second, then...
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT_ENGLUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Freddy as in me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT_ENGLUND>
<DIRECTION>
Heather shakes her head.

<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It isn't you. He's scarier. He's...

Robert puts down his brush, takes the portable phone to the window and looks out as if he could see her.

	Darker. More...evil?

</ROBERT_ENGLUND>
<DIRECTION>
He starts painting again, as if he saw something in the canvas he had to capture instantly or it would vanish. His face twists and flinches with the effort; we get the feeling this is no mere hobby at all. But we still don't see the picture.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, what I was calling about was...have you seen any of the script, by any chance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<ROBERT_ENGLUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wes won't show it until it's finished. That's what he told me, at least. I asked him at the funeral.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT_ENGLUND>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When do you think it'll be done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<ROBERT_ENGLUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The way he's writing is so weird, who knows? I asked him how far he'd gotten at the funeral, and what was it he said...? Oh yeah, as far as Dylan trying to reach God. Weird, huh, that he'd have your kid in it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBERT_ENGLUND>
<DIRECTION>
Heather can't find her breath for a moment. Fighting a perception of fear so stifling it's like a pillow pressed to her face. She barely manages.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Robert? Have you been having any nightmares?

<DIRECTION>
Just the line noise.

	Robert, I think we should talk. And not over the phone. Could I come over?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>

He shakes his head.

<ROBERT_ENGLUND>

	Uh, actually today's not good. There's something I've got to finish. How's tomorrow?

pale, turning to look at Dylan's door.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tomorrow, then. First thing in the morning. Meanwhile take care, Robert, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
She hangs up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROBERT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hangs up, too, just staring at the painting. As if it held his salvation or his doom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHASE AND HEATHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather, deep in sleep, tossing as if her bed were floating on a stormy sea. In fact, this time very, very subtly, another EARTHQUAKE has begun rocking the house. Lamps sway, the whole bed rises and falls, as we
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE IN ON HEATHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA AT CARPET LEVEL as two little FEET pad INTO FRAME. MOVE WITH THEM, TILTING UP the cowboy PJ's TO DYLAN'S FACE. Ghostlike in the moonlight. Eyes vacant, moving through the living room as in a dream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHASE AND HEATHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather gasps out something in her sleep, the tone deeply distressed. PAN OFF HER, ACROSS THE SHEET FLUNG OVER HER, TO THE FOOT OF THE BED. There's movement there. The sheet rising at four salients. Pressed up from beneath. Then the glint of steel pokes through with a subtle rip-rip-rip, the claws of finely-honed steel rise into moonlight. Moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAST HEATHER'S FACE TO THE CLAWS cleanly parting the sheet as they pull their way closer to her. The only sound a soft RRRIIIIIPPPPP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEY STOP IN CU and with practiced SNICK cut the tatters between them, leaving only a single hole. Then the lethal steel hand rises fully into sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then there's a CRASH from downstairs, as if a silverware drawer were dumped on a tile floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather JOLTS as if prodded with an electric wire, twists around and stares wide-eyed at
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOTHING. OUR WIDE ANGLE FROM DIRECTLY ABOVE SHOWS twisted blankets, nothing more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chilled, Heather pulls the sheet around her. Then pulls it back open. Realizes it's cut into ribbons along its entire length.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She jumps out of bed, breath caught in her throat. Then there's a METALLIC SCRRRIIIIITCH from the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (distant)
</DIRECTION>

	One two, Freddy's coming for you. Three four, better lock your door...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRWELL/DEN/KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather appears at the foot of the stairs, heart in her throat. Twenty feet away, advancing slowly from the kitchen, Dylan is chanting the old refrain
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five six, grab your crucifix...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
Heather starts for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE PAST DYLAN TO HEATHER, and from this vantage point, we can see the cluster of steak knives he's taped to his fingers, making a serious-looking claw, hidden behind his back. Heather shakes her head, almost to him.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweetie, don't sing that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches for him, and he strikes like lightning, slashing, barely missing. Advances again, breath coming in little asthmatic rasps. Heather backs away.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seven eight, better stay up late!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
She bangs up against a wall, he's too near for her to dodge away. They grapple, the boy suddenly with the strength of a feral animal. He raises the blades, hissing at her
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>

INT. CHASE AND HEATHER'S BEDROOM - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRASH! she falls out of bed, now truly awake.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>

	Never sleep again.

</DYLAN>

Pad, pad, pad.

<DIRECTION>
INT. DEN - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather enters, limping. Looks. Sees her child circling in the center of the room before the lit TV, crying softly...
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never sleep again, never sleep again...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
And scattered all around him on the floor are the filthy pages of letters.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dylan...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Then she stops, staring more closely at the letters on the carpet. For the first time she sees that using the single letter from each page, Dylan has spelled out:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANSWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHONE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the phone RINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather stares at Dylan, stunned. The phone RINGS again, and without even thinking about it, she picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?

</HEATHER>
<FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
(FILTER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I touched him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Before she can react the telephone suddenly thrusts a long, fleshy tongue into her mouth in an appallingly obscene lick. She flails backwards, flinging it away, and as she does, Dylan lets out a piercing scream and falls gasping on his side, legs kicking like an animal struck by a car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather grabs him and runs for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EYES, PEERING FROM BEHIND THE FLARE OF LIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER STILL ON DYLAN'S EYES - WIDE - UNBLINKING.

<DIRECTION>
DOCTOR HEFNER, a tall, powerful looking woman in her 40's and Chief of Pediatric Medicine, clicks off the light and looks at Heather.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HEFNER>

<HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(not sure she imagined it or not)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Hefner nods, scowling.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HEFNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. I'm convinced they can tip an unstable child over the edge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HEFNER>
<DIRECTION>
Heather swallows, hardly able to find her voice.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unstable? Dylan's not unstable, he's... just...upset.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
The doctor's looks at her, as if wondering if Heather's competent enough to handle a painful truth. Then she just scrawls something on a prescription sheet.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HEFNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll run a battery of tests and know in a few days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HEFNER>
<DIRECTION>
Heather looks at Dylan, eyes haunted by a terrible vulnerability.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan is stone silent. No evil behavior. Just exhausted and withdrawn, like some small creature escaped from a predator by the skin of his teeth, now just following core instinct: stay in hiding. Do not make a sound.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does he have to stay here over night?

</HEATHER>
<DR_HEFNER>

She holds Heather's eye and speaks low, so Dylan can't hear.

Heather tenses ever-so-slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DR_HEFNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes what a child says or fantasizes will give a clue to what ails him. Did he say anything while he was still lucid?

</DR_HEFNER>
<DIRECTION>
Heather looks to Dylan. He's looking at her with trusting eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(low)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Dylan didn't say anything.
	</DIALOGUE>

She goes into the room. Dr. Hefner watches her carefully. A nurse walks by and Hefner hands her the X-rays.

INT. DYLAN'S HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON HEATHER AND DYLAN. Heather has heard the above exchange. Near tears, she looks down to Dylan curled against her, eyes open but unseeing. Staring not so much at her as past her, out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dylan, can you hear me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Just barely perceptibly, the terrified boy shakes his head 'no'.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dylan, you've got to fight it, whatever it is that's after you. And you've got to come back to me. You can't make it alone. Do you hear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
ON DYLAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No response to this. But then a single tear courses down his cheek. And then he nods 'yes'.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. And if you can hear me, you can tell me what you need to feel safe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
He says nothing. But then Heather is aware of movement. She looks down and sees Dylan's hand moving under the covers, reaching, reaching down towards the bottom of the bed, for something that clearly is not there.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (realizing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rex? Is that what you want? Rex is home, Dylan. That's where you should be, too. You've got to get better so they'll let you come home, understand?!

(very, very quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Home.

</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
She points out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's where I want you, Dylan. You know we're not that far. Right out there past the freeway is our home. But to get there you've got to come out from where you are. Then they'll let you come back home to Rex...and to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him gently on his forehead, crying herself now. Then a NURSE ENTERS with a paper cup.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time for your medicine, cowboy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan looks at it solemnly.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just something to help him sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
Heather looks at Dylan and nods. Then as if he were a thousand years old, Dylan puts it in his mouth. The nurse gives him water and he swallows.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Attaboy. Now take a little nap.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Heather)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll have to leave now. He'll be fine. We'll run tests tonight. You can visit again in the morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
The nurse leaves. Heather turns to Dylan.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Dylan. I'll be back here first thing tomorrow. I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Heather kisses him again, gives a little wave, and leaves. Dylan closes his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But when Heather disappears through the doorway behind, he brings his hand to his mouth and spits the sleeping pill into his palm. A moment later he's hidden it deep in his bed covers, and his eyes are wide open, staring out through the window again, to his home over there, so near yet so far away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOSPITAL PARKING LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather, in her Volvo, starts to back out, lost in thought. Instantly there's a BLARE OF HORN and CURSES from the car she's almost backed into. Heather pulls back into the parking place and kills the engine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She just sits there and sobs, for one moment all the confusion and dread surging out of her. Then she forces herself to breathe. Swipes away the tears. Swears to herself. And starts the engine.

CUT TO WHAT SHE'S LOOKING AT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The IMPRESSIONISTIC PAINTING Englund was working on. A LARGE, FRIGHTENING PORTRAIT OF FREDDY HIMSELF. A being far more dark and ominous that the usual version. The one we (and Heather) glimpsed in Chase's coffin. As different in kind as the film Batman was from the TV version. He's larger, quick and feral, yet at the same time imbued with enormous strength and intelligence. A truly primal threat from the lowest ring of hell. And the large gleaming steel hand and claws, cocked and ready to strike, grow right out of the end of his arm.

Wes stops as his HOUSEKEEPER emerges from the kitchen with a steaming cup of coffee. Heather drinks immediately, despite the scalding heat. When the housekeeper disappears, Craven continues.
</DIRECTION>
<WES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can tell you what the nightmares are about. They're about this...entity. Whatever you want to call it. It's old, very old, and it's taken different forms in different times. The only thing that stays the same about it is what it lives for.

	The problem comes when the story dies. It happens a lot of different ways, the story gets too familiar, or too watered down by people trying to make it easier to sell, or ti's labeled a threat to society and just plain banned. However it happens, when the story dies, the evil is set free.

He stops in the doorway to his studio. Heather sees this room is draped against the light. In its center glows a computer, a half-finished page of script on its screen. Next to the computer, a narrow cot, its sheets twisted.

INT. CHASE AND HEATHER'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather studies long into the night, a host of books spread around her. Yellow pads for notes, and she's brought the coffee-maker right into the bedroom now. It sits prominently on her bedside table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOCK 12:30AM

INTERCUT WITH CU OF HEATHER'S EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reading, reacting subtly as the fear and awful doubts mount.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she loses her grip momentarily on the book, and several pages turn. She tries to find her place. Then straightens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
XCU NEW TEXT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
under a heading of SLEEP DISORDERS, the words 'many of the symptoms of schizophrenia are duplicated in children suffering from sleep deprivation.'

<DIRECTION>
CU OF HER HAND REACHING FOR HER CUP OF COFFEE, stopping inches from the cup.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
XCU HEATHER'S EYE, shifting to the cup.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
XCU COFFEE CUP, the black surface of the coffee radiating concentric rings, subtle at first, then larger and larger until the fluid is sloshing over the brim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEATHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
goes rigid, braces looking around. There's a distinct LOW RUMBLE BUILDING now, with a responding CREAKING COMPLAINT from the timbers of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the TV IN HER ROOM BLINKS ON, at first silently, so that she's not even sure she's heard its subtle 'blink'. Then the volume comes up, and she finds herself watching a newstory on the days earthquake, FOOTAGE (STOCK) of brick walls atop smashed cars, freeway overpasses cracked and closed off.

HEATHER fumbles in the drawer of her bedtable and finds the remote, aims and fires and the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TV BLINKS OFF. BEAT. THEN BLINKS BACK ON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEATHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
just stares at it. What is going on, here?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's about to beep it off again when she stops, the story is segueing to:
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>

	The world of horror films suffered its own terror today, as two of Hollywood's best-known special effects technicians were found dead in a vacant field.

<DIRECTION>
Heather beeps it off, and the TV stays black. She breaths a sigh of relief, badly shaken. Then it comes back on.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Freddy's glove was missing, and police are speculating whether the murders were the result of a botched theft of...

</ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
GZZZTTT!!! The picture contorts, goes to snow and dies. There's an interior, bluish flare inside the TV, and a wisp of smoke. Then silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the phone rings. Heather just stares at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IT RINGS AGAIN. Then her answering machine picks up downstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(FILTER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heather? This is Sara. Um, sorry to call so late, but...this is kinda hard... I don't know if you've seen the news, but... we just are thinking we might shelf this new Nightmare project for a while, and wanted you to know. Call. Bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather leans back against her pillows. Closes her eyes and takes a deep breath. Just the sound of the WIND now. Her head falls slowly sideways.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the first plate falls in the kitchen, then another, a sharp, harrowing CRASHING of crockery. And Heather dives out of bed, stumbling for the doorway as the full force of the earthquake hits!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLAM! Heather braces in the doorway, gritting her teeth as things throughout the house topple now, something big in the living room, both lamps off the bedside tables, this is the worst quake yet!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the LIGHTS GO OUT. Heather lets out a cry of terror and adrenaline. At last, it's over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment's silence. Then one final CRASH. Glass from the sound of it. Then utter, preternatural silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather holds, waiting for the aftershock. But there is none. Then she starts to wonder about that last crash. There's enough moonlight to tell the direction of it, the closet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks. The rest she can guess, but what the hell was in the closet? She crosses and opens the door, looking down to see
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The broken remains of her coffee pot. She looks back to her bedside table. The coffee pot is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The merest sound brings her head around, and she finds herself looking into a face not ten inches from her own, a dark, scarred figure, face contorted with menace, eyes catching the scant light just enough to glint incredible hatred and energy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather lets out the scream at the same second he strikes, lunging forward and driving her backwards over the bed, landing atop and pressing his ugly face right into hers. Now there's enough of the moonlight to glimpse the pocked and crisped skull.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naaaaancy!

</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
XCU TWO SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and he drives down hard, but as he does, the bed suddenly twists up and over at the same instant, and the AFTERSHOCK HITS! Heather is thrown to the side at the last possible second. The blades slashing past her throat and hitting her up-thrust arm, a split second before she careens out of bed entirely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hitting the floor hard, knocking herself out cold. As the quake's last RUMBLES shake the room, then fall away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON HEATHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
on the deck. Shaking herself back to consciousness. Looking around in shock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is normal. Only her bed seems affected, so askew half the mattress touches the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She raises herself painfully. Her bedside clock radio is blinking "12:00...12:00". She realizes she's clutching her arm, that there's blood oozing between her fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she remembers.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>

	Dylan!

</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA MOVING HANDHELD WITH HEATHER as she runs down the corridor towards Dylan's room. Then she sees
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JULIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
staring back at her, stopped by a nurse.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Julie, what're you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Julie gives a funny shrug.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I just...had this terrible dream...that Dylan was in danger. I had to come over to see...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs nervously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must think I'm crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Heather shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't think that at all. How is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They wouldn't let me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment Dr. Hefner strides into sight. She looks at Heather with a slightly pained smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HEFNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms. Langenkamp. I'm afraid there are no evening visiting hours in Intensive Care.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HEFNER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DR_HEFNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dylan? He's holding well. Earlier he had some problems, he's in an oxygen tent just now...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HEFNER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to pass but the doctor stops her, looking down at her sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HEFNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It seems we've had an accident, Mrs. Langekamp. May I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HEFNER>
<DIRECTION>
Heather looks down. She's forgotten entirely about her bloodied arm. The doctor lifts the sleeve. Sees the four slashes across the forearm.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HEFNER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those are nasty cuts. How...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HEFNER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It happened during the earthquake. I fell. I want to see Dylan...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
But the doctor doesn't move out of the way. She looks from the cuts to Heather's face, seeing the fear and stress.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HEFNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a moment, first let's see about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HEFNER>
<DIRECTION>
She takes Heather's elbow. Heather glances towards Julie, then goes with her to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DISPENSARY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather sits while the doctor treats the cuts. Heather's obviously uneasy and wishing to be with her son, but the Doctor isn't taking the cuts lightly, and is increasingly alert to Heather's highly agitated state.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HEFNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If these had been a few inches nearer to the wrist... What did you say you cut yourself on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HEFNER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was an earthquake and it was dark. I have no idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DR_HEFNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These look quite fresh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HEFNER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They are...it happened in tonight's quake.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off her blank look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It happened just fifteen minutes ago. You must've felt it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
The doctor has no idea what she's talking about.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HEFNER>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles faintly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess we lucked out over here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HEFNER>
<DIRECTION>
Heather swallows. The doctor begins bandaging.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HEFNER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your son, apparently, is terrified of a man. Someone he thinks is going to come out of his bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off her look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One of the nurses heard him talking in his sleep You have any idea who that man might be, Mrs. Langenkamp?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HEFNER>
<DIRECTION>
Heather winces as the woman binds the gauze with a clip.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I meant to bring him his dinosaur, Rex. Rex keeps Freddy from...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Heather realizes what she's said, but too late.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HEFNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The man from your films? Freddy Krueger with the claws? Is that who he's afraid of?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(eyes flick to Heather's arm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have let your child see your films, haven't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HEFNER>
<DIRECTION>
Heather turns and faces the woman, furious.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Every kid knows about Freddy. He's like Santa Claus or King Kong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Hefner just eyes her, too appalled to take it further.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HEFNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see. Well. Interesting talking to you, Ms. Langenkamp. I hope you understand, my concerns are simply for the welfare of your son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HEFNER>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles thinly and leaves the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DYLAN'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan, now visible only through the plastic of an oxygen tent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather sits next to her son's bed, exhausted. Just watching his slow breathing. Trying to piece it all together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A nurse passes, glances at Heather and exchanges a whispered word with a SECOND NURSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather, despite her best efforts, is nodding. Suddenly there's a shrill ALARM from a monitor and Dylan twists sharply inside his tent, suffering what looks like the full cardiac arrest. Arched across the bed, fingers clawing the air in silent agony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather jerks awake as several NURSES rush in, looks back to Dylan, sees he's half sitting up now, his eyes open, peering back at her with incredible intensity as he unzips the oxygen tent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It stops her short. She leans closer.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dylan, honey. You shouldn't do that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan's face twists slowly into an uncanny imitation of an old man, and the voice that comes out of this child's mouth is absolutely recognizable, absolutely Freddy Krueger's.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN_FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too late. I'm almost there, Heather, I'm almost there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN_FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
And with that Dylan vomits. A huge involuntary convulsion that sends green/black effluvia straight into her eyes!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather lurches back, clawing at the stinging globs clinging to her face, her hair. We glimpse insects, worms and worse:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK CUTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emergency machinery flying in. Heather pushed back. Nurses scurrying. The SOUND of Dylan CRYING in a daze for his mother.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Dr. Hefner strides in and roughly shoves the nurses away.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doctor...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DR_HEFNER>
<DIRECTION>
(to nurses)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get her back! I've got to go in! Get me a full anesthetic, STAT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HEFNER>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't have any here, doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
The doctor, grim-faced and furious, wheels back to Dylan, clawing the oxygen tent away.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HEFNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Screw it, then. I'm going in!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HEFNER>
<DIRECTION>
She rips the terrified child's gown away from his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HEFNER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut this evil out of him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HEFNER>
<DIRECTION>
And with that, she pulls her hand out of her bag and we see the grim glove. A medicalized version of the gleaming, TINGING scalpel-sharp claws. Dr. Hefner raises them to plunge into the child.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather lurches forward.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nooooo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
STILL IN THE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the crazed Dr. Hefner is not there. But Heather has dived right onto Dylan's bed. Now several NURSES struggle to subdue her. Heather fights one last second, then realizes what's happened.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what have you done to yourself, Miss?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
Heather looks down and sees the blood seeping out from under the bandage on her arm. Then she looks back
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DYLAN'S BED. The oxygen tent shredded. And Dylan gone. Heather loses it.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's got him. He's got my Dylan!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
The nurses wheel and stare at her. Wild, trembling, and now with a stark streak of gray slashed through her auburn hair!
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who? Who's got him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
Heather sees the looks of people clearly thinking she's nuts. But she doesn't give a shit. She realizes now what's happened in the brief moment she was asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Freddy...

(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who, Freddy Krueger or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE_2>
<DIRECTION>
Just at that point the real Dr. Hefner comes in. Takes in the situation in an instant and asks
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My baby. Freddy's got my baby! He's got my Dylan!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
The doctor seizes Heather roughly by the arms and shakes her until she looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HEFNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms. Langenkamp. I suggest you go home and get some rest. Your son is fine. He's been taken downstairs for further testing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HEFNER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was just here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DR_HEFNER>
<DIRECTION>
(as to a retarded child)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was here. You fell asleep. We took him. You looked so exhausted, frankly, we didn't wake you. Besides, the young woman, Julie, is with him. Believe me, everything is fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HEFNER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything is not fine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
And she bolts out of the room. Hefner swears under her breath and snaps to a nurse.

</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Screw your pass!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Just then Dr. Hefner catches up.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HEFNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right, now...Ms. Langenkamp, just remain calm.

<DIRECTION>
(glance to nurse)

The nurse flicks a look at Heather.

	He's fine, actually. He came out of coma ten minutes ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(just to Hefner, lower)

The door behind them opens and two SECURITY GUARDS appear. Hefner stops them with a hand signal, hearing...

	I know he is, sweetie. We'll both go get Rex right now.

</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to pick up Dylan, then stops. Dylan's looking over her shoulder. She turns and sees Dr. Hefner.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HEFNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid Dylan really should stay with us until we know what's causing these episodes, Ms. Langenkamp. I'm sure you understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HEFNER>
<DIRECTION>
Heather looks back to Dylan. Motions for Julie to come in close with them.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>

	Tell you what. I'm gonna go get Rex for you right now. You know home isn't far from here, right?

Julie takes his hand. Dylan seems to take comfort in that, but still he leans closer to Heather and begs.

	Just a quick word, Ms. Langenkamp. For Dylan's sake.

The security men post themselves at the door. Dr. Hefner exchanges a glance with the nurses, and they vanish from the room. Heather has no choice right now.

	If you don't mind, I've got something more important to do than to make small talk.

She starts to rise but the doctor presses her back down with a look that means business.

Julie stands. One nurse goes directly to a cabinet and begins rummaging inside. The second walks past Julie to stand by Dylan. Julie, instantly alert, crosses to the nurse at the cabinet as the woman pulls out a very large needle and vial.

The nurse has already filled the syringe and now squirts out the air bubble.

The nurse moves for Dylan. Julie grabs her. The nurse just stops and looks at her with a strange smirk of a smile.

	Hey! You can't do that!

Julie grabs the large syringe dropped by the KO'd nurse and levels it at the other. Nurse #2 holds her own a moment, the two facing each other needle to needle.

	I know what's in that one. Do you know what's in this one?

She feints. Nurse #2 drops her syringe like a hot potato and

runs out the room! Julie slams the door and locks it. Then...

Dr. Hefner pulls up a stool and sits directly before Heather, leaning in closer still.

Heather's eyes flash with barely suppressed rage.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>

</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
The woman raises her hands in a practiced non-threatening gesture.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HEFNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't take this wrong. But if there was, there's a good chance Dylan could be suffering from something passed down to him.

	Have you been suffering from any delusional events, Ms. Langenkamp?

Heather starts to stand again, but this time the security guards push her back down. Heather looks back to Dr. Hefner, a cold snake of fear now coiling up her spine.

Heather looks down. The bandage on her arm is seeping blood. She looks back to Hefner, a flick of desperation in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HEFNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are drugs and treatments, Ms. Langenkamp. We could place Dylan in foster care for a short while. Run some tests on you...
	</DIALOGUE>

Heather cuts Hefner off with a deadly cold wave of her hand. Gets up. Bumps against the guards.

INT. TESTING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POUNDING ON THE DOOR FROM THE NURSES OUTSIDE, and Julie is shaking Dylan as hard as she can without hurting him. But despite all this, the injection is having its way. Dylan is sagging before her very eyes. Eyelids fluttering, words slurring...
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's mommy? Where's...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
Then his head lolls onto his shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON HIS EYE. CLOSING. Then opening just a crack, seeing

SOMETHING BIG AND DARK AND AWFUL rising behind Julie. Something with long, vicious claws at the ends of his gleaming steel fingers.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Julie, behind you!

She turns. There's nothing there for her to see.

<DIRECTION>
But DYLAN SEES THE CLAWS RAISE OVER JULIE, then fall onto her like the scythe of the Grim Reaper himself.

FROM OUR POV, JULIE lets out a scream and is hauled up into mid-are by an invisible but horrible force just as

INT. TESTING ROOM

<DIRECTION>
A SCREAMING, WRITHING JULIE lifted into the air by invisible hands, then flung to the floor. Next moment she's being dragged bodily up the wall, leaving a scarlet trail of life's blood. Dylan jerks suddenly up into amulatory sleep. Eyes glazed, face rigid and pale. And Julie smashes to the floor behind him. The nurses scream at a terror they could never in a million years imagine
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TESTING ROOM DOORWAY

and Dylan runs out of the room and is gone!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TREATMENT ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Heather, as the security guards react to the screams and race from the room, gives one look to Dr. Hefner. The woman frozen in fear. She then turns and bolts from the room.

INT/EXT. HEATHER'S VOLVO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE ZOOM ACROSS THE STREET TO AN EMBANKMENT. UP THE EMBANKMENT. TO THE TINY FIGURE up there in cowboy pajamas. Doggedly clawing his way up through the weeds and cresting the hill. There, lit now by the flare of a thousand headlights, is Dylan, staring across either lanes of high- speed traffic. Trying to see his home!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET/EMBANKMENT - NIGHT

Heather leaps out of the car and screams at the top of her lungs.

<HEATHER>

	Dylannnnnnn!!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE WITH DYLAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
on the edge of the freeway. Traffic roaring by, wind ripping through his hair. Somehow in all this din he still hears his mother and turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEEING HER RUNNING ACROSS THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
starting up the steep embankment after him.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dylan! Stay right there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
But then he looks up and reacts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND IN HIS POV WE SEE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the night sky. A giant bank of clouds, moving, twisting, changing into a huge, DARK FIGURE in a wide-brimmed hat, peering out from behind the clouds in frightening silhouette. It looks down on him with glowing, leering eyes. And then the huge steel claws poke through the very fabric of the night, rendering it asunder as the light of the full moon catches in their wicked curves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without another choice, Dylan turns and runs into traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instantly, there's a BLARE OF AIRHORNS and semi-tractor trailer is screaming down on him. Momentarily blinded by its headlights, Dylan barely manages to dance sideways enough, and the truck misses him by inches! But this puts Dylan directly in the path of a SPEEDING CAR coming up in the next lane. He freezes, the car swerves and screams around him so close his clothes are ruffled by the wind!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HEATHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hearing the BRAKES AND HORNS. She convulses in horror and lets out a scream of her own. Then redoubles her efforts, clawing her way over the fence and up the hill!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH DYLAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
staggering for the median strip, three howling lanes away!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH HEATHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
topping the embankment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN HER POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
seeing in horror her son, missed and missed again by inches, unable to cross the last two lanes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUTTING WITH DYLAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as a huge CLAWED HAND stabs into FRAME, plucking him up and swinging him with merciless sport, in and out of the path of oncoming cars!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO HEATHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
about to start after him, then, to her amazement, SEEING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DYLAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
no claw visible whatsoever, just lifting into the air against all laws of physics, nearly dashed to oblivion time and time again.

<HEATHER>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Freddy! You bastard! Take me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
And she runs straight for him!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TANKER TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
slams on all brakes, hews sideways. Heather sees it coming, turns and runs for her life. But it's coming too fast. She dives, tucks and looks up just in time to see the whole massive tanker sweep right over her head! Cars are slewing every which way, but she stumbles back up and presses on. Her terror surpassed only by her utter resolve to get to
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DYLAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the blade of the claw cuts clear through his PJ's. He drops hard. He jumps up and darts through a gap in the median fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEATHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
leaps for her life as a station wagon blurs past her without even seeing her. Then she looks up to see a second car, brakes smoking and screaming, coming right at her! She's too paralyzed by fear to move, and the car hits her just before it stops, knocking her flying. A moment later the freeway on her side grinds to a halt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Already people are out of their cars and running to her aid. But on the other side of the median strip, the brakes are still SCREAMING!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH DYLAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looking back to his mother's side. Then seeing dozens and dozens of FREDDYS suddenly peering at him over the brink of the median wall. Dylan turns and runs, and somehow, by absolute miracle, makes it to the far side, plunging down the embankment!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH HEATHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
dazed, but fighting her way up. She pulls away from the helping arms and staggers after her son!

He points. Heather, not knowing what the hell's going on with him using Nancy's name, turns and looks:
</DIRECTION>

DYLAN

toddling out of his room, holding his guard dinosaur, Rex. The child's eyes are still glazed, and he's definitely not awake, but he's singing softly...

She glances back at the house, trying to see Dylan. Can't. She looks back at Saxon, and reacts in shock!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's staring back at her from in front of an UNMARKED POLICE CAR with its magnetic dome light flashing. Those of us with a good memory might even realize that it's the identical car that LT. THOMPSON drove in NIGHTMARE I. And even more mind- boggling, he's now dressed in the wardrobe of Lt. Thompson from the same film!

Even her wardrobe has changed. She's now wearing the same pajamas she wore in our opening boiler room nightmare. She feels the cold chill up her spine. Turns around and looks at her house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HOUSE ON ELM STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stares back at her. Its windows barred. Its front door swinging open in the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she hears her child's SCREAM.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dylan!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
She races inside and the iron reinforced door slams shut behind her!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HEATHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Interestingly, it's still Heather's house inside. She shakes herself to make sure she's not dreaming...
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dylan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. She crosses to the kitchen and picks up the largest kitchen knife she can find. Then she becomes aware of the television set. She reacts in shock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER POV OF TV SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nancy and Lt. Thompson (Heather and John Saxon) mid-dialogue from the final moments of NIGHTMARE I, and what they say on- screen matches exactly what they've just said in the previous scene.
</DIRECTION>
<NANCY>
<DIRECTION>
(TV)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fred Krueger did it, Daddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NANCY>
<LT_THOMPSON>
<DIRECTION>
(TV)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, sure...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LT_THOMPSON>
<DIRECTION>
The transformation is complete.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HEATHER'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she notices something on the floor. She stops and picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(seeing what it is)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dylan's sleeping pills...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
She looks again. There's another. And farther on, another. A trail, leading towards Dylan's room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DYLAN'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather enters. Knife ready, turning on the light and picking up another capsule. Then she notices two things: the disemboweled remains of Rex flung on the floor near the foot of the bed, and then still another pill, on the blanket near the pillows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She picks this pill up. Then, on impulse, lifts the blanket and looks under. Two more pills, on in the middle, one far down towards the bottom. She pulls the blanket all the way back. Nothing but bed, then floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Heather realizes...
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's given me the only way I can join him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
She closes her eyes and takes the pills. All of them. Swallows. Turns back to the bed, lifts the cover again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN HER POV UNDER THE COVERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's another pill there now, so far down she has to get under the blanket to reach it. She tucks the knife in her belt and crawls under.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDER THE BLANKETS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather picks up the capsule, starts to squiggle back out, then, again on impulse, lifts the blanket at the very bottom of the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRICK BED/CHUTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And this time, instead of the edge of the mattress and floor beyond, only more sheet is revealed. Going on another five or six feet. And sloping downwards. And down there, near the place where sheet and blanket come together, is another pill. Heather starts down for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH HER DOWN THERE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
now completely within the softly glowing tent of blanket, pitched downward awkwardly, she picks up the pill and takes it and the other. And just...has to lift the blanket and check if there's one more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What is revealed is a steep slope of sheet dropping away sharply into what could be infinity, it goes so far. Heather draws back, intimidated. Yawns and starts to crawl back out. Then hears the VOICE from down there.
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
(distant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mommmeeee!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
And then the unmistakable LAUGHTER OF FREDDY. Heather closes her eyes and dives forward without hesitation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING WITH HER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a wild, half OVER-HER-SHOULDER, HALF POV SHOT plunging down a well of bedding into darkness and then
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RUDDY LIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
wet stone walls shooting by at great speed, then
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN ANCIENT STONE FACADE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather flies out of a stone flume in this wall amid coursing water, pitching out into thin air and out of frame!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FREDDY'S BOILER ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UP ANGLE to a toothed rectangle in some ancient ceiling. Above is darkness, out of which falls Heather/Nancy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She plunges down into the deep, fetid water of some horrendous catch of basin. She surfaces, gasping and half drowned, looking around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She finds herself lit in hellish hues by the flames licking through a monumental wall of furnaces behind her. Galleries of stone and vistas of a city of Night stretch out in all directions. The heavy drizzle of condensed steam is everywhere. And there is a palpable feeling of...Evil
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	D...Dylan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Her only answer is the horrific SOUND OF STEEL NAILS SCRATCHING ALONG STEEL. A sound a thousand times worse than fingernails on a chalkboard!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches under the red water, coming up with the butcher knife. Then turns and splashes towards the last sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She searches the vast room, then stops, hearing the faintest...
</DIRECTION>
<DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mommy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
She races across the chamber towards the wall of flame, and there at its base is DYLAN. Crouched alone in front of a huge furnace, backlit by the angry flames. And he's holding something. A sheaf of papers. And the whole dimension falls quiet as he holds it out to her...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather starts for him, then warily stops, alert for a trap.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dylan, where's the man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating the sheaf of papers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
She splashes to him. Drops the knife on a sill of a furnace and takes him in her arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE TWO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a long, tender embrace. Heather looks at his face. He seems alright. Then she looks at the papers in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What...what is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A story?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
Heather finds herself seized by the strangest compulsion to look, despite where she is. She opens a page towards the back at random. And smiles grimly.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. It's a story. A story for a movie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DYLAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Read me some?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DYLAN>
<DIRECTION>
Heather just shakes her head, incredulous at the eerie accuracy of the writing...
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(reading)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"At last his mother finds him. She gives him a long, happy hug. And then looks at the pages. 'Story?' the little boy asks. 'Yes,' says his mother. 'A story of us.' And the mother takes the book and begins to read."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Heather looks at him and laughs' reads more)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"And as she begins to read, from behind her there comes...There comes..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
She stiffens, realizing, twists around and at the same split second he strikes. The true FREDDY, huge and dark and incredibly fast. Slamming into her and lifting her up in his clawed hands. Snatching away the script and flinging it into the fire.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Meet your maker!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
He lifts his arm to strike, then lets out the most GOD AWFUL SCREAM IMAGINABLE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOW ANGLE ON DYLAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
down there on the deck with the big knife jammed into the back of Freddy's right knee!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREDDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
goes down like a fallen Seqouia clawing for the child.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DYLAN springs backwards barely out of reach of the monster Heather leaps onto the monster's back, pulling him off. And Dylan is free.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run, Dylan!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
And run he does. Freddy twists Heather around and flings her across the room into a stone pillar. Heather hits hard and doesn't move. Freddy turns and SEES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DYLAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
dodging through an archway and disappearing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREDDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pulls out the knife and flings it away. Takes off after him like a tiger after a fawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING WITH DYLAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
through this lowest level of hell. Fire and steam and gushing water the only elements, splashing through to a low staircase, turning to see
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREDDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
huge and fierce, splashing after him, claws flashing!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DYLAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
turns and runs deeper into the light of fire, reaching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FINAL CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a huge furnace ending the passage. With one last look over his shoulder telling him he must do something fast. Dylan climbs like a little monkey and disappears into the maw of the huge furnace. This one not fired up but still lit from within by a huge PILOT FLAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FURNACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan jumps the flame and lands singed but safe on the far side of the fire pit, safe for the moment as Freddy slams into the opening of the furnace, reaching for him. And though he's too big to get in fast, his claws are inching closer and closer, inches now from the boy's body!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FIRST ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather drags herself up, half dead, but hearing the SCREAMS OF DYLAN turning to see Freddy head and shoulders inside the distant furnace. She races back and retrieves the knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FURNACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan looks behind, spies an access port barely larger than his head, leading outside the furnace. Knowing it's his only chance, he instantly squeezes himself into it just as FREDDY'S CLAW SNAGS HIS PAJAMAS, pulling him back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MIDDLE CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather splashes through the ankle deep water, coming fast with blood in her eye! She reaches the stairs and suddenly sinks to her knees in sticky goo, flailing and clawing to pull herself free!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FURNACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freddy, lit like a demon in hell by the flame of the pilot, reeling the kid in inch by inch.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gonna eat you up...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
He has Dylan now, pulling him up to his face, opening his mouth wider and wider, unhinging his jaw like some horrendous snake, when suddenly he
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CONVULSES and drops Dylan then lets out a WAIL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE FURNACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather has made it there in time and has the knife buried deep between Freddy's legs, her body blocking sight of exactly where. But we get the idea. She shoves it hard and twists. Freddy HOWLS and fills the world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE FURNACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan squeezes through a tiny aperture!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VENT PASSAGE JUST OUTSIDE FURNACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan looks and sees
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
down this narrow passage and through a grill to Heather, pushing at Freddy's kicking feet!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dylan rushes to help
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE THE FURNACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the side vent grill pops and Dylan jumps out, and at the same instant Freddy pulls his legs fully inside in terrified panic. Together, HEATHER AND DYLAN SLAM the main furnace door and bolt it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The screams are deafening. Heather backs away, horrified. But Dylan climbs right up on the furnace, reaching for the rusted iron lever just above the door and pulls down hard!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instantly there's a DEEP RUMBLE and the furnace fills with a huge GOUT OF FLAME! The child falls back amid deafening screams from inside the furnace. Heather sweeps Dylan up and staggers off!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE FURNACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE FLAMES, as Freddy's screams roar and a huge, gargantuan Freddy starts to outglow the flames themselves! Flame sprouts from his arms and claws. His head blossoms with light and then he's blindingly brilliant, rising, WHITING OUT THE SCREEN, and his screams turn to terrifying laughter. The we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DYLAN'S ROOM - FIRST LIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His bed, as the blanket bumps up yet again, and Dylan and Heather fall out onto the floor. Heather, wet, shivering and bloodied, turns and pulls the blanket completely off the bed, wrapping it around herself and her child. And of course there is nothing behind them now but...bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather turns to Dylan and pulls his head against her breast. She looks to the clock. It changes from 6:59AM to 7:00. Then she looks to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's something there, bound loosely with three brads.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She picks it up and opens it. A script. Finished now. She looks at its top page
