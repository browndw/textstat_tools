</YU>
<LI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	During my meditation training... I came to a place of deep silence... I was surrounded by light... Time and space disappeared. I had come to a place my master had never told me about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LI>
<YU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were enlightened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YU>
<LI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I didn't feel the bliss of enlightenment. Instead... I was surrounded by an endless sorrow. I couldn't bear it. I broke off my meditation. I couldn't go on. There was something... pulling me back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LI>
<YU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YU>
<LI>
	<DIALOGUE>

<LI>

	I don't understand. How can you part with it? It has always been with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YU>
<LI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too many men have died at its edge. It only looks pure because blood washes so easily from its blade.

Li doesn't reply.

	</DIALOGUE>
</YU>
<LI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First I must visit my master's grave. It's been many years since Jade Fox murdered him. I have yet to avenge his death. And yet I'm thinking of quitting. I must pray for his forgiveness.

</YU>
<SIR_TE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be coy. I've always known about your feelings for each other. All these years, it's a shame... neither of you is brave enough to admit the truth to the other. You're both wasting precious time.

<YU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I beg your pardon. Li Mu Bai and I aren't cowards.

Yu gently lays the sword, still in its sheath, in Jen's hands.
</DIRECTION>
<JEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's heavy for such a thin piece of metal!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEN>
<YU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The handle is heavy. And the blade is no ordinary metal. Still, the sword is the lightest of weapons. You're just not used to handling it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YU>
<JEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I have had much practice. As a child in the West, a platoon lived with us. They'd let me play with their weapons. The scabbard is so beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEN>
<YU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beautiful but dangerous. Once you see it tainted with blood, its beauty is hard to admire. It's 400 years old.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YU>
<JEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exquisite! You said it belongs to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEN>
<YU>

	My friend Li Mu Bai. He's given it to Sir Te as a gift.

Yu yanks the sword out of the sheath. An eerie sound resonates within the study. Jen is even more impressed.
</DIRECTION>
<YU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I am. But I prefer the machete. Certain moves, however, call for a sword.

Yu puts the sword back in the case.

	I've read all about people like you. Roaming wild, beating up anyone who gets in your way!

<YU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Writers wouldn't sell many books if they told how it really is.

</YU>
<JEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you're just like the characters in the stories.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEN>
<YU>

	Sure. No place to bathe for days, sleeping in flea-infested beds... They tell you all about that in those books?

	You know what I mean. I'm getting married soon, but I haven't lived the life I want.

<DIRECTION>
Governor Yu is impressed by the opulence and elegance of the sword. He closes his eyes to guess the weight of the sword. Te snubs out the flame from a candle, then slides the sword out from its sheath. The sword gives off a luminous blue glow in the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<SIR_TE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two feet 9 inches long. 1 inch wide. The handle is 1 inch deep, 2.6 inches wide. Seven-tenths of an inch thick. With seven rubies missing from the hilt. You can tell the design dates back to before the Chin era. Engraved with a technique lost by the time of the Han Dynasty.

	Your knowledge is remarkable, Sir Te.

	The Imperial Court isn't the problem. With royalty and officials everywhere, the Royal Guard keeps security tight. But Peking is not like the West. Here, you'll find all sorts of characters. Proceed with caution in your quest for law and order. Don't depend only on the court. Contacts in the Giang Hu underworld can ensure your position. Be strong, yet supple. This is the way to rule.

<YU>

	His name was Meng Si Zhao. He was a brother to Li Mu Bai by oath. One day, while in battle, he was killed by the sword of Li Mu Bai's enemy. After, Li Mu Bai and I went through a lot together. Our feelings for each other grew stronger. But how could we dishonor Meng's memory? So the freedom you talk about, I too desire it. But I have never tasted it.

	They wouldn't have found me if you hadn't stolen the sword. Like a little girl, you thought stealing would be fun? You, too, are responsible for that death. Come with me. You don't want to waste your life as the wife of some bureaucrat. Denied your talent... As a master and disciple we will rule.

Jen lunges at the Governess, and the two exchange a few blows. Jen presses her finger against one of the Governess's pressure points, disabling her. Jen pushes her across the room.

	You think you've been teaching me all these years from the manual? You couldn't even decipher the symbols!

	I studied the diagrams. But you hid the details!

</FOX>

<LI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not for her. She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.

Though unharmed, Madam Yu immediately faints. Lo approaches the carriage and grabs the comb from Jen's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She bolts from the carriage, and, once outside, bends down and grabs a lance from the body of a dead guard, whose horse flails beside him.

Lo rides on as she charges after her horse.

EXT. DESERT BLUFF - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of bandits is dividing up the loot, as Jen rides up, keeping a respectable distance. They notice her and rise as she dismounts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of them saunters over to her and stands, grinning, a few feet away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a second, she's slammed his balls into his stomach and knocked his nose into his face. He crumples to the sand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other bandits stop laughing, quickly exchange glances, and charge her at once.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a matter of seconds, they're either on the ground or dragging their fallen comrades back.

He dismounts, looks down at the dry creek bed.

INT. CAVE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jen comes to and finds herself wrapped in a blanket of animal fur. She sits up with a start and checks her clothes. Looking around, she realizes she's in a cave. Next to her are a lamp, some hunting equipment, and a neat row of sharp arrows. She quickly grabs one of the arrows.
</DIRECTION>
<LO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you like that arrow, I can make you a bow. Great for hunting wild chicken. They're delicious.

Jen raises one of the arrows, going on the attack again, but her legs betray her and she falls.
</DIRECTION>
<LO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need to eat, understand? Then you'll have the strength to fight. Understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LO>

He helps her up, then pours her some horse milk from a sac. He hands her a small chunk of food, which she first accepts grudgingly, then, her hunger getting the better of her, she starts to wolf it down.

Jen again awakes inside the cave. Lo tries to feed her some water, but she chokes, and tries to push him away, only to find that her legs and hands are tied up.
</DIRECTION>
<LO>

Later: She weaves in and out of consciousness. In the flickering lights, she sees Lo sharpening his arrows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Later, he pulls back an opaque curtain to reveal a makeshift bathroom -- a water-filled cavity serves as a tub.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rises as Jen sobs at the sight of her imprisoned and dishevelled body. He comes over and unties her.
</DIRECTION>
<LO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax. If I had wanted to, I would already have done it. You must be dying for a bath. Fresh water's hard to get here. But I managed to bring some up. You can wear my clothes when you're done. They're clean. Don't worry. I'll sing, so you'll know where I am. After the bath, you'll be calmer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LO>
<DIRECTION>
Jen nods and the bandit releases her. He starts to sing as he walks out. Jen waits until the sound recedes before closing the curtain behind her and dipping into the pit. While she bathes, she listens to his singing, a loud rendition of a tribal song. Lo apparently doesn't remember all the lyrics, and la-las his way through more than a few passages. Jen smiles.

Jen impulsively grabs an arrow and stabs Lo, drawing a little blood from his chest. Furious, Lo lunges at her and they tussle briefly. Finally, Lo gets on top of Jen, and the scuffling becomes more like foreplay. Violence turns into unleashed passion.

I will make my mark on the world. I will earn your parents' respect. We have a legend. Anyone who dares to jump from the mountain, God will grant his wish. Long ago, a young man's parents were ill, so he jumped. He didn't die. He wasn't even hurt. He floated away, far away, never to return. He knew his wish had come true. If you believe, it will happen.

As Yu passes the cup to Li, their fingers touch. Embarrassed, Li pulls back.

	Not everything is an illusion. My hand... wasn't that real?

	</DIALOGUE>
</LI>
<DIRECTION>
Li throws the sword into the rapids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jen dives in to retrieve it. He follows Jen downstream by hopping from one rock to another. Jen recovers the sword but is herself drowning. Suddenly Jade Fox swings into the rapids and fishes Jen out. Jade Fox carries the unconscious Jen away. Li gives chase, but loses them.

<DIRECTION>
INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's raining. Inside an old factory, Fox heats some medicine paste and then dips a needle in the paste. She burns the needle point, causing a blue smoke. She lights some incense and puts it in a burner near Jen, who is barely conscious.
</DIRECTION>
<FOX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sooner or later, they'd drag you back to Peking. Your parents will never accept you again. But why go home? We've gone this far, we won't stop now. You'll always be my lady. At last, we'll be our own masters. We'll be happy. That's the most important thing. All we have left is each other, right? Lie down and rest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOX>
<DIRECTION>
Jen is too weak to respond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fox leaves Jen clutching the Green Destiny.

<YU>

<DIRECTION>
INT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jen wakes up, flushed from fever. She takes a sip from a cup of water -- it's empty. She tosses the cup, gets up, and walks into the rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ABANDONED FACTORY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jen walks out, raises her face into the rain, and drinks the raindrops. Thirst quenched, she turns around and finds Li standing there. Jen limps towards him while mumbling.
</DIRECTION>
<JEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it me or the sword you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEN>
<DIRECTION>
Jen falls into Li, who checks her pulse and looks at her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<LI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been drugged!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LI>
<DIRECTION>
Li carries her inside, kicking away the incense burner.

Li lays his hands on Jen's back; she slowly comes to.
</DIRECTION>
<LI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is Jade Fox?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LI>
<DIRECTION>
Jen gestures that she doesn't know. Yu and Bo enter. Yu looks at Jen.
</DIRECTION>
<YU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YU>
<LI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jade Fox drugged her. How did you get here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LI>
<YU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We followed Jade Fox.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YU>
<DIRECTION>
Instantaneously, a flurry of darts flies directly in Jen's direction. Li and Yu swipe miraculously at them all, sending them flinging hither and thither.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fox shows herself. Li attacks her. She falls back, bleeding to death.
</DIRECTION>
<LI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so you die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LI>
<DIRECTION>
Li touches his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<FOX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so shall you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOX>
<DIRECTION>
Li pulls a single needle from his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<YU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A poisoned needle!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YU>
<FOX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You deserve to die, but the life I was hoping to take... was Jen's. Ten years I devoted to you. But you deceived me! You hid the manual's true meaning. I never improved... but your progress was limitless! You know what poison is? An eight-year-old girl, full of deceit. That's poison! Jen! My only family... my only enemy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOX>
<DIRECTION>
Jade Fox dies.
</DIRECTION>
<YU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't die! Tell us what poison you used! You can't die! Tell us the antidote! You can't let Li Mu Bai die!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YU>
<JEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She used Purple Yin... Purple Yin poison. It goes straight to the heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEN>
<LI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My blood will soon reverse its flow. It's the same poison she used to kill my master. There is no antidote.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LI>
<YU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That can't be! Everything has an antithesis! Why not this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YU>
<JEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The antidote exists. She taught it to me. The formula is simple, but it takes time to prepare. Trust me. As you have helped me, let me help you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEN>
<LI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. Hurry. I will hold on as long as I can.

	Use it to meditate. Free yourself from this world as you have been taught. Let your soul rise to eternity with your last breath. Do not waste it... for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YU>
<LI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've already wasted my whole life. I want to tell you with my last breath... I have always loved you. I would rather be a ghost, drifting by your side... as a condemned soul... than enter heaven without you. Because of your love... I will never be a lonely spirit.
