RUN TITLES.

Gradually, the screen begins to lighten as the SUN RISES. The silhouette of the SNARK becomes visible, like some strange insect crouching motionless on the barren plain. The floods shut off. Dense clouds of impenetrable dust shriek and moan, obscuring everything and reducing the sunlight to a dull orange.

INTERIOR - ALIEN SHIP - DAY

The doorway is a glowing geometric blur of light against blackness, spewing dust. In the darkness of the chamber are huge, formless shapes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standard, Broussard and Melkonis appear silhouetted against the doorway. They switch on flashlight-like devices called "DATASTICKS", and step in.

	Climbing gear.

<DIRECTION>
Standard draws out a stubby spear gun with a graplon attached to it. He aims it up into the hole and fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The graplon is launched up into darkness, trailing a thin wire. There is a dull CLUNK, and the wire dangles.

<STANDARD>

<DIRECTION>
Standard attaches the wire to a powered gear box on his chest, and presses a button. With a mechanical whine, he is pulled up into the hole, using his feet for leverage where he can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Broussard attaches the wire to his own chest unit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - CONTROL ROOM OF ALIEN SHIP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This chamber is totally dark as Broussard arrives at the top of the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standard stands with his flashlight/camera ("datastick") tracing a beam through the hanging dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Broussard unclips himself from the climbing wire, then raises his own light. At that moment, Melkonis arrives at the top of the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR LIGHTS SCAN THE ROOM. The beams are clearly visible as columns of light in the floating dust. They reveal heavy, odd shapes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Broussard stumbles over something. He shines his light down on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a large, glossy urn, brown in color, with peculiar markings. Broussard stands it upright. It has a round opening in the top, and is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Melkonis lets out a grunt of shock. Their lights have illuminated something unspeakably grotesque: A HUGE ALIEN SKELETON, SEATED IN THE CONTROL CHAIR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They approach the skeleton, their lights trained on it. IT IS A GROTESQUE THING, BEARING NO RESEMBLANCE TO THE HUMAN FORM.
</DIRECTION>
<MELKONIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy Christ...

Traced raggedly onto the surface of the panel, as by the point of a sharp instrument, is a small triangle:

<DIRECTION>
Hearing something, Broussard flashes his light across the room. As the beam scans the walls, it briefly touches on SOMETHING THAT MOVES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Melkonis convulsively yanks out his pistol.

<MELKONIS>

Standard knocks his hand down.

<DIRECTION>
Standard shoulders himself in front of the others. Then, slowly, he begins to move toward the far side of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They approach a console on the wall, training their lights on it. There is a machine. On the machine, a small bar moves steadily back and forth, sliding noiselessly in its grooves.

Roby is alone in the room, slumped into a chair, watching the photographic slides on the screen. He is clicking slowly through them. He stops on an angle of the skeleton, and stares at it.

Broussard is standing on a dusty stone floor, with a feeble column of sunlight shining down around him from the tunnel above. Around is solid darkness.

He flashes his datastick around. The beam reveals that he is in a stone room. STRANGE HEIROGLYPHICS are carved into the walls. They have a primitive, religious appearance. Row after row of pictograms stretch from floor to ceiling, some epic history in an unknown language. Huge religious symbols dominate one wall.

Spaced at intervals are stylized stone statues, depicting grotesque monsters, half anthropoid, half octopus.

He shines his light on the floor at the base of the "urn." There lies the "lid" -- the stopper that had filled the hole. He picks it up and studies it. It appears more organic than artificial; the inside surface is spongy and irregular.

He bends over the mouth of the "urn" shining the light in, AND WITH SHOCKING VIOLENCE, A SMALL, OCTOPUS-LIKE THING LEAPS OUT AND ATTACHES ITSELF TO HIS FACE, WRAPPING ITS TENTACLES AROUND HIS HEAD.

<DIRECTION>
With a MUFFLED SCREAM, he launches himself backward, tearing at the thing with his hands.

EXTERIOR - TOP OF PYRAMID - NIGHT

The dust blows and howls as Standard and Melkonis arrive at the top, lights bobbing in the darkness.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's his line. We can haul him out of there if we have to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<MELKONIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it. The line could get tangled in something.

</MELKONIS>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what can we do? He's out of radio contact.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<MELKONIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELKONIS>
<DIRECTION>
Standard hesitates, clinging to the lip of the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
(making up his mind)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I told him to be out in ten minutes. It's been much longer. Let's get him out of there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
Standard pulls himself up and crouches precariously on the edge of the tunnel. He begins to fiddle with the winch mechanism from which Broussard's line dangles.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The line's slack. Christ, do you think the idiot unhooked himself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
He switches on the winch motor. With a whine, it begins to reel the line in. After a moment, the line TIGHTENS WITH A JERK -- and the motor slows down, laboring under the added weight.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There, it caught!

Standard shines his light down into the hole.

<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I can't see far enough. The line's moving, though.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment, the two men hang to the narrow top of the pyramid, saving their strength, while the line reels in and the wind howls. Then Standard shines his light back down in.

</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
In their panic and confusion, the men teeter momentarily, finally regain their balance. They shine their lights on Broussard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He appears to be completely unconscious -- AND THE OCTOPUS THING IS STILL WRAPPED AROUND HIS FACE, MOTIONLESS.

After a moment, they hear the motor sound again, followed by another CLUNK. The outer door has closed again. The red light goes off.

The inner door slides open, and Standard and Melkonis stagger through, carrying the sagging body of Broussard. A cloud of choking dust follows them out of the lock.

One of them flicks on the lights as they come shuffling into the medical room, carrying Broussard.

Revealed is a rather small cubicle whose walls are lined with machinery. The principle item of interest is a mechanized bunk bed, which rests in a cradle and slides in and out of a slot in the wall.

	Medical gloves.

</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
They pull thin elastic gloves from a dispenser in the wall, and pull them on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gingerly, they approach Broussard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standard places his hands on the octopus-thing that is slowly pulsing on Broussard's face. He grasps the tentacles in his hands and tries to pull it free.

A trickle of blood begins to ooze down Broussard's cheek.

	It's not coming off -- not without his whole face coming off too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELKONIS>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's let the machine work on him.

</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
Efficiently, they strip Broussard naked, then Standard presses a couple of switches on the wall. The machine lights up, and Broussard is sucked into the slot in the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is visible inside. The machine immediately sprays a cloud of disinfectant on him, then sterilizes him with a blinding pink light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bank of video monitors pops on, revealing X-ray images of different parts of his body. Sensors begin to scan, relays chatter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROBY APPEARS IN THE DOORWAY.

Standard turns and looks at him. For a long moment, the two men regard each other, then STANDARD STEPS FORWARD AND SLAPS ROBY ACROSS THE FACE.

The others are shocked.

<HUNTER>

	Yeah, but how? His nose and mouth are blocked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTER>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's look inside his head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
Standard punches some buttons, and on the monitors, a kind of X-ray image in vivid colors appears, depicting Broussard's HEAD AND UPPER TORSO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The parasite is clearly visible on Broussard's face. In X-ray, the creature is a maze of complicated biology. But the shocking thing is that, in X-ray, we can see that Broussard's jaws are forced wide open, and THE PARASITE HAS EXTRUDED SOME KIND OF LONG TUBE, WHICH IS STUFFED INTO HIS MOUTH AND DOWN HIS THROAT, ending near his stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at that.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... God...

Hunter bends over and RETCHES.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<HUNTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't make any sense. It paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTER>
<MELKONIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't expect to understand a life form like this. We're out of our back yard. Things are different here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELKONIS>
<HUNTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, can't we kill it? I mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTER>
<MELKONIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it. At least right now it's keeping him alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELKONIS>
<HUNTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about cutting it off? We can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTER>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right... we can't stand here and do nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
Standard picks up his dusty breathing mask and pulls it over his head. Then he pulls back on his bulky gloves. Finally, he presses a switch and Broussard slides back out of the booth.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somebody give me a scalpel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
Melkonis takes a glittering surgical blade from a slot in the wall, and carefully passes it to Standard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clumsily because of the gloves, Standard manipulates the knife in his hand till he has a decent grip on it. Then he flicks a little button with his thumb. The scalpel begins to hum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standard advances on the parasite. The others draw back nervously. Roby reaches over and draws yet a longer blade from the rack, and holds it inconspicuously at his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standard bends over the parasite. Carefully, he touches the scalpel to the extreme end of one of the tentacles, where it curves toward the back of Broussard's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Effortlessly, the electronic blade slides through the alien tissue. Immediately, a urine-like fluid begins to flow from the wound.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (muffled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've made an incision... it's not reacting... but some kind of yellowish fluid is leaking out of the wound...

<DIRECTION>
The noxious-looking liquid drips down onto the bedding next to Broussard's head. Instantly, it starts to hiss, and a thin stream of smoke curls up from the stain.
</DIRECTION>

(CONT'D) (muffled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold it, this stuff's smoking!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
The others REACT nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By now, the yellow fluid has eaten a hole through the bunk bed and has dripped down onto the floor below. The metal floor begins to bubble and sizzle, and more smoke rises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men start to COUGH.

<DIRECTION>
Abruptly, the men jostle their way out of the room and huddle in the corridor outside, coughing their lungs out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standard, who is masked, remains. Frantically, he attempts to put a bandage on the wound, but the fluid instantly melts the bandage, and in the process, some of the stuff gets on Standard's gloves. They begin to smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frantically Standard leaps back, pulling off the smouldering gloves. Then he runs out into the corridor and yanks off his mask.
</DIRECTION>

A droplet of the fluid is sizzling on the ceiling. It oozes down and drips to the floor.

The X-ray reveals a spreading dark blot in the vicinity of Broussard's chest. In the center, the stain is completely opaque.

<DIRECTION>
Again we are watching slides in the darkened room. This time Standard, Roby, Melkonis, and Hunter are watching the sequence of photographs taken automatically by Broussard's datastick as he probed the tomb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera reveals the "urns." The climax of the sequence of stills comes when THE CREATURE LEAPS OUT OF THE "URN" TOWARD THE CAMERA -- and after that the camera drops to a useless angle and proceeds to show a series of meaningless blurs. Then the reel ends.

<HUNTER>

CLICK. CLICK. Melkonis is changing the slides as they talk, showing different angles on the glyphs.

</HUNTER>
<STANDARD>

	Well, those things out there aren't the same, you know -- the spaceship and the pyramid. They're from different cultures and different races. That ship just landed here -- crashed like we did. The pyramid and the thing from it are indigenous.

<HUNTER>

The door slides open, and they step into the room. Hunter activates the bed, and it slides out of the wall.

<DIRECTION>
THERE IS A LONG, HORRIFIED PAUSE.
</DIRECTION>
<HUNTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTER>
<DIRECTION>
They rush to Broussard's prone form. THE PARASITE IS GONE FROM HIS FACE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Broussard is still unconscious, but he is breathing. HIS FACE IS COVERED WITH SUCKER MARKS.

<HUNTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now we're in for it.

</HUNTER>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>

Standard picks up a stainless steel tray with a lid.

Tray in one hand, lid in the other, Standard begins moving slowly around the room. There are very few places to hide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He bends down and peers under the bunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he is down on his hands and knees, WE SEE ONE TENTACLE OF THE THING, VIBRATING ON A LEDGE JUST ABOVE STANDARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rises, and HIS SHOULDER BRUSHES THE TENTACLE. THE PARASITE DROPS TO THE FLOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
(leaping back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
But the thing is not moving. It lies motionless on the floor, its tentacles curled up. Its color has faded to a dead-looking grey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without taking his eyes off the thing, Standard reaches behind him and takes a long probe from the wall. He prods the thing; it does not respond.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's dead.

With great care, he uses the probe to fish the motionless parasite into the tray. Then he quickly closes the lid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - LABORATORY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standard, Roby, and Melkonis have the parasite spread-eagled on a stainless steel table, with a bright light on it. It is belly-side up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wearing gloves, Standard probes at the thing with an instrument.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at these suckers -- no wonder we couldn't get it off him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that its mouth?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<MELKONIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More likely that organ -- the tube- like thing -- fits up in there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELKONIS>
<DIRECTION>
With a pair of needle-nosed pliers, Standard fishes in the fleshy aperture. Carefully, he extracts the end of the tube-organ.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ugh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, it starts to FALL APART IN THE PLIERS.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quick -- it's decomposing -- gimme something to grab it with!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
It begins to SMOKE AND BUBBLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roby grabs a long pair of tongs from the wall and thrusts them at Standard -- who throws down the pliers, snatches the tongs and seizes the thing in the tongs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is smouldering and dripping acid on the floor.

They come running up to the airlock. Roby stabs the button and the inner door slides open. By the time Standard is in the lock, Roby is already on the intercom:

Standard HURLS THE CARCASS OUT, tongs and all.

Broussard's face is screwed up into a mask of agony, and he is trembling violently from head to foot.

</BROUSSARD>
<DIRECTION>
A RED SMEAR OF BLOOD BLOSSOMS ON THE CHEST OF BROUSSARD'S TUNIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR EYES ARE ALL RIVETTED TO BROUSSARD'S CHEST AS THE FABRIC OF HIS TUNIC IS RIPPED OPEN, AND A HORRIBLE NASTY LITTLE HEAD THE SIZE OF A MAN'S FIST PUSHES OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everybody SCREAMS and leaps back from the table. The cat spits and bolts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The disgusting little head lunges, comes spurting out of Broussard's chest trailing a thick, wormlike tail -- splattering fluids and blood -- lands in the middle of the dishes and food on the table -- and scurries away while the men are stampeding for safe ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When they finally regain control of themselves, it has escaped. Broussard lies slumped in his chair, a huge hole in his chest, spouting blood. The dishes are scattered and the food is covered with blood and slime.

A hatch slides open on the side of the ship, and Broussard's wrapped body tumbles silently out.

AN ELECTRONIC BASS DRUM BEATS A DIRGE as Broussard drifts into eternity.

	We'll have to trap it somehow. If we had a really strong piece of net, we could bag it.

	We could cut a section out of that metallite netting. It won't hold up to that acid, but aside from that it's pretty strong.

	We have to avoid injuring it. What we really need is some electric animal prods.

INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP

<DIRECTION>
Standard is walking purposefully along the corridor, alone. He is garmented in an unusual outfit which makes him look like a riot policeman, including clear plastic helmet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches a corner and turns. But this new passageway has a different gravity orientation -- Standard seems to be walking down a vertical wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He makes yet another disorienting turn, and now he is walking upside- down. He reaches a set of steps and climbs up them -- or rather, down them.

Melkonis is seated in the dome, upside-down, peering down into space. He also wears the protective suit.

Standard, upside-down, climbs into the dome. It is dark and eerie here, under the stars of interstellar space. A few glowing panels provide the only illumination.

Standard takes the device and studies it.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>

	These will be very useful. At least we won't have to go digging around in closets with our bare hands. All right, here's the battle plan: we're going to break into two teams and start systematically covering the ship.

INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL

Roby, Melkonis, and Faust come carefully down a set of crude metal stairs, into a drab, functional section of the ship.

The corridors in this level are lit by rows of bare bulbs in the ceiling. The effect is ugly and confining.

Roby and Melkonis heft the net, each keeping his prod in hand. Faust, prod in one hand and tracker in the other, has the unpleasant job of approaching the source of the signal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves with great care, in a half crouch, ready to leap back at any second, prod extended, constantly glancing at the tracker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tracking device leads him right up to a small hatch or door in one wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind his plastic mask, sweat is pouring down Faust's face as he sets down the tracker and reaches for the little door. He raises the prod, grasps the door handle, yanks it open, and jams the electric prod inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH A NERVE-SHATTERING SQUALL, A SMALL CREATURE COMES FLYING OUT OF THE CABINET, EYES GLARING, CLAWS FLASHING.

Instinctively, they throw the net over it, but:

He begins to crawl forward into the narrow metal tunnel. He turns a corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a couple more tight turns, THE TRACKER SUDDENLY BEEPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hunter twitches. He raises his flamethrower and FIRES A BLAST INTO THE DARKNESS. It roars loudly in the confined tube, and the air instantly heats up. Smoke drifts back into his face. He begins to sweat.

Roby points to a large rectangular opening in one wall.

Hunter is still crawling on hands and knees. Up ahead, he can see that the shaft takes an abrupt downward turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crawls toward the down angle, then fires another blast from his flamethrower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he starts crawling down, head first.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he is nearly upside-down, the shaft takes yet another turning which puts him into a nearly impossible position, almost immobilized.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the tracker starts BEEPING LIKE CRAZY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frantically, he fumbles the flamethrower around, but the space is narrow -- it is difficult maneuvering. He hears a HISSING CRY up ahead, and claws scrambling on metal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he has the weapon into position, and sprays another lethal flaming burst toward the sound.

INSTANTLY, A TREMENDOUS WINDSTORM STARTS UP as the ship's air is sucked out toward the lock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SIREN BEGINS TO SOUND, AND A RED LIGHT FLASHES:
</DIRECTION>
<CRITICAL_DEPRESSURIZATION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment of panic and confusion, Roby bolts out of the control room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - CORRIDORS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Loose papers and articles of furniture hurtle through the passageways, as Roby hurries toward the rock, partly running, partly sucked along by the air current.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR - SHIP - OUTER SPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge plume of steam grows from the side of the ship, with all kinds of tiny loose particles tumbling out in it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - CORRIDORS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whipped by the hurricane wind, Roby crashes to a momentary halt against a wall. As he hesitates there, trying to regain his balance, HE SEES THE CREATURE SCURRYING AWAY DOWN ANOTHER CORRIDOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ignoring the monster, he pushes off from the wall and starts running again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE AIR LOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roby stops himself by grabbing the edge of a doorway at the end of the hall down from the airlock. Here, the wind is really terrific -- his clothes flap on his body and all kinds of things fly by -- the sound is a DEAFENING WHISTLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instantly, Roby starts turning a large wheel, which begins to close a sliding hatch door, closing off the air lock corridor. As the hatch closes, THE CURRENT DECREASES, THEN IS FINALLY CUT OFF AS HE SEALS IT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Done in, he collapses to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he clutches his throat and begins to gasp for breath. Because of the thinness of the air, THE SOUND LEVEL IN THE SHIP IS VERY ODD -- THIN, DISTANT, ALMOST INAUDIBLE. Roby is gasping loudly, but we can barely hear him; and his footsteps boom thinly like a man walking underwater.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - CORRIDORS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clutching his throat, he comes across the others -- Standard and Hunter -- and they are all choking, clawing at their throats, gasping like fishes out of water. They are sweating heavily and their noses bleed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They try to speak to each other, but the sound is so muffled we can only hear distant croaks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standard mumbles something and stumbles down the hall. The others follow him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - MAIN AIR TANK ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door bursts open and Standard reels in, his footsteps pinging thinly on the metal flooring. We see several rows of large oxygen tanks, all connected by hoses to a few petcocks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standard staggers to these and starts twisting the handles, opening them. THERE IS A PIERCING HISS OF ESCAPING AIR, AND THE SOUND LEVEL GRADUALLY RETURNS TO NORMAL as Standard and the others sink to the floor, gasping in the oxygen gratefully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally they have recovered enough to be able to sit up.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much oxygen did we lose?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<DIRECTION>
Standard rises unsteadily and peers at the gauges.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got six hours left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<HUNTER>
<DIRECTION>
(groans)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTER>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does anybody know what happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw it. Faust got himself jammed in the air lock door. His body held it open.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we get to him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I had to seal off a whole section. We'd lose too much of our remaining air if we opened the connecting door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - AIR LOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faust's body, crushed in the inner door, floats weightlessly in the vacuum. His nose and mouth are crusted with huge gobs of dried blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - BRIDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three survivors -- Standard, Roby and Hunter -- slump into chairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cat emerges from a hiding place, yowling with fear.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBY>
<DIRECTION>
(picking up the cat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor kitty; puss puss puss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least we're rid of the damn monster. It must have been the first thing sucked out of the ship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No such luck. I saw it running down one of the corridors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<HUNTER>
<DIRECTION>
(groans)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no! We can't fight this thing! There's only six hours of air left -- we're dead men!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTER>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't buy that. There's still time to destroy it and get ourselves in the freezers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<HUNTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTER>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's time for drastic remedies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was time for that a couple days ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That kind of remark is pointless. Now come on -- I want to hear every suggestion you can come up with, no matter how wild.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<HUNTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't kill it on board. It's huge now and must have tremendous amounts of that acid in its body.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTER>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got an idea, but you're not going to like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's hear it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. First we shut down all the cooling systems on the stardrive engines.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That'll blow the ship up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right... but it'll take a few minutes for the engines to overheat and melt down the core. In the meantime, we get in the lifeboat and leave the ship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<HUNTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blow the ship up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTER>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the creature with it. We can make it back to Irth in the lifeboat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the lifeboat can't accelerate to light speed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't matter -- we're already at light speed. And when we get back to the Colonies, they'll pick us up in the network.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<HUNTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about all the minerals and elements in the cargo hold? That's the only reason we came out here. We'd have to abandon them all. We'd be broke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTER>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our lives are more important. Anyway, we can take a small amount of the most valuable stuff with us on the lifeboat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it won't work and I just realized why. There's only one hypersleep freezer on the lifeboat. Only one of us could survive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... I forgot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the idea's good, if we could just turn it around somehow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
They think.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we could just get the creature into the lifeboat, we could launch it into space and blow it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<HUNTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good! That's good!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTER>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can load the lifeboat up with explosives and trigger them remotely, once the lifeboat is in space.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's going to be almost impossible to drive it up into the lifeboat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<HUNTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can use the flamethrower.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTER>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not going to work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't say that; I think it's a good plan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<HUNTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The flamethrower needs more fuel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTER>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. We've got a lot to accomplish. Let's get moving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - MINING & CARGO BAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three men come down steps into this rather dirty area of the ship. A lot of tools and large items of machinery are stored around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG RACKS OF SHELVES ARE STOCKED WITH METAL CONTAINERS OF VARIOUS SHAPES. Each container is well packed and labelled.
</DIRECTION>
<HUNTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which explosive should we use?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTER>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd suggest the N-13 sticks. They're portable, and they can be radio detonated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
Hunter begins to unlock a locker and draw out long, red sticks like broomhandles, with tiny printing on them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, ROBY IS STARING AT THE ROWS OF METAL CANNISTERS. He touches one of them.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, it's funny -- this stuff we went to so much trouble to dig up -- this treasure, the paydirt -- it'll make it back to Irth just fine -- even if we're not with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, carry these.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
Hunter takes an armload of the red broomsticks, and stumbles.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBY>
<DIRECTION>
(grabbing at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey watch it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
(grinning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's stable; it doesn't hurt to drop it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
They begin to carry the explosives up the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three men are carrying their equipment along the hallway, when Hunter's tracker suddenly BEEPS.
</DIRECTION>
<HUNTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTER>
<DIRECTION>
They all stop. The tracker BEEPS AGAIN. Hunter puts down his stuff and points the tracker around.
</DIRECTION>
<HUNTER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (nodding up some steps)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Up there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTER>
<DIRECTION>
They all look at each other. Standard puts down his bundle and picks up the flamethrower.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what do we do? Do we ignore it and finish loading the explosives into the boat -- or do we flush it out now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now. If we can get it into the boat, we won't have to blow it up -- we can just eject it into space.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
Standard hefts the flamethrower and starts up the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - DIM STAIRWELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standard's face is tense as he advances up the circular steps. Suddenly, a METALLIC TAPPING SOUND is heard. He freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he continues up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR - DORSAL OBSERVATION DOME - VIEW OF OUTER SPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The view of interstellar space is spectacular. As Standard comes up the steps, the METALLIC TAPPING is heard again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standard looks around. Then he sees it -- BROUSSARD'S CORPSE FLOATS OUTSIDE THE GLASS OF THE DOME. It is tangled in some rigging, and the movement of the machinery causes the cadaver to tap on the glass periodically.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
(shouts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can come up! It's safe!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
The others come up the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBY>
<DIRECTION>
(spying the corpse)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh -- Jesus --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<DIRECTION>
Broussard's corpse is blue and bloated where the wrappings have torn loose. Bumping against the glass, he looks like he wants to come in.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The ship's gravitational attraction must have drawn him back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<HUNTER>
<DIRECTION>
(horrified)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should we go outside and bring him in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTER>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... the risk is too great. Perhaps after we've destroyed the thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
Glancing back, the men retreat from the observation dome. Broussard remains against the glass, peering in with dead eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The floor slopes upward slightly here as the corridor funnels in and ends in the entrance to a narrow passageway or crawl-way. This passageway connects the nose of the ship with the lifeboat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three men come up to the entrance to the passageway, carrying the equipment. They duck in and walk the short distance to the lifeboat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The passageway connects into the rear of the lifeboat. It is an extremely simple, stripped-down vehicle; even the metal struts and beams-are exposed. A single hypersleep freezer takes up a fair amount of floor space. It is an escape-craft, nothing more.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Along the base of the walls there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
They begin to stack the red broomsticks against the base of the walls on both sides of the lifeboat, and to wire them into position tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<HUNTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This should do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTER>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should hope so! And we'd better make sure it's pretty far from the ship when we blow it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It will be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<HUNTER>
<DIRECTION>
(surveys the craft uneasily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What we really need is some red meat in here for bait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTER>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if we had some, I'd eat it. I'm starting to get hungry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<DIRECTION>
By this time, they are exiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... now we have to herd that thing up here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<HUNTER>
<DIRECTION>
(nervously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full. I think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(searches for a word)
</DIRECTION>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't "bait" the word you used?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<HUNTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTER>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, and maybe launch the boat and blow it too... if the others are injured.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who gets the privilege?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT: THREE CRUMPLED PIECES OF PAPER. Three hands pick them up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON ROBY. He unfolds his paper, turns it so the others can see it. It has a big X on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - SHORTLY LATER. Hunter is showing Roby a small device like a transistor radio.
</DIRECTION>
<HUNTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTER>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it armed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<HUNTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTER>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for the thought.

<DIRECTION>
(puts detonator in his breast pocket)
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, Martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kablooey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<DIRECTION>
Hunter's face twitches nervously at this.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on; we haven't much time, air is a factor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
They leave the nose of the ship, Standard carrying the flamethrower, Hunter the tracker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roby settles himself at the controls, runs through them briefly to familiarize himself. Using a switch, he opens and closes the lifeboat door a couple of times. It slams open and shut quite rapidly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He presses a few buttons and sets the launch button to "READY."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then STANDARD'S VOICE comes from the communicator:
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
(over, filtered)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got something on the tracker... got to be it, it's too big for the cat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
This is a VERY SPOOKY SCENE, ROBY ALONE BY THE LIFEBOAT, LISTENING TO THE VOICES ON THE COMMUNICATOR.
</DIRECTION>
<HUNTER>
<DIRECTION>
(over, filtered)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's coming from down there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTER>
<DIRECTION>
Roby hears various tinny sound effects, rustlings, clunkings, breathing, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - CORRIDOR IN SHIP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standard has the flamethrower at the ready, and Hunter is staring at the tracker.
</DIRECTION>
<HUNTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It must have stopped moving. I'm not getting anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTER>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me go first; you stay behind me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
Carefully, Standard advances down the corridor. Then THE CREATURE POPS OUT OF HIDING BEHIND HUNTER, AND PICKS HIM UP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HUNTER SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standard whirls around, sees the thing clutching Hunter. It holds him off to one side, as though to keep Standard from getting at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standard doesn't know what to do.
</DIRECTION>
<HUNTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The flamethrower!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HUNTER>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't, the acid will pour out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment the creature TAKES A BITE OUT OF HUNTER, WHO SCREAMS IN MORTAL AGONY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standard can take it no longer; he raises the flamethrower and fires -- BUT THE CREATURE SWINGS HUNTER AROUND AS A SHIELD AND HUNTER CATCHES THE FULL BLAST OF THE FLAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standard instantly stops firing, but now Hunter is a kicking ball of flame, held out at arm's length by the monster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - NOSE OF SHIP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roby is listening to all this on the communicator. He can hear the shrieks and crashing noises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the communicator goes dead, and all he hears is a rush of static.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Standard? Hunter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<DIRECTION>
He waits quite a while for a response, but we can see from his expression that he expects none.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drops his face into his hands. When he lifts his head again, he has managed to summon a certain amount of resolve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - CORRIDORS IN SHIP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roby walks along watching the tracker, carrying a pistol in the other hand. He comes across Standard's flamethrower, lying on the floor. He picks it up, substituting it for the pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he continues to follow the tracker; it takes him down the steps into the maintenance level.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roby follows the device for a short distance until it indicates that the source of the signal is directly under his feet. Looking down, he sees that he is standing on a square metal plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Getting down on his hands and knees, he removes the heavy plate, revealing a black opening with a ladder going down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Substituting the tracker for a flashlight, but still carrying the flamethrower, Roby starts down the ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - DARK STORAGE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shining the light around into the darkness, Roby descends the metal ladder to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PLACE IS A HORRIBLE LAIR, FULL OF BONES, HAIR, SHREDS OF FLESH, PIECES OF CLOTHING, AND SHOES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something moves in the darkness -- Roby turns his light on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANGING FROM THE CEILING IS A HUGE COCOON. It appears to be woven from some fine, white, silk-like material, and it is slowly undulating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flamethrower ready, Roby approaches the cocoon. As he gets close enough, he sees that the cocoon is semi-transparent and THE BODY OF STANDARD IS INSIDE IT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unexpectedly, Standard's eyes open, and focus on Roby -- who jumps violently.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
(a feeble whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<ROBY>
<DIRECTION>
(sickened)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did it do to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
(moves his head slightly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
Roby turns his light where Standard indicates. Another cocoon dangles from the ceiling, but this one looks a little different. It is smaller and darker, with a harder shell. In fact, it looks almost EXACTLY LIKE THE SPORES IN THE TOMB.
</DIRECTION>
<STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was Melkonis... it ate Hunter...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... don't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<ROBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I can save you -- get you to the Autodoc!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBY>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No good... it's eaten too much of me...

	<DIALOGUE>
	What can I do?

</ROBY>
<STANDARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STANDARD>
<DIRECTION>
Roby stares at him in horror, then bends down and takes a closer look at him. REACTING, he straightens back up, raises the flamethrower, and sprays a molten blast. When the entire room is in flames, he turns and scrambles back up the ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - MAINTENANCE LEVEL

Roby drops to his knees and gasps for breath, trying not to throw up. At length, he regains control of himself.

He seals the catbox, then turns on the oxygen. There is a faint hiss of pressurized air. Wild-eyed, the cat peers out of a little window in front. It YOWLS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up the pressurized catbox and leaves the bridge.

Carrying the catbox and a shoulder bag (and of course the flamethrower), Roby goes quickly to the nearest rank of metal cannisters.

Putting the invaluable cannister into the shoulder bag, he hurries back up the steps.

INTERIOR - ENGINE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Catbox in one hand, flamethrower in the other, Roby enters the engine room, containing the massive stardrive engines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He puts down his parcels and approaches the main control board for the engines. Studying the instructions, he begins to close switches, one by one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SIREN BEGINS TO HONK THROUGHOUT THE SHIP.
</DIRECTION>
<COMPUTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Attention! The cooling units for the stardrive engines are not functioning! Engines will overload in 4 minutes, 50 seconds! Attention!

Finally Roby closes the last switch. Shaking with nervousness, he hurriedly picks up catbox, bag and flamethrower and hurries out of the engine room.

Roby comes hustling up to where the lifeboat is berthed. Hands full, he starts to enter the connecting passageway.

<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - CONNECTING PASSAGEWAY

THE CREATURE IS WAITING AT THE OTHER END OF THE PASSAGEWAY, INSIDE THE LIFEBOAT.

It HISSES and starts toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Roby leaps out of the passageway, bounds to the controls, and throws the switch. The hatch door SLAMS SHUT, locking the thing in the lifeboat.
</DIRECTION>
<COMPUTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Attention! Engines will overload in 4 minutes!

Indecisive, Roby stares at the lifeboat "LAUNCH" button. The thing can be heard fumbling around in the passageway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, he turns and bolts back toward the engine room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Like a maniac, Roby runs through the ship, level after level, pounding down stairwells, his footsteps clanging metallically throughout the ship as he sprints for the engine room.

The door crashes open and Roby comes running in. The room is full of smoke and the engines are whining dangerously. It is extremely hot in the room; Roby instantly breaks out in sweat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He runs to controls and begins throwing back on the cooling unit switches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still THE SIREN CONTINUES.
</DIRECTION>

A look of terror comes onto Roby's face. He turns and runs from the engine room.
</DIRECTION>

Again, Roby must run through all the levels of the ship, this time up the stairs, exhausted, stumbling, while the computer counts down:

Reeling, gasping for breath, Roby staggers into the vestibule where the lifeboat is berthed. He grabs the flamethrower and turns it toward the passageway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is then he realizes that THE LIFEBOAT DOOR IS OPEN AGAIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quickly, he glances around to see if the creature might be behind him. Then he advances on the passageway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - PASSAGEWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dripping with sweat, his face a mask of fear, Roby enters the passageway, flamethrower gripped tightly in his hands. He is goaded on by the siren and the computer:
</DIRECTION>
<COMPUTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Attention! Engines will explode in 90 seconds!

<DIRECTION>
He makes it all the way to the end of the passageway, then sticks his head into the lifeboat.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POINT-OF-VIEW as he quickly scans the lifeboat, reveals that it is EMPTY.
</DIRECTION>

Immediately, he turns and dashes back to the head of the passageway. There he grabs the catbox and bag, then runs back into the lifeboat.

He comes in on the run, hurls the catbox and bag toward the front, and does a dive over the back of the control chair. He is no sooner in the seat than he hits the "LAUNCH" button.
</DIRECTION>

The retainer clips drop away, and with a blast of ramjets, THE LIFEBOAT IS LAUNCHED AWAY FROM THE "SNARK."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roby is frantically strapping himself in, as the lifeboat accelerates away from the mother ship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR - SPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tiny pod of the lifeboat accelerates away from the larger bulk of the SNARK. The scene is strangely serene for such deadly circumstances.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roby finishes strapping himself in, then he reaches and grabs the catbox. The cat is YOWLING. Roby hugs the box to his chest and hunches his head down over it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR - SPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SNARK drifts ever farther away as the lifeboat leaves it behind, until it is barely a point of light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEN IT BLOWS UP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN EXPANDING ORANGE FIREBALL WITH PIECES OF METAL FLYING IN ALL DIRECTIONS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shockwave hits the escape craft, jolting it and rattling everything inside. Then all is quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roby unhooks himself from his straps, rises, and goes to the back of the lifeboat. He stares out through the porthole. His face is bathed in orange light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR - SPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What he sees is the boiling fireball, now fading and fizzling away into nothingness, and a couple of pieces of debris floating past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roby's expression is mournful as he watches the final obliteration of his ship and friends.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND HIM, THE CREATURE EMERGES FROM SOME HIDING PLACE -- IT HAS BEEN INSIDE THE LIFEBOAT ALL ALONG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cat SCREECHES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roby whirls, and finds himself facing the thing across the length of the boat. It squats, then pulls out its trophy -- a man's arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It begins to eat the arm, watching Roby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His first thought is for the flamethrower -- unfortunately, it lies on the floor right next to the monster. Next he glances around for any place to hide. His eye falls on a tiny locker containing a space suit, with the door standing open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He begins to edge toward the locker. The creature rises. He freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It throws down the arm. With that, Roby dives for the open locker door, hurls himself inside, and slams the door shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a clear glass panel in the door, and the thing puts its face right up to the glass, peering in at Roby. The locker is so small that Roby's face is only inches away from the creature's. The sight is disgusting. It turns its head, looking at him in curiosity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the MOANING OF THE CAT distracts it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creature waddles over to where the pressurized catbox sits. It bends down and peers inside. The CAT YOWLS LOUDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It picks up the catbox in its tentacles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trying to distract the monster away from the cat, Roby TAPS ON THE GLASS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the monster reacts so fast that its face is instantly back at the glass, startling the hell out of Roby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Getting no more interference from him, the thing returns to the catbox.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roby looks around. He spies the spacesuit. Quickly, he begins to pull it on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creature picks the catbox up in its tentacles and shakes it to see if there is anything inside. The cat MOANS.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roby is halfway into the pressure suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - LIFEBOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creature throws the catbox down. It clangs, and bounces. The thing picks it up again and hammers it against the wall. Then it jams it into a crevice in the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With one tentacle, it begins to pound the sealed catbox into the crevice. The cat has gone beyond hysterics.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - SPACESUIT LOCKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roby pulls on the helmet, latches it into place, then turns on the oxygen. With a hiss, the suit fills itself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a rack on the wall is a long metal rod with a blunt rubber tip. Roby peels the rubber off, revealing a sharp steel point.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again he raps on the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

The creature turns. It faces the locker, peers at him.

<DIRECTION>
The creature rises, but just in time to catch THE STEEL SHAFT RIGHT THROUGH ITS MIDRIFF.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IT MAKES A HORRIBLE NOISE AND CLUTCHES AT THE SPUR. The yellow acid begins to flow from the wound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before the acid can touch the floor, Roby reaches back and pulls a switch -- BLOWING THE REAR HATCH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a poof, the tiny atmosphere in the lifeboat is sucked out into space -- and the bleeding creature along with it. Roby grabs a steel strut to keep from being sucked out, but as the creature passes him IT WRAPS THE END OF A TENTACLE AROUND HIS ANKLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Roby is now hanging halfway out of the lifeboat, with the thing clinging to his leg. He kicks at it with his free foot, but it won't let go.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking for any salvation, Roby grabs the hatch control lever and yanks it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hatch slams shut, closing Roby safely inside but TRAPPING THE END OF THE CREATURE'S TENTACLE IN THE DOORJAMB.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It instantly releases Roby, who staggers back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

The creature is now outside the lifeboat, in the vacuum, squirming, the tip of its tentacle caught in the closed hatch.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where the tentacle is caught in the hatch, it is wounded, and is starting to foam with acid, eating away at the metal.

Roby stumbles forward to the controls and pushes a lever labeled:

The jet exhausts are located at the rear of the craft, right where the creature is wriggling. THE ENGINES BELCH FLAME FOR A FEW SECONDS, THEN SHUT OFF.

INCINERATED, THE CREATURE TUMBLES SLOWLY AWAY INTO SPACE.

Roby hurries to the rear hatch and looks out after the thing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR - OUTER SPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The burned mass of the monster drifts slowly away into space, a writhing, smoking, foaming mass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it tumbles into the distance, pieces drop off it -- it bloats -- then bursts, soggily, sending a spray of particles off in all directions. The last we see of it is a few smouldering rags, dwindling into infinity.
