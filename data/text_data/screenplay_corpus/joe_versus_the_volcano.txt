GREY SCREEN

The TITLE appears in white letters -

<DIRECTION>
JOE VERSUS THE VOLCANO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC. Borodin's "Polovtsian Dances," Chicago Symphony Orchestra, begins to play. The stormy part.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CREDITS ROLL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The credits have that depressing, shitty, this is going to be one of those lousy black and white movies from the 1950s look. This is going to be one of those cheap teen sci-fi movies about a creature
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC. When the female star's name appears, Borodin's theme, which will later become adapted into "Strangers In Paradise," plays. Then we return to the stormy part, which subsides as:

<DIRECTION>
The CREDITS END.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The following LEGEND appears on the field of grey:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"You only live twice. Once when you're born, Once when you look death in the face."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- James Bond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The LEGEND remains, but the field of grey turns to a rich texture of solid gold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC. "The Girl From Ipanema," sung by the likes of Tom Waits, sung like it was the Downest blues song anybody ever croaked out just before the final curtain. The MUSIC starts as the field turns from grey to gold. The MUSIC PLAYS ON.

EXT. AMERICAN PANASCOPE CORPORATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're in color now, but it's a grey world. It's an ugly building about the size of a city block and a couple of stories high. It's surrounded by hurricane fence topped with barbed wire. Outside the fence is a muddy parking lot. On the fence is a sign that reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AMERICAN PANASCOPE CORP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a subsidiary of
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACHI.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sign also has an abstract logo; a sort've German Expressionist's version of a lightning bolt. Another sign reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOME OF THE RECTAL PROBE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a grey winter's morning. It's raining or snowing or it just has or it's about to. There's a guard at a gate nodding workers inside the fence. They trail listlessly past him and continue on their way to the building's entrance. Most of them carry or are using grey or black umbrellas. Since they are coming from the parking lot, and since the entrance to the building is still almost a city block away once inside the fence, this straggling line of workers stretches hundreds of yards. Some of the workers wear hats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the line of workers FROM HIGH OVERHEAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The line is in the same shape as the lightning bolt logo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of these workers is JOE BANKS. Joe is in his early thirties. He's wearing a beat-up black trench coat; under the trench coat he's got on a cheap and square jacket and tie. This is a depressed man. You can see where he could be cool, where he could have something on the ball. But he's way too beaten down and depressed to be cool. Joe steps in a puddle. He pulls his shoe out of the water. He notices the sole is coming loose from the shoe. This depresses him further. He walks on. The sound of the WATER SQUISHING in his shoe can be heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PANASCOPE BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe is shuffling down the main walk in the building. On his left are doors leading to offices. On his right is the factory, which has the feel of an airplane hangar. The factory is separated from the walk on which Joe progresses by a heavy wire fence twelve feet high. Joe passes by a sign on this fence that says "Shipping." This area is filled with thousands of brown cardboard boxes; a shipping clerk among these boxes pulls a lever on a device; the device spews out several feet of wet brown tape. Joe continues on. He passes a sign on the fence that says "Canteen." This area contains a row of vending machines and two long tables; a guy who looks like he's going to die is sitting at one of the tables eating pink Hostess snowballs; he eats them in a slow, dismal way, as if they were giant sleeping pills. Joe continues on. He passes a sign on the fence that says "Quality Control." This is the biggest area; it's filled with workers in shower caps and worn white jackets; they work a distance apart from each other, at long tables; they are inspecting terrifying medical instruments. One of these workers, a middle-aged woman named Sally, attaches a catheter to an air pump. The catheter inflates and finally explodes. Sally seems satisfied. Joe continues on, his shoe distantly SQUISHING. He stops at one of the office doors on his left. The lettering on the door reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ADVERTISING DEPARTMENT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe opens the door and goes in. The SONG ENDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ADVERTISING DEPARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is lit with those totally draining, deadening fluorescent lights. DEDE, a secretary in her late twenties, is sitting at her desk, typing. She's pretty, maybe a little hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She types like an automatic weapon. Her makeup doesn't really work under these lights. She nods briefly to Joe, and goes on with her typing. Joe tries to hang up his hat, but it keeps falling off the hook. He is endlessly patient. It's the sound of the typewriter that makes him miss. At last he succeeds. Behind Dede, at a bigger desk, is MR. WATURI. He's leaning back in an executive chair, talking on the phone. He's middle-aged, olive skinned, in a dark suit that shows up his significant dandruff. His teeth are yellow as rancid butter. And there's enough grease shining on his forehead to coat a skillet. He's talking into the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<WATURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, Harry, but can he do the job? I know he can get the job, but can he do the job? I'm not arguing that with you. I'm not arguing that with you. I'm not arguing that with you
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATURI>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Waturi waves absently at Joe and goes on talking into the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<WATURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who told you that? No. I told you that. Me. What? Maybe. Maybe. Maybe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATURI>
<DIRECTION>
Joe hangs up his coat on the coat rack and goes to the coffee set-up at the rear of the office. He snaps a disposable plastic coffee cup into a permanent plastic holder. He puts a spoonful of instant coffee in the cup. Then a spoonful of powdered creamer. Then two spoonfuls of sugar. He takes a plastic stirrer and stirs the powders. He pours in the hot water and stirs. Little clumps of undissolved stuff rise to the top. Joe tries to break them up with the stirrer and partially succeeds. He feels the glands in his throat. Maybe they're a little swollen. He rubs his eyes. They're burning a little. He takes his coffee and walks past Mr. Waturi and into his own office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ADVERTISING LIBRARY - JOE'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same fluorescent lighting. There's a small wooden desk which has on it an old electric typewriter and an out-of-place lamp; it's a lamp Joe brought from home. The rest of the office is almost entirely taken up with grey industrial shelving. On these shelves are brochures depicting various medical instruments. Samples of each brochure are taped to the appropriate shelf. Behind Joe's desk is a pipe that runs floor-to-ceiling and is painted fire-engine red.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the center of this pipe is a big wheel valve. Hanging from this valve is a printed metal sign.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sign reads: THE MAIN DRAIN. Another sign reads: Do Not Touch. Joe turns on the lamp, which casts a small ring of golden light, and sits down with his coffee. He takes off his shoe and examines it. He tries to huddle close to the lamp, like a cold creature trying to get warm. Dede comes in.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, Dede.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DEDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Joe. What's with the shoe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEDE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm losing my sole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DEDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. How you doin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEDE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a little tired.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DEDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she hands him some labels)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here. Each one gets sent five catalogs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEDE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DEDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEDE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I only got twelve catalogs left altogether.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DEDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEDE>
<DIRECTION>
She leaves. Joe puts his shoe back on. Mr. Waturi comes in. Joe cowers. He's threatened by Mr. Waturi.
</DIRECTION>
<WATURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How you doin', Joe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATURI>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm not feeling very good, Mr. Waturi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Waturi chuckles.
</DIRECTION>
<WATURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what else is new? You never feel good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATURI>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Well. That's the problem. Anyway, I got the doctor's appointment today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<WATURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Another doctor's appointment?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATURI>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<WATURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Joe. What's this Dede tells me about the catalogs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATURI>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've only got twelve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<WATURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd you let us get down to twelve?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATURI>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<WATURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATURI>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three weeks ago. Then two weeks ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<WATURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you tell me last week?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATURI>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<WATURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATURI>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I thought you knew.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<WATURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not good enough, Joe! Not nearly good enough! I put you in charge of the entire advertising library...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATURI>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean, this room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<WATURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gave you carte blanche how to deal with the materials in here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATURI>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You put the orders into the printer, Mr. Waturi, not me. That's how you wanted it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<WATURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not competent to put the orders into the printer! That's a very technical...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATURI>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you were going to explain it to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<WATURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was going to do better than that. I was going to make you assistant manager. I want to make you assistant manager. But you, you're not flexible! You're inflexible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATURI>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't feel inflexible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<WATURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're inflexible. Totally. And this doctor appointment! You're always going to the doctor!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATURI>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't feel good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<WATURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what! Do you think I feel good? Nobody feels good. After childhood, it's a fact of life. I feel rotten. So what? I don't let it bother me. I don't let it interfere with my job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATURI>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want from me, Mr. Waturi?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<WATURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're like a child. What's this lamp for? Isn't there enough light in here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATURI>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These fluorescent lights affect me. They make me feel blotchy, puffy. I thought this light would...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<WATURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get rid of the light. This isn't your bedroom, this is an office. Maybe if you start treating this like a job instead of some kind of welfare hospital, you'll shape up. And I want those catalogs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATURI>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then please order them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<WATURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch yourself, Joe. Think about what I've said. You've gotta get yourself into a flexible frame or you're no place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATURI>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to leave, but stops and looks back.
</DIRECTION>
<WATURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take that light off your desk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATURI>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<WATURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it off now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATURI>
<DIRECTION>
Joe unplugs the light and takes it off his desk.
</DIRECTION>
<WATURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATURI>
<DIRECTION>
Waturi leaves. Joe sits at his desk, shrinking in the fluorescent light. He sips his coffee. The PHONE RINGS and he answers.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Advertising library. Fifty? I'm sorry, we don't have that many in stock. I don't know why. The catalog is a thing... I don't know. It's here and it's gone. I can't explain. It's a mystery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up the phone. Dede has quietly come in. She's looking at Joe. She speaks to him in a low voice.
</DIRECTION>
<DEDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you let Waturi talk to you like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEDE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DEDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEDE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't... feel very good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him. She's frustrated with this guy. This is somebody who she could go for, but he's just lying there like a dog waiting to be kicked. He looks at her. If he had the strength, if he were feeling a little better, he'd make a play for this woman. But he's helpless. He just doesn't feel very good. Absently, he feels the glands in his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DEDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEDE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at him. She's angry, frustrated. She turns and walks out. Joe's eyes are shining with tears that will not fall. He is powerless to help himself. He mutters to himself, fierce and impotent.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
He presses the heels of his hands into his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DOCTOR'S WAITING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We discover Joe with the heels of his hands pressed into his eyes. This room is fluorescently lit, too, and perhaps at first we don't realize we have gone somewhere else. A nurse's voice is heard.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Banks? Mr. Banks?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe, startled, takes his hands from his eyes. The CAMERA PULLS BACK and we see we're in a doctor's waiting room. And now we see the NURSE. She is a very conservative, W.A.S.P. Nurse .
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doctor Ellison will see you now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DR. ELLISON'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lighting in the doctor's office is the first warm, relaxing light we've seen. It comes from lamps and a little frosted window. The office itself is full of old wood and books. DR. ELLISON sits in a comfortable chair, at an old desk. He is the last word in doctors. He's a large, respectable, distinguished, greyed-haired M.D. He's a specialist. You get the feeling he may be a genius.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you feeling, Mr. Banks?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLISON>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty much the same. I feel puffy, blotchy. I never seem to have very much energy. I get these little sore throats. I just don't feel good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<ELLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And how long have you felt this way?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLISON>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. Pretty much since I left the Fire Department. On and off. But since then. 'Bout eight years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<ELLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you do in the Fire Department?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLISON>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, ah, you know, I put out fires.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<ELLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was it dangerous?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLISON>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Ahm, pretty rough stuff. But I came out of it okay. The hard part was not feeling good all the time. I started not feeling good all the time. So I hadda quit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Ellison nods.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I've gotten the results of your tests.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLISON>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got cancer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<ELLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLISON>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This new venereal...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<ELLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLISON>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there something wrong with my blood or urine or...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<ELLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, they're fine. But there is something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLISON>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<ELLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a brain cloud.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLISON>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A brain cloud.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<ELLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a black fog of tissue running right down the center of your brain. It's very rare. It will spread at a regular rate. It's very destructive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLISON>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it's incurable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<ELLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLISON>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<ELLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Six months. You can pretty much count on it being about that. It's not painful. Your brain will simply fail. Followed abruptly by your body. You can depend on at least four and half or five months of perfect health.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLISON>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what are you talking about, Doctor? I don't feel good right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<ELLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the ironic part, really. Mr. Banks, you're a hypochondriac. There's nothing wrong with you that has anything to do with your symptoms. My guess is your experiences in the Fire Department were extremely traumatic. You experienced the imminent possibility of death. Several times?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Joe nods numbly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You survived. But the cumulative anxiety of those brushes with death left you habitually fearful. About your physical person.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLISON>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sick? Except for this terminal disease?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<ELLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which has no symptoms. That's right. It was only because of your insistence on having so many tests that we happened to discover the problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLISON>
<DIRECTION>
Joe laughs, a little maniacally, then stops abruptly.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I going to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<ELLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if you have any savings you might think about taking a trip, a vacation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLISON>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have any savings. A few hundred bucks. I've spent everything on doctors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ELLISON Yes. Perhaps you'll want a second opinion?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A brain cloud. I knew it. Well, I didn't know it, but I knew it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<ELLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLISON>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I going to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<ELLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have some time left, Mr. Banks. You have some life left. My advice to you is: Live it well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLISON>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got to go. I'm on my lunch hour which is over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe gets up and Ellison follows suit, putting out his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLISON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry for what I had to tell you. I wish the news had been better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLISON>
<DIRECTION>
Joe doesn't take his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah .
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe leaves. Ellison starts to sit down. Joe comes back in.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry I didn't shake your hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe takes the doctor's hand and shakes it. Then he drops it and exits abruptly. Ellison sits there a moment, not moving. Then he opens a drawer in his desk and takes out
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a flask. He pours himself a drink and begins to drink it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MEDICAL LEAGUE BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is the building Ellison's office is in. Joe's car is parked out front. Joe comes slowly out. It's still overcast, but lighter and dryer than it was earlier. As Joe walks down the steps, an elderly woman approaches with her dog, Molly, a mutt. Joe sees the dog and stops, fixed on it. He pats the dog on the head. The elderly woman thinks this is nice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Joe embraces the dog, and kneeling down, hugs it intensely. The elderly woman is alarmed and pulls the dog away. Joe looks after them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he gets in his car, which is beat-up and beige. Drives off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AMERICAN PANASCOPE CORPORATION PARKING LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe drives INTO FRAME. He gets out and we FOLLOW him as he approaches the GUARD at the gate. The Guard nods him in. He starts to walk past. Then he goes back to the Guard.

<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your name?

Joe standing outside the door marked Advertising Dept. He is thoughtful. He goes in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ADVERTISING DEPARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe comes in. Dede is typing away. Mr. Waturi is on the phone. Joe hangs up his coat. He misses with the hat again because of Dede's typing. He leans over and switches the typewriter off. Then he picks up his hat, dusts it off and throws it in the garbage can.
</DIRECTION>
<WATURI>
<DIRECTION>
(on phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No. You were wrong. He was wrong. Who said that? I didn't say that. If I had said that, I would've been wrong. I would've been wrong, Harry, isn't that right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WATURI>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Waturi's attention is split between his call and Joe, who is walking around the office like a tourist.
</DIRECTION>
<WATURI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, let me call you back, I've got something here, okay? And don't tell him anything till we finish our conversation, okay?

INT. JOE'S OFFICE - DAY

Joe is staring at the big wheel valve sporting the sign that says Main Drain. Mr. Waturi comes in as Joe moves forward and, with great effort, rotates the wheel to its opposite extreme. This scares Waturi.
</DIRECTION>
<WATURI>

<DIRECTION>
He's been filling up a shopping bag with stuff from his desk: three books (Romeo and Juliet, Robinson Crusoe and The Odyssey), an old ukulele and his lamp. Now he's finished. He walks out of the room without even looking at Waturi. Waturi goes after him as he exits.

I've gone all day, every day, not doing, not saying, not taking the chance for three hundred bucks a week, and Frank the coffee stinks it's like arsenic, the lights give me a headache if the lights don't give you a headache you must be dead, let's arrange the funeral.

Whereupon the three guys with guitars arrive at the table and launch into an extremely passionate Castilian love song. The song makes conversation impossible. Joe pours Dede some more red wine. They toast, looking into each other's eyes. The scene ends, but the SONG CONTINUES through the following.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. SPANISH ROSE - NIGHT

Against a slightly tilting lamp post leans a sailor in uniform. Joe and Dede emerge from the restaurant and get in his beat-up car. The car pulls away. The SONG CONTINUES through the following.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. STATEN ISLAND FERRY - JOE'S CAR

	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.

She quickly goes, slamming the door after her. Joe looks after her blankly. Then he takes off his coat, tie and jacket, and throws them on the floor. He walks off down
</DIRECTION>

the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JOE'S KITCHEN - PREDAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe is making some real coffee. He's changed into bathrobe. He's got a little lamp on, not the overhead light. He opens the refrigerator and takes out a loaf of white bread. He puts a couple of slices in the toaster. Then he looks at his little tin dining table and at window. The window is so dirty it's opaque. You'd like to open it to see out. He pulls the table over to window. Then he pulls a chair over to face the window. The window looks out on a long little street. At the end of the street is a brightness, where the sun will be. He brings his coffee to the table, and a napkin, and a a spoon. He hears the TOAST POP. He gets it, puts it on a plate, butters it, and brings it to the table. He sits down. He takes a sip of coffee and a bite of toast. He 1ooks out the window. The sun is just starting to come up. He looks at the coffee, at the little whiff of steam rising from the cracked cup. The crack's in the shape of ACHI logo. He looks at the toast with one bite missing and the butter melting into the golden bread. He 1ooks at the sun's splendid red rim. These things are so beautiful. His eyes well up. He takes another bite of the toast and another sip of the coffee and looks at the rising sun. It's so great that he's here to experience these things, and so sad that he's leaving. He goes back to the refrigerator and takes out the loaf of bread. He puts a couple of more slices in the toaster and the almost full loaf of bread next to the almost full pot of coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JOE'S KITCHEN - MORNING (COUPLE OF HOURS LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The loaf of bread is almost gone and the pot of coffee is empty. Now we PULL BACK and see Joe sitting by the window with his feet up, some crusts of toast lying on the plate next to him. The sun has risen a goodly bit, and can no longer be seen by us. But Joe is dappled with sunlight. He is no longer in the thrall of a big emotion, but he is extremely deep in the thought. The DOORBELL RINGS. Joe doesn't move. It RINGS AGAIN. Did he hear the doorbell? It RINGS AGAIN. He is now satisfied the doorbell is ringing. He gets up and out into the foyer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JOE'S FOYER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DOORBELL starts to RING AGAIN as Joe opens the door. In the hallway is a powerful, glittering-eyed old man of seventy, MR. GRAYNAMORE. He's wearing a long, black cashmere overcoat, a dramatic but not silly black fedora, and cowboy boots. He carries a vacuum-sealed can of Planter's Peanuts in his pocket. He's got a cane with a duck's head.

Graynamore strides past Joe into Joe's living room. Joe looks after, in a bit of a daze. Then he follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JOE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's modest, to say the least. It's messy and cheaply furnished. An enormous crack runs up the wall and across the ceiling. Graynamore takes the room in.

	Not a nice place you have here, Joe. Mind if I call you Joe?

</GRAYNAMORE>
<DIRECTION>
He rips off his coat with gusto and tosses it away. He sings a little of "Someone's in the Kitchen With Dinah."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's a rich man, from out West, and that's what his clothes look like. He seems to be enjoying himself very much. He sticks out his hand to Joe.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAYNAMORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see it as a sign of tremendous sophistication that you haven't demanded my name or asked me what I'm doing here. My name is Samuel Harvey Graynamore.

Joe nods.

Joe shakes his head. Graynamore produces a pipe.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAYNAMORE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Joe jumps up.

Joe pulls a bottle of cheap scotch out of a cabinet, along with two glasses. He pours them both a drink and sits down. Graynamore downs his whiskey which makes his eyes glitter all the more. He leans forward and speaks with great intensity.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAYNAMORE>

	There's an island in the South Pacific called Waponi Woo. The name means 'The Little Island With the Big Volcano.' The Waponis are a cheerful people who live a simple existence fishing in the lagoon and picking fruit. They have one fear. That's a big volcano, they call it The Big Woo. They believe an angry fire god in the volcano will sink the island unless, once every hundred years, he is appeased. It's been ninety-nine years, eleven months, and eleven days since the fire god got his propers and the Waponis are scared.

	Of his own free will, a man's got to jump into the volcano. Now as you might imagine, none of the Waponis are anxious to volunteer for the honor of jumping into the Big Woo. And the problem is that whoever does it gotta do it of his own free will so what do you do?

Graynamore gets up and starts to move around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAYNAMORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do some tradin'. There's a mineral on that island, Mr. Banks. It's called bubureau. I don't know anywhere else on the planet where you can find more than a gram of this stuff, and believe me I've looked. Because without bubureau I can't make my superconductors. I've tried to get the mineral rights from the Waponis, but I don't seem to have anything they want. But they do want a hero, Mr. Banks. And they'll give me the mineral rights if I find them one.

	<DIALOGUE>
	This is our premier steamer trunk. All handmade, only the finest materials. It's even water-tight, tight as a drum. If I had the need and the wherewithal, Mr. Banks, this would be my trunk of choice. I could face the world with a trunk like this by my side.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIN RESTAURANT IN THE PIERRE HOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is an incredibly beautiful, quiet restaurant. Joe's discovered, sitting alone at a table. The Pierre waiter is just walking away. Joe's sipping a glass of wine, his entree before him. The MUSIC CONTINUES through next.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CENTRAL PARK SOUTH - JOE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walking along. As he approaches The Plaza, two cabs pull up and eight theatregoers from out of town disembark. They are all middle-aged, wearing their best clothes, having a good time. They cross in front of Joe on their way into the hotel. He watches them go by and disappear. It makes him smile and it makes him feel alone. He goes on. The MUSIC CONTINUES through next.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE WINDOW - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe walks by and stops, struck by the contents of the win dow. It's a female dummy, dressed as Patricia will be on the yacht. Behind the dummy is a photo mural of the yacht.

<DIRECTION>
INT. TUESDAY'S (JAZZ BAR) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We've arrived at the place where the music is coming from. Joe sits at a little table listening to a good jazz quartet. They are a pasty-faced English quartet. Everyone in the club is black except Joe, the bartender and the band, which is playing "Do You Know The Way to San Jose." Everyone is drinking martinis. They form a straight line down the bar each with a giant green olive in it. Joe finishes a martini and waves for the check. The MUSIC CONTINUES through the next.

<DIRECTION>
INT. AMERICAN FLIGHT - FIRST CLASS CABIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the flight to L.A. Joe is sitting on the aisle. Next to him is a grey-haired, wholesome priest named FATHER CONROY. The clergyman is most way through a drink, wrapped up in his own thoughts. Joe is deeply aware that he's sitting next to a priest; he's uneasy, shifting in his chair. The STEWARDESS notices Joe and approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<STEWARDESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I get you anything, sir?

	I'm sure there are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_CONVOY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I've come to a place in my life where I've come face to face with the facts of life and death. I mean, it's a chance happening I'm alive, it's a miracle, I'm so lucky! And it's not going to last. It's like a shooting star. So beautiful, so fleeting, make a wish before it's gone, you know? I'm so moved. But cut off. If there is a God, if there is some kind of music going through everything, I can't hear it. I'm alone. I really feel I'm alone. I'm walking down this little path by myself.

	Can you help me?

<FATHER_CONROY>

	Do you see an analyst of some kind?

Inspirational light shines through the cabin window.

<FATHER_CONROY>

INT. L.A. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe and his fellow travellers are just entering the terminal proper. A commercial airplane presses its nose inquisitively against a visible window. It is surrounded by orange trees. Joe is surrounded by blond California guys as he gets off the plane. We see a homemade banner "Welcome to L.A. St. Dymphna's Girls Academy." Of the six people waiting, five of them look like Brezhnev. The sixth is ANGELICA, she is holding aloft a sign which reads "JOSEPH BANKS." She looks like Dede. Joe does a take, he goes to her. Several Catholic school girls run by.

	No, that's not true. I don't know why I'm telling you.

Inspired by him, she hesitates on the brink of courage. For a moment she finds it and lifts her hands to say "yes," but her courage fails her. She gets a chill.

She starts up the car.

Suddenly, she's very angry.
</DIRECTION>
<ANGELICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I do! This is one of those typical conversations where we're all open and sharing our innermost thoughts and it's all bullshit and a lie and it doesn't cost you anything!

<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. I don't know you. I don't think I know anybody. You're angry. I can see that.

JOE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Joe making his way through some greenery. He parts some tall grass, and we see what he sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH AND OCEAN - JOE'S POV - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A couple of stars vaguely twinkle overhead. There's the DULL BOOM of the SURF.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWN WHERE BEACH MEETS OCEAN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe arrives at this spot and sits down in the sand. He looks out at the ocean, at the horizon, where the night presses down on the water. Time passes. The sky gets lighter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The VAGUE beginnings of something MAGICAL and very, very big are heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A band of golden light hits Joe in the back of the head. He turns around and it's in his eyes. We see the fake sun rising over a row of palm trees. Just a touch of red on the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MAGICAL MUSIC CEASES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the sun continues to rise. And rise. Until it clears the horizon and is a discreet orange-blue disk in the morning sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUNNY RESTAURANT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun turns into an orange-yellow yolk of a sunnyside- up egg. The CAMERA PULLS BACK. Joe and Angelica are eating breakfast. Joe is dressed like Jungle Jim.
</DIRECTION>
<ANGELICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so tired. You take that stuff, it just ruins your sleep. I'm sorry I was so abusive, immature, hostile, and needy last night.

<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were fine.

<ANGELICA>

	You think this is inappropriate? For the boat?

</JOE>
<ANGELICA>

	No, it's fine. We'd better get going. I gotta guy dropping your trunks off at the marina who may not have understood my travel directions.

They get up to go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BIG MARINA - MANY BOATS LIKE RESTLESS HORSES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the end of a long narrow dock is a yacht about 7 feet long. It dwarfs all the other vessels. We hear a CAR DOOR SLAM and hear Angelica.
</DIRECTION>
<ANGELICA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here we are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELICA>
<DIRECTION>
Now we see Angelica and Joe approach the dock and start walking down it. We see them FROM the back and hear them talking.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that it?

</JOE>
<ANGELICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.

</ANGELICA>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's big.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
They approach the yacht, which is called The Tweedle Dee. It has on its hull a single arrogant eye that looks haughtily at Joe. On the dock by the yacht are the four steamer trunks. Sitting on a piling, staring balefully at the trunks is a magnificent, athletic, truly feminine, blonde, blue-eyed woman in her late twenties. This is PATRICIA. On The Tweedle Dee two boat boys, MIKE and TONY, ready the yacht for departure; they are young and shining and strong. Joe and Angelica arrive at the slip. Patricia looks just like Dede and Angelica. Joe does a take.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>

	Alright. Joe. Get ready. We're leaving.

Joe turns to Angelica and speaks to her privately.

He takes her hand and gives her a little kiss on the cheek. She notes his hand. She's puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<ANGELICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're shaking.

He smiles, examining his hand.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
He runs up the gangway. Patricia has already boarded the boat. The boat boys are casting off. Patricia takes the wheel. But we are still WITH Angelica on the dock. She stands there. Slowly, as the yacht pulls away, she waves. Joe stands at the railing, the sails still furled behind him. He waves back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we are WITH Joe on the yacht, at the railing. He waves a little, and then his eyes rove the shore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOE'S POV - SHORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe looks at the flag on the stern of The Tweedle Dee. He looks up from the flag at his departing homeland. A ghost image of the flag follows his glance up so that he sees the following through that image. He sees Angelica on the dock, and then the boats behind her, and then the parking lot behind that. And then the hills in the distance off to his left. And the rich people's houses off to his right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And cars on roads. And a smokestack. He sees all this through the ghost image of that American flag. He sees his homeland. Receding. He's leaving his homeland. He will never see it again. And now we see again:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOE - AT RAIL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Staring, moved, determined. His clothes are a bit much, but he almost fills them in this moment. A wind comes up and sweeps his safari hat off his head, into the ocean. He flinches slightly at the loss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
swirling away into the wake. But now we see again:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And after a glance, he gives up the hat without regret. He continues to look after the receding land. Without the hat he looks great. His hair blows in the wind and he stares and stares.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. YACHT - FROM FEW HUNDRED YARDS AWAY - DAY

The Tweedle Dee has cleared the harbor and the boat boys have started unfurling the sails. The huge, snowy sails fill with a rich wind.

<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever been there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<PATRICIA>

	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	they were returning to Rome, they sailed deep into the South Pacific, and finally ended by colonizing a lightly populated, Polynesian island
	</DIALOGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	which they named Waponi Woo. Thus was born the Waponi culture - a mixture of Polynesian, Celtic, Hebrew and Latin influences. The Waponis are known throughout Polynesia as having a peculiar love of orange soda and no sense of direction.

<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why'd you talk to me so snotty back on the dock?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<PATRICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because you work for my father. And I'm angry with my father. But he's not around to give him a shot. So you work for him, I give you a shot.

</PATRICIA>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why you angry with him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<PATRICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because he's never around.

	If you're angry with him, and he's never around, why are you working for him?
	</DIALOGUE>

She goes to the entranceway and fingers a switch on the wall.

<PATRICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love my sister. I know she's screwed up. I love my father, even though I never see him and he's not so great when I do see him. I'm very nervous about this trip. My father didn't tell me anything and you don't seem to be telling me anything. But it's more than that. I've always kept clear of my father's stuff since I got out on my own. Now he's pulled me back in. He knew I wanted this boat and he used it and he got me working for him, which I swore I would never do. I feel ashamed because I had a price. He named it. And now I know that about myself. I don't know who you are. I don't know anything about you. But you're working for him, too, and that makes us two of a kind. I could treat you like I did back on the dock, but that would be me kicking myself for selling out. Which isn't fair to you and doesn't make me feel any better. I don't know what your situation is. But I wanted you to know what mine is. Not just to explain some rude behavior. But because we're on a little boat for a while and I'm soul sick and you're gonna see that. Like my sister. She's soul sick, too. And if you'd slept with her I would've known something about you. But you didn't. You didn't. I believe you.

It's a really beautiful sunny day. Tony is at the wheel, the sails are full and, sitting in two chairs hard by the stern are Joe and Patricia. They both are holding deep sea fishing rods; they're trolling.

<DIRECTION>
MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"The Girl From Ipanema," the famous recording by Getz and Gilberto, is playing now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Patricia reels in her line. A beautiful fish is flapping on the end of it. Joe reels in his line. Nothing. He watches as Patricia unhooks her catch and tosses it in a hamper. Dagmar appears, looks in the hamper, and nods approvingly. Then she looks at Joe. Where's Joe's fish? Then he walks away again. Joe casts again, while Patricia rebates her hook. Then Patricia casts again. Mike arrives with a beer for Patricia, who accepts it. Mike leaves. Patricia gets another strike, asks Joe to hold her beer, which he does. She reels in another beautiful fish. She unhooks it and throws it in the hamper. Dagmar appears, looks in the hamper, nods approvingly, and then looks at Joe. Where's Joe's fish? Joe looks at Dagmar, and then ignores her. Dagmar departs. Joe goes back to fishing. Now Joe gets a strike. It's a big one! The line goes burning out his reel. Patricia notices. She offers to help him. He waves her off. Dagmar appears. She offers some advice. But Joe's completely focused on his rod. The rod, which is substantial, starts to bend. Mike comes back to watch. The rod is almost bent double. Then it goes madly to the left. Offers of help are made, but Joe shouts them back. Then the rod goes madly to the right. Dagmar runs OUT OF VIEW, and reappears with an enormous gaff, which she brandishes excitedly. A sudden powerful tug almost pulls Joe off the back of the boat, but Mike grabs him just in time. Joe is a man possessed. He reels and pulls with superhuman determination. Without warning, a huge head, the head of a hammerhead shark, appears at the stern. Its eyes turn inboard and look at Joe. Everybody drops everything and runs away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DINING TABLE - TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun has just sunk beneath the horizon's rim so there's still all that sun setting light in the sky. The first evening star has appeared. Joe and Patricia are the last left at the dinner's end. The bones of the fish Patricia caught earlier are on a platter at the table's center. Mike appears and removes the platter and a couple of stray plates, and disappears into the galley. There are balloon glasses by Joe and Patricia's places and, by Patricia, a bottle of cognac.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you like cognac?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICIA>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cognac?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<PATRICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICIA>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<PATRICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I make a point of not knowing about certain things. One of them's cognac. I like cognac. But I don't want the accepted wisdom about cognac, you know what I mean? I mean I want glimpses of the myth about it. You see people drink it out of these big glasses, and smelling it forever. That's interesting to me, that sight of them doing that. But I don't want them to talk to me about it, you know what I mean? I want to figure it out based on what I've seen from other people, and what I personally get from it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICIA>
<DIRECTION>
She opens the bottle and pours them both some.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So this is what I've got. So far. To say about this: Most cognac is French. It's very volatile. Like gasoline or model airplane glue. And when you taste it, in my opinion, it tastes like gasoline or model airplane glue. That's because it's for smelling really. And I figure that's because the French, physically, tend to have big noses. They get the pleasure of the cognac through the nose. You could really just smell it and pour it down the sink. But this isn't French cognac. This is Italian cognac. It's probably generally considered inferior. But the news is, it tastes good. Maybe it doesn't smell as good -- it smells okay - but it tastes good. And when I came to that fork in the road, between the nose and the tongue, I chose the tongue. So, here's to the tongue.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They toast.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To the tongue.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They drink a little.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's good. Don't the Italians have big noses, too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<PATRICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. And that really messes up my theory.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICIA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE TWEEDLE DEE - NIGHT (HOUR AND A HALF LATER)
</DIRECTION>

We see it bobbing gently on the sea. Many stars are coming out, some waxing quite bright. A half moon, pale and small, hangs in the western sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DINING TABLE ABOARD BOAT - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Joe and Patricia have been talking and sipping cognac for an hour and a half. Patricia is quite mellow, as is Joe.

	So my understanding, as far as I understand it, is I'm leaving you on this island.

	I have confidence in myself.

	I've done a lot of soul searching lately. I've been asking myself some tough questions. You know what I've found out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<PATRICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICIA>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no interest in myself. I think about myself, I get bored out of my mind.

</JOE>
<PATRICIA>

She pours them both a drink.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, up till now I've lived on a tiny island called Staten Island, and I've commuted to a job in a shut up room with pumped in air, no sunshine, despicable people, and now that I've got some distance from that situation, that seems pretty unbelievable. Your life seems unbelievable to me. All this like life, seems unbelievable to me. Somewhat. At this moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<PATRICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father says almost the whole world's asleep. Everybody you know, everybody you see, everybody you talk to. He says only a few people are awake. And they live in a state of constant total amazement.

They think about that for a while.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have less than six months to live. The Waponis believe they need a human sacrifice or their island's going to sink into the ocean. They have a mineral your father wants. He's hired me to jump in their volcano.

INT. THE TWEEDLE DEE - SLEEPING BERTHS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe enters, undresses to his new underwear, and climbs into the berth. Then he remembers the light, gets up, turns it off, and climbs back into his berth. It's dark. We see his face. He thinks for a moment, and then goes to sleep. And he has a dream.

Everything goes dead black. There is the sound of WIND. Then Joe's face suddenly lifts up out of the dream into a CLOSEUP. Startled, he bangs his head. He has awakened from his dream.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GALLEY AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Patricia is trying to get the weather on the RADIO, but there's nothing but STATIC. She puts on a set of headphones and adjusts the dial again; the radio is silent now, only she can hear it. Joe comes into the galley, his hair still rumpled from sleeping on it
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Little weird today, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>

Patricia waves for him to be quiet. She listens at the phones another moment, adjusting the dial. She hears something. She's glad. She listens. Her face darkens. She tears off the phones angrily.

Dagmar appears in the hatchway. She greets Joe.

There's too much play in it. It's swinging from side to side. If it swings much longer, it's going to snap its stays.

Joe and Patricia pinned against the wall. The rain pouring over their faces. They are close, looking at each other, panting, illuminated by lightning.

They are thrown toward the boom again.
</DIRECTION>

BOOM

<DIRECTION>
At this moment, the boom breaks free. Joe has fallen to the deck, while Patricia is still standing.

The boom swings over Joe and slams into Patricia, knocking her unconscious and into the raging sea. Joe stands up and, still holding the coil of rope, dives into the ocean after her. A SLOW-MO stylized leap.

ANOTHER ANGLE - TWENTY MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe with three trunks tied together. He is easing Patricia's unconscious form on to the three ganged- together trunks. Having accomplished this, he slides the fourth trunk into position with the other three and begins to secure it with the remaining rope. The four trunks together make up a raft of ten feet square. Joe crawls onto the raft, totally exhausted, reaches out a hand to the still form of Patricia, and passes out. The fog begins to thin. A few shafts of sunlight dapple the raft.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. LITTLE RAFT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The little raft in bright, fresh sunlight. Joe stirs and wakes. He tries to wake Patricia, but to no avail. He looks in all directions. Nothing but blue horizon. After a moment's thought, he opens one of the trunks. But it's the wrong one. He secures it and opens another. He takes out a violin case and opens it; it's a bar masquerading as a violin case, the one he bought at Hammacher Schlemmer. It contains two bottles of Moet champagne, two champagne glasses and two bottles of Pellegrino water. Joe takes out one of the bottles of water and closes the case. Then he gets his little world-band radio out of the trunk and sets it down. He opens the Pellegrino water and starts to drink. But then he thinks. He looks at Patricia. Her lips are a little parched. He looks up at the sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOE'S POV - SUN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun looks kind of powerful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looks again at the bottle of water. He decides not to drink any. He pours a little into the bottle cap, and presses the cap to Patricia's lips. He repeats the process and then, satisfied, screws the cap on the bottle again and puts it away in the case. Then he puts the case back in the trunk and fastens the lid. He turns ON the RADIO. STATIC. Turns the dial. The VOICE of a GERMAN ANNOUNCER speaks confidentially. Joe turns the dial. A JAPANESE ANNOUNCER's VOICE solemnly intones a short statement in Japanese ending with "Elton John." Joe immediately switches the station. The song "Goodbye Cruel World" begins to play. Joe sits listening for what seems a long time.

Joe is discovered with his ukulele, looking at the sky. He is staring at the millions of stars overhead. He is full of wonder. He is singing. He is singing "The Cowboy Song."

Joe is chipping golf balls on his Hammacher Schlemmer practice green. Occasionally making a shot, occasionally hitting one into the water. One of the golf balls gets tossed back onto the raft. Joe looks. There is a mischievous DOLPHIN who LAUGHS and then submerges.

JOE SITTING ON RAFT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe is listening to the radio. A Hawaiian disk jockey comes on. His name is PETE.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is K.R.U., Honolulu, speakin' ta ya from the shadow of the Koolau Mountains. And here's one that was a hit when I was a kid. Sukiyaki.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETE>
<DIRECTION>
The song "Sukiyaki," which became a pop hit in America, even though it's sung in Japanese, begins to play. Joe is satisfied and lies back to listen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LITTLE RAFT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Radio is off. Joe is trying out his aquatic shoes. Just trying his first tentative steps, he accidentally punctures one of his shoes so it deflates. He topples over to one side. He swims back to the raft, abandoning his shoes. He turns the RADIO ON, but it's only giving out a little STATIC now. He checks on Patricia, but gets no response. He tries to get something on the radio, but the batteries are too weak now. He turns it OFF. He notices he's sweating. He shifts, knocking the radio in the ocean. Irritated, he looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOE'S POV - SUN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun looms down, hot and white and huge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looks at the sun with concern. He gets out the violin case. He gets the water out and fills the cap and ministers to Patricia. His lips are parched, but he takes none for himself. He takes off his now well- seasoned safari jacket and puts it over Patricia, to protect her from the sun. We hear a sound, like the HISS of something being SEARED in a SKILLET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LITTLE RAFT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again, the sky is ablaze with stars. They're even brighter than previously. Joe is looking at them. He's shaking. He's got a fever. He closes his eyes and then opens them again. He looks at the stars again. And shakes his head in disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOE'S FEVERED POV - STARS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What's this? the stars are all connected together with little pale blue lines, and over that are boldly visible the astrological signs: The Flying Horse, The Archer, The Twins, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shakes his head, bewildered and amazed. He blinks and looks again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOE'S POV - STARRY NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All of the lines and pictures are gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looks and looks. But no, they are gone. It's just a starry night. He relaxes, closes his eyes, and quakes with fever.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LITTLE RAFT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe, very ill with fever, checks the water supply. There's a little less than half a bottle of water left. His lips are deeply cracked. But still he takes no water for himself. He looks up at the sun. The sound of SIZZLING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun burns down, bright and big.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pours a capful of water and gives it to Patricia. She is still unconscious, but she looks pretty good. It's Joe that's really going down the tubes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LITTLE RAFT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We come in on Joe's face. Joe quakes with fever. Then he sees something. Joe is entranced by what he sees.

JOE'S POV - NIGHT SKY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The astrological signs have appeared in the sky again as they did the night before.

stares. He's half mad with fever. What is he seeing?
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOE'S POV - NIGHT SKY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dome of astrological signs begins to rotate from horizon to horizon so that the full panoply of the ancient mythology is revealed.

<DIRECTION>
JOE

<DIRECTION>
is frightened, moved. His eyes fill with tears.

The sky has returned to its ordinary self.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
wonders if he really saw the astrological signs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LITTLE RAFT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another scorching day under the sun. Joe looks very bad. He's got a fever. He's slowly dying of thirst. He gets out the bottle, gives a capful to the still unconscious Patricia, and then looks at the water level. There's a quarter of a bottle left. He puts the bottle away. He crawls to the raft's edge and plunges his head in the sea. A dolphin sticks his head out of the water and looks at Joe. Joe lifts his head out of the water and finds himself looking at a dolphin who is looking at him. Man and fish are just a few feet apart. They regard each other.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>

The Dolphin disappears back beneath the water. Joe lowers his head and lies still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LITTLE RAFT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again, it is a great starry night. Joe, weak and sick and bleary-eyed, looks up at the stars. He closes his eyes. He opens them again. Again, he is astonished.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOE'S POV - HEAVENS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the lines and astrological signs are back, brilliant and splendid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rouses himself, crawling to his knees to look. He stares in utter wonder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The signs begin to rotate again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Earlier, in L.A. Joe stared at the horizon, just before dawn, and big, magical music began to play. But then it stopped prematurely. That MUSIC begins to play now, but this time it does not stop. It's the big, dramatic pas de deux music from "The Nutcracker."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The astrological signs melt away into Disney dust as a light appears at the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE ON HORIZON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A light appears at the horizon's edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ENORMOUS MOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
with slow majesty rises from the glittering sea, directly to Joe's front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe and his little raft are utterly dwarfed by this great heavenly body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOE ON HIS RAFT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Though he is on the verge of utter collapse he is so moved by what he sees he clambers his way to his shaky feet and raises his arms over his head in complete reverence. He is dwarfed. He's a bug. The raft is a mote in the eye of God. Joe is deeply moved, humbled, awestruck. The moon continues to ascend up and up and out of view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe looks at the stars that are simply stars. Sinking to his knees, he presses his hands to his breast.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dear God, whose name I do not know, thank you for my life. I forgot how big... Thank you for my life

<DIRECTION>
Joe slowly crumbles, physically crumbles from thirst and fever and exhaustion. His eyes dim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOE'S POV - STARS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We watch the stars DISSOLVE, and BLACKNESS closes in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the blackness starts to FADE, become rosy. We hear the sound of LABORED BREATHING. WATER being POURED. Someone COUGHING a little, CHOKING a little, and then recovering. Then we hear Patricia's voice.

He sips from this with great relish. Then he spots something with the telescope. It's the raft! He carefully puts down his soda, cups his hands, and lets out with a mighty formal cry.

Outrigger canoes lay along the shore. The EXCITED CRIES of running NATIVES are heard approaching. And now we see them. It's the Waponis! They are a motley lot, used to the good life. They sport big orange dots on their fore heads. They carry fruit, garlands of flowers, and cans of Jump. They leap into their canoes and head out toward the raft. Their eyes are enhanced with liner.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess they're glad to see us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICIA>
<DIRECTION>
They're both handed cans of Jump. Natives grab the pop tops with their teeth and rip them off, smiling. Joe and Patricia drink from the cans of Jump. All the natives cheer. Then hands reach out and pull them gently off their raft and into the canoes. Another canoe's occupants get a grass rope and tie it to the raft. Now we see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOLE FLOTILLA OF CANOES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe and Patricia, and the whole welcoming group, covered with flowers and drinking Jump, head for the island. With the raft of trunks in tow. The welcoming group, led by Baw, sing a Polynesian "Song of Happiness."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHORE OF ISLAND - DAY
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Two guys hoisting an enormous spool of homemade red carpet on a wooden yoke lead the way into the jungle providing the "Red Carpet Treatment."
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
The red carpet unrollers run through a stretch of Jungle. Through a thin veil of greenery we see unrollers pass by us on a jungle path. After a second they are followed by Joe and Patricia and the full happy entourage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CENTER OF VILLAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Exhausted, our carpet men, their spindle all but spent, stumble into the village's center. Their carpet reaches its tail. They drop to the ground, gasping and proud. The welcoming group arrives with Patricia and Joe and the whole village turns out and goes nuts. Some of them carry ducks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then from the biggest hut emerges the CHIEF. Instantly, everything stops and all the natives are lying face down on the ground, utterly silent. Only Joe and Patricia are left standing to face the Chief. The Chief is a big, impressive man with grey hair and in totally traditional native costume. Most of the other natives have some element of Western dress about their person. The Chief has a sad, rich voice, a voice full of memory and knowledge. He holds a tiki teddy bear. It has atrophied little arms and legs; its hair is standing on end.

EXT. CLEARING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
which has been set up to clean Joe. What can only be described as a giant bassinet made out of beautiful, soft greenery has been set up in the clearing, along with many coconut bowls. Into this a violently protesting Joe, stark naked, is being pressed by the laughing native men. They dump many bowls of water over him while he desperately tries to hide his genitals, first with his hands, and then by turning face down in the bassinet. Then the men take mounds of fresh fruit that has been cut up and rub it into Joe's flesh. Then six of the native men produce big shining fish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They hold these fish by the tails. Other men hold Joe still. Then the men rhythmically beat Joe with the fish. They hum to keep time. They are giving him a massage. At first he reacts by screaming, but then he starts to groan, as one does from an important massage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CLEARING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the natives holds forward a tray covered with a thin blue material. Joe looks at it with interest. The native gently, physically closes Joe's eyes, then blows the contents of the tray, a thin, bright blue powder directly into Joe's face. Joe opens his eyes, a wiser man. They lick the powder off his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
169 EXT. CLEARING - DAY (WHILE LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are dousing Joe with water again, only he's sitting up now, eating a piece of fruit. Emo, the lookout, offers him a Jump, but Joe shakes his head. Emo looks amazed and comments to the others in a low voice, in another language. Their reply to Emo's comment is a low Whoa!; they are incredulous. Then they go back to dousing Joe. He likes this treatment by now. Then a look of concern passes over his face and he looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
The two natives look at him blankly, and go back to what they're doing. Joe accepts it. Another native is massaging his scalp, adding a little oil to Joe's hair. The native combs the hair with his fingers. Joe's starting to look like his old self. Something on the edge of the clearing catches his eye.

Baw comes into the playing area, a half-moon circle of natives. He clicks the sticks of his fingers. He looks side-to-side, sternly, with his hands on his hips and cries out.

This is the cue for the story-telling MUSIC to begin. Baw does a little Waponi dance in a tight circle, as he recites.

He appears at the top of a grand staircase. He descends (as the MUSIC resumes).

The crowd faces him and cheers, as they turn with him as he walks across to the Chief and stands before him.

Joe and Patricia have been talking across the Chief, who sits between them. Now a groaning native, holding his jaw, comes forward and, after prostrating himself, speaks excitedly to the Chief, addressing him as Tobi, and continuing in another language. The Chief listens and then waves him away. The groaning native departs.

<CHIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe Banks. We are the children of children and we live as we are shown. Now a change has come. The Waponis like this soda, and no one among my people will jump into the Big Woo. They trade with this man, your father, for a hero. We have no hero-of our own. So we give this man the right to dig holes in the ground under us like the Jump digs holes in our teeth and in some short time we will be nothing but holes. I am the Tobi. I cannot be the hero. It is my place to hope for my people. But the Woo calls and no one from among my people says, I will go to my end for the rest of you. Joe Banks. We are not your people. Let us die. Take a boat and your woman and go to that no good island over there.

The Waponis slowly get up, shamefaced. The Chief sits. He speaks to Joe and Patricia.

Natives cheer. They form an aisle again, leading off in the direction of the Big Woo. Flaming torches dot the aisle. The natives start the same call and response they had going when Joe's raft was first sighted. Emo calls and the natives respond. This call and response continues through all the following. Joe walks off, down the aisle. The Chief follows him. Before Patricia can follow the Chief, the crowd closes in, following Joe up the mountain. Patricia tries to reach Joe.

EXT. FOOT OF TRAIL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A head torch man leads the way up the mountain path. He carries a heavy, lit torch that he swings from side to side with a ritual motion. With each swing he lights another permanent tiki sconce along the path's upward progress. He is followed by Joe, dapper and alone. Joe in turn is followed by the Chief, who walks with a ritual movement, not unlike the bent-kneed gait of a Sumo wrestler, leaning first on one leg then on the other. He is assisted in this gyration by two lackeys, one to his left, one to his right, who catch him as he leans to his most extreme angle and gently shoves him back the other way. Behind the Chief, comes the general native population all of whom carry torches.

EXT. SIDE OF BIG WOO - TRAIL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flaming torches now delineate the trail up the mountain. The line they describe looks very like a German expressionist version of a lightning bolt. The Big Woo is RUMBLING more and more. The whole sky over the mountain is suffused with red.

They are silent and solemn and focussed. They arrive at a spot just below the rim of the volcano. There is a little well worn trail leading from they stand to where the rim.

Joe nods. Patricia breaks through the crowd and throws herself at Joe's feet. She's sobbing.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do it! Please don't do it, Joe! I love you! I've fallen in love with you! I've never loved anybody! I don't know how it happened! And I've never even slept with you or anything and now you're going to kill yourself!

<DIRECTION>
Joe kisses her, waves to the Chief, and starts to walk up the little path. The natives are silent, staring. The Chief is sad. Patricia is rooted, staring after him, stricken. When Joe has just about reached the summit, Patricia wakes from her trance, and bolts up the little path after him.

EXT. UNDERSIDE OF PLATFORM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Throughout the following, occasionally we CUT TO a carved wooden figure of an alarmed but committed little man, who is under the platform holding it up. Of course, he's actually an inanimate strut, but as his little knees quake ever more violently under the platform's oppressive weight, we fear for the moment when he and therefore the platform on which Joe and Patricia stand will give way and fall into the volcano.

Graynamore is watching the island sink through a telescope. Meanwhile, two boat boys wrap Patricia and Joe in blankets. Graynamore, oddly calm and detached, given the circumstances, looks away from the eyepiece of the telescope. He says to no one in particular.

<GRAYNAMORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There goes my dream of beating the shit out of the competition.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAYNAMORE>
<PATRICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICIA>
<DIRECTION>
Graynamore ignores her. During this scene the island is slowly sinking in the b.g.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAYNAMORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You kept your bargain, Mr. Banks. To the letter. The miracle of course is that you kept the bargain and you're alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAYNAMORE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what? My number's about up one way or the other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<GRAYNAMORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAYNAMORE>
<DIRECTION>
He's a trifle uneasy.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICIA>
<GRAYNAMORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you were dead, young lady. I thought you drowned. Both of you for that matter. I just got here to see what kind of alternate deal I could cut with the Chief. But the Chief, I'm afraid, is history.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAYNAMORE>
<PATRICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't show any sign of being glad I'm alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICIA>
<GRAYNAMORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm glad. I'm just disappointed about losing these mineral rights. It meant a lot to me. It was a real opportunity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAYNAMORE>
<PATRICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are so... full of holes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICIA>
<DIRECTION>
Graynamore looks at her, a little irritated and puzzled. But then his attention shifts to Joe.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAYNAMORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a small boat, Mr. Banks. Too small to keep a big secret all the way back to L.A. Come out, Kenneth!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAYNAMORE>
<DIRECTION>
Kenneth emerges from the shadows where he's been skulking. It's Dr. Ellison; the doctor who told Joe he was going to die. He's got a drink and he looks nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Ellison.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or words to that effect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<GRAYNAMORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His name is Kenneth Hindmick. Business Affairs. He works for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAYNAMORE>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. Need your taxes done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kenneth Hindmick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Need any terrible job done? I'm your man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not Dr. Ellison.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kenneth Hindmick. I'm not a bad guy, really. I just have an unfortunate tendency to do what I'm told.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
Joe nods numbly.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICIA>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His name is Kenneth Hindmick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<GRAYNAMORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he made believe he was a Dr. Ellison. And he told Joe here that he had something called a brain cloud, and that he was going to die. So that Joe here would agree to jump in the volcano.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAYNAMORE>
<PATRICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh! That's dastardly. You're both dastards.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICIA>
<DIRECTION>
Joe, still focused on Hindmick, pushes her aside.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have a brain cloud?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you don't have anything. You're just a hypochondriac. Sorry. Or, looking on the bright side, congratulations!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
Joe takes a step for Kenneth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenneth takes out a gun and points it shakily at Joe.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I'm gonna beat you up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold it! Don't make me kill you when there's nothing wrong with you! I feel bad enough already. I told you he'd be mad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<GRAYNAMORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So we'll just take turns watching him till we get back to L.A. Nobody'll believe his story anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAYNAMORE>
<PATRICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will. I'll back him up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICIA>
<GRAYNAMORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, Patricia, when we get back, I'm going to give this boat to you, and you can sail off into the distance with it and be done with us all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAYNAMORE>
<PATRICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICIA>
<GRAYNAMORE>
<DIRECTION>
(talking to Kenneth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So we'll take turns watching the two of them till we get back to L.A., and then we'll turn them both loose, and I'll keep the boat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAYNAMORE>
<PATRICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's fine with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICIA>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've forgotten one thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<GRAYNAMORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I have? Nothing comes readily to mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAYNAMORE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe is still facing Kenneth.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've looked into the volcano, Mr. Graynamore. You know what I mean? After that, the hole in the front of a gun doesn't scare me at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna take the gun away from you, Kenneth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think I won't shoot?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. That's your part. I can't make you shoot me and I can't stop you. I can only do my part. I'm going to take the gun away from you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe, after slowly approaching, swiftly takes the gun away from Kenneth.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just as well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<GRAYNAMORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I'd had the gun, you'd be dead now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAYNAMORE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll never know. Patricia, tell Dad the happy news.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<PATRICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got married. The Chief married us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICIA>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I was wondering where you thought we should go on, you know, a honeymoon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<GRAYNAMORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no idea
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAYNAMORE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought we might like to go on a sailing trip. How's that sound?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Graynamore doesn't answer.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think that sounds great!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICIA>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does this thing have like a rubber raft or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<PATRICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It has a dinghy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICIA>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's break it out. I think your father's tired of this ostentatious life style.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDE THE TWEEDLE DUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Graynamore and company are just finished getting into a dinghy. Joe and Patricia stand on the deck, Joe still pointing the gun. Patricia's crew stands by.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if there's a storm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you'll drown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<GRAYNAMORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll pay for this. I'll see to that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAYNAMORE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I think, Mr. Graynamore?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<GRAYNAMORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRAYNAMORE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think that you don't scare me at all. Maybe you can do some stuff to me - if you make it back home. If I come back. And maybe you can't. It remains to be seen. But what I think, and I say this to you from the bottom of my heart, sir. I don't fear you at all. I don't fear any man. Because every day is a gift, and I'm just glad as hell it looks like I may have a few. And beyond that, to be scared or glad of anything beyond that, why a man's just got to be a fool!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe laughs a laugh, wild and free, a laugh unweighted by fear, a laugh of pure joy. Patricia goes below. Only here does the island finally go under completely.

EXT. DINGHY - GRAYNAMORE AND KENNETH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Graynamore is thoughtful. He starts to smile.
</DIRECTION>
<GRAYNAMORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like that boy! Good for her!

</GRAYNAMORE>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good for her? What about us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<GRAYNAMORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like a tight spot. Maybe I have gotten a little greedy.

(produces a paddle and hands it to Kenneth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Start paddling while I re- assess my values.
	</DIALOGUE>

(as Kenneth doesn't start)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Start paddling.

	You paddle.

<GRAYNAMORE>
<DIRECTION>
(lights a pipe)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright. Fair enough. We'll both paddle. 'And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by!' Com'on, let's put our backs into it.

(stops rowing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I have a good feeling about this. Maybe we're going to become friends.

OMITTED
</DIRECTION>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I doubt that. You're just too overbearing.

Graynamore begins to sing "Someone's in the Kitchen with Dinah" as they paddle out of view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE TWEEDLE DUM - NIGHT (COUPLE OF MINUTES LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dinghy has gone. The boat is passing over the spot where the island went down. A lot of bubbles and steam are still coming up. A few empty cans of Jump come up.
</DIRECTION>
<PATRICIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's the end of Waponi Woo.

FROM JOE'S POV - BUBBLING SURFACE

His trunks start rising to the surface, one after the other. Until three trunks are bobbing on the surface.

	I'll tell you one thing. Wherever we're goin'. We're taking this luggage. Help me fish it out.

JOE'S POV - BUBBLING TO THE SURFACE

The Chief comes up on the last trunk. He is holding his Tiki teddy bear.

BACK TO SCENE

<DIRECTION>
Joe and Patricia smile at each other and help the Chief up onto the boat. We STAY where we are, LOOKING AT the horizon OVER the railing of the boat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The big, dramatic pas de deux music from the NUTCRACKER starts to play. A moon, with its volcanic aspect emphasized, a moon that's simply too big to be real, starts to rise from the sea. It rises into and up OUT OF the FRAME while:

<DIRECTION>
THE CREDITS ROLL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE TWEEDLE DUM - NIGHT (FEW MINUTES LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The moon hangs in the sky off to the right of the boat. We see, FROM a distance, Joe and Patricia just getting the last trunk on deck. Then Patricia goes below. The ENGINE STARTS up. The boat turns and heads straight for the moon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUSTY SPRINGFIELD, singing "You Don't Have To Say You Love Me" begins to play.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We watch them grow fainter and fainter, a smaller and smaller speck in the eye of the Man in the Moon. UP CLOSE to us, the DOLPHIN sticks his head out of the water again, makes his NOISE once more, and disappears forever beneath the gentle waves. One of the craters on the craterous moon shakes and erupts, puffing out a bunch of white smoke which forms the words: "The End."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
