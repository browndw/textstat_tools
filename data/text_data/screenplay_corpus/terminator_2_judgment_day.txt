EXT. CITY STREET - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Downtown L.A. Noon on a hot summer day. On an EXTREME LONG LENS the lunchtime crowd stacks up into a wall of humanity. In SLOW MOTION they move in herds among the glittering rows of cars jammed bumper to bumper. Heat ripples distort the torrent of faces. The image is surreal, dreamy... and like a dream it begins very slowly to

Same spot as the last shot, but now it is a landscape in Hell. The cars are stopped in rusted rows, still bumper to bumper. The skyline of buildings beyond has been shattered by some unimaginable force like a row of kicked-down sandcastles. Wind blows through the desolation, keening with the sound of ten million dead souls. It scurries the ashes into drifts, stark white in the moonlight against the charred rubble. A TITLE CARD FADES IN:

LOS ANGELES, July 11, 2029.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON a heap of fire-blackened human bones. Beyond the mound is a vast tundra of skulls and shattered concrete. The rush hour crowd burned down in their tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE DISSOLVE TO a playground... where intense heat has half-melted the jungle gym, the blast has warped the swing set, the merry-go-round has sagged in the firestorm. Small skulls look accusingly from the ash-drifts. WE HEAR the distant echo of children's voices... playing and laughing in the sun. A silly, sing-songy rhyme as WE TRACKS SLOWLY over seared asphalt where the faint hieroglyphs of hopscotch lines are still visible.

CAMERA comes to rest on a burnt and rusted tricycle... next to the tiny skull of its owner. HOLD ON THIS IMAGE as a female VOICE speaks:

A metal foot crushes the skull like china.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TILT UP, revealing a humanoid machine holding a massive battle rifle. It looks like a CHROME SKELETON... a high-tech Death figure. It is the endoskeleton of a Series 800 terminator. Its glowing red eyes compassionlessly sweep the dead terrain, hunting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SOUNDS of ROARING TURBINES. Searchlights blaze down as a formation of flying HK (Hunter-Killer) patrol machines passes overhead. PAN WITH THEM toward the jagged horizon, beyond which we see flashes, and hear the distant thunder of a pitched battle in progress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BATTLE. Human troops is desperate combat with the machines for possession of the dead Earth. The humans are a ragtag guerrilla army. Skynet's weapons consist of Ground HKs (tank-like robot gun-platforms), flying Aerial HKs, four-legged gun-pods called Centurions, and the humanoid terminators in various forms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEQUENCE OF RAPID CUTS: 5A Explosions! Beam-weapons firing like searing strobe-light. 5B A gunner is an armored personnel carrier fires a LAW rocket at a pursuing Aerial HK, bringing it down in a fiery explosion. 5C Another APC is crushed under the treads of a massive Ground HK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
5D A TEAM OF GUERRILLAS in a intense fire-fight with terminator 5E endoskeletons in the ruins of a building. Three terminator 5F endoskeletons advance, firing rapidly. Another (complete cyborg), with flesh ripped open and back broken, gropes for a rifle on the ground.

5G A Centurion overruns a human firing position. Soldiers are cut down as they run. Fiery explosions light the ranks of advancing machines.

IN A BLASTED GUN EMPLACEMENT at the edge of battle, a man watches the combat with night-vision binoculars. He wears the uniform of a guerrilla general, and a black beret. He is still amid running, shouting techs and officers.

<DIRECTION>
C.U. MAN, pushing slowly in as the battle rages O.S. He lowers the binoculars. He is forty-five years old. Features severe. The left side of his face is heavily scarred. A patch covers that eye. An impressive man, forged in the furnace of a lifetime of war. The name stitched on the band of his beret is CONNOR. We push in until his eyes fill frame, then...

Wild fingers of BLUE-WHITE ELECTRIC ARCS dance in a steel canyon formed by two TRACTOR TRAILERS, parked side by side in the back lot of an all-night truck stop. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The strange lightning forms a circular opening in mid-air, and in the sudden flare of light we see a FIGURE in a SPHERE OF ENERGY. Then the FRAME WHITES OUT with an explosive THUNDERCLAP!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the clearing vapor we see the figure clearly... a naked man. TERMINATOR has come through. Physique: massive, perfect. Face: devoid of emotion. Terminator stands and impassively surveys its surroundings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRUCK STOP DINER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a back route to north L.A. A handful of local TRUCKERS hunch over chili-sizes, CAT hats pushed back on their heads. Three BIKERS are playing a game of pool in the back, their Miller empties lining the table's rail. The dive's owner, LLOYD, a fat, aging biker-type in a soiled apron, stands behind the bar. Nothing much going on...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the front door opens and a big naked guy strolls in -- that doesn't happen every night. All eyes simultaneously swivel toward Terminator. Its emotionless gaze passes over the customers as it walks calmly through the room. Everyone frozen, not sure how to react.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
8A TERMINATOR POV. A digitized electronic scan of the room, overlaid with alphanumeric readouts which change faster than the human eye can follow. In POV we move past the staring truckers, past the owner and the awestruck WAITRESS, and approach a large nasty-looking biker puffing on a cigar. His body is outlined, or "selected", and thousands of estimated measurements appear. His clothing has been analyzed and deemed suitable...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
8B TERMINATOR
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need your clothes, your boots, and your motorcycle.

The big biker's eyes narrow. He takes a long draw on this cigar, the tip cherry-red hot.
</DIRECTION>
<CIGAR_BIKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You forgot to say please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CIGAR_BIKER>
<DIRECTION>
He grinds the cigar out on Terminator's chest. Which produces not the slight reaction of pain. Terminator calmly, and without expression, grabs Cigar by his meaty upper arm... Cigar screams from the hydraulic grip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terminator doesn't see Cigar's friend, behind him, holding his pool cue by the narrow end like a Louisville Slugger. The heavy send whistles in a powerful swing and CRACKS IN TWO across the back of Terminator's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terminator seems not to notice. Doesn't even blink. Without releasing his grip on Cigar, he snaps his arm straight back and grabs Pool Cue by the front of his jacket. Suddenly the heavyset biker finds himself flying through the nearest window. CRAASSH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terminator hurls Cigar, all 230 pounds of him, clear over the bar, through the serving window into the kitchen, where he lands on the big flat GRILL. We hear a SOUND like SIZZLING BACON as Cigar screams, flopping jerking. He rolls off in a smoking heap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The third biker whips out a knife with a eight-inch blade and slashes at Terminator's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terminator grabs the arcing blade with his bare hand. Holding it by the razor-sharp blade he jerks is from the guy's hand. Ultra-fast here: He flips it. Grabs the handle like you're supposed to hold a knife. Grabs the biker and slams him face-down over the bar. Then brings the knife whistling down, pinning the biker's shoulder to the bar top with his own steel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors BANGS OPEN and Terminator strides in. The Mexican cook does a fast fade as Terminator walks toward Cigar, who is cursing in pain on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With his deep-fried fingers he struggles to get out the .45 auto tucked under his leather jacket. But he can't even hold onto it. Terminator takes it from him. Instead of pointing it at him, Terminator carefully examines weapon, analyzing its caliber and operating condition. Terminator never threatens... that's a human thing. He just takes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cigar senses what he must do when the emotionless eyes come back to him. He slides the keys to his bike across the floor to Terminator's foot. Then painfully starts getting out of his jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRUCK STOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terminator strides from the kitchen, fully clothed now in a black leather jacket, leather riding pants, and heavy, clean boots. He moves toward the moaning biker pinned to the pool table. Without slowing his stride he jerks the knife out. The guy slumps to the floor, groaning, behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terminator continues toward the front of the diner, passing Lloyd, the owner. At the door, he comes abreast of two truckers who sit frozen like a snapshot in mid-bite. One of the truckers finally nods.

EXT. TRUCK STOP

<DIRECTION>
Terminator walks out, surveying the parked Harleys. Sticks the .45 in his belt and swings one leg over a massive CUSTOM ELECTRO-GLIDE. He slips the dagger in his boot and the key in the ignition. Kicks over the engine. It catches with a roar and he slams the heavy iron into gear with a KLUNK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lloyd appears at the diner's door with a sawed-off 10-GAUGE WINCHESTER LEVER-ACTION SHOTGUN. He fires into the air and jacks around round in fast, aiming at Terminator's back.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't let you take the man's wheels, son. Now get off or I'll put you down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
Terminator turns and considers by coldly. He eases the shifter up into neutral. Rocks the bike onto its kickstand. Swings him leg over and walks calmly toward the guy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terminator strides right up to Lloyd, staring straight into the shotgun's muzzle. Lloyd starts sweating, trying to decide is he's going to kill a man in cold blood. He's still trying to decide when Terminator's hand blurs out like a striking cobra and is somehow suddenly holding the shotgun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lloyd gapes, knowing he's screwed. Then... Terminator reaches toward him. Oh shit... And slips the sunglasses out of Lloyd's shirt pocket. Puts them on. Strides back to the Harley and roars off in a shower of gravel.

EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Terminator roars down the freeway, heading for L.A. Cold neon flares across the chrome of the big bike. The 10-gauge is jammed through the clutch and brake cables, across the handlebars. The lights flow over Terminator's wrap-around sunglasses like the tracks of tracer rounds.

A TREMENDOUS BLUE-WHITE GLARE suddenly spills out between the columns of the overpass. The young UNIFORMED COP in the car whips his head around at the source of the light. He pulls over quickly, in time to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
13A The powerfully arcing electrical discharge reaches its peak between the columns. Lightning climbs the chain-link fence and light standards, lighting up the night, and papers swirl in a blasting whirlwind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
13B The cop climbs from his cruiser as the glow fades. He sees vapor dissipating as he approaches the spot where he saw the strange light. He draws his revolver and cautiously moves into the shadows between the rows of pillars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A NAKED MAN glides from a shadowed doorway behind the cop. Nothing special about him. Certainly not built like a terminator. The flash of light and fact that he is naked are pretty good clues that he just arrived from the future. His features are handsome bordering on severe. His eyes are gray ice. Penetrating. Intelligent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE COP spins at a sound. Too late. Mr. X is already on him. The blow is lighting fast and the cop drops like a bag of sand.

LOW ANGLE as the unconscious cop hits the deck, his BERETTA 9mm AUTOMATIC clattering next to him. A hand ENTERS FRAME and picks up this pistol.

TIGHT ON YOUNG JOHN CONNOR, who at his moment is ten years old and busy reassembling the carburetor on his Honda 125 dirtbike. He has ripped Levi's and long stringy hair. A sullen mouth. Eyes which reveal an intelligence as sharp as a scalpel. The Ramones' "I Wanna Be Sedated" blasts from a boom box next to him.

INT. HOSPITAL - MAXIMUM SECURITY WING

Sunlight is a barred slash on the bare institutional wall. The room is empty of all furnishings save the bed, a stainless steel sink, toilet, and a dented metal mirror. WE HEAR a rhythmic grunting, small explosions of breath in perfectly-metered time.

PAN TO a bedframe leaned upright against the wall, legs facing outward. A pair of sweaty hands grip one leg. Tendons knot and release as SOMEONE does pull-ups. A man of tangled hair hides the face that comes INTO FRAME, dips out, comes back.

WIDER. A WOMAN in a tank top and hospital pants in hanging from the top leg of the vertical bedframe. Her body is straight and taut. Knees bent so the feet clear the ground. The arms are lean and muscular. The inmate, face hidden, pulls up, dips, pulls up. Like a machine. No change in rhythm.

He whips the baton in a whistling backhand, which -- WHAP! Takes her square in the stomach. She doubles over and drops to her knees, unable to breathe. Douglas tips the bed and it slams down with a crash, right new to her. He takes her stun wand from the other attendant and walks forward.

The stun wand hits her between shoulder blades as she tries to rise. It drives her to the floor, pinning her like a bug. Little ELECTRIC ARCS CRACKLE as the baton makes her writhe in pain. Douglas grabs her by the hair and jerks her up to her knees. Holds the cup of thorazine in front of her lips.

John furtively hunches before a Ready-Teller machine at the rear of a local bank while his friend Tim stands lookout. John slips a stolen ATM card into the machine slot. It is something he's rigged up, because trailing from the card is ribbon-wire which goes to some kind of black-box electronics unit he's got in his ever-present knapsack. He holds the pack between his knees and pulls out a little lap-top keyboard, which is also connected to the black-box.

John enters a few commands and the plasma-screen displays the PIN number for that account. He quickly enters the number on the Ready- Teller's keypad and asks it for 300 bucks. The machine whirs then begins dispensing twenty-dollar bills. Tim looks back over his shoulder amazed.

CLOSE ON SARAH. She is shackled, hands and feet, to the bed. Sunlight falls across her pale face. A hand enter frame, gently stroking her cheek. She wakes up to see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KYLE REESE. Sitting on the edge of her bed, looking exactly the same as we last saw him in 1984. Scruffy blonde hair and a long raincoat.

INT. CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah staggers from her cell. Reese is already, impossibly, a hundred feet away, striding down the dim corridor. A silhouette in a long coat, disappearing around a corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah runs after him, her bare feet slapping the cold linoleum. Her hospital gown floats out behind her as she dream-runs along the seemingly infinite corridor. She reaches the corner, slides around it, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
30A Slams right into the arms of Douglas and his three helpers. They grab her as she struggles and screams. The Silberman is there, smiling soothingly. They force her down and she is pinned to the floor, screaming. A new figure approaches... one even more menacing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TERMINATOR walks toward her, with heavy measured steps. Backlit, eyes concealed by the sunglasses, it stands over her like the angel of death itself. It reaches down and... Takes her hand. Lifts her up. Leads her to a door. They go through together. Emerging into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
30B A BEAUTIFUL SUNLIGHT MORNING. CHILDREN are playing nearby... sliding down slides, clambering through a jungle gym. Sarah knows this dream know... it's is the worst of all her nightmares. She starts to scream but no sound comes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
30C THE SKY EXPLODES into WHITE LIGHT. Everything is seared by the unholy glare, hotter than a thousand suns. The children ignite like match heads. Sarah is burning, screaming silently, everything silent and overexposed. Terminator's flesh and clothing are burning, silently. It grips her hand, Virgil to her Dante in this tour of the nuclear-age Inferno.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
30D THE BLAST WAVE HITS... a near-solid wall of compressed air followed by 250-mph winds. The children, charcoal statues frozen in positions of play, explode into black leaves of ash and swirl away. SOUND hit now, with a thunderous roar. Sarah's scream merges with the howl of the wind as the blast hits her, exploding the flesh from her bones. Beside her, Terminator is stripped of its burnt flesh, becoming a smoking skeleton of steel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
30E Then she wake up... in her cell, shackled to the bed. Sunlight hurts her eyes. She looks desperate and defeated. She knows the war is coming. It visits her every time she closes her eyes. Lost and alone, Sarah feels all hope recede for herself and for humanity.

INT. VAULT ROOM

Dyson enters with Bryant. Dyson and a GUARD stand together before what looks like a high-tech bank vault. It requires two keys to open, like the launch controls in a nuclear silo. The guard and Dyson insert their keys and turn them simultaneously. Dyson then enters a passcode at a console and the vault unlocks itself with a sequence of clunks. The door swings open and Dyson enters. Bryant stays outside with the guard, who notes Dyson's name and item on a clipboard.

Dyson walks to a stainless steel cabinet and opens it. Inside is a small artifact in a sealed container of inert gas. IT -- a ceramic rectangle, about the size of a domino, the color of liver. It has been shattered, painstakingly reconstructed and mounted on a metal frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dyson removes the artifact, it its insert-gas, and sets it on a specially-designed cart. He handles it like the Turin Shroud. Dyson closes the cabinet. Turns to the one next to it. Opens its door. In this cabinet is a larger object... an intricate METAL HAND AND FOREARM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the elbow, the metal is twisted and crushed. But the forearm and hand are intact. Its metal surface scorched and discolored, it stands upright in a vacuum flask, as if saluting. This is all that remains of the terminator Sarah destroyed. Dyson stares at it, lost in thought. The he closes the cabinet, BLACKING OUT FRAME.

He parries deftly at the enemy ICBMs deploy their MIRVs... the warheads stream down... it's more than he can deal with. The world gets nuked. Game over. He slouches away from the game, looking for another. Bored.

John ducks just as the cop glances over. He slinks out the other side of the ride and heads for the back of the store, instinctively retreating. Sarah has taught him that cops are bad news.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE COP scans the crowded arcade. Glimpses John, looking back as he moves around a row of machines. Starts toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHN sees the cop homing in and starts walking fast. Looks back. THE COP is shoving through clots of kids. One of them is slammed to the floor. As eddy of outrage behind the cop as he gains speed. John breaks into run. So does the cop. Kids scatter like ten-pins as the cop charges after John. John sprints through the arcade's back officer and store-rooms.

INT. SERVICE CORRIDOR

John emerges through a firedoor into a long corridor with connects to the parking garage. He's running full out, when around the corner ahead of him comes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TERMINATOR. Time stretches to nightmarish crawl as John tries to brake to a stop. Terminator reaches into the box of roses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOW MOTION. The cold back steel of the SHOTGUN emerges at the box falls open, the roses spilling to the floor. TERMINATOR'S BOOT crushes the flowers as it moves forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHN, transfixed by terror, is trapped in the narrow featureless shooting gallery of the corridor. THE SHOTGUN COMES UP. Terminator expressionlessly strides forward. Jacks a round into the chamber, slow and fluid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John looks behind him for a place to run. Sees the cop coming toward him, pulling his Beretta pistol. Incredibly, John realizes the cop is aiming his gun at him! John looks back at Terminator. He is starting into the black muzzle of the 10-gauge now. Aimed right at his head. He realizes he's screwed. Then something crazy happens...

THE COP catches the SHOTGUN'S BLAST square in the chest just as he fires the pistol. The pistol's shot goes wild.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TERMINATOR pumps another round into him. The another. And another. Advancing a step each time he fires, he empties the shotgun into the cop, blowing his backward down the corridor. The sound is DEAFENING. Then silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE COP lies still on his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
44A Terminator is now standing right over John. They both watch as the cop, incredibly, sits up unharmed and gets to his feet. Terminator grabs John roughly by his jacket. Clutches the kid to his chest then spins around at the cop opens fire with the Beretta.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
44B The "cop", who not only isn't a cop, he clearly isn't even human, pulls the trigger so fast it almost seems like a machine-pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TERMINATOR'S BACK, as the 9mm slugs slam into it, punching bloody holes in the motorcycle jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHN is bug-eyed with fear, but completely unscratched. Terminator's body has blocked the bullets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Beretta CLACKS empty. Terminator turns at the sound. Shoves John behind a Coke machine. Drops the empty shotgun. Starts walking toward the "cop". The empty magazine clatters to the floor. The cop inserts another one. Snaps back the slide. Terminator still has twenty feet to go. He doesn't break his purposeful stride.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cop opens fire. Bullets rake Terminator's chest. He doesn't even flinch. Ten feet to go. BLAM BLAM BLAM BLAM! Neither the cop nor Terminator show the slightest change in expression as the gun rips Terminator's wardrobe to shreds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLACK. The pistol empties again. Terminator stops two feet in front of the cop. The appraise each other for a second.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We realize now that the cop is a terminator too. We don't know the details yet, but let's call him the T-1000 (since that's what he is). A newer model than the one we've come to know so well (the 800 Series "Arnold"). This guy's a prototype... and he's got quite a few surprises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
T-1000 AND TERMINATOR size each other up. Terminator moves first. He grabs T-1000 in his massive hands but the T-1000 snaps back with a counter-grip. After about two seconds of intense slamming, the walls on both sides of the corridor have all the plaster smashed in, and the two battling machines have blasted through the wall and disappeared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHN, totally stunned by all this, remembers to move. He staggers to his feet. Stumble-runs toward the parking garage.
</DIRECTION>

44C THIRD LEVEL CONCOURSE. A plate glass window EXPLODES and Terminator crashes through to the tile floor like a sack of cement amid the screaming crowd.

44E Terminator is totally still. A JAPANESE TOURIST cautiously steps forward and takes a picture of the body. Suddenly, Terminator's eyes snap open. The stunned tourist backs away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits up and looks around. Gets his bearings. Rises smoothly to his feet. All servos seem to be working fine. The tourist's camera whirs as the motor-drive runs on by itself, taking shot after show. The owner isn't even looking through the eyepiece, he's so shocked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARKING GARAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John is frantically pumping the kick-start of his bike, scared shitless and the damned thing won't start. His hands are shaking so badly he can't find the choke. He looks up to see -- The T-1000 running down the corridor toward him. John fumbles with the choke. The bike catches. He slams it in gear and spins the bike out into the main aisle of the garage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John looks back... the T-1000 is behind him, running. He twists the throttle and guns the little bike forward. Incredibly, the T-1000 is gaining. This nightmare isn't happening. John races out the exit ramp, and charges right into the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John shoots into the busy traffic. Cuts off a BIG-RIG TOW TRUCK. The DRIVER swears. Hits his air horn. What the driver doesn't see is the cop, running faster than O.J. Simpson at the airport, who emerges onto the street and runs back at his truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
46A IN THE TRUCK. The driver hears a thump as something slams against his door, then feels himself pulled right out. T-1000 slides in and takes his place. The truck is still rolling along about 25 mph. T-1000 accelerates after John without missing a beat. It can see him, up ahead, weaving through traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
46B Out of the garage entrance, Terminator roars onto the street on the Harley. He accelerates after the others.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John slides his bike down the service ramp faster than he's ever done it before. He races along the bottom of the canal, turning into a narrower tributary which has vertical sides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks back. No sign of pursuit. 47A Suddenly he sees the sun blocked out by a great shadow. The Kenworth tow-truck... big as a house, all chrome and roaring diesel engine... crashes through the fence and launches itself right into the center of the canal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It crashes down, 15 feet to the ground, going about 60, hits at an angle and tears into the concrete wall with a hideous grinding of metal. It ricochets back and forth between the walls then, bellowing like a gunshot stegosaurus, it just keep on plowing forward, gathering speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
47B John looks back and sees this wall of metal almost filling the narrow concrete canal and he milks every last bit of throttle the little bike has. The Kenworth is all muscle, tearing along the canal like a train in a tunnel. Its big tires send up huge sheets of muddy spray, backlit in the setting sun. It looks like some kind of demon. And... it's gaining.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
47C ABOVE THEM, on the service road running parallel, Terminator is fighting to overtake them. He looks down and sees John with the tow- truck from Hell catching up to him. It is only about twenty feet behind him and still gaining.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
47D ANGLE IN THE CANAL, looking back past a desperate John, at the wall of metal filling frame behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
47E ABOVE, Terminator cuts the bike suddenly hard to the left, leaving the road. Hitting an earth embankment just right, he jumps the bike into the air like Steve McQueen in "The Great Escape" and vaults the fence bordering the canal. It slams down at the edge of the canal and tears along, inches from the drop-off on a dirt path, accelerating past the truck in the canal below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
47F John hits some water and slews momentarily, loosing speed. The massive push-plate on the front of the truck slams into his back fender. Panicked, he pulls a little ahead. All this is happening at about sixty miles and hour. Top speed for the little dirt bike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
47G SLOW MOTION as Terminator jumps the bike again. This time the 700- pound Harley sails out into space and drops into the canal. It arcs down between the truck and John, hitting on its wheels. It bottoms out, an explosion of sparks under the frame. Only the ultra-fast reflexes of a machine could keep the bike upright. Terminator fights for control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
47H He guns the throttle and the powerful bike roars up beside John's tiny Honda. Terminator sweeps the kid off his machine with one arm and swings him onto the Harley, in front of him. John's Honda weaves and falls, smashing instantly under thundering tires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Harley roars ahead. It hits eighty. Ahead is an overpass, and supporting it is an abutment which bisects the canal into two channels. The Harley thunders into one channel, which is essentially a short tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
47I The truck can't fit on either side. Neither can it stop, at that speed. Tires locked, it slides on the muddy concrete and piles into the concrete abutment at seventy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
47J Terminator and John emerge from the tunnel, looking back to see a fireball blasting through behind them as the truck's side-tanks explode.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terminator stops the Harley. John peers around his body to see the destruction. A burning wheel wobbles out of the tunnel and flops in the mud. Terminator revs the bike and they roar away, down the canal, disappearing around a bend.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
47K ANGLE ON THE FIRE, as a column of black smoke rises from the overpass. Smoke boils from the tunnel as well, and inside it is a solid wall of flame. A figure appears in the fire. Just an outline. Walking slowly... calmly. The figure emerges from the flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is human-shaped but far from human. A smooth chrome man. Not a servo-mechanism like Terminator is underneath, with its complex hydraulics and cables... this thing is a featureless, liquid chrome surface, bending seamlessly at knees and elbows as it walks. It reminds us of mercury. A mercury man. Its face is simple, unformed. Unruffled by thousand-degree heat, it walks toward us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With each step detail returns. First the shape and lines of its clothing emerge from the liquid chrome surface, then finer details... buttons, facial features, ears...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
47K But it's still al chrome. With its last step, the color returns to everything. It is the cop again... handsome young face, blond hair, mustache. Icy eyes. It stops and looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a perfect chameleon. A liquid metal robot. A killing machine with the ultimate skills of mimicry for infiltration of human society.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
47L ANGLE NEARBY, as several police cruisers and a fire truck pull up. T-1000 climbs out of the canal behind them. More cops arrive. T-1000 blends in perfectly. There are always cops at diasters and scenes of violence. We now see why its choice of protective mimicry is so perfect. It walks among the other cops unnoticed. Gets into one of the squad cars. Starts it and drives away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terminator, with John in front of him on the Harley, roars down the empty street. John cranes his neck around to get a look at the person/thing he is riding with. The image is strangely reminiscent of father/son, out for an evening ride.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John is still in shock from the experience of what just happened and he's just a ten-year kid, but he's also John Connor who will someday rise to greatness, and we see a bit of that in him even know.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa... time out. Stop the bike!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
Terminator immediately complies. He leans the bike into a turn. They head into a nearby alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terminator and John rolls into the alley and come to a stop. John slides off the gas tank. Terminator impassively stares at him. John checks him out. Tentatively speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now don't take this the wrong way, but you are a terminator, right?

EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John and Terminator on the bike again, weaving through the side streets. They blend into the evening traffic. In the darkness, Terminator's wounds are not readily visible. John cranes his head up and back.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So this other guy? He's a terminator too, right, like you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<TERMINATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not like me. A T-1000. Advanced prototype. A mimetic polyalloy.

</TERMINATOR>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Radical.

<TERMINATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are targeted for termination. The T-1000 will not stop until it complete its mission. Ever.

John mulls that over.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where we going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<TERMINATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have to leave the city, immediately. And avoid the authorities.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERMINATOR>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I stop by my house?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<TERMINATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Negative. The T-1000 will definitely try to reacquire you there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERMINATOR>

<JOHN>

	Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks but I gotta warn them. Shit! You got a quarter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>

Terminator reaches past John and smashes the cover plate off the phone's cash box with the heel of his hand. A shower of change tumbles out. Terminator hands one to John. John dials.
</DIRECTION>

INT. VOIGHT HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Janelle Voight picks up the kitchen phone and cradles it with her shoulder which she continues to chop vegetables with a large knife. She answers sweetly.

In the backyard, John's German Shepherd is going bonkers, barking at something.

	<DIALOGUE>
	John? Where are you, honey? It's late. You should come home, dear. I'm making a casserole.

AT THE PAYPHONE. John listens, an odd look on his face. He covers the phone's mouthpiece and turns to Terminator.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>

(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something's wrong. She's never this nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE VOIGHTS' KITCHEN. Todd comes through the kitchen's back door. Just home from work. He ignores Janelle and opens the fridge. Grabs a carton of milk. Takes a sip. Frowns at the dog's barking.
</DIRECTION>
<TODD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell's the goddamn dog barking at? SHUT UP, YOU MUTT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TODD>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON JANELLE as Todd growls around the kitchen behind her. He passes OUT OF FRAME next to her. Janelle switches the phone to her other hand then... THUNK! Her free hand seems to do something out of frame. There is a gurgling, and the sound of liquid dribbling onto the floor. (Don't go away. We'll find out what happened in a moment)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE PAYPHONE
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The dog's really barking. Maybe it's already there. What should I do?

Terminator heads for the bike. John, shocked, stares after him.

INT. VOIGHT HOUSE/KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Janelle hangs up the phone. Her expression is neutral. Calm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAN OVER along her arm, which is stretched out straight from the shoulder. Partway along its length her arm has turned smoothly into something else... a metal cylinder which tapers into a sword-like spike. Now we see Todd Voight PINNED TO A KITCHEN CABINET by the spike which has punched through his milk carton, through his mouth and exits the back of his head into the cabinet door. His eyes are glassy and lifeless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The spike is withdrawn -- SWIISHHTT! -- so rapidly, Todd is actually standing there a second before he slumps out of sight. THUMP. 53A Janelle doesn't bat an eye as the spike smoothly changes shape and color, transforming back into a hand, and then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
53B JANELLE CHANGES rapidly into the COP we now know as the T-1000. The change has liquid quality. T-1000 opens the back door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VOIGHT HOUSE/BACKYARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
T-1000 approaches the big German Shepherd, which slinks away from it, barking in fear. T-1000 walk right into CLOSE UP. Reaches down, OUT OF FRAME. We hear that sickening THUNK followed by a shrill YELP. Then T-1000's hand snaps up INTO FRAME holding a bloody dog collar. The tag reads "MAX". T-1000 nods thoughtfully. Heads back to the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

Dark. Off a quiet street. Terminator stands near the Harley, watching John pace before him. John's brain is calling time-out. This is all too weird.

<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need a minute here, okay? You're telling me it can imitate anything it touches?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, why doesn't become a bomb or something to get me?

T-1000 walks down the dark hall. It passes the bathroom and we see the real Janelle's legs through the half-open door. The shower is running. Her blood mixes with water on the white tile floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
56A In John's bedroom the T-1000 begins searching methodically in the dark. Calmly and dispassionately ripping the room apart for any clues that could lead it to its target. T-1000 finds a box of audio cassettes marked "Messages from Mom". In it are some letters, and envelopes filled with snapshots. It begins looking through some of the photos...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT OF JOHN AND SARAH during the missing years. Sarah in olive cammos with an RPG 7 grenade launcher, teaching John how to aim. Sarah with a group of military-clad Guatemalan men, standing next to cases of Stinger missiles. John and Sarah in a Contra camp, deep in the mountains.

	We spent a lot of time in Nicaragua... places like that. For a while she was with this crazy ex-Green Beret guy, running guns. Then there were some other guys.

	Now who's the dipshit, you jock douchebag?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
Immediately, things get out of hand. The guy's friend jumps behind Terminator and tries to grab him in a full nelson -- Terminator throws the first guy across the hood of a car -- Grabs the second by the hair, whips out his .45 in a quick blur, and aims the muzzle at the guy's forehead. John grabs Terminator's arm with a yell as he pulls the trigger -- John's weight is just enough to deflect the gun a few inches. The guy flinches, stunned by the K-BOOM next to his ear. He stares, shocked. Pissing himself. John is freaking out, too. He screams at Terminator.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put the gun down! NOW!!

Terminator sets the .45 on the sidewalk. John scoops it up fast then turns to the shocked civilians, who can't believe what just happened.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walk away.

<DIRECTION>
They do. Fast. John grabs Terminator by the arm and tugs him toward the bike. John still holds the gun, reluctant to give it back.

Terminator doesn't get it. John just stares at him. Frightened at what just almost happened. He gets a glimpse of the responsibility that comes with power. Finally he hands the .45 back to Terminator, who puts it away.

A black-clad figure stands at the end of the corridor. The guy has short-cropped hair and dark glasses. An AR-80 assault rifle in one hand, and a 12-gauge in the other -- holding them both like toy pistols. ANOTHER PHOTO is slapped on top of the first. Another still-frame blow-up is placed over the last. Terminator looms in CLOSEUP.

59A INT. INTERVIEW ROOM/PESCADERO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The photos are lying on the table in front of Sarah, placed there by DETECTIVE WEATHERSBY. His partner DET. MOSSBERG, and Dr. Silberman, sit at the table as well. Two uniformed cops, plus Douglas, stand by the door. Sarah stares listlessly at the top photo. She's withdrawn, haggard... drugged-looking.
</DIRECTION>
<MOSSBERG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He killed seventeen police officers that night. Recognize him?

Weathersby slaps another black-and-white eight-by-ten on the table. A closeup of Terminator taken by the Japanese tourist at the mall. It's the same face.

	<DIALOGUE>
	This one was taken by a Japanese tourist today.

</DIRECTION>
<WEATHERSBY>

Sarah stares up at him. A cold and empty stare. He glances at Silberman. Then at his partner.

TIGHT ON SARAH, slumped under the bright lights. Totally out of it. Then we see her hand, creeping along the edge of the table toward the stack of photos. She slips off the paper clip binding the stills together, and hides it between her fingers. Douglas jerks her up by the arms and leads her out.

INT. SARAH'S CELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Douglas inches up the last of Sarah's restraints. Then her leans over her... looking down. Even wrecked as she is, we see the beauty in her face. He bends down. We think he's going to kiss her. Instead he runs his tongue across her face like a dog would. She seems not to even see him. Her dull eyes past him. He can't provoke a reaction. Even here, strapped down, the two of them alone, she give him no superiority. He smirks and leaves. We hear the sound of his night-stick tapping its way down the corridor, growing fainter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah's eyes snap suddenly alert. There is intensity and resolve in them. She slips the paper clip out from between her fingers and awkwardly spreads it open into a straight piece of wire. With slow, painful concentration she moves it toward the lock of the restraints that bind her wrists to the bed at her sides.

Terminator and John charge through the night on the Harley. Streetlights flare past them like comets. Two serious guys with a mission. One a ten-year old kid, the other a half-man/half-machine cyborg from the post-Apocalyptic future.

INT. SARAH'S CELL/CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah is using the paper clip on the door lock. She hears an echoing tapping sound. It's getting louder, coming her way. She goes back to work on the lock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CORRIDOR. Douglas the attendant is tapping his stick along the wall like he does every night on his rounds. He shines a little mag-light in the windows of the cells as he passes, barely slowing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
65A He rounds the corner. His footsteps echo in the dark hallway. The tip of the stick hits the wall. Tap, tap, tap... getting closer to Sarah's cell. He stops at the door. He is about to shine his light in when he notices that a utility closet across the hall is open. He goes to shut it, absently flicking his light into the dark closet. He notices something strange among the buckets and cleaning supplies. A mop lies on the floor, with its handle snapped off about halfway up. The other half is missing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Douglas ponders this for half a second, then hears a SOUND behind him and spins around. The sound he heard was Sarah's cell door. The missing two feet of MOP HANDLE fill his vision as it CRACKS viciously across the bridge of his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
250 pounds of doughy attendant hit the floor like a sack of cement. Sarah slams the makeshift baton down expertly across the back of his head, bouncing him off the linoleum. Lights out, Douglas. She drags him into her cell and locks him in with his own keys. Then swaps her mop-handle for his nice heavy night-stick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
65B Sarah moves down the dark corridor, cat-stepping in her bare feet. She holds the baton like a pro, laid back along the forearm, police- style. She looks dangerous.

INT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE/CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long corridor ends at a reception area, which is closed, and a NIGHT RECEIVING DESK, which is a glass window where they can buzz you in through a heavy door. A NIGHT NURSE types at a desk nearby. She looks up at the sound of footsteps and sees a young cop (T-1000) walking toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<T_1000>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a Sarah Connor here?

She assumes he's with the other cops. Smiles.

<NIGHT_NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Running late, aren't you?

</NIGHT_NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to the inner door to buzz him in and sees Silberman and the cops coming toward the door from the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<NIGHT_NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your friends are on their way out now...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIGHT_NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
When she turns back to the window, T-1000's no longer there. She goes to the counter and leans out to see if he's at the drinking fountain or someplace. No. Reception is empty. And so is the long corridor beyond. She frowns. Too weird.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
66A Silberman comes through the solenoid door with Mossberg and Weathersby, the two uniformed cops, and the hospital security guard. The guard retrieves his 9mm pistol from a lock-out box behind the night desk. Silberman faces him.
</DIRECTION>
<SILBERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lewis, see these gentleman out and them lock up for the night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SILBERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The security guard nods. Silberman goes back into the secure area of the hospital and the cops walk down the long corridor to the main doors. No sign of T-1000. Mossberg and the other cops exit, and the guard locks the door behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
66B The guard walks slowly back along the long corridor. The hall is dark, with the light at the night desk far ahead like a sanctuary. His footsteps ring hollowly on the tile floor. His keys jingle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
66C ANGLE ON FLOOR as the guard's feet pass through FRAME. An instant later the floor starts to move. It shivers and bulges upward like a liquid mass, still retaining the two-tone checkerboard of the tile. It hunches up silently into a quivering shadow in the darkness past the guard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
66D Up ahead we hear typing. The night nurse has her back to us, working. The guard stops as the drinking fountain. Bends to take a sip. Behind him the fluid mass as reaches six feet of height and begins to resolve rapidly into a human figure. It loses the color and texture of the tile and becomes... THE GUARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
T-1000's mass has been spread out a quarter of an inch thick over several square yards of floor. The guard walked over the T-1000, and his structure was sampled that instant. Now we see it drawing in and pulling up to form the figure of the guard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The T-1000/Guard's feet are the last to form, the last of the "liquid floor" pulling in to form shiny black guard shoes. The shoes detach with a faint sucking sound from the real floor as the T-1000/Guard takes its first step.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
66E The real guard spins at the sound of footsteps to see... himself. He has one deeply disturbing moment to consider the ramifications of that. Then he sees his double calmly raise its hand and, inexplicably, points his right index finger directly at the real guard's face, about a foot away. In a split second, the finger spears out, elongating into a thin steel rod which snaps out like a stiletto, slamming into the guard's eye. It punches into the corner of the eye, past the eyeball like a trans- orbital lobotomy tool, and emerges from the back of the guard's skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Life quietly empties from the guard's face. He is dead weight, hanging from the rod/finger with suddenly reacts -- SSSNICK. As the guard slumps, the T-1000 takes his weight easily with one hand and walks him, like it's carrying a suit on a hanger, back toward the night desk. The wounds are so tiny, no blood drips onto the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
66F ON THE NIGHT NURSE, glancing up as the T-1000/Guard walks past, dragging something casually which she can't see because it's below the countertop.

She nods, uninterested. Keeps typing. T-1000 moves past, dragging the unseen guard toward a closet down the hall from the night receiving station. T-1000/Guard removes the Browning High-Power pistol and the keys from the real guard's belt, then stuffs the body into the utility closet.

T-1000 opens the locker and blocks it from her view with its body as it mimes putting the gun in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
66H CLOSE ANGLE ON T-1000'S CHEST, from inside the locker. Instead of setting the gun in the locker, it inserts the pistol into it own chest, where is disappears inside like it was dropped into a pot of hot fudge. It withdraws its hand. The chest is once again a surface that looks like cloth, buttons, name-tag etc. You'd ever guess it was really an intelligent liquid metal.

T-1000 slams the locker door and waits as the nurse hits the button unlocking the door with a BUZZ-CLACK. T-1000/Guard goes through.

INT. ISOLATION SECURITY CHECKPOINT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small room before a short SALLY-PORT corridor designed to prevent violent inmates from making a run for it. There are doors at each end. The first one is barred like a jail-cell door, and the second is a steel fire door. The attendants have a video monitor with which they can see the corridor on the other side of the doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two bored attendants barely notice the T-1000/Guard as it approaches. Looks briefly at a chart next to the door, seeing SARAH CONNOR is in #19.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
67A IN THE ISOLATION WARD, the T-1000 passes a nurses' station which looks a cage, walled in by heavy metal mesh. Silberman, leaning in the open doorway, is talking to an attendant in the cage. He doesn't glance twice at Lewis the Guard passing by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARAH, moving like a ghost in the darkened corridor, hears footsteps coming and quietly but quickly unlocks a cell next to her with Douglas' master key. 68A She slips into the cell and waits as the footsteps pass. We glimpse the T-1000/Guard pass the window. She waits as the footsteps fade away. She looks over. A female inmate, strapped to a bed, watches her with bird-like eyes. She puts a finger to her lips -- SSHHH. The inmate nods. Sarah exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
68B POV MOVING TOWARD nurse's station. We hear Silberman's voice, reviewing medication with the night attendant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SILBERMAN, yawning, looking at his watch. He turns to go... Sarah is there. She slams into him, hurling him through the door into the cage and follows him in. The orderly jumps up, going for his stunner, but she nails him with Douglas' baton. WHAP-WHAP-WHAP! You can barely see the thing she's swinging it so fast. The guys goes down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silberman lunges for the alarm button and she cracks down hard on his arm. He cries out and grabs his wrist. She grabs him by the hair and slams him face down on the desk, smacking him behind the knees expertly with the baton. His legs buckle and he drops to his knees with his chin on the desk. She pins him with one hand. He face is full of outraged disbelief.

68B Moving rapidly, she whips open a medication drawer and grabs a syringe. They keep a few of these handy for tranking unruly patients. She jams it into the orderly's butt and fires the whole shot. Still holding the empty syringe, she sees what she need next. They keep the toxic cleaning supplies in here to keep the inmates from drinking Drano. She grabs a plastic jug of LIQUID PLUM'R and slams it down on the desk inches from Silberman's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She jams the empty syringe into the plastic jug. Draws back the plunger. The syringe fills with blue liquid. She whips it out of the jug and jams the needle into Silberman's neck. His horrified eyes rack toward it. 10 cc's of blue death fill the cylinder. Her thumb hovers over the plunger. She jerks him to his feet by the collar and gets a tight grip on him, then hauls him through the door.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN ANOTHER CORRIDOR in the maze of the vast hospital, Sarah flies past us, her bare feet slapping on the cold tiles. The orderlies charge after her. She's like an animal in a maze. She turns the corner, glancing off the wall, and sprints on without slowing. She reaches a steel door. Tries it. Locked. Footsteps like a drum solo behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She fumbles with Douglas' keys, breathing hard. Jams the master in. The orderlies are bearing down on her at full tilt. Sarah gets the door open. Dives through. Slams it. She turns a deadbolt knob just as the first orderly grabs the latch on the other side. He's too late.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah sees them beyond the window, fumbling with their keys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
73A Sarah is in another sally-port corridor. A jail-cell type barred door is between her and the corridors of the ward beyond. She sprints to the walls of bars, jams her key into the door. She unlocks and pulls open this door just as she hears the latch of the one she just came through being unlocked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She flings herself frantically through the barred door as the first orderly comes through behind her. She slams the bars shut. CLANG. Her keys are dangling from the lock on the other side from her. The orderly is racing at her, white-lipped with rage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches back through the bars, turns the key, and purposefully snaps it off in the lock. An instant later the big orderly slams against the door, grabbing through the bars for her as she dances back just out of reach. He lunges against the steel bars, unbelievably pissed off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah takes off running, looking back at the frustrated orderlies. They're shouting at each other, unable to fit their keys into the lock -- The broken-off key tip makes it impossible to get their keys in. Silberman shouts at them.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TERMINATOR steps out... his head swivels to face her. Sarah reacts, stricken by the image from her worst nightmares. Her eyes go wide as momentum carries her forward. Her bare feet slip on the slick tile. She slams to the floor, staring up at the leather-clad figure with the shotgun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She loses all semblance of courage and some of her sanity. She's not even aware that she is screaming, or what would be screaming if she could get the breath to do it. In slowed-down dream-time, Sarah scrambles back along the floor like a crab, spinning and clawing her way to her feet along the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs like the wind, like in her nightmare. If she looked back she would have seen John step warily out of the corridor behind Terminator. John, however, catches a glimpse of the fleeing Sarah and figures out instantly what happened.

Sarah doesn't hear. She has clicked fully into her own nightmare. They take off running after Sarah.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
73C She is pelting down the long corridor, back the way she came. As she reaches an intersection with a cross-corridor a white-clad figure blurs from that corridor. The orderly hits her in a flying tackle. She skids across the floor, shrieking and struggling. The other two orderlies leap into the fray.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Help me! Goddamnit, it's gonna kill us all!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
She is shouting, pleading, trying to get them to understand what is coming. They grab her thrashing arms and legs. They don't even look where the out-of-control woman is pointing... back along the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They have pinned her to the cold tiles, a ring of faces above her. Silberman leans down to her, holding a syringe with a heavy dose of trank. Sarah cranes her neck and sees the dark silhouette of Terminator coming up behind them. It is exactly her nightmare. She screams in utter hopelessness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terminator, holding the shotgun in one hand, reaches down and grabs one of the orderlies with his other hand. He hurls the 200-pound guys against the far wall of the corridor. SMACK! He drops to the floor. The other two orderlies react instantly, leaping onto the intruder. Terminator seems to disappear for a moment under the two big guys. Then there is an explosion of white-clad figures, as the orderlies are flung outward like they stepped on a land mine. One crashes through a window of safety glass and is caught before a two-story fall by the outer steel bars. The other crashes through an office door, splintering it into kindling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silberman has jumped to hold Sarah. He is grabbed by a roll of skin at the back of his neck and lifted like a cat. The doctor feel his feet pedaling above the ground. He looks into the expressionless face. And it hit him. Sarah was right... this guy isn't human. He feels the fabric of reality crumbling. Then he feels himself flying through the air. The wall smacks him, then the floor kicks him in the face. He decides to lie there a second.

Sarah, is a daze, takes the huge hand in her shaking fingers. Terminator lifts her to her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
73D John sees a GUARD standing thirty feet away, on the other side of the walls of bars. John doesn't know what we know, but he knows something's not right with this guy. Terminator turns to follow John's gaze. The T-1000 had its pistol in its hand, at its side. Terminator pushes John behind him. They start backing up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
73E The T-1000 walks forward, reaching the bars. It doesn't stop. Its body divides like jello around the bars. As it squeezes itself through like metal playdough, its surface reforms perfectly on our side. We see it deform and squeeze through like a viscous paste forced past an obstacle. Silberman has recovered enough to be sitting up and watching this. That faint snapping sound is his mind. There is a CLANK and we see that the guard's gun has caught against the bars... the only solid object. The T-1000 turns its wrist and tries again, slipping the gun endwise through the gap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
73F Sarah is agape. Not reacting. It's been a heavy day for her. Terminator grabs John by the seat of his pants and hooks him up onto his back. John grabs him around the neck. Terminator raises the shotgun and starts backing up.
</DIRECTION>
<TERMINATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go! Run!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERMINATOR>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah doesn't need to be told twice. T-1000 walks toward them, opening fire with the Browning Hi-Power. Terminator straight-arms the 12-guage like a pistol and FIRES. The stunned orderlies flop face down on the floor as the corridor is filled with high-velocity lead. One of them, stupidly running for the cross-corridor, gets hit by the T-1000.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terminator is hammered by several slugs, and the T-1000 is cratered by two buckshots hits. It staggers, but comes on. In the craters we see bright mercury before they close and reseal, disappearing in a second.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
73G Terminator makes it around the corner and breaks into a run. Ahead, Sarah is already at the elevator. Terminator and John pile in and John slaps the button for "Garage Level".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors start to close. T-1000 clears the corner. Terminator slams John and Sarah back against the side walls as the T-1000 charges at them, rapid firing the Browning. The rounds hit the steel doors as they close. T-1000 keeps pumping them at the closing gap. 73H Inside, they see the backside of the doors denting with the hits that are punching holes in the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
73I The Browning locks open, empty. T-1000 drops it without a glance back. The doors close. K-WHAM! The T-1000 hits them a split second later. The elevator hasn't moved yet. SSWWIKK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
73J A sword-like blade rams through in between the doors, forcing them open. Terminator jams the shotgun through the widening gap. Punches the muzzle right INTO T-1000's face -- BOOM!! 73K We get a glimpse of the T-1000's head blown apart by the blast. It is hurtled back. The doors close. The car descends.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
73L ON THE T-1000, outside the elevator. Its head, which is blown apart into two doughy masses lying on the shoulders, reforms quickly. There is no trace of the injury. It sees the closed door and jams its hands between them, its fingertips becoming pry-bars. It pulls the doors apart with inhuman strength 73M and LEAPS INTO THE OPEN SHAFT. It falls two floors and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE ELEVATOR. Out trio hears a loud THUMP on the roof. Terminator, reloading the shotgun, looks up. Sarah grabs the .45 from his waistband and aims it at the ceiling. BEAT... Then CLANGG!! a swordlike shaft punches through the ceiling and spears down four feet into the elevator car. It is inches from Sarah's face. She opens fire, BAM-BAM-BAM -- right through the roof. Lighting-fast the lance withdraws and thrusts down again, slashing Terminator's jacket, and missing John by inches. Terminator chambers a round and K-BOOM! the 12-guage opens a hole in the ceiling. Terminator rocks out in a fury of firing/cocking/firing as the metal shafts slash down again and again. Sarah yells in pain as one of them slices open her upper arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors open. Sarah pulls John out as soon as the gap is wide enough. They emerge into the basement. We see the Harley parked nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terminator, in a rearguard action, fires another blast through the ceiling and runs out. He throws his leg over the Harley, kicks it to life with one powerful stroke and then whips something out of the inner pocket of his jacket. He throws it to John. A road flare!?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the elevator, the T-1000 has bashed a hole in the ceiling big enough to... Pour itself through. A massive blob of mercury extrudes from the opening. The mass drops through the hole, down out of frame, then comes back up into frame as Officer X.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It seems to need just a second to get its mental act together after doing this king of taffy-pull with itself. It opens its eyes and sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TERMINATOR, the shot gun held in his teeth, astride the roaring Harley twenty feet away. Terminator twists the throttle and pops the clutch. The back tire screams on the concrete. The front wheel lifts off the ground and the heavy bike launches in a thundering wheelie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terminator gets off just before the bike hurtles into the elevator. The Harley slams the T-1000 square and smashes it right through the back wall of the elevator. Terminator rolls to his feet. Johns strikes the flare on the concrete. Tosses it. Terminator catches the life flare with one hand. Levels the shotgun with the other. With his last round he blows a big hole in the bike's gas tank. Gas splashes everywhere, covering the struggling T-1000. Terminator tosses the flare. KA-VOOOM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The explosion knocks Terminator backward off his feet, enveloping him in the fireball. He gets up, smoking, and runs after John and Sarah toward the exit ramp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE EXIT RAMP. They are partway up when a blue-and-white hospital security car comes screeching down the other way. Without breaking stride Sarah runs right at the car. It skids to a shrieking halt. She's in the guy's face with the .45 in both hands.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out of the car!!

</SARAH>

The patrol guy is thinking what he can try when BLAM! she puts a round through the glass next to his head.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	RIGHT NOW!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and the guy is coming out with his hands up as Terminator arrives. The cyborg flings the rent-a-cop out of the way and slides behind the wheel. Sarah gets John into the back seat and dives into the front passenger seat as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
78A Terminator slams the car into reverse and punches it, lighting up the tires on the slick ramp. Terminator hands the shotgun over his shoulder to John and tells him to reload. John pulls some shells from the pocket of his army jacket and starts feeding them in. Terminator power backward up the ramp, scraping along one wall, barely in control. Because...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The T-1000 is running at them out of the inferno below. This guy won't quit. Shifting from chrome mode to cop-form as it runs. It sprints up the ramp after the retreating car. T-1000 is gaining.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terminator hands Sarah another magazine for the .45. She snatches it, drops the other out, and slaps in the new one. Cocks the slide. The car backs along the service driveway toward the security gate. John hands the shot gun back to Terminator. He leans out the window and takes aim at the pursuer. The T-1000's face is right in the headlights. 80A Terminator fires, blowing a hole in its shoulder. Shiny liquid metal visible in the hole, which then closes. 80B Sarah, half out the passenger window, opens fire. The car crashes backward through the security barricade.
</DIRECTION>
<TERMINATOR>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERMINATOR>
<DIRECTION>
He cuts the wheel hard. The car slews into a reverse 180, swapping ends with a screech. T-1000 is almost on them. Terminator punches it. The car accelerates forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
80C T-1000 leaps. Lands on the trunk. Its hand is a metal crowbar slammed down through the trunk lid. Feet dragging on the pavement, it slams its other hand down, punching another metal hook into the trunk lid, pulling itself up. Terminator turns to Sarah.
</DIRECTION>
<TERMINATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERMINATOR>
<DIRECTION>
Terminator heaves himself half out the driver's window. Sarah slaps her foot down on the throttle and steers from the passenger side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
80D T-1000, fully on the car now, holds on with one hook-hand while it slams the other into the back window, sweeping away the glass and missing John by inches as he ducks. It draws back for another swing, lunging forward as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
80E Terminator whips the shotgun over the roof of the car. Fires point-blank. Hits the T-1000's arm just above the "hand" which anchors it to the car. The 12-guage blows the arm apart, severing the hook-hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
80F T-1000 tumbles backward off the accelerating car. John looks out the back window, his eyes wide. He sees the T-1000 roll to his feet and continue running. But he's dropping way behind now. Sarah has the car floored and the liquid-metal killer won't catch them on foot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
80G John watches, in awe, as the "crowbar hand", stuck into the trunk right in front of him, reverts to the neutral polyalloy... a kind of think mercury. The gray metal slides off the trunk of the car and falls onto the road to lie there in a quivering blob.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
80H The car speeds off into the night. REVERSE on the T-1000, walking now, coming right up into closeup, watching the tail lights recede. It looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
80I ANGLE ON BLACKTOP, tight on the liquid metal blob. Next to it is the T-1000's shiny cop shoe. The mercury blob crawls and rejoins the main mass, disappearing into the "shoe".

A GHOST CAR blasts out of the darkness on a long stretch of moonlight highway. Headlights off, the hospital security car punches a hole in the wind.

Sarah looks at Terminator, still not quite believing this is happening. But this is a different Sarah than the waitress of 1984. She spends only a second or two dealing with the unbelievable. Then she turns to John in the back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
He nods. She reaches for John and we think she's going to hug him. She starts to rub her hands over him and we realize she's checking for injuries, very clinically the way a vet checks a dog for broken bones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls away from her. He hates her always checking him, treating him like he might break, like some piece of rare china.

	Goddamnit, John, you have to be smarter than that. You're too important! You can't risk yourself, not even for me, do you understand? I can take care of myself. I was doing fine. Jesus, John. You almost got yourself killed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>

We see his chin quiver. He's a tough kid, but all he really wants is for her to love him. He hasn't had enough years on the planet yet to be the man of steel she demands.

<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... had to get you out of the place... I'm sorry, I...

His face crumples. He starts to cry. Sarah gives him a cold stare.

	Stop it! Right now! You can't cry, John. Other kids can afford to cry. You can't.

Now we know it is that that Miles Dyson values so highly. The brain of a terminator.

89A WIDER. John walks around Terminator and looks at his face. Eyes open, he is completely inert. Dead.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
92A IN THE PICKUP. Terminator has this trick (which you could do too if you had servo-driven steel fingers) where he smashes the cowl around a steering column with one blow from the palm of his hand. When it shatters he strips it away with a single move, and then turns the stub of the lock-mechanism with his fingertips. This starts the vehicle. It takes about three seconds.

INT. DYSON HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miles Dyson sits at the huge desk in his study. He is deep in thought, tapping away at the keyboard of his home computer terminal. Next to desk are racks of sophisticated gear. On a Sunday morning, when most men are relaxing, spending time with their families, Dyson is hard at work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN A PROFILE CLOSEUP we see him in deep concentration, his mind prowling the labyrinth of his new microprocessor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WOMAN'S FACE ENTERS FRAME soundlessly behind him. He doesn't hear her. His wife, TARISSA, extends her tongue and traces it down the back of his neck. He smiles and turns to kiss her good morning. She's still in her bathrobe, holding coffee. He's been up for hours. He turns and goes back to work, forgetting instantly that she is standing there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She watches him work, the arcane symbols moving across the screen. We see her frustration, her inability to truly enter the magic box of his world.

The desert northwest of Calexico. Burning under the sun like a hallucination. Heat shimmers the image, mirage-like. Terminator turns the pickup off the paved road and barrels along a roadbed a sand and gravel, trailing a huge plume of dust. A sign at the turnoff says: CHARON MESA 2 MI CALEXICO 15 MI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A101 AHEAD is a pathetic oasis of humanity in the vast wasteland, a couple of aging house-trailers, surrounded by assorted junk vehicles and desert-style trash. There is a dirt airstrip behind the trailers, and a stripped Huey helicopter sitting on block nearby.

A thin Guatemalan KID, FRANCO, eighteen or so, comes out of the trailer with the AK-47, followed by Salceda's wife, YOLANDA. She has THREE younger children with her, from a five-year-old GIRL, JUANITA, to a year-and-half-old BOY. She waves at John. They exchange greetings in Spanish. They seem like nice people. Terminator looks down at John, next to him. He says quietly...

Salceda rips the cap off the tequila bottle. The two-year-old toddles to Terminator and grabs his pants, sliming them with drool. Terminator looks down at the tiny kid, fascinated. What is it? He picks up the child with one huge hand. Looks at it. Turns it different ways. Studying it. Then sets it down. The kid waddles off, a little dizzy.

John grins and does a victorious thumbs up. Terminator imitates the gesture awkwardly. John laughs and makes him get out of the truck, to try the move again.

A108 SARAH, across the compound, pauses in her work to watch John and Terminator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A109 SARAH'S POV... we don't hear what John and Terminator are saying. It is a soundless pantomime as John is trying to show some other gestures to the cyborg. Trying to get him to walk more casually. John walks, then Terminator tries it, then John gestures wildly, talking very fast... explaining the fundamental principles of cool. They try it again. Continued ad lib as we hear:

	<DIALOGUE>
	Watching John with the machine, it was suddenly so clear. The Terminator would never stop, it would never leave him... it would always be there. And it would never hurt him, never shout at him or get drunk and hit him, or say it couldn't spend time with him because it was too busy. And it would die to protect him. Of all the would-be fathers who came and went over the years, this thing, this machine, was the only one who measured up. In an insane world, it was the sanest choice.

A110 EXT. ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A police cruiser is parked off the side of a quiet, empty road on the outskirts of Los Angeles. A ribbon of traffic moves steadily by on a freeway in the distance. Nothing stirs around the cruiser except some pump-jacks sucking the earth on the hill behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A111 IN THE CRUISER. The T-1000 sits inside. John's notes and letters are spread out on the seat beside it. Sarah's voice speaks from a cassette deck. John's tapes. Her voices mixes with the static filled chatter of the radio that T-1000 monitors for any signs of its targets.

T-1000 whips around and rewinds the tape, replaying the last section. It then snaps up the envelope of photos we saw earlier.

ECU on envelope. We see the postmark: "Charon Mesa, Calif."

TIGHT ON T-1000 staring at the postmark on the envelope. It glances up at the sound of crunching gravel. In the rear-view it sees a BIKE COP pulling onto the shoulder behind it. The big KAWASAKI 1100 idles up next to the T-1000, still seated in the cruiser.

Sarah sits at the picnic table. The weapons are cleaned and her work is done. She hasn't slept in twenty-four hours and she seems to have the weight of the whole world on her shoulder. She draws her knife from its belt sheath. Idly starts to carve something on the table top... the letter "N".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A114 NOT FAR AWAY, John and Terminator are packing the Bronco for the trip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A115 ON SARAH, AT THE TABLE as she looks up from her carving, thinking. She watches Salceda's kids playing nearby... wrestling with a mutty dog and loving it. Sarah watches Yolanda walking her toddler by her hands. Backlit, stylized. She looks over at John. Loading guns and supplies.

A116 ANGLE ON kids playing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A117 SARAH'S HEAD droops. She closes her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A118 TIGHT ON small children playing. Different ones. Wider now, to reveal a playground in a park. Very idyllic. A dream playground, crowded with laughing children playing on swings, slides, and a jungle gym. It could be the playground we saw melted and frozen in the post-nuclear desolation of 2029. But here the grass is vibrant green and the sun is shining.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
118A Sarah, short-haired, looking drab and paramilitary, stands outside the playground. An outsider. Her fingers are hooked in a chain-link fence and she is staring through the fence at the young mothers playing with their kids. A grim-faced harbinger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
118B Some girls play skip-rope. Their sing-song weaves through the random burbling laughter of the kids. One of the young mothers walks her two-year-old son by the hands. She is wearing a pink waitress uniform. She turns to us, laughing. It is Sarah. Beautiful. Radiant. Sarah from another life, uncontaminated by the dark future. She glances at the strange woman beyond the fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
118C Grim-faced Sarah presses against the fence. She starts shouting at them in SLOW MOTION. No sound comes from her mouth. She grabs the fence in frustration, shaking it. Screaming soundlessly. Waitress Sarah's smile falls. Then returns as her little boy throws some sand at her. She laughs, turns away, as if the woman at the fence were a shadow, a trick of light.
</DIRECTION>

118D-118F OMITTED

118G THE SKY EXPLODES. The children ignite like match heads. Sarah is burning, screaming silently, everything silent and overexposed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
118H THE BLAST WAVE HITS... devouring the cowering mothers and children. Sarah's scream merges with the howl of the wind as the shockwave rips into her, blasting her apart and she...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wakes up. All is quiet and normal. The children are still playing nearby. Less than fifteen minutes have gone by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bathed in sweat, Sarah sits hunched over the table. Every muscle is shaking. She is gasping. Sarah struggles to breathe, running her hand through her hair which is soaked with sweat, She can escape from the hospital, but she can't escape from the madness which haunts her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks down at the words she has carved on the table, amid the scrawled hearts and bird-droppings. They are: "NO FATE." Something changes in her eyes. She slams her knife down in the table top, embedding it deeply in the words. Then gets up suddenly and we --

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

A120 LONG LENS on Sarah walking toward us, striding across the compound with grim purpose. She carries a small nylon pack and a CAR-15 assault rifle. Her face is an impassive mask. She has become a terminator.

A120A JOHN LOOKS UP from his work in time to see Sarah throw the rifle behind the seat of their stolen pickup, jump in and start it. She slams it in gear. Salceda walks up to John.

Dyson's kids, Danny and Blythe, are playing in the halls with a radio- controlled off-road truck. Danny drives and Blythe scampers after it, trying to catch it. They stop in the hall outside Dyson's study and sees him working at his terminal. Danny puts a finger to his lips, shushing Blythe. His expression is mischievous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
129B With the silencer in place, Sarah eases back the bolt and then slips it forward, chambering a .223 round. Then she lies down on the embankment. He cheek pressed against the cool rifle-stock, she slides one hand slowly forward to brace the weapon, taking the weight on her elbow. Her other hand slips knowingly to the trigger.

Her expression is cold, impassive. She looks through the scope at the man in the house. She feels nothing as she raises the rifle.

132A LOW ANGLE as Danny's Bigfoot truck roars toward us -- FILLING FRAME. Thump. It hits Dyson's foot. He jerks, startled, and looks down as -- POP!! 132B His monitor screen is BLOWN OUT spraying his with glass. He jerks back, utterly shocked... and spins to see the huge hole blown through the window behind him. This saves him as K-THUMP! -- the second shot blows the top of his high-backed chain into an explosion of stuffing an inch from his head. Instinctively he dives to the carpet as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM BLAM BLAM -- rounds blast through the window, tearing into his desk and computer, blowing his keyboard into shrapnel. 132C With the monitor screen blown out, the room is in darkness. Sarah can't see Dyson now, down behind his desk. She puts round after round into the heavy desk, blasting one side of it into kindling.

132D Dyson, scared out of his mind, has his face jammed against the carpet, terrified to move. He sees his kids in the hall.

132F ON THE FLOOR, Dyson flinches as chucks of wood and shattered computer components shower down on him. He looks desperately toward the door, but knows he'd be totally exposed. He'd never make it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARAH's rifle empties with a final CLACK! She throws it down and draws her .45 smoothly from a shoulder base. She starts toward the house, snapping back the slide on the pistol, chambering a round. She is in a fast, purposeful walk, keeping her eyes fixed on the target. She is utterly determined to kill this man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM UNDER THE DESK Dyson can see a sliver in the backyard. He sees Sarah's feet as she strides toward him. He tenses to make a break for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah raises the pistol, eyes riveted ahead, controlling her breathing. Dyson springs up in a full-tilt sprint. She tracks him. He hooks a foot on the cord of a toppled disk drive. BOOM! Her shot blows apart a lamp where his head was. He hits the floor hard, but keeps moving, scrambling forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crunch of glass behind his as Sarah's dark form is framed in the blown-out floor-to-ceiling window. Dyson leaps toward the hall. BOOM! Her second shot spins him. He hits the floor in the hallway. Tarissa is screaming. Dyson struggles forward, stunned. There is a .45-caliber hole clean through his left shoulder. He smears the wall with blood as he staggers up. Looking back, he sees the implacable figure behind him, coming on.

We see her psyching herself to pull the trigger... needing now to hate this man she doesn't know. It's a lot harder face-to-face. She is bathed in sweat, and it runs into her eyes. Blinking, she wipes it fast with one hand, then gets it back on the gun. The .45 is trembling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON SARAH as we see the forces at war behind her eyes. She looks into the faces of Dyson, Tarissa, Blythe, Danny. Sarah takes a sharp breath and all the muscles in her arms contract as she tenses to fire. But her finger won't do it. She lowers the gun very slowly. It drops to her side in one hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the breath and energy seems to go out of her. She weakly raises her other hand in a strange gesture, like "Stay where you are, don't move". As if, should they move, the fragile balance might tip back the other way. She backs away from them slowly, panting. It's as if she's backing away in terror from what she almost did. She reaches a wall and slumps against it. Slides down to her knees. The gun falls limply from her fingers. She rests her cheek against the wall.

TERMINATOR grasps the skin and strips is off his forearm like a surgeon rips off a rubber glove. It comes off with a sucking rip, leaving a bloody skeleton.

Dyson looks like that guy on the Sistine Chapel wall, the damned soul... eyes fixed and staring with terrifying knowledge. His shoulder is bandaged. Terminator's arm is wrapped with a blood-soaked bandage below the elbow. The steel forearm and hand gleam in the harsh kitchen light.

EXT. BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the face of the building EXPLODES in an eruption of glass and fire. Remains of the second-floor windows shower the parking lot and a huge fireball rolls out, leaping into the sky. The cops look up, stunned. The helicopter banks away from the heat. Burning debris falls among the cop cars and a number of officers break ranks, pulling back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONLY ONE OF THEM seems to be moving with purpose. A BIKE COP who has just arrived drives through the disorganized crowd, directly toward the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
171A T-1000 guns the bike up a ramp to a pedestrian bridge which crosses from a parking structure to the Cyberdyne building. It enters on the second floor, which is now a burning maze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECOND FLOOR/OFFICE/CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
T-1000 drives into the smoky wreckage. It draws a Hoechler and Koch MPK machine pistol and cruises slowly into the firelit offices, scanning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
172A IN THE CORRIDOR the bike skirts flaming wreckage as it idles forward. T-1000 scans the leaping shadows for its prey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GROUND FLOOR/ELEVATOR/LOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator doors part and Terminator eases a look out into the corridor. The walls on either side of him ERUPT WITH BULLET HITS. The SWATs have the lobby end of the corridor blocked off. They're totally trapped, cut off and screwed.

173A The SWATs fire a tear-gas grenade toward the elevators. It spews the vicious CS gas out in a swirling cloud which envelops Sarah and John, who are pressed against the back wall of the elevator.

<DIRECTION>
He slings the grenade launcher over his shoulder and walks out into the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
173B BLAM. A tear-gas grenade ricochets from wall to wall as it flies down the corridor. It skids to rest in front of Terminator, throwing out a white cloud which quickly fills the corridor. 173C In the elevator, Sarah and John are choking, handing the breathing mask back and forth desperately. They're scarred. This looks like it. 173D ANGLE ON THE SWAT TEAM, gripping their weapons at the mouth of the corridor. They watch the boiling cloud, waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
173E THEIR POV -- on the wall of boiling smoke. A FIGURE APPEARS. Walking Totally unaffected. Terminator emerges from the smoke. Not even misty-eyed. Not what they expected.

</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drop him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
They OPEN FIRE. The corridor is filled with CRACKING THUNDER. The rounds tear into Terminator's chest. Stomach. Face. Thighs. His leather jacket leaps and jerks as the rounds hit him. The SWATs think the guy's wearing body armor or something. They keep firing. The rounds tear into him, staggering him slightly, but he keeps moving.

<DIRECTION>
Terminator draws his .45 smoothly. Unhurried. He shoots the nearest man in the left thigh. As he screams and drops, Terminator shoots him in the right thigh. Terminator bends down and picks up the shrieking man's weapon... the TEAR-GAS LAUNCHER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is one of those new rotary jobs that hold 12 rounds in a big drum. Terminator shoots the next SWAT in the chest with the tear-gas launcher. The gas canister hits the guy's body armor and doesn't penetrate. But it's like getting slugged in the stomach with a full- swing from a baseball bat. The SWAT fold double and hits the tiles, gasping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terminator is an image from Hell, a tall figure in shredded black leather, streaked with blood. One eye is a bloody socket, the metal eye-servo glistening. The flesh of one cheek hangs down in tatters, revealing the chrome cheekbone beneath. The whole front of his jacket is blown open, revealing his metal armor chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The remaining SWATs start to fall back. One turns to run and -- KPOW! A gas canister nail him in the back, sending him sprawling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
173F Terminator fires three gas canisters into the lobby. It fills rapidly with the white gas, cutting the visibility to a few feet. It is total pandemonium. SWAT LEADER crouches in the fog, white- knuckling the rifle. Terminator looms suddenly out of the mist right in front of him. POOM! Terminator drills him in the leg with the .45. As the guy screams and drops rifle to clutch his leg, Terminator rips his gas mask off. The SWAT leader drops writhing to the floor, choking and gagging, clutching his bleeding thigh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terminator walks up to two SWATs at the front doors. POW-POW. Leg and leg. He snatches their masks as they fall. The gunfire has stopped. Nobody an see anything. Screams and whimpers echo in the smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smoke boils out of the front door as a figure emerges. Firing the tear-gas launcher with one hand, Terminator launches all remaining rounds among the cop vehicles. Unprotected officers run, choking and half-blind, slamming into cars and tripping over each other. It is a total rout.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE SWAT VAN on of the SWATs is rapidly handing out the remaining masks to unprotected cops. A FIGURE appears out of the smoke beside him. He looks up. His mask is ripped off and he is handed the empty launcher. Instinctively he catches it. Terminator grabs his flak vest with one hand and sails him out into the mist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
175A INT. SWAT VAN
</DIRECTION>

Terminator strides the length of the van and climbs into the driver's seat. No keys in the ignition. He flips down the sun visor. The keys fall into his hand. He starts the van and slams it into gear.

INT./EXT. LOBBY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tear gas has cleared to a thin haze. The uninjured SWATs are tending their wounded. They look up at the sound of shouts and a roaring engine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
176A THE SWAT VAN CRASHES INTO THE LOBBY in an explosion of glass and debris. Cops scatter as the van screeches across the lobby in a smoking one-eighty, sliding to a stop across the corridor which leads to the bank of elevators. Terminator backs up until -- crunch -- he seals the corridor with the back of the van.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
176B Sarah and John stumble along the corridor, coughing. They leap into the back of the van and Terminator hits the throttle. The van roars across the lobby and exits through blown-out windows.

INT./EXT SECOND FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
T-1000, astride the Kawasaki, looks down from a second-floor office and sees the van tearing across the parking lot with the remaining cops firing at it. It knows. It looks around. Analyzing options. It sees the helicopter hovering outside the building at the end of this corner office block... It twists full throttle on the powerful bike. Roars through the office, accelerating fast, straight at the windows --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
T-1000 BLASTS OUT THROUGH THE GLASS, airborne on the motorcycle. It rockets across the gap to the hovering chopper and -- 178A SLAMS into the canopy. The impact of bike and rider pitches the chopper radically. The startled PILOT fights to regain control as the bike tumbles to the pavement below. 178B The T-1000 doesn't. It clings to the shattered canopy. Nightmarishly, the pilot watches as the T-1000 smashes its head through the plexiglass canopy and rapidly POURS ITSELF through the jagged hole. It reforms instantly into its previous self on the passenger seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
178C It hurls the pilot out of the chopper and slides into the driver's seat. The chopper is auto-rotating, spinning out of control. It drops toward the parking lot. T-1000 recovers control ten feet above the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
178D Cops hits the deck as the tail-boom swings around, going over them by inches. The chopper lifts out in a power climb, roaring away across the parking lot toward the fleeing SWAT van.

INT./EXT. SWAT VAN/HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terminator looks back at his two passengers as he turns the boxy van onto a divided highway. Sarah and John are catching their breath, still coughing from the CS gas. Terminator look to the rear-view mirror. He sees the xenon searchlight of the chopper behind them, gaining.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah looks around the inside of the SWAT van. It is a rolling armory. There are rifles, ballistic vests, all manner of equipment.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John, get under these. Hurry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
He sits against the front bulkhead of the van and she pile bullet- proof vests on top of him, completely covering him. Then she grabs two M-16s from the wall-rack and loads them. She starts on a shotgun as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SWAT van weaves through sparse traffic at high speed. Terminator slews the unstable van around cars and trucks which seem to be crawling. The van hits it top speed of eighty. They swerve to miss the back end of A WHITE 18-WHEEL TANKER. 180A The chopper swings in behind them, closing fast. 180B T-1000 reaches through the shattered canopy with the MPK machine pistol and FIRES. The back of the can CLANGS WITH HITS. The door windows are BLOWN IN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terminator weaves the van, trying to throw off the T-1000's aim. The unstable vehicle screeches and wobbles on the edge of control. One of the doors is kicked open. Sarah, wearing a ballistic vest, crouches in the doorway, whipping up the M-16. SHE OPENS FIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
180C Bullets riddle what's left of the chopper's canopy as the T-1000 returns fire. The van is stitched with hits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
180D INSIDE THE VAN holes are punched through the thin sheet-metal walls, ripping up the interior. The vests covering John are hit repeatedly. We see that Sarah has hung two Kevlar vests on the inside of the back door and she ducks behind these as bullets hit around her. She pops back out and fires in controlled bursts. The M-16 empties and she grabs another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
180E Terminator serves around a car which is changing lanes, hitting it and knocking it skidding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OMITTED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
181A Sarah reloads and keeps firing. The van swerves around a Toyota. A moment later the helicopter passes it, the rotor just clearing the top of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
181B T-1000 FIRES the machine pistol. 181C Sarah has popped out to fire. She takes a HIT in the thigh, and several rounds hammer into her Kevlar vest. She is thrown back onto the floor of the van. She lies there, an exposed target...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
181D Terminator sees the T-1000 preparing to fire again. He locks up the van's brakes. Tires scream as the vehicle shimmies. Sarah is thrown forward, sliding up to the bulkhead next to John. And the helicopter SLAMS RIGHT INTO THE BACK OF THE VAN. The rotor disintegrates. The back doors of the van are crushed in as the canopy, the whole front of the fuselage is HAMMERED INTO JUNK, trapping the T-1000 inside the twisted metal. The chopper hits the pavement, flips, sideways, and cartwheels... smashing itself into a shapeless mass of twisted metal. It falls away behind the van, tumbling end over end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
182A Terminator fights to control the van, which is fishtailing violently from the impact. It smashes up against the center divider, screeching along the concrete, and then pulls away. Terminator puts the hammer down and the van accelerates. He swerves to avoid an UGLY PICKUP crawling like a snail ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE RIGHT FRONT FENDER of the van, crumpled by slamming the wall, is sawing into the tire. The tire blows and peels off the clean rim. The steel wheel grinds across the pavement, striking trails of sparks, and the van slides sideways and topples -- STEEL SCREAMS on pavement as the van grinds to a stop on its side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
182B INSIDE THE VAN, John crawls to Sarah, who is groaning and holding her bleeding leg. She is white and shocky. Terminator starts to extricate himself from the crumpled driver's seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK DOWN THE ROAD, THE HELICOPTER wreckage is a crumpled ball of junk metal, unrecognizable. Behind it, the TANKER TRUCK brakes hard, shuddering and groaning, trying to stop. The big tires lock up in clouds of tire-smoke. The rig comes to a shuddering stop just short of the wrecked chopper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
183A The shaken DRIVER jumps down. The behind the wreckage a cop emerges, walking toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn, are you alri --

</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
183B SSSHHCK! T-1000 drives a blade through the man's abdomen and walks on past without slowing, or even looking at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
183C It climbs into the open cab of the tanker. Releases the brake. As the truck bellows are rolls forward we see the large blue letters on the side which say "CRYOCO INC. LIQUID NITROGEN SUPPLY'.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE SWAT VAN John and Terminator are carrying Sarah out of the wreck. Terminator has the M-79 slung over his shoulder, the bandolier of grenades, and his .45 stuck in his waistband. John has borrowed a 12-GAUGE RIOT GUN from the SWATs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
184A The pickup they passes seconds earlier pulls up to them. The DRIVER, A Hispanic guy in his 50's, is getting out to help them. Terminator and John hear a CRASH and look back as the helicopter wreckage is knocked aside by the accelerating tanker truck.

<DIRECTION>
The guy seems to know better than to try and stop him as Terminator slides Sarah into the front seat and climbs in behind the wheel. John runs to the passenger side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TANKER ROARS, spewing smoke from its chrome stacks as it shifts up through the gears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terminator slams the pickup in gear, checking the rear-view. The tanker is a hundred feet behind them now, and really moving. Terminator puts the throttle down, but the pickup is and old slug loaded down by a heavy home-made wooden camper-shell. It accelerates slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TANKER slams into one end of the SWAT van, spinning it out of the way with a roar and screech of twisting metal. The 18-wheeler shifts to a higher gear, still accelerating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. PICKUP TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the tanker right behind them, Terminator cuts the wheel, swerving the pickup back and forth across the lanes. The big rig stays right on them, it tanker whiplashing violently.

<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faster! He's right on us!

Terminator doesn't reply. He rapidly unslings the blooper, still around his neck, and reaches for a grenade.

<DIRECTION>
LOW ANGLE ON THE TRACTOR-TRAILER as it roars right up to the lens, filling frame with chrome and lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
191A K-WHAM!! It rams the backs of the pickup, sending it skidding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
191B Then the T-1000 pulls the tractor trailer up alongside the pickup and crabs over, sandwiching it against the center divider. The spinning chrome hubs tear into the passenger side door and the guard rail screeches along the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pickup bucks and shakes insanely. It ricochets violently between the big-rig and the divider Horrible SCREECH of tortured steel. Sparks pour in sheets of fire from both sides. The windshield shatters as the door-posts buckle in. Metal and glass shower in through the side windows. The frame twists and buckles. John feels like the fillings are being shaken right out of his teeth. The wooden camper disintegrates, falling away as kindling behind them.
</DIRECTION>

191C INT. TANKER CAB

T-1000 holds the wheel hard over, mercilessly grinding the pickup. The whole rig jerks and shakes with the violence of the sustained hammering.

Terminator slams the shattered windshield with the palm of his hand. Held together by the plastic laminate, the windshield flops out of its frame. It flies over the top of the truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
191E Terminator pushes his upper body out over the dashboard and stands up. He turns and aims the M-79 one-handed. 191F POOM! The grenade misses the T-1000 by less than a foot. It EXPLODES against the front bulkhead of the tanker, almost at the top. Liquid nitrogen pours from the opening, swept back by the 60-mph windstream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
191G The big-rig swerves as T-1000 regains control. The tanker swings like a pendulum behind the cab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
191H The pickup accelerates, getting back out in front by a few yards. Behind it the big-rig is trailing a swirling comet-tail of nitrogen vapor. It is gaining again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terminator, still standing, opens the breech and starts to reload. 191I John cuts across the highway and takes an OFF RAMP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
191J T-1000 swerves the smoking behemoth across the lanes and down the ramp after him, still accelerating. It is twenty feet behind them and closing when Terminator closes the breech and FIRES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
191K The grenade hits the front grill and EXPLODES. The radiator is destroyed, along with half the hood. Steam blasts out, obscuring the whole front of the truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
191L The semi rams the back of the pickup again. Spewing smoke and vapor like some demon locomotive, the tractor-trailer pounds into the back of the pickup. Driving it right through the intersection at the bottom of the ramp, and straight toward --

<DIRECTION>
EXT. STEEL MILL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chase has led them to an area of heavy industry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GATES are blasted off their hinges as the semi rams the pickup right through them. Terminator struggles to reload amid the chaos and impacts. He has THREE GRENADES LEFT on the bandolier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John isn't even steering. They are just being pushed. There's nothing he can do. They are rocketing down the broad thoroughfare which leads directly to the MAIN BUILDING of the plant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
192A Terminator pulls himself onto the roof of the pickup. He leaps to the bed, takes two powerful strides and -- Leaps onto the semi. He climbs rapidly onto the hood. 192B And FIRES POINT BLANK THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. Right into T-1000's face. The EXPLOSION blows out all the glass and fills the cab with smoke and fire Terminator grabs onto the air-horn as the truck starts to SHUDDER AND 192C SCREAM. IT IS JACK-KNIFING. Almost dream-slow the cab begins to swing sideways, until its tires are shrieking over the pavement. The tractor is smashed back at right-angles to the tanker-trailer which begins to slide broadside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
192D The juggernaut bucks and shudders as the tires and smoke sideways across the pavement. It begins to topple. Terminator hold on as the side of cab becomes the top. With an unholy scream, like the unoiled hubs of Hell, the whole rig slides on its side at 60 mph toward the steel mill. A sheet of sparks sixty feet wide trails behind it on the pavement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
192E John sees what's behind him, then snaps around to see the building looming right in front. The huge rolling doors are partly open. No choice. He steers right through them into the mill, as --

Terminator slams to the floor of the mill and rolls, as -- The tanker-trailer smashed into a massive concrete support at one side of the doors. Thunderous carnage of twisting metal. o 193A It splits wide open. A river of liquid nitrogen pours out at -230.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
193B John hits the brakes, sliding out of control. He slows almost to a stop but hits a steel support column head-on. He and Sarah are slammed forward, hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
193C Terminator, still clutching the M-79 blooper, rolls and slides across the floor. He smashes through a railing and slams up against the base of a massive machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
193D The semi cab swings about the trailer wreckage, into the building, and shudders to a stop. Liquid nitrogen sprays over the cab, flooding out around it in a HISSING WAVEFRONT OF ULTRACOLD. Freezing vapor swirls everywhere, obscuring the wreck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
193E TERMINATOR lies still. A beat. Then he rolls weakly, rising on one elbow to survey the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
193F IN THE WRECKED PICKUP, John stirs. He is stunned, and blood runs from his nose. Dazed, he realizes he is in a steel mill. There are sirens, and he can see men running... shouting. He turns and sees what they are running from...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
193G The wall of nitrogen vapor spreads from the demolished tanker. It is a strange vista of fire and ice. The huge SMELTERS pour out orange light and fire from the sides of the huge galley, while the freezing vapor rolls down the center.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
193H TIGHT ON THE WRECK. A billowing gray cloud. Deep inside, the shape of the cab in visible. A FIGURE emerges, pulling itself out. It drops to the floor. The hissing, boiling river of liquid nitrogen flows around its feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The T-1000 staggers, moving slowly, painfully. It has finally been affected by something. Its feet are freezing to the ground as it walks...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
194A CLINK! One of its feet breaks off at a glassy angle. It stumbles forward, and -- 194B Its other foot snaps off. As it catches its balance on the stump of its other ankle, 194C the whole lower leg shatters at the impact. It topples forward to its knees. Catches itself on one hand. Liquid nitrogen flows around the hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the hand is stuck to the pavement. 194D The T-1000 pulls and... CLINK! The hand snaps off at the wrist. It looks stupidly at the glassy stump of a wrist. For the first time we see an expression on its face we know to be a true one... The expression is pain. Agony. Its mouth opens in a soundless scream as the hoar-frost races up its legs, across its body. 194E And that's the position it freezes in. It has become a statue, kneeling in the frozen vapor, that surprised look of agony frozen on its face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The liquid nitrogen stops flowing and begins to evaporate. 194F Terminator, just beyond the boundary of the cold, can see the T-1000 clearly. He draws his .45 and aims.

195A TERMINATOR. On his knees, he looks into the dissipating cloud of vapor. The heat of the furnaces has evaporated all the liquid nitrogen.

John looks back in new terror as --

The T-1000 rises to man-height. It is still in mercury form, but its features are forming rapidly. It takes its first step after them. Sarah stumbles and they pull her up.

INT, MAIN GALLERY

The T-1000 steps INTO FRAME. Fully formed. The hell-fire light glints on its impassive cop face. It walks forward. At first it seems unaffected by its crystallization but --

<DIRECTION>
203A ANGLE ON ITS HAND as it touches a railing in passing. The railing is covered with O.S.H.A. yellow-and-black safety tape. The hand turns yellow and black, the color fading to normal by about the elbow. It rips the hand from the railing with difficulty. There is a sound like adhesive tape ripping off a surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
203B The T-1000 looks at its yellow-and-black striped hand. It wills the hand back to normal. We see ripples of "static" or system noise moving subtly over the surface of its body. It's starting to "glitch".

203C TRACKING WITH THE T-1000'S FEET. With each step, the pattern on the tile floor "invades" its lower legs. Fades as the foot is lifted. Returns as it is set down. The foot is trying to meld with the floor. The chameleonic function is out of control. The T-1000 is losing it. It moves forward, searching. It rounds the corner, entering the aisle between the furnaces.

Terminator sees the SILHOUETTE closing on them through the smoky gleam. The T-1000 breaks into loping run when it sees them, Terminator turns to Sarah over John.

John shakes his head no. The T-1000 is almost on them.
</DIRECTION>
<TERMINATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	RUN!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERMINATOR>
<DIRECTION>
John runs, dragging, half-carrying Sarah as best he can. She can barely stay conscious. Half-running, delirious, she stumbles and drops to her knees. John pulls but she can't rise.

John looks back to see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
204A TERMINATOR trying to load the M-79. With his shattered hand, he can barely maneuver is last grenade into the breech. T-1000 smacks the weapon out of his hands. It clatters to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The grenade spins across the floor, rolling under some machinery. Terminator lunges, slamming the T-1000 against a wall with all his weight. The battle is joined.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
204B JOHN AND SARAH have reached the back of the aisle. It is a cul-de- sac, blocked on the end by the base of an IMMENSE SMELTER CRUCIBLE. They turn to watch the titans battle in silhouette, backlit by the molten sparks falling from the furnaces above. The battle which will decide their fate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
204C Terminator grabs the T-1000 and hurls it with awesome force against the opposite wall of the narrow alley. In less time than it would take to turn, the 204D T-1000 morphs trough itself, front to back... face emerging from the back of its head. 204E It comes off the wall straight at Terminator, who smashes his good fist into its face. The pile-driver blow buries Terminator's fist almost to the elbow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
204F But the T-1000's head morphs in a split-second into a hand which grips Terminator's wrist, and the head "emerges" somewhere else, the geometry shifting faster than we can follow. 204G The T-1000 slams Terminator into a large machine, jamming his arm into the moving works. A massive sliding bar SCISSORS HIS ARM, smashing it into junk at the elbow, pinning him in the machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terminator strains against the machine pinning him. We hear his servos whining with overload. The T-1000 turns and lopes toward Sarah and John.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah screams and hurls John into a gap between the machines. He falls into a maze of pipes and girders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAZE OF MACHINES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHN turns to see her in the entrance of the narrow gap. She could follow him but she doesn't. SUDDENLY a dark mass moves toward him. John gasps as a huge steel counterweight, driven by a chain 6 inches thick, slides toward him. He rolls out of the way. When he looks back, he cannot see the opening.

<DIRECTION>
TERMINATOR strains to reach a 6-foot steel bar lying near him. Steel workers use them to move the red-hot ingots around. He gets hold of the end and uses it as a lever. With titanic effort he spreads the massive components which are holding him, and withdraws him arm, which is severed at the elbow. Dangling junk hands from the crushed joint.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARAH has lost sight of John. It is much of a goodbye as they will have. She turns as the T-1000 closes on her. She is half-slumped against the sooty machines, looking barely conscious. She struggles to load a shell into the empty weapon. At the last instant she whips up the RIOT GUN and FIRES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A207 T-1000's face is blown open, but quickly reforms as it closes on her. She fumbles to get another shell into the magazine but -- A208 THUNK! A steel needle slams through her shoulder, pinning her. The polymorphic killer cocks back its other hand. The index finger extends as a gleaming needle, toward her eye --
</DIRECTION>
<T_1000>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call to John. Now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</T_1000>
<DIRECTION>
207C WHAM!! SOMETHING whistles down on the T-1000 with such force that is cleaves it head and body in two down to the naval. The 6-foot steel bar is imbedded in its body. Terminator hurls the killer off Sarah.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
207D The T-1000 pulls the steel shaft out of itself and attacks him with fury. Swinging again and again. Hammering Terminator back. Terminator falls back against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the T-1000 is an enormous I-beam, hanging from two chains. It is used to lift ingots into the smelters, and it runs on a linear track. 207E The T-1000 grabs the I-beam and rolls it down the track. Straight at Terminator. The two-ton girder smashes into his chest, crushing the armor. The T-1000 pulls the I-beam back, and then heaves it forward again. Terminator turns and takes the second blow on the shoulder. We hear metal crush and break inside him. He sags, turning to grip the wall... The third blow slams into his back, smashing his spine and pelvis. We hear servos ratcheting and failing. He drops to his knees, crucified on a wall of machinery. The fourth blow is centered between his shoulder blades. Sound of crushing metal. His skull is partially caved in. He slides to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
207F ON THE T-1000, emotionless as it walks forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
207G TERMINATOR is a pathetic shape on the floor. He is trying to crawl, feebly. Dragging his malfunctioning legs behind the crushed spine. His arm stump screeches on the tile floor as he inches himself forward. His exposed machine eye burns red with determination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see his prize. He has the M-79, with the breech still open, cradled in the crook of his ruined arm. He good hand, the exposed steel one, is reaching for the last grenade, which is visible under the skirt of the massive smelter base. His metal fingers reach out for it as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
207H The T-1000 raises the heavy steel bar over his head and stabs it down with unbelievable force. It punches into Terminator's back, through a gap in the shattered armor. The T-1000 levers it back and forth, widening the hole. Then is raises the pointed bar again and slams it down. It punches right through. Emerging from Terminator's chest. And into the floor. He is pinioned. The cyborg sags face down and stop moving. The light goes out of his eye.

John scuttles like a rat through the gut of the smelter. Above him, vast machines churn untended. He hears a voice... SARAH'S Calling low and urgent to him.

	John? John? Can you hear me? Where are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
208A He crawls out of the shadows. Onto a landing next to one of the SMELTER CRUCIBLES. Molten steel glows bright orange in the crucible of the furnace. Heat shimmers the air, giving everything a hallucinatory quality.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John sees Sarah nearby, limping toward him. She can barely move, her leg bathed in blood. He runs toward her.

TIGHT ON SARAH, her stoic face, as she hobbles forward, reaching out to him. Something rises behind her, OUT OF FOCUS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER, IDENTICAL, SARAH... but this one has a shotgun. Aimed right at us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
209A JOHN freezes. Which is which? He looks down. The first Sarah's feet are melded with the floor, sucking and fusing with the tiles as she walks. They have the color and pattern of the tiles up to the knee.

209B John dives aside. The Sarah-form spins, changing into you-know-who. Sarah starts unloading the shotgun into it. BOOM! It staggers back. K-CHAK. She chambers another round. BOOM! It staggers again. K-CHAK. BOOM! And again. And again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
209C The T-1000 is blown back a step and Sarah advances with each shot. The craters in the T-1000's body "heal" slowly. Its power is waning. She FIRES again. And again. Her eyes blazing with feral intensity. She walks it back, right to the edge of the pit of MOLTEN STEEL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
K-CHAK... CLICK. She's empty. The T-1000 is right at the edge. In a second it will recover its composure, as its crater hits close slowly. She has failed. Now it will kill them both, Except...

CLOSEUP TERMINATOR, as the chain drive brings it into view. Half human flesh, half chrome steel. His red eye gazes right at us as he -- FIRES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
210A The T-1000 takes the round in the belly. The grenade EXPLODES inside its body. A huge hole is blown clean through it, and it is ripped open and peeled back, half inside-out. It topples into the molten steel and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The T-1000's head and upper body reappear above the molten steel. It is screaming. A terrifying, inhuman siren of a scream. It is changing, morphing, transforming into anything and everything it's ever been so rapidly the eye can barely follow it -- We catch a glimpse of Janelle Voight checkered with the linoleum tile colors, Lewis the Guard with knives exploding from his face, other faces, switching at a stroboscopic rate now... a face every two frames until they merge into one face --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The T-1000 screams and slips beneath the surface of the molten steel. We see liquid silver running in dissipating whorls over the superheated surface... until it vanishes, swirling into nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHN runs to Sarah. She stands staring into the pit. The empty shotgun slips from her fingers. Clatters to the floor. He sees that she's okay and he runs to the fallen Terminator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
212A The crippled cyborg is trying to rise. Its servos whine and stutter. It pathetically lifts itself to a kneeling position, collapses... tries again. John lifts for all he's worth. Sarah joins them, helping. The help the crippled machine get on its feet. It can barely stand.
