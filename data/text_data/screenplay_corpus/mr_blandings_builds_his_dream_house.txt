EXT. A LARGE NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As CAMERA MOVES UP it and TOWARD a window:
</DIRECTION>
<BILL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For fourteen years Jim and Muriel had been living in their apartment over on East Seventy-fourth Street. It was just another of those wonderful crisp September mornings and the Blandings were still asleep. Just like millions of other people in good old Manhattan -- New York City -- U.S.A.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA GOES THROUGH the window and INTO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BLANDINGS' BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim (Cary Grant) and Muriel (Myrna Loy) Blandings are asleep in twin beds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room, not large to begin with, gives us the impression of being cluttered up and overcrowded because the beds, oversized chest of drawers, dressing table and chaise lounge take up an inordinate amount of space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND of an alarm clock going off. Jim awakens, yawns himself into hazy consciousness, gropes about on the night table for the clock; it isn't there. He slips out of bed, and rubbing his eyes, blindly moves toward the dresser. The circuitous path, which he accomplishes with sleepy dexterity, entails going around the chaise lounge, just missing the ominously pointed edge of Muriel's dressing table, deftly stepping over the low dressing table chair and finally reaching the chest of drawers upon which is the clock. He turns off the alarm and yawningly starts back over the same path. We get the feeling that Jim makes this sleepy excursion every waking morning of his life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back at his bed, Jim sits down, and, yawning loudly, gropes with his feet for his slippers. Before he can find them, however, he begins to doze off and slowly tilts back toward the pillow, pulling the covers over him. In a moment he is sound asleep. Muriel's arm automatically stretches out and shakes Jim into consciousness. As he painfully reawakens and starts to rise, Muriel's arm disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We get the impression that this, too, is a regular part of the Blandings' daily routine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim locates his slippers, reaches around for his bathrobe, can't find it, stumbles his way over to the closet, opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CLOSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a fairly good-sized closet but it was never intended to be shared by two people, particularly not Jim and Muriel Blandings. Assuming that they had started out on even terms, it is now obviously Muriel, three-to-one. Her dresses, gowns, slips, seem to obscure his occasional pair of slacks, suit or sports coat. Her shoes neatly line the floor and the shelf above is loaded to the ceiling with her hat boxes, in an orderly but somewhat precarious state of balance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Groping blindly for a robe, Jim feels around and pulls one out. As he slips into the arms, we see it's much too small for him, obviously Muriel's. In disgust he attempts to put it back. Unable to find a hook he finally jams it in between two silk dresses which fall to the floor. As he bends down and gropes for the dresses, he discovers his robe crumpled under them on the floor. He drags the robe out and dons it, leaving the dresses where they fell. With a guilty look at Muriel he closes the closet door and starts out of the bedroom and into the narrow hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A narrow corridor extending the length of the apartment. Off it are doors leading to the bathroom, the childrens' room and the foyer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim shuffles down the hall. He stops at the closed bathroom door, listens, hears the shower, knocks.
</DIRECTION>
<BETSY_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETSY_S_VOICE>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Jim continues down the hall, stops at the closed door of the children's room, knocks. No sound. He opens the door and enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHILDREN'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small room, crowded and cluttered up with the accoutrements of adolescence. Joan, an eleven-year-old is asleep in one of the twin beds. Jim automatically pulls the covers clear off Joan's bed. She awakens, cocks an eye at him.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
As she sleepily stretches and prepares to rise, Jim exits into the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA FOLLOWS Jim through the foyer into the living room, on through the very small combination dining and breakfast nook and into the compact but tiny kitchen. Gussie, the colored cook, greets him heartily.
</DIRECTION>
<GUSSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Morning, Mr. Blandings!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUSSIE>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(a feeble attempt at a smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Gussie takes a glass of hot water, squeezes in a little lemon, stirs and hands it to Jim who gulps it down, makes a slight face and pats his stomach. Gussie hands Jim a cup of black coffee and he starts back toward the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gingerly balancing the cup and saucer, Jim approaches the door to the children's room. With split-second timing, he pauses as the door flies open and Joan, in her bathrobe, towel in hand, rushes out and past him down the hall. She disappears into the bathroom. Jim carefully proceeds down the hall and, as he reaches the bathroom, deftly steps to the left as the door bursts open and Betsy flies by on the way back to her bedroom. All this is done with a timing and shifting of hips of which Knute Rockne might have been proud. Jim continues down the hall, enters the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BLANDINGS' BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Muriel is still asleep as Jim enters, walks over, nudges her.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Muriel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<MURIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURIEL>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coffee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Muriel awakens, sniffs the fresh coffee, smiles, sits up, takes the cup.
</DIRECTION>
<MURIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, dear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURIEL>
<DIRECTION>
They kiss briefly. Muriel starts to sip the coffee as Jim goes to his chest of drawers. It consists of several rows of small drawers above and large drawers below. Jim ruffles through a couple of small drawers, pulls out a suit of underwear, continues noisily and with some annoyance to look through the other drawers.
</DIRECTION>
<MURIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looking for something, dear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURIEL>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(briefly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My socks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<MURIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you look in your sock drawer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURIEL>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(with restraint)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's where I found my underwear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<MURIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(brightly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, try your underwear drawer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURIEL>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm in my underwear drawer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches in and holds up one of Muriel's silk slips.
</DIRECTION>
<MURIEL>
<DIRECTION>
(sipping coffee)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, they must be somewhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(attempt at morning cheeriness)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Socks just don't get up and walk away by themselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURIEL>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(strained patience)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Muriel, I thought the top two-and-a- half drawers were to be mine! I wish you'd tell Gussie --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<MURIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The closet! That's where they are. We put them in the closet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURIEL>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Socks? In the closet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<MURIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, there didn't seem to be any room in the drawers...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURIEL>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And there's so much of it in the closet!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<MURIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...so Gussie and I decided that from now on we'll keep them in a basket on the shelf.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURIEL>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, thanks a lot!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
He strides angrily to the closet, opens the door, reaches up for the basket and pulls it off the shelf. As he does so, all the hat boxes come tumbling down knocking the basket from his hand, the socks spilling on the floor. About to explode, he looks at Muriel.
</DIRECTION>
<MURIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jim, I do wish you'd make an effort to be a little less clumsy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURIEL>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(barely containing himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll try, dear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Jim looks at her barely containing himself, and then puts the hats back in the boxes, jams them back on the shelf where they toter precariously. With bated breath he gingerly closes the closet door. Pause. Silence. He picks up a pair of socks and walks cautiously toward the hall door. Suddenly there is a rumble and crash from inside the closet. Jim exchanges a look with Muriel, is about to say something, changes his mind, exits into the hall. Muriel looks at the closet, sighs, takes another sip of coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim opens the door of the bathroom. There is a scream. He quickly closes the door, scowling with annoyance. A moment later the door opens and Joan emerges, wrapping her robe around her.
</DIRECTION>
<JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
(sharply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father, just one morning I wish you'd knock!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(to her back as she walks away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Morning, dear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Joan disappears into her room as Jim enters the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Very small with a stall shower. Jim takes off his bathrobe, yawns, gets on the scale, looks at the dial, shakes his head. He takes a deep breath, draws in his stomach, looks down, scowls, shrugs, gets off, moves to the mirror. He examines the thinness of his hair, the condition of his tongue, etc. Taking his toothbrush he looks down at the tube he is about to use, frowns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT HE SEES - THE TOOTHPASTE TUBE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT HE SEES - the toothpaste tube. It has been squeezed in the middle, one of Blandings' pet peeves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - JIM METICULOUSLY SMOOTHES OUT THE TUBE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - Jim meticulously smoothes out the tube, rolls up the used portion from the bottom. Then placing a small amount on his brush, he caps the tube, and starts vigorously to brush his teeth. As he does so, he attempts with his free hand, to put the tube back in the medicine cabinet which he opens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - THE MEDICINE CABINET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - the medicine cabinet, loaded to the hilt with medical accumulation of fourteen years of family life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - JIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - Jim. As he pushes the tube into the bulging top shelf, a bottle of iodine falls out. Jim makes a desperate one-handed catch, still brushing his teeth. As he pushes the iodine into the second shelf, a small bottle of pills pops out. Jim catches it, pushes it back into the cabinet. A bottle of cough medicine falls out. He catches it, tries to put it back, finds it won't fit. He looks at the bottle, sniffs it, contemplates its value, throws it in the wastebasket. He finishes washing his mouth, admires his teeth, disrobes and steps into the shower, putting on his shower cap. He reacts, scowls, takes off the cap and turns it upside down, a full cup of water falling out. He reaches out for a towel, dries the inside of the cap, carefully puts it back on his now wet hair. Then he turns the water on and at the first warm spray Jim Blandings' life takes a sharp turn for the better. He starts to sing, a robust bathroom baritone version of "Home On The Range."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim - He stands in front of the washstand lathering his face. Over scene we hear Muriel's voice from the shower. She is singing a lusty chorus of "Home On The Range." Jim picks up his razor and turns to the mirror. He reacts with annoyance, as he discovers it is covered with steam. With weary resignation he takes a towel and starts to rub off the mirror. As he clears one section another clouds up. By the time he gets it all reasonably clear he finds that his lather needs freshening. He grimly relathers his face only to find that the mirror is again clouded up. As he turns with exasperation toward the shower we see Muriel turn off the water, reach for a towel, start to dry herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mirror cleared off, Jim relathers, starts to shave. During this, Muriel, having dried herself and donned her robe, comes into scene.
</DIRECTION>
<MURIEL>
<DIRECTION>
(reaching for toothbrush)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURIEL>
<DIRECTION>
She takes her toothbrush and then opens the cabinet to get the paste. Jim, automatically following the mirror, has to squeeze around in a desperately contorted position as he continues shaving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - MURIEL

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - Muriel. She takes the tube from the cabinet and, squeezing the tube in the middle, applies the paste to her brush.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM AND MURIEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim and Muriel - Placing the tube on the washstand, Muriel closes the cabinet. Jim, still shaving, moves back to his original position as he follows the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Muriel nods, steps back, starts to brush her teeth. They both hum "Home On The Range". Her mouth full, Muriel taps Jim on the shoulder. Without stopping his shaving, Jim moves to one side as Muriel rinses her mouth. She examines her face in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(impatiently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you don't mind, dear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
As he steps back in front of the mirror, Muriel continues to look at her face in the glass, over his shoulder. She decides she needs a little skin lotion.

<MURIEL>
<DIRECTION>
(as she steps in front of him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.

She again opens the cabinet. Jim once more follows the mirror around, nicks his face, gives up, stands glaring arms folded. Muriel takes the lotion from the cabinet.

	You don't have to carry on so. I only said, why don't you get an electric razor?

	Stop writing advertising copy! Hurry up, dear, you'll be late for breakfast.

<DIRECTION>
Muriel exits. Jim sighs, turns back to the mirror and with a few deft strokes finishes shaving. As he reaches for the water faucet, he encounters the tube of toothpaste, squeezed in the middle. Reacting with annoyance, he meticulously smoothes it out and rolls it up from the bottom. He opens the cabinet and gingerly places the tube on the top shelf. The iodine bottle pops out. He grimly catches it, studies his problem, has a solution. With his right hand he starts slowly to close the mirror door. Just before it closes, he slips the bottle into the cabinet with his left hand, quickly slamming the mirror door, trapping the bottle. He reacts masterfully at his triumph, picks up his robe and starts for the door. As he reaches it, there is the SOUND of the cabinet opening and a crash as the bottle obviously hits the washstand. As Jim winces,

INT. THE BLANDINGS' BREAKFAST NOOK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Narrow and small. The four Blandings are at breakfast, Jim and Muriel each reading his section of the morning paper, Betsy pasting a clipping in her notebook, Joan engrossed in a magazine of popular science. As we come in, Gussie, taking off the orange juice, is squeezing by Jim who accordingly and automatically ducks his head as she passes. Jim uncomfortably turns the newspaper to another page, folds it, reacts with pained but controlled exasperation.

	Certainly, mother. What some people don't see is the whole sordid picture. A poor, honest farmer, pushed to the wall by hardship, soil erosion, mortgages, everybody gobbling, gobbling, gobbling, until finally, in desperation, he is "forced to sell," and stoops to the crass commercialism of newspaper advertising.

	-- practically the middle of the night --

Funkhauser looks briefly for a high object over which to display his last bolt of chintz, finds none, settles for Jim's shoulder over which he drapes the cloth, the folds flowing down in front. As Jim reacts:

<FUNKHAUSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that's out! All out! Changed the whole thing! I just couldn't live with it! I said to myself, "Bunny, what are the Blandings? How shall we do them?" And the answer was perfectly obvious. Very American, very grass roots, very blueberry pie -- that sort of thing.

	Now as I see our room, it's definitely Colonial. You know, cobbler's bench, breakfront, pie cooler, student lamp, hooked rug. But everything in good taste. It must not jump out at you and scream: "Look -- see how antique I am!"

<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heaven forbid.

INT. THE CAR - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Jim, Muriel and Mr. Smith - They are driving through a beautiful Connecticut countryside. Mr. Smith, a local real estate dealer, is of that shrewd Yankee breed which specializes in the understatement, underselling school of salesmanship.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There they are, two little fish from New York -- out in the deep deep waters of Connecticut real estate. That's Smith, the real estate salesman. Mighty shrewd cookie in a quiet sort of way. Never thought he'd get a bite this quick.

</BILL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Smith looks speculatively at the Blandings.

Jim takes a deep breath, looks at Muriel as if to say, "Get that air!" Muriel smiles with approval. Jim pats her hand affectionately. Smith reacts.

	They're buyers.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir, Smith, looks like you're finally going to unload the old Hackett place. Now first thing is get 'em a little anxious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Jim slows down the car as they approach a rather picturesque- looking old Connecticut farmhouse. He and Muriel react with approval, look questioningly at Smith. Smith shakes his head, "no," as though to say, "Not nearly good enough for you."

WHAT THEY SEE -- BURROWED INTO THE UPWARD SLOPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What they see -- Burrowed into the upward slope of the land is the old Hackett farmhouse. If the roof seems to sway a little and the massive stone chimney to tilt a bit and the overall condition of board and beam to be a trifle unsteady, charge it up to age, which will be a hundred and seventy years come next April. However, the overall effect is definitely one of picturesque rustic beauty. In the back are a series of barns and behind them the rolling hills known as Bald Mountain.

A letter on Danton & Bascomb's stationery flutters across the screen from right to left. A miniature figure of Jim appears above the house, desperately pushing it back. Over this, we hear:
</DIRECTION>
<JIM_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Dear Mr. Smith: You may inform Mr. Hackett that the very highest I could possibly go --"
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
As a succession of letters flutter across the screen, first from left to right and then from right to left, and the house is jockeyed back and forth, they are punctuated with the following lines:
</DIRECTION>
<SMITH_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Dear Friend Blandings --"

<DIRECTION>
Throughout this Smith's voice remains bland and unperturbed while Jim's has the desperate, frenetic quality of a man being slowly pushed to the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Special Effect concludes with the house finally and firmly at rest on the preordained $11,550. As the antagonists on both sides of the house relax, Smith reaches around in front of the house and shakes hands with Jim. It's a deal!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
About halfway through when the going gets tough, Jim beckons Muriel to help in the losing fight. As they now embrace, Smith and Hackett shake hands in mutual congratulation.

INT. BILL COLE'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A successful lawyer's office, the walls crowded with leather- bound books. Jim and Muriel are seated facing the large desk behind which sits Bill Cole. Bill finishes reading a series of papers, the sum total of correspondence between Jim and Mr. Smith. He sets down the papers, leans back thoughtfully. Jim and Muriel look at him with nervous but eager anticipation.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>

	What do you think, Bill? Steal, huh?

<BILL>

	It certainly is.

Jim looks triumphantly at Muriel.

<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps "steal" is an understatement -- "swindle" might be a little more appropriate.

<JIM>

	Well, it wasn't much, Bill. I just saw a good thing and I --

<BILL>

	First time around you offered ten thousand dollars for fifty acres, right?

</BILL>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What of it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's two hundred dollars an acre. I know that part of Connecticut and one hundred dollars an acre is standard top-gouge price to city slickers. When the natives sell to each other it's around forty or less.

</BILL>
<MURIEL>

<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(on the defensive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, so it's thirty-five! What's the difference? Do you know how many tennis courts you can get on thirty- five acres?

</JIM>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not spending eleven thousand five hundred dollars for tennis courts!

	That's not the point!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<BILL>
<DIRECTION>
(very businesslike)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's precisely the point. We're going to write this Hackett a strong letter and tell him he can either kick in with those fifteen acres, reduce the price, or find another sucker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(rising emotion)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll do no such thing! I'm not going to queer this deal over fifteen broken- down acres!

	Now wait a minute! You can't measure everything on a slide rule. This house has certain intangibles.

</JIM>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what, for instance?

</BILL>
<JIM>

<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That doesn't make this a good buy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bill -- Muriel and I have found what I am not ashamed to call our Dream House. It's like a fine painting. You buy it with your heart, not your head. You don't ask, how much was the canvas, how much was the paint? You look at it and you say, "It's beautiful... I want it," and if it costs a few pennies more you pay it -- and gladly -- because you love it and you can't measure the things you love in dollars and cents!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Muriel looks at Jim, impressed, her face softening with compassion.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(emotionally spent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- that's how I feel about this place. And when I sign those papers Saturday, I can look the world in the face and say, "It's mine! My house! My home! My thirty-five acres!"

INT. HENRY L. SIMMS' LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim, Muriel, Simms. The room is in quiet, good taste, a flagstone fireplace, modern steel casement windows, window seats, etc. The walls are crammed with books and photographs of Simms' handiwork. There are a couple of gold medal citations of his work conspicuously spaced around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simms is a tweedy, pipe-smoking, conservative New Englander, a distinguished-looking local architect. He puffs thoughtfully on his pipe as he looks at a photograph of the old Hackett place, an exact duplicate of the shot we saw through the window frame.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course you could fix up that old house. You can fix up any structure that's still standing. The sills and floors couldn't be worse, I grant you, and I guess you'd have to jack up that west corner at least three feet to make it level. Need new chimney. New roof. Complete new plumbing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sigh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too bad you didn't buy it ten years ago. Could have fixed it up in jig time then, and it would have made some sense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMMS>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(nervously nibbling at his nails)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh... mm-hmmm... uh-huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<SIMMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fact is, before you're through, it would be less expensive to tear the old place down and build a new one, same size.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMMS>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mm. New house...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as the notion sinks in, becomes attractive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	New house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<MURIEL>
<DIRECTION>
(to Simms, with pleasant incredulity)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean... for the same money... we could build a brand new house?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURIEL>
<SIMMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It certainly wouldn't cost any more.

</SIMMS>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(soberly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hm... New house...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and looks thoughtfully at Muriel who raises an interested eyebrow. Then, to Simms:
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(tentatively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just... what sort of thing do you have in mind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<SIMMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I imagine the type of house you'd want would be something in quiet good taste, two story, frame and brick veneer construction -- modern, but of course fitting in with the architectural traditions of the countryside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMMS>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I -- What do you think, Muriel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<MURIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it sounds fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURIEL>
<SIMMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps you'd like to see a basic floor plan --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reaches into file behind him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- something like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMMS>
<DIRECTION>
Simms places the basic floor plan on the desk before him, the Blandings moving around, flanking him. They examine the plan with interest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT THEY SEE -- THE PLAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What they see -- the plan. A simple master plan of a two story house, the names of the various rooms indicated. As he talks, we see Simms' hand, holding a pencil, point out the various rooms
</DIRECTION>
<SIMMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First floor. Living room, study, dining room, kitchen, service porch, maid's room -- upstairs three family bedrooms with two adjoining baths.

</SIMMS>
<DIRECTION>
THREE SHOT. THE BLANDINGS PRAISE THE PLAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREE SHOT. The Blandings praise the plan with the uncompromising expertness of two people who have never seen such a plan before in their lives.
</DIRECTION>
<MURIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's very nice, I'm sure, but -- uh -- well -- doesn't it seem just a little bit conventional?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURIEL>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Simms, if we were going to build a house we want it -- well, you know -- just a little bit different.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'd better point out to you --

Jim's hand reaches the pencil before Simms. Now Simms' fingers and Muriel's drum in unison.

	Just a minute. Do you think --

But Muriel's hand has the pencil.

<BILL>

<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I -- I did?!

What they see - a beautiful pencil and charcoal drawing of their completed prospective house. Under it, in neat letters is printed:

RESIDENCE OF MR. AND MRS. JAMES H. BLANDINGS.

JIM, MURIEL, AND SIMMS.

A sign on a sawhorse - it reads:

OHN W. RETCH AND SON.

Over scene is the thunderous dissonance of the various SOUNDS that go into preliminary construction. A steam shovel in action, a bulldozer, the sawing of wood, and intermittently the loud, earth-shaking crash of a well-digger's rig.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the CAMERA PULLS BACK, we see the machines and workmen at their various tasks. The scene has all the rustic peace of the invasion of Hollandia.

The ANGLE CHANGES, and we see Jim, Muriel, and Bill drive up the improvised driveway very close to the scene of activity.

EXT. AT THE WELL RIG

Tesander, a stolid New England well-digger, the soul of industry and candor, attacks the earth. Jim, followed by Muriel and Bill, walks into scene, stands by, watching him. After a moment:

Tesander shakes his head, "No."

</JIM_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
An efficient clockwise turn of the knob. Pause. An impatient doubletwist of the knob. Pause. A more forceful rattling of the knob, plus a slight kick. A furious rattling, pounding and kicking. The door remains closed.

Jim gives him a look, turns back to the window, sizing up an escape, starts muttering to himself.

Jim swings; the window shatters. Almost simultaneously there is a click and the door to the closet swings open. As Jim turns with a sense of accomplishment, his face falls as he and the others see that the erratic door has opened.

EXT. ROAD AND COVERED BRIDGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two moving vans are approaching the bridge. Behind them is the Blandings' convertible. In it are Jim, Muriel and the children. Behind it and attached is a trailer. After a pause, over this, we hear:
</DIRECTION>
<BILL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So-came thirty days -- and they moved.

	I mean -- we moved.

<DIRECTION>
OTHER END OF BRIDGE AND FORK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The moving vans precede the convertible, make the wrong turn. Jim stops the convertible at the fork and honks as he impatiently gestures to the drivers to turn in the opposite direction. Over this:
</DIRECTION>
<BILL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Jim would say it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the wrong road! Any fool knows that!

EXT. ROAD AT THE HOUSE - DAY

The moving vans turn up the new gravel driveway. Jim stops his car and they all look off at the house, react with pleasant surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT THEY SEE - LONG SHOT - THE HOUSE IS RAPIDLY NEARING COMPLETION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT THEY SEE - LONG SHOT - The house is rapidly nearing completion. A half dozen men are finishing the exterior painting, planing down doors, etc. In front, a couple of men from the nursery are working on the landscaping. For the first time we, as well as the Blandings, see the property as a clean, bright and very attractive new house.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, there she is, bright and shining -- and just about complete -- the residence of Mr. and Mrs. James H. Blandings.

	<DIALOGUE>
	All right! -- Everybody out.

Everybody piles out of the car. As Jim and Muriel walk toward the house away from us and Bill, Muriel sentimentally reaches out, takes Jim's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess you can't blame them for feeling just a little bit proud.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL_S_VOICE>

At the door, Jim stops, indicates that he'd like to carry Muriel across the threshold.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL_S_VOICE>

GROUP SHOT. OVER MURIEL'S PLAYFUL PROTEST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GROUP SHOT. Over Muriel's playful protest, Jim starts to pick her up.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-uh. Watch that sacroiliac. Fifteen years since you've done this sort of thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Jim manages to lift Muriel.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whew! Nice work, Tarzan. Now, let's see if you can make it into the hall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Jim carries Muriel over the threshold and into the foyer.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. Go right in. Don't pay any attention to the sign.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PANS TO a LOW SHOT of a sign on the floor of the foyer. It reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WET VARNISH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - FOYER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - foyer. In the b.g. is a painter, varnishing the floor. He looks up in complete dismay as he sees his newly varnished floor being violated. After a couple of steps, Jim stops, suddenly aware of the painter. The painter rises, throws down his brush, says something caustic.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(imitating painter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't mind me, buddy, I just got through varnishing that floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Jim reacts, raises a tentative foot, the sticky varnish practically holding it to the floor. Jim says something.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whose bright idea was this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The painter says something, points at Muriel. Jim looks darkly and accusingly at Muriel whose weak smile is an admission of guilt.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She just wanted everything to be nice and shiny on the day they moved in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Jim turns and shouts something to the painter.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop painting that floor and put some planks down in here, or some thing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The painter shouts back.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, mister, but take it easy. The Republicans ain't in yet, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Jim reacts, turns and walks back out of the foyer, desperately trying to match his clearly outlined incoming footsteps. Each step is outlined by strands of thick sticky varnish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE FRONT DOOR OF THE HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Jim appears, still carrying Muriel, Betsy and Joan catch his attention, indicate the front wall of the house which is complete except for the windows. Jim reacts.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, fine! A house without windows! We'll just see about that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Abruptly handing Muriel to Bill he starts off. Ahead of him and unnoticed are a layer of newspapers which have been spread out.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look out for those papers!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
But Jim has stepped on the papers. They stick to his feet. After a few steps he is aware of it, tries to get rid of them. After a few hectic but futile attempts, he disgustedly disappears around a corner of the house, the newspapers flapping behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDE OF HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim flaps his way up to a workman who is staring at a pile of window casements.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. REAR OF HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simms and Retch. More window frames are neatly stacked against the wall. Simms and Retch react as they see an angry Jim Blandings flap his way into scene, his varnished shoes having picked up additional paper, shavings, shingles, etc. Retch hands Jim a sheaf of papers.

Bill wanders into scene, looks over Jim's shoulder.

A general flurry of activity; Gussie and several workmen carrying furniture upstairs, unpacking barrels, etc. Muriel, list and samples in hand, is explaining her color scheme to Mr. PeDelford, a polite, cigar-smoking, noncommittal boss painter. In the b.g., casually leaning on the bannister is PeDelford's taciturn and somewhat skeptical-looking assistant.

	It's flowered but I don't want the ceiling to match any of the colors of the flowers. There are some little dots in the background, and it's these dots I want you to match. Not the little greenish dots near the hollyhock leaf, but the little bluish dot between the rosebud and the delphinium blossom. Is that clear?

It is dark outside and getting quite chilly. The children are unpacking a last barrel. They have made a rather unsteady pile of books and boxes, obviously Muriel's personal effects. Jim is in the process of trying to start his first fire in the fireplace. The immediate result is a clouding of the room with smoke. As he backs away, coughing, he bumps into the pile which falls to the floor spilling open a box which contains, among other things, Muriel's diary and a lifetime accumulation of sentimental trinkets.

INT. THE BLANDINGS' LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Note: The house is painted and almost completely furnished.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hard rain beats on the windows. There is a blazing fire in the fireplace. Muriel, in a warm bathrobe, sits near it, comfortably knitting. In fact, the scene is exactly the one Jim has just described, except that the man with slippers, pipe and smoking jacket, reading the paper, is Bill Cole. Near the fire, Bill's rain-drenched jacket, shirt and shoes are hanging up to dry. The cozy tranquillity is broken by a sharp RINGING of the front doorbell.

(rising)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay put. You look too comfortable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA FOLLOWS Bill to the front door. He opens it. A man in raincoat and boots stands there in the pouring, driving rain. The man enters as Bill struggles to get the door shut against the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whew! What a night! I'm Jones, from down the road. Just came over to tell you your kids are all right, Mr. Blandings.

</MR_JONES>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm not Mr. Blandings. Cole's the name, Bill Cole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
He sees Jones' doubtful look at the smoking jacket, feels an explanation is necessary.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Friend of the family. Wet clothes. Just came in out of the rain.

Muriel walks into scene. Jones takes in the bathrobe, again looks skeptically at Bill.

<MURIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Mrs. Blandings.

<JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>

<MURIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. I was beginning to get concerned. Can I make you a cup of tea?

The door is opened with a terrific swirl of wind and rain. Jones exits as Muriel and Bill push the door against the wind, finally getting it shut.

INT. JIM'S OFFICE - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA COMES IN ON a package of cigarettes. A finger impatiently rips open what is left of the package, discloses that it is empty. The ANGLE WIDENS to reveal a tired, disheveled Jim. Disgusted, he fishes the most likely butt from a tray littered with them. With considerable difficulty he manages to light it, only to burn his nose. Impatiently stamping out the butt he rises, stretches, walks to the window, pulls up the shade. Early morning sunlight floods the room. He turns off a standing lamp, looks thoughtfully out the window, suddenly gets an idea. Turning, he snaps his fingers. Mary, who is asleep on the desk, her head resting on her elbows, raises her head, opens a sleepy eye.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>

voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Compare the price, compare the slice, Take our advice -- Buy Wham!"
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Mary critically shakes her head "no", closes her eye. Jim wearily throws himself down on the couch, absently toys with his already loosened tie. He pulls it up over his nose, throwing the balance over the top of his head. Suddenly he reacts, snaps his fingers. Mary opens a sleepy eye.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"If you'd buy better ham. You'd better buy Wham!"

	It's Boyle Petroleum. "If you'd buy better oil, You'd better buy Boyle."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Her eye closes. Jim sinks back with defeat, his hand dropping over the edge of the couch. It encounters a crumpled piece of paper, earlier work. He smoothes the paper, scans it, kind of likes it. He gets up, comes over, snaps fingers. Mary looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"This little pig went to market As meek and as mild as a lamb. He smiled in his tracks When they slipped him the axe He knew he'd turn out to be Wham!"

(rising panic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's gone! I've lost my touch! Maybe I never had a touch! Maybe "Whim Say Wham" was an accident! Who knows? I can't think any more! All I've got on my mind is a house with an eighteen thousand dollar mortgage, and bills, and extras, and antiques, and -- and --

(dejected)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know... I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Mary looks at him sympathetically, doesn't quite know what to say. As the CAMERA MOVES to a CLOSE SHOT of the emotionally distraught Jim, his eyes go to a large photograph on his desk of Muriel and the children. He picks it up, looks at it with affection. Suddenly he gets an idea. Rising with determination he puts on his coat and starts for the door.

EXT. THE BLANDINGS' HOME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is an especially beautiful, sunshiny morning. A rural- looking taxi deposits a weary Jim, who pays the driver. As the cab drives off, Jim looks speculatively at Simms' car, which is parked there, yawns, stretches, opens the door and enters. Under this a slightly sour underscoring of "Home On The Range."

INT. BLANDINGS LIVING ROOM - DAY

As Jim comes into the foyer, he sees Muriel, in nightgown and robe, talking to Mr. Simms. She holds the rolled-up volume of blueprints that went into building the house.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Simms, what brings you out with the morning dew?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<SIMMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just dropped by to check the blueprints. Some extras came in from Retch this morning and there're a couple of things I thought we ought to go over together.

	Well, let's see.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(thumbing through sheets)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Few little things here, all right, I guess. "Mortising five butts -- a dollar sixty-eight."
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMMS>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's not quibble about that. A man's entitled to mortise a few butts now and then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<SIMMS>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Extra nails and screws -- three dollars, eighty-nine cents.

<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Petty larceny, but let him get away with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<SIMMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now there's one here I frankly don't understand. Ah, here we are.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reads)

	<DIALOGUE>
	"Changes in closet, twelve hundred and forty-seven dollars." Did you authorize that?

<SIMMS>

(indicating blueprints)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Far as I remember, that would be something in the back of the house. Let's just take a look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMMS>
<DIRECTION>
As he unrolls the blueprints, Jim looks suspiciously at Muriel. She seems a little nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, here we are. It isn't a closet at all. It's off the back pantry... Mrs. Blandings' little flower sink.

	Oh... Mrs. Blandings' little flower sink.

</JIM>
<MURIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(rattling off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I did was one day I saw four pieces of flagstone left over from the porch that were just going to be thrown away because nobody wanted them and I asked Mr. Retch if he wouldn't just put them down on the floor of the flower sink and poke a little cement between the cracks and give me a nice stone floor where it might be wet with flowers and things. That was absolutely all I did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURIEL>
<DIRECTION>
During the above speech Simms sinks into a chair, puts his head in his hands and closes his eyes, a fact that isn't lost on Jim.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all you did?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<MURIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely. Just four little pieces of flagstone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURIEL>
<SIMMS>
<DIRECTION>
(to Muriel; wearily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you by any chance authorize a drain?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMMS>
<MURIEL>
<DIRECTION>
(verge of tears)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I didn't. All I said was I wanted a nice stone floor and Mr. Retch was just as nice as could be and said, "You're the doctor," and that's all anybody ever said to anybody about anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Jim takes a deep breath, turns to Simms.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Well?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<SIMMS>
<DIRECTION>
(sigh; plunging in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, I think I can tell you what happened. First, the carpenters had to rip up the flooring that was already laid. Those planks run under the whole width of the pantry, so Retch had to knock the bottom out of the pantry wall to get at them.
	</DIALOGUE>

JIM AND MURIEL

<DIRECTION>
Jim and Muriel - Jim looks at Muriel as though he were premeditating first-degree murder. She averts his gaze. Over this:
</DIRECTION>
<SIMMS_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then he had to chop out the tops of the joists under the flower sink space to make room for a cradle. I guess he bought some iron straps and fastened them to a big pan to give him something to hold the cement. What with that added load on the weakened joists, I'll bet he had to put a lally column down there for support, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMMS_VOICE>
<MURIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was just four little pieces of flagstone, and I only ---

GROUP SHOT - During the following speech we see Bill Cole, in Jim's pajamas and robe come down the stairs and enter the room. Jim and Muriel are not aware of his presence.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, the main soil pipe runs under there on wall brackets, so Retch had to get his plumbing man back to take out a section so he could get that cradle set. I guess that meant he had to change the pitch of the soil pipe from one end of the house to the other.

Through Simms' speech, Jim looks darkly at Muriel.

	I also had a job at Danton and Bascomb, something I don't happen to have at the moment!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<MURIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jim!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURIEL>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, I've resigned! We're starting all over again! From scratch! And without this house!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<MURIEL>
<DIRECTION>
(near tears)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You love this house!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURIEL>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
In the b.g. Mr. Tesander enters, cap in hand, stands there, nervous and embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<MURIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't mean that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURIEL>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Every word of it! Anybody who builds a house today is crazy! The minute you start, they put you on the list. The All-American Sucker list! Everywhere you turn they've got a hand in your pocket. If you take out their hands, they find more pockets!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(explosively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a conspiracy, I tell you, a conspiracy against every man and woman who want a home of their own! Against every boy and girl who were ever in love!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Tesander clears his throat. Jim turns.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(sharply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
A slight embarrassed pause. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<TESANDER>
<DIRECTION>
(shyly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Mr. Blandings, there's a matter of twelve dollars and eighty-six cents.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TESANDER>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(with a wild gleam)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twelve dollars and eighty-six cents! Why be a piker, Mr. Tesander?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(emptying pockets)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take everything I've got! Spread it out among your pals!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(advancing toward the bewildered Tesander)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wouldn't Retch like a little something? Maybe Zucca could use my new dinner jacket? It's open house, Mr. Tesander! Help yourself! If this isn't enough I'll come over to your place and do some odd chores. Maybe I can mow your lawn or scratch your back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<TESANDER>
<DIRECTION>
(simply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't understand, Mr. Blandings. This twelve dollars and eighty-six cents -- you don't owe me, I owe you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TESANDER>
<DIRECTION>
There is a momentary pause.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...W-what was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<TESANDER>
<DIRECTION>
(taking out money)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Found I overcharged you. Almost three feet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TESANDER>
<DIRECTION>
He hands the money to Jim, who stares at it blankly.
</DIRECTION>
<TESANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better count it. I think it's all there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TESANDER>
<DIRECTION>
Jim looks haplessly at Muriel, sheepish, guilty.
</DIRECTION>
<MURIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you very much, Mr. Tesander.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURIEL>
<TESANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I guess I'd better be gettin' along.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking around)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure got a pretty place here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(at door; pauses; looks back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell Mr. Zucca about the dinner jacket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TESANDER>
<DIRECTION>
Jim and Muriel look at each other a little sheepishly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE FOYER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Tesander is about to exit, Bill, dressed, starts down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Mr. Tesander -- could you give me a lift to town?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<TESANDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TESANDER>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be right with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<MURIEL>
<DIRECTION>
(concerned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you mean before about losing your job? Will we really have to sell the house?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURIEL>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(miserable)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, dear... I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Bill enters.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In case anyone's interested, I'm leaving for town.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(for Jim's benefit)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you want to count the silverware, I'll wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(sheepishly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bill, be patient with me. Maybe one of these days I'll grow up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<BILL>
<DIRECTION>
(to Muriel)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<MURIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twelve dollars and eighty-six cents.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURIEL>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mind if I say something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
Jim and Muriel look at him curiously.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I've kind of been the voice of doom about this whole project. Every step of the way I was firmly convinced you were getting fleeced, bilked, rooked, flimflammed and generally taken to the cleaners. And maybe you were. Maybe it cost you a whole lot more than you thought it would. Maybe there were times when you wished you'd never started the whole thing. But when I look around and see what you two have here -- I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe there are some things you should buy with your heart and not with your head. Maybe those are the things that really count... See you around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL>
<DIRECTION>
As Bill turns and leaves, the outer door is heard opening and the kids appear. There is an exchange of "Hi's" as they pass.
</DIRECTION>
<BETSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Morning, everybody!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETSY>
<JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Dad! How come you're not at the office?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(a look at Muriel)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm on a... kind of a vacation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<JOAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean you got fired?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, not exactly, I --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<MURIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll discuss it later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Gussie's head appears from the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<GUSSIE>
<DIRECTION>
(brightly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come and get it! Breakfast everybody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUSSIE>
<BETSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good! I'm starving! What are we having, Gussie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETSY>
<GUSSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Orange juice, scrambled eggs and you- know-what.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUSSIE>
<JOAN>
<DIRECTION>
(making a face)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ham?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOAN>
<GUSSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not ham -- Wham!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(cheerily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you ain't eatin' Wham, you ain't eatin' ham!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUSSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Gussie's head disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - JIM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - Jim.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did she say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
He reacts with the sudden exhilaration of Balboa first seeing the Pacific. He snaps his fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darling, give Gussie a ten dollar raise!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes light up as he begins to visualize.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT ADVERTISEMENT IN MAGAZINE - It is a picture of Gussie, smiling, holding a platter with an enormous ham. Under it, the simple caption:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"IF YOU AIN'T EATIN' WHAM, YOU AIN'T EATIN' HAM!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS TO DISCLOSE MR. JAMES BLANDINGS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA ANGLE WIDENS to disclose Mr. James Blandings reclining in a hammock on the patio of his Dream House. In the b.g. Muriel is working at her garden, Joan and Betsy assisting her. Jim reacts with pride and satisfaction as he sets the magazine down, takes a long drink of lemonade and picks up a book which he has been reading. As the CAMERA COMES IN for an EXTREME CLOSE SHOT of Jim we see the title of the book on the jacket cover. It reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"MR. BLANDINGS BUILDS HIS DREAM HOUSE".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim looks up over the top of the book, directly into the camera and winks.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(with simple sincerity)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drop in and see us sometime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
As the CAMERA PULLS AWAY to a LONG SHOT tableau of the Blandings and their Dream House, we:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
