A man walks into the shot, grabs a microphone, slips out of his jacket and looks at us. He wants to tell us something. He's in a lavender light. This is SAM COOKE. What he calls out...a throaty mixture of gospel, soul and sex...is "Let me hear it!" And WOMEN SHRIEK. He says, "Yeah!" They answer, shrieking, "Oh, yeah!"...

up and down, running along a dark road in the dead of night, passing vacant lots with debris amid trees and faded buildings. He is CASSIUS CLAY. He runs in construction boots. His eyes stare from under the hood. He passes the husk of an abandoned car, a pastel storefront. We're in Overtown, Miami's inner-city black neighborhood.

Cassius runs toward us. Off to the side in the black- mirrored water of Biscayne Bay, leaden clouds in a black sky. And now Sam Cooke SINGS "...because you make me wanna mooove...!" and breaks into the first verse of "Feel It." But we see Cassius' eyes are FOCUSED, CONCENTRATED, ELSEWHERE. To where is this man running? Why is his expression so distant? A WHITE LIGHT suddenly hits him from behind. He looks over at...
</DIRECTION>

WIDE FROM THE FRONT: CASSIUS + A METRO-DADE POLICE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
that's slowed, clocking the suspicious, running black man. The driver starts to pull over, to hassle Cassius. Then, the cop riding shotgun gets a radio call. He taps the driver's shoulder. They take off, the driver laughing. Cassius looks after the white cops. He is neither relieved nor angry. He's dismissive. And, instead, he sees something else...

and six other patrician, white business-people of Louisville in their green baize and wood-paneled Luxo boardroom. They speak soundlessly and patronizingly to Cassius Clay, Sr., seated at the foot of the table. It relates to the stack of contracts in front of him. He is in a suit and tie, his hair and moustache are dapper. His tie's a little loud. He has his hands folded deferentially in front of him.

Right now he looks to his left and to the right, and only then do we notice the entire wall he's against is covered with pictures of thoroughbreds and studs this Louisville Sponsoring Group owns as well. He is one among their sporting possessions. He doesn't like it. He looks at the back of his father listening.

It's that time of day Jack Johnson called the "fighter's hour," "...between the night and the light..." ...whopwhopwhopwhopwhop... And Angelo Dundee puts on a pot of coffee. He washes his hands in a dirty sink, thoroughly drying them. Alert and clean, he's old school. He goes back to the edge of the ring, reading his newspaper. Now, crossing past the white windows is DREW "BUNDINI" BROWN. He takes an orange out of his pocket, sitting on a bench, silently peels it... As Cassius "walks" the rope, jumping up and back.

<DIRECTION>
And as he goes, leaving us, not Cassius, incomplete, Cassius returns to Dundee, who ties gloves and puts tape over the knot. The Inspector signs that, too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. A CORRIDOR, CASSIUS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A door slams open. Cassius comes along the hallway, his entourage surrounding him. Three large middle-aged white officials accompany him, too. His face is set in stone. White towels are draped over his head onto his shoulders. Bundini chirps in his ear. Dundee, like a plumber, carrying the tools of his trade...a bucket, his swabs and Vaseline. And they seem distant to Cassius. They reach the end of the corridor, and against the wall stand three or four older bad cigar guys. A curtain...the sounds from the arena drift into the hallway. Cassius is on his toes now, dancing, dancing. And as if being drawn by a force we can't see, he just goes...his entourage, as if holding on, carried along by him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE MIAMI CONVENTION CENTER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes into the hall...there are shouts, some scattered applause, some booing, growing; and the sound moves through the arena...the sounds of expectations, ridicule, potential
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
violence. But past the faces and the press, what's arrested Cassius' attention and makes him oblivious in his solitude to all else is the bright 20-by-20-foot place he wants to be most in all the world: the ring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE RING - CASSIUS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is struck by the brilliance. Illuminated, ready to go... dancing...warming up. Counter to an expectation of anxiety, Cassius can't wait to get this on. Other sounds happen...irrelevant to him...and now the distant sound of Liston coming into the ring...his bulked-up presence, the roar he inspires, somewhere over there. And all of a sudden, Cassius turns to face the angry man who wishes him death. Cassius rocks left and right, like a tough kid on a corner ready to rumble. The hysteria act is gone; so is the boasting. Instead, there is only Cassius' stare. The effect is enigmatic: what is going on here? A Referee, like a distant bird, says something we don't hear...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the corner, his feet float, waiting. There's the BELL for ROUND ONE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RING - ROUND ONE - WIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It starts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LISTON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
right away throws a left that misses and attacks Cassius, throwing seven more that Cassius with extreme, awkward caution evades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is fearful of the monster whose punches he has yet to feel. Nevertheless, he does his job: measure Liston's range and speed. Then, a body shot catches him above the heart. Cassius feels the real power of Liston. It could stop your heart's beating. He survives. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CASSIUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
throws his long left jab. It keeps Liston at a set distance. He has Liston's range, now, and he dances away from Liston's charges. Then, halfway through the round, Cassius' eyes have hunted out an opportunity, and he throws his first combination with a few hard shots that, to Liston's surprise, rock Liston's head back. And, then, Cassius easily evades...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LISTON'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
furious big misses to the left and right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CASSIUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
keeps tagging Liston with his long left. And, now, infuriates Liston even more by merely walking away from Liston's big misses, provoking even wilder and more inaccurate Liston assaults. (We're aware that any Liston shot could knock out Cassius if it connected.) Then Cassius soaks up a couple of body shots, most flicks his jab, slides, dances, clinches, circles away...UNTIL...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE END OF THE ROUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cassius launches a second combination, slams a couple of big lefts Liston's way that rock his head back two times. Liston's so furious, he flips, charging Cassius, who hits and ducks at the same time. The BELL RINGS THREE TIMES before they stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLAY'S CORNER - CASSIUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
breathes hard. Dundee works. Cassius says something we can't hear.
</DIRECTION>
<CASSIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was supposed to kill me. Well, I'm still alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASSIUS>
<DIRECTION>
Angelo is talking to Clay a mile a minute, while Clay MUGS an open mouth...to the press, ridiculing their accusation he was all talk. It's clear he controlled Round One to everyone's surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BELL. INT. RING, ROUND TWO - CASSIUS + LISTON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see press with typewriters, ribbon, microphones, note pads; massive TV cameras hang on platforms over two of the corners. It's a desultory, lower-key version of Round One. And...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BIRD'S NEST TV CAMERA + MEDIA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coverage segues to Liston, who throws and misses a few lefts. Cassius tags him with a few rights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BELL. CASSIUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
literally ambles into the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SONNY'S CORNER: HIS TWO TRAINERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liston's getting a lot of strident advice. THE BELL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RING, ROUND THREE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LISTON'S LEFT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
comes in like a freight train. Cassius merely leans away to avoid Liston, circles and now snaps off a flurry and OPENS A CUT UNDER SONNY'S LEFT EYE. Then, he splits out of there.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
(at ringside, on radio)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's opened a cut on Liston. Liston's never been cut!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
And Cassius, seizing opportunity, hits Liston with more combinations. If Cassius won Round One, probably but not certainly won Round Two, he now demonstrates he OWNS Round Three. It's a symphony of classical Cassius Clay footwork, flicked jabs that confuse, and, then, hard-hitting combinations that rock the presumably immovable Liston. No one told Sonny that Cassius could hit. And, at 210 pounds, he hits HARD. Liston, angered, panicked, knows he's losing and goes after Cassius and misses wildly as the BELL ends Round Three...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLAY'S CORNER - CLAY

EXTREMELY CLOSE: CASSIUS CLAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
breathing heavily, ignoring the stool and Dundee and Bundini, looks around. THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE 22, TO BE CASSIUS CLAY, TO BE ON TOP OF YOUR GAME AND TO BE ABOUT TO OWN THE WORLD. He looks over the crowd. Only then, turns and sits...

<DIRECTION>
slips a vial of some medicant from his pocket and rubs it into Liston's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RING - ROUND FOUR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BELL RINGS. Clay peppers Liston with jabs. Liston pokes his left at Cassius, trying to reach him. They feint,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
circle. Liston gets his left into Cassius' face. It's more a poke than a shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE: CASSIUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
blinks back something...we're not sure what. It seems to go away. Then it's back. The fight continues...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER: CASSIUS

</DIRECTION>
<CASSIUS>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
A knife-like pain. He can't see. He's getting beaten up. He's in trouble. The BELL.

Dundee feverishly washes water to get the irritant out of Cassius' eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ARENA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A buzzer sounds, warning the bell's coming for Round Five. Now Cassius stands, saying...
</DIRECTION>
<CASSIUS>
<DIRECTION>
(his gloves)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut 'em off! Cut 'em! I'm blind.
	</DIALOGUE>

	No. You quit, it's over! Get out there. Be a yardstick. This is the big one, daddy. Get out there and run!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELO_DUNDEE>
<DIRECTION>
He literally pushes Cassius into the ring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RING - ROUND FIVE - LISTON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rushes Clay. He knows this is his chance. Cassius tries to tie Liston up by holding onto the back of his neck, but
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liston pounds left and right hooks. If anybody wondered if Clay could take punishment, this answers that. WHAM-WHAM- WHAM-WHAM-WHAM...five huge hooks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liston is desperate to end it while Cassius is in trouble. Haymaker after haymaker; some connect, others are blocked but knock Clay sideways. Clay, still blind, keeps backing and dancing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER: CASSIUS' EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a minute left, now, he sees better. Liston throws him into a corner, still trying to put him away. But, he can't, and Liston's energy seems to deflate once he knows that. The BELL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RING, CASSIUS' CORNER - CASSIUS'
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
eyes are clear. In 60 seconds he recovers his energy. He's ready. BELL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RING - ROUND SIX - CASSIUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
can't wait to get out. He shuffles. He circles. He fires combinations. In the early rounds, provoked by Cassius, Liston's anger caused him to abandon his fight plan. Now, having been proven futile, Liston's confidence is gone. He's left with nothing. Psychologically and athletically, Liston is defeated. The BELL. Liston's eyes contemplate the inevitable: face nine more rounds of this.
</DIRECTION>

Cassius, Sr. is there. They all wait. No sign of Cassius. "Where's your boy?" A young New York Times sportswriter, ROBERT LIPSYTE, is there as well.

A little girl runs from the bathroom back to Cassius. The girl plops into his lap with much familiarity, so we understand Cassius is family and has been for a while. He's not at the Fontainebleau or the Roney Plaza. It says Cassius' sense of himself is more about what's next than what he did tonight.

INT. THE HAMPTON HOUSE HOTEL ROOM, 1964 - NIGHT, LATER

The room's near dark. Soft sounds from outside. A laugh. A snatch of music. Malcolm's children are asleep on a cot. And we see Cassius has fallen asleep on the sofa. A bedsheet is over him. Malcolm and Betty, sitting at the table in the kitchenette, quietly talking...an intimate laugh...partners. And as Cassius, the new heavyweight champion of the world, spends the first night of his reign asleep at "home" with this family...

I locked that down! So tight my muscles seized. I lost control over the right side of my body. Leg didn't work...right arm didn't work. "I'm having a stroke," I thought.

Cassius is at his most deferential, awed at being in this man's presence. Elijah's power is the inverse of his size. He's short and delicate-featured. He motions for Cassius to sit beside him. Joseph 13X sits across the room with two men.

She blows on it. She's not quite eighteen, six feet tall; there's a supremely confident expressiveness about her. Her gestures are large. He opens his hand. The scarf is gone. She instinctively looks over at his other hand. Nothing's there. His eyes go wide in mock fright at the mysterious.

	Ali comes out to meet Frazier, but Frazier starts to retreat; If Frazier goes back an inch farther, he'll wind up in a ringside seat; Ali swings with a left, Ali swings with a right. Frazier keeps backin', but there's not enough room. It a matter of time before Ali lowers the boom; Now Ali lands with a right, what a beautiful swing, But the punch lifts Frazier clean out of the ring. Frazier's still risin', but the referee wears a frown, 'Cause he can't start countin' 'til Frazier come down. And Frazier's disappeared from view. And the crowd is getting frantic. Then our radar stations pick him up. He's somewhere over the Atlantic. Who would have thought when they came to this fight, That they would witness the launching of a black satellite?

The contentious roar diminishes only slightly for the announcer.

ALI'S EYES deep in his focused concentration. His attention so arrow like it reminds us of the younger man in the Liston fight...pure purpose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE RING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...only SILENCE as the referee's instructions are given in SLO-MOTION. Ali bounces on the canvas. We HEAR his feet shift, turn, dance...and his breathing, expectant. Here comes the return of what was unfairly taken: his heavyweight championship.
</DIRECTION>
<DISSOLVE_TO>
<DIRECTION>
MID-FIGHT - ALI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looks swollen, out of breath. Something's wrong! Two solid Ali jabs and a right hook connect. But they slow down Frazier not at all. Joe Frazier, short and compact, like a pit bull, bobs and weaves his way inside Ali's longer reach.

ALI'S CORNER - DUNDEE + BUNDINI

shouting instructions. None get through. Ali looks slow. Older.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RING - PROFILE: ALI + FRAZIER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frazier, off his bobbing and weaving, launches his devastating left hook to Ali's head. Frazier is making the most of what he is: smaller. Ali clinches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERY LOW: FRAZIER + ALI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The referee separates them. Both men throw and miss...Ali on the right, Frazier on the left. Ali throws a hard left that catches Frazier but doesn't stop him. Now Frazier connects with a wild left hook into Ali's cheekbone. THE UNTHINKABLE HAPPENS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVERHEAD: ALI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is knocked down onto his knee. Ruled a slip, he stands immediately and continues. Ali, backed against the rope again, blocks shots, pushes Frazier into the middle of the ring...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALI SWINGS FRAZIER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
around. But Frazier cranks his left. ALI SEES IT COMING...

<ALI>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hook's comin'. Lean back, man! Move back! WORK LEGS...!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
But Ali's legs DON'T work fast enough. Frazier's hook CRASHES into Ali's face. Ali goes rubbery as he backs to the rope. Ali comes out and backs to the rope on the other side, with cartoon rubbery legs. But the mimicry is camouflage. He really is wobbling. The crowd is going wild. We HEAR everything, now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRAZIER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is wary. He doesn't trust Ali. He walks across the ring, allowing Ali to recuperate...THE BELL. Ali walks to his corner, drained...
</DIRECTION>
<HOWARD_COSELL>

<DIRECTION>
Ali saved himself with GUILE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROUND FIFTEEN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They clinch. They separate. They both...as if mirror images of each other...crouch, looking for shots. Ali's right is down. Frazier's right is down. As they both rise up out of the crouch, Frazier's out of the box first. Ali's right is coming around. Frazier's left hook slams Ali across the jaw. Ali goes down. Half the crowd ROARS for Frazier. Ali gets right up and stands in the corner and takes the mandatory eight-count. The right side of his face is swollen like a balloon. They resume...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVERHEAD: ANOTHER CLINCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ali takes another right, but the ropes hold him up. Another left catches Ali. Frazier's face is a grotesque, swollen mask. He doesn't care.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is exhausted. Labored breathing. The crowd cheering Frazier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEN THE BELL.

Ali drops his arms. He knows he lost. Frazier raises his arms. He knows he won. Half the crowd cheers.

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: INT. AIR ZAIRE DC-10 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A towering man in denims with sequins blocks our view of the door as he walks out onto the ramp. Only now do we see BEYOND HIM a small welcoming party. Native African dancers, a big banner that proclaims, "Welcome, George Foreman," the Zairian paratroopers, media and a few dozen of the curious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRONTAL: GEORGE FOREMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looks like "Superfly" on steroids. His entourage follows him down the ramp. DICK SADLER, tough and smart, is the Louis Armstrong of trainers. ARCHIE MOORE, crafty and wise, wears a blue shirt and blue pea-cap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
If George Foreman wonders at the paucity of his reception, he doesn't let on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALI'S HOUSE, N'SELE - ALI - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sits in EXTREME CLOSE-UP drinking coffee...lost in thought. He's somewhere else, puzzled, alone in his thoughts. He wears grey sweatpants, a thin-rubber long-sleeved T-shirt under his grey sweatshirt. He's oblivious to the Euro- modern furnishings. Then it's time, and he leaves...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. N'SELE COMPOUND - WIDE: ALI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
enters from his bungalow. We SEE we're in a compound. They are white and severely truncated houses linked by sidewalks and too many large street lamps. As Ali starts to jog through this imitation of suburbia with the scale all wrong. It's like a Gulag in reverse for the rich and powerful to be within while keeping the rest of the country out. As Ali passes, REVEAL we are at the bank of the Congo River. As Ali starts his predawn run, across the river the first band of magenta tints the horizon and reflects molten on the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING SHOT: ALI + DUNDEE, SARRIA IN A PICKUP TRUCK - RED DAWN

</DIRECTION>
<ALI>

	Fast. Six left jabs flash from his chest and shoulder, followed by a right hook and left and right uppercuts.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ALI>
<DIRECTION>
Ali slides to the right and throws a left jab and hooks off the jab. EXT. KINSHASA ROAD - EMPTY ROAD - MORNING LIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ali ENTERS, running. The road is lined with Mobutu's green billboards in French and English, proclaiming Zaire wonderful. A few kids emerge from behind the signs, coming out from between...and they trail Ali.
</DIRECTION>
<KIDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ali, boma ye!
	</DIALOGUE>

<ALI>

</DIRECTION>
<ALI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You out, sucker!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Curious, Ali runs behind the green signs from where the kids came.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALI'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
still jogging. Behind the signs, he becomes a magnetic attraction. People are surprised to see Ali. He's making their day. Euphoric kids parallel him, run with him, follow him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAST ALI:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the concrete-and-cinder-block walls to the dusty, bare ground are chromatic. Primary colors. Ethnographically interesting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALI SEES interiors. Broken walls. No roof. No plumbing. People come from a ditch with a shower curtain for privacy, surprised to see Ali. Faces indifferent to squalor. This is the ethnographically "interesting" surface of what, in fact, is civic disintegration starting to occur... It is the human concomitant to 13 years of Mobutu kleptocracy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looks at the backs of the signs. He and we realize the signs' purpose: to hide the makeshift plastic walls and rooms made from cardboard containers and oil drums from the foreigners traveling the road to Kinshasa. One TEENAGER WITH A WITHERED ARM and a big smile runs up...
</DIRECTION>
<TEENAGER>
<DIRECTION>
(broken English)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You beat them, Ali!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEENAGER>
<ALI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Foreman? I kill him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALI>
<DIRECTION>
He mimes knocking out Foreman. Something powerful is affecting Ali. We don't know what it is. Ali slows down...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...throws two lightning jabs and a hook. Ali reaches to the kid's head and pulls a coin. He flips it to another kid and walks on. A SECOND TEENAGER comes out and wants Ali to look at something around the back. He takes Ali's hand...and holds it. Ali complies. The entourage follows...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AROUND CORNER: KIDS' PAINTING ON WALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's an imitation fight poster. Childlike caricatures in Basquiat-like brush strokes. Foreman's got crosses for eyes. He's out! Ali is victorious! His fist is raised. His cartoon face shouts his victory...the people's champion. There's more. There's knocked-out white policemen, knocked- out black soldiers, knocked-out landlords, knocked-out South Africa, knocked-out planes and tanks, knocked-out tse-tse flies...everything!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
So much, it means "ALL"...all expectation. This childish painting powerfully affects Ali. The kids look at him. It's still. Some kids in the back leap up in the air to see over taller heads what Ali's doing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looks at individual faces. A grinning OLDER MAN with a blue transistor radio (we'll see him later). A smiling kid. A girl with no shoes. A teenage kid jumping up and down...all looking at him. Ali makes four pieces of rope appear. He rubs them together...

(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...even if I die here. If it kill me, no matter what...I gotta win.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALI>
<DIRECTION>
Concentration has taken him into the athlete's zone, the state of unified awareness wherein dwells his total self- knowledge. And he knows the transaction: what they give him with their adoration, which he converts to power, is in exchange for what he means to them. And what he means to them is specific: he represents them in defying power and vanquishing what oppresses. He validates the existence of expectation, that struggle is possible...George Foreman, mute and unknowingly, represents disinterested power. Ali doesn't "accept" his obligation; he embraces it. It is his purpose, revealed. And he will never waver from it.
</DIRECTION>

INT. INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL, ANTEROOM (KINSHASA) - ALI - DAY

A bittersweet smile and the eye contact with Ali. Cosell knows...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GYM FLOOR - HEAVY BAG - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is slammed by a massive fist. It leaves a dent the size of a deflated basketball. The fist is George Foreman's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DICK SADLER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
holds the bag. Foreman throws hooks, one after the other. Each blow rocks Sadler. George is literally punching a hole in the bag. These blows would mash an opponent's liver, break ribs, destroy kidneys. This man can do more than hurt you. This man can kill you.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RING - FOREMAN + SPARRING PARTNER - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Foreman is boxing a middleweight. He is smaller than Foreman and, therefore, faster. And, that's the point. The partner tries to circle, slide, dance away, and Foreman cuts him off and drives him to the ropes where he tags him. He doesn't put a lot behind it. Partner slides...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOREMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
darts left and jars him with three left jabs, keeping him on the rope. Foreman's training to defeat Ali's dancing, his "float + sting" tactics.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE: GEORGE FOREMAN

<DIRECTION>
is young, has unreal power and he can move.

SIDE ANGLE: THE TWO ENTOURAGES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pass. Comparatively, Foreman looks bigger. He is more dense of bone. He's taller. His chest seems deeper and his shoulders wider.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND FOREMAN'S EXPRESSION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is casual, unrattled by Ali's antics. He is menacing in his indifference. It means he's ALSO immune to getting psyched out by Ali.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RING - CROWD - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bundini's in Ali's corner. Ali's sparring partner is Larry Holmes. Ali's hands are at his side. He dances, bicycles, shuffles, dances, dodges, doesn't throw anything, his elbows at his side. Ali is training to DANCE from Foreman. He's fast, but not seemingly suspended in air as he was 10 long years ago against Liston.

Ali ain't fucking around. Ali has reasons for working with Don. Belittling Angelo cuts across all that. Danger's in the air. Dundee puts his hands up.

Ali's served notice to anyone with ears to hear it: he's multidimensional, strategic and dangerous as hell. A taste of what's to come.

EXT. VERANDA - ALI, BUNDINI, BINGHAM + ANGELO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Waiters scurry. Ali talks to a blonde reporter from France and settles next to Lloyd Price, without a shirt. Everyone crowds around their table. A ZAIRIAN INTERPRETER and Lieutenant Nsakala are present. Ali disregards their presence because his attention tracks...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALI'S POV: VERONICA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
seen over the heads of Zairians. She's 5 feet 10 inches tall. Without acknowledging she's the object of Ali's attention, her radar tells her she's the object of Ali's attention.

He steers her into the chair next to him, which is immediately vacated by Lloyd Price.

<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don brought me here, but I'm not "with"...anybody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DIRECTION>
The others are paying them no attention. Bundini stands to talk to Howard Cosell. There's an ocean of side conversations. Ali's presentation to Veronica is natural, open admiring. It is not seduction. It's more seductive than seduction. She feels from Ali nothing predatory or exploitative...only the warm rays of the sun from his open face and appreciating eyes. Still holding her hand...
</DIRECTION>
<ALI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where you from?
	</DIALOGUE>

Meanwhile, George Foreman, with Sadler, Moore, Broadus, sees and laughs at Ali and Veronica and onto George Foreman going into hotel.

Meanwhile, 15 Chinese and some Vietnamese approach and wait patiently. Ali has to force his attention away from Veronica to respond... They all bow. He bows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Zairian Interpreter translates English to French to another Zairian, who speaks Mandarin. It all gets lost in chaos while Bingham shoots pictures and a Plimpton type explains pedantically to Bundini...
</DIRECTION>
<PLIMPTON_TYPE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...she's an African "succubus." Means witch doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLIMPTON_TYPE>

	Succubus? Suck my dick. They ain't room in Africa for more than one witch doctor. And that's B'dini.
	</DIALOGUE>

The eyes of some of the Asians are very emotional. Ali stands up and bows to them. Chinese bow themselves away. Ruth Pointer arrives. Ali kisses her. She sits, but talks to Bingham.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
squints, trying to figure out how he did it, because...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shows the scarf, pushes back his cuffs so that he can't hide anything up his sleeves. His wrists are bare. He shows both sides. Now, he takes the scarf and pushes with his right hand and feeds it into the closed fist of his left. He looks up wide-eyed at everybody. Then, he opens his fingers and the scarf is not there!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALI + VERONICA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
walk, towering over the kids. One girl holds Ali's hand. The others maintain a respectful proximity so that they don't invade the space around Ali.
</DIRECTION>
<ALI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So why you glad we still here?

	</DIALOGUE>
</HOLMES>
<DIRECTION>
Ali sees something beyond the ring. And, now, flicks four ripping left jabs into Holmes and slides sideways as Holmes tries to catch Ali with a right. But Ali changes directions, changes back and now comes over Holmes' right with his own left cross, and a six-or-seven-punch combination. It is Ali dancing and floating. Crowd cheers..."TIME."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BUNDINI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
meanwhile, has thrown his arms around Dick Sadler, Foreman's manager. (We realize this is why Ali segued from serious work to snapping his traditional left jab.)

</SADLER>

Sadler affectionately puts an arm around Ali's neck and reaches up and pretends to hit Ali on top of the head with a fist for Bingham's camera. Ali bites his lower lip and starts wrestling with Sadler, putting him in a headlock. Sadler's arm is around Ali's waist.
</DIRECTION>
<ALI>

	Hey! Look! Look at George Foreman's trainer, feelin' me up on purpose! On the side, to see if I'm in shape!

</ALI>
<DIRECTION>
Throughout the above he's pretending to jab at Dick, who's laughing and feinting at him. It's raucous. Fond relationships transcend the adversarial roles. They are all of the tribe of boxers. Sadler is a particularly bright and talented man. Meanwhile...

Ali looks at her a moment. Then he leaves. Silence. Belinda sits on the bed. She looks up. Then she comes apart. She rips open a closet.

circles the ring. He looks at the crowd from different angles, from the corner, the center... He looks up at the lights and gets used to the heat from them.

OVERHEAD: ALI + FOREMAN'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
corners are clear. Ali is facing his corner, praying to Allah. Foreman is bent over at the waist, flexing and releasing the last tension in his huge shoulders, as the bell for ROUND ONE clangs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE RING - BOTH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
charge out and stop as if they ran into a brick wall five feet from each other. Then Ali dips, throws a left, which George takes on the shoulder...a BIG RIGHT HAND to George's head. The crowd goes nuts. George clinches, picks up Ali and swings him through 180 degrees with his power. As he puts Ali down, Ali pushes George's head down and away and Ali clocks him with ANOTHER RIGHT. Foreman clinches and drives Ali back to the rope. Ali throws ANOTHER RIGHT that lands. Ali dances, circles, stays out of Foreman's way. Then he slams him again with a right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Foreman gets Ali in the corner, throws vicious combinations and a hook that nails Ali in the body and a wild shot hits Ali on the side of the head. CLOSER ON ALI...stunned, his eyes clear. He's just taken a Foreman shot. He pushes Foreman, the stronger man, out of the way and dances and circles. Foreman ties him up again. Ali pushes out, dances and hits HIM with a RIGHT. Ali ties him up, and there's the BELL.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Legs heavy...air's heavy...like sand...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALI>
<DIRECTION>
SLOWLY MOVE IN ON ALI as Angelo and Bundini's talk fades away. We see Ali's awareness in a deep concentration. He is holding counsel with himself. Ali stares into space across the diagonal to the other corner, but not really at Foreman. Ali is weighing something. A gamble. He blinks, and whatever it is, he's decided it NOW. AMBIENT SOUND starts to come back as Ali's attention returns to the present and he ignores...
</DIRECTION>
<ANGELO_DUNDEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...keep moving. Don't let him put you into the corner. Stay off the rope!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELO_DUNDEE>
<DIRECTION>
THE BELL FOR ROUND TWO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ali charges into the center of the ring, provoking Foreman to chase him, and Ali immediately BACKS TO THE ROPE. And stays there! Seizing opportunity, Foreman throws big hooks. ALI IS DOING EXACTLY WHAT HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO DO. He gets off the rope and backs to the rope on the other side. Most of the shots are blocked by the gloves of both men. No damage. Then George throws a left, which Ali blocks, and a big right hook.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
turns away. Nevertheless, it crashes into his jaw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MACRO ALI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIME SLOWS. He ties up George. We SEE Ali's hurt. Dazed. But he must make George believe he's unhurt.
</DIRECTION>
<ALI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That all you got...? That it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALI>
<DIRECTION>
Foreman reacts. Ali takes vicious hooks to the midsection, hangs on and goes right back onto the ropes, tying Foreman up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOW ANGLE

<DIRECTION>
George's shots are taken on Ali's elbows and gloves. But for every four that are thrown, one or two tremendous hooks get through to Ali's ribs, his side.
</DIRECTION>

ALI'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reveals impact, but nothing diminishes the TERRIBLE FORTITUDE with which he endures. Now, he ties up George. Now, George drives Ali into the corner and pummels him.

ANGELO + BUNDINI going crazy in the corner!

<ANGELO_DUNDEE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Ali blocking, getting hit. WORRIED FACES in the crowd. One woman looks away.

alive, more than alert, the sharpest eyes in boxing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOREMAN'S LEFT JAB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
coming in. Ali feints, shifts. It misses by a quarter of an inch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOREMAN HOOKS OFF HIS JAB Ali leans back on the top rope. Foreman's punch falls short and connects with little effect. That's how good is Ali. The techniques BECOME CLEAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Foreman goes upstairs, throws three hooks, all get taken on Ali's gloves. Foreman slams a hook that began in Cape Town and ends up in Zaire, into Ali's abdomen. And another. Ali takes the shots, hangs on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALI'S EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
are bright like stars. His white mouth guard shines. A grimace? A grin?

</ALI>
<DIRECTION>
Ali pushes Foreman off and Ali connects with a left and a straight right to the jaw. They pound but don't stop George. Ali ties him up. Ali's jabs end the round. Nothing effective, but Ali shakes his head, disapprovingly, puts his hand on the back of George's neck, and as the BELL sounds...

Ali pushes away from his handlers and rises. He opens his arms to the crowd. We hear a massive "ALI, BOMA YE" start up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER: ALI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
opens his arms as if the roar of 65,000 voices is sunlight. By opening his arms, his skin soaks it in and converts it to power. And the BELL STARTS ROUND THREE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE RING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They trade. Nothing. Foreman advances, Ali backs to the ropes, tags Foreman with a couple of harmless left jabs. Now Foreman opens up with heavy artillery. Ali gets in a couple of shots, but for the center of the round he's pummeled by Foreman. Midway through...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOREMAN accepts a left jab, and while Ali's left arm is out with it, Foreman hammers a right into the exposed lower
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
midsection of Ali and then follows it with six tremendous hooks to Ali's abdomen. Ali pushes him away. Foreman comes in again. Foreman gets him on the rope again, and a surprising right on the left side of Ali's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ties up Foreman's left in the crook of his elbow, and they stagger, married, awkwardly, into the center of ring. The referee separates them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE: FOREMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
charging and throwing heavy shots. Ali takes some on his elbows, arms, biceps and shoulders. NOW we see Ali lean BACK. WAY BACK. 45 degrees back... We start to hear the TWANG of the rope. We get it. Ali is using the rope as a shock absorber. Some Foreman punches get through, but the rope TWANGS and Foreman's hitting a trampoline with a hammer. Between deflection and being ring-wise, Ali dilutes much of what George throws. Then Foreman drives three powerful hooks into Ali's side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALI'S BODY SPASMS

But, as if inconsequential...

Ali's eyes are stars. He sees everything. He sees things no one else can see in the quantum physics of deflecting the force of Foreman's blows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOREMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
desperate, pounds a left to Ali's side, a blocked left to the head, three lefts to the belly, which get through! Ali's left arm convulses downwards, involuntarily, with the blows. What Ali's not ready for and doesn't block is the right hand that follows. This shot is jarring and concussive. He grabs Foreman's neck and has to hold on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BELL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RING - ALI - MID-ROUND SEVEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
leaning way back at impossible angles -- soaking up George's shots. George is SLOWER...BUT Ali's not throwing at all!
</DIRECTION>
<ALI>
<DIRECTION>
(hisses to George)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eight more rounds... You runnin' outta gas?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALI>
<DIRECTION>
Then...Ali comes out from under.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM. WHAM. WHAM. WHAM. WHAM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Five hard shots are followed into Foreman's puffed face. They surprise and enrage him. WIDER: GEORGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
drives Ali with his 220 pounds...George's arms and fists now SWING HEAVILY. Some get through. Ali's right eye is puffy. Both tie up. And BELL ends the round.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RING - ALI'S CORNER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Angelo and Bundini talk. Neither we nor Ali hear them.
</DIRECTION>
<ALI>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself to George)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...can't let you get that second wind which you don't know is out there for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(talking to George in his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want the title...wear the heavyweight crown?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jaw broke? Nose smashed? Face busted? You ready to die? Is that you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(towards George)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Cause you gonna meet a man who will die before he let you win.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALI>
<DIRECTION>
A tall African Girl walks by with the number "8." As she passes near Ali, she has the audacity to wink at him. ALI happens to see it. He winks back at her. She smiles. He brightens right up! THE BELL RINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RING - ALI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
goes to the ropes, throws a couple and, now, comes off the ropes. He's in the center of the ring. HE'S HUNTING. A couple of lefts from Ali. Foreman throws a haymaker and almost falls out of the ring. Ali's in the corner, having avoided the shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOREMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
gets in a couple of lefts that Ali deflects. Ali takes another on the cheek, leans way back again. Suddenly, he seems tired, as is Foreman. Tied up, they go diagonally to the other corner of the ring, both fighters exhausted, leaning against each other. Resting. BUT...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTREMELY CLOSE: WE SEE ALI'S EYES ARE DEAD SHARP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's faking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOREMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
backs Ali into the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hits Foreman with a left. Foreman launches a short left that Ali counters with a BIG RIGHT CROSS that connects.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOREMAN'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
head snaps around. Sweat sprays in a parabola of light. Crowd ROARS with expectation. George Foreman tries a right uppercut, fails as Ali circles, guiding Foreman onto the ropes. Foreman's on the ropes NOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALI'S EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
know the moment is...
</DIRECTION>
<ALI>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALI>
<DIRECTION>
ALI'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
short, chopping right turns Foreman's head down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER: FOREMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
comes over the ropes and turns back into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALI'S RIGHT HOOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
slams his head down and sideways. And Foreman charges into Ali.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SLO-MO: ALI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
snaps a combination: an overhead right to Foreman's face, a short chopping left and a right hook. Ali's eyes light up like white phosphorus.
</DIRECTION>
<ALI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	RIGHT NOW!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALI>
<DIRECTION>
FOREMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
wrestles Ali into the center. And the most significant moments begin...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLO-MO: ALI ON THE LEFT + FOREMAN ON THE RIGHT ...and Ali's left hand is extended way behind him with the wrist bent, no power. As it passes his body, Ali converts it into a left hook. As he's doing this, he's dropping his left foot back. The left foot DOES NOT support a left hand. It's for a right hand so the body can untorque across with the punch. And Ali is already cocking his right. Meanwhile, the left connects with Foreman's jaw and raises his chin. As the left is departing Foreman's chin, Ali launches the RIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLO-MO: AS ALI'S RIGHT HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
comes in, Ali's torso untorques, transitioning all 217 pounds to Ali's left foot and putting that weight and power behind his right fist that crashes into George Foreman's chin...and the impact transfers to Foreman's skull...and Foreman's head snaps around. He is gone. He is falling in a spiral...a metaphor for vertigo...turning downward into
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
unconsciousness. And through the spiral, Ali has moved with him, pivoting with the falling Foreman, his right fist cocked to unload again if he has to. He never does...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MASSIVE OVERHEAD: FOREMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
down. Ali is pushed into the corner by referee Zack Clayton. Foreman is counted out. Clayton raises Ali's hand. 65,000 people go crazy!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOTAL CHAOS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ali is seized by Rahaman, Dundee, Bundini. And in the corner, hardly seen by anybody, Ali, now, faints. Veronica, with a DON KING AIDE, is overcome. Tears stream down her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ARENA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As if finally released from the suspense, the sky opens. The monsoon begins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE STREETS OF KINSHASA, OUTSIDE THE STADIUM, ZAIRIANS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
celebrate. The city is crazy with the air of liberation in the rain. People are drunk, bowing to one another, extending their arms and legs in strange gestures. Laughter. THUNDER is deafening in the downpour. People celebrate despite the storm, dancing on sidewalks on Rua Absini.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KINSHASA ARENA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almost empty. The downpour. The last fans rip down one gigantic image of Mobutu...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOBUTU'S PALACE - THREE MEN waiting, now rise. One, in Saville Row, is from a London Bank. The other is Bradley, the USIA/CIA character. The third is Idi Amin of Uganda. As everybody shakes hands, they sit down and servants appear. Everyone is pleased with themselves...

INT. CITROEN ON KINSHASA ROAD - ALI - NIGHT rides through the downpour with Belinda and Bingham in the front seat. She gently holds, almost supports his hand.

</BELINDA>
<DIRECTION>
They drive through a fishing village with dense foliage in part. Ali looks, sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALI'S POV: WOMEN + SOME MEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
have brought their children out into the rain to see the champion so they can say when they grow up they saw him pass by. Plastic or clothing protect the children from the rain. One man holds up his son. Ali rolls down the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL, BAR - DICK SADLER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shouting French to the bartender. Folks who look like Jim Brown, Schulberg/Mailer types...hang out, half drunk...and argue about flights out with extortionate petty bureaucrats like Zairian Official #2. Flights have been cancelled, tickets rendered no good, passports confiscated, etc. There's a stoned Hunter Thompson/Bill Cardoso type with a couple of Zairian hookers. The Hunter Thompson type is not very discreetly smoking Congolese weed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVEAL: IN THE BACK CORNER OF THE BAR ARE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DON KING + HERBERT MUHAMMAD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
King is importuning Herbert, his hands work the air, gesticulating madly, building whole castles of hype and hustle. We can't hear what he's saying. Herbert listens. Then Don King stops and looks at him, and Herbert nods his head "yes." Then Herbert starts saying something and Don King nods his head "yes." Whatever's happening here, a deal for the future has been struck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALI'S COMPOUND, N'SELE - ALI - PRE-DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rain stopped. The cold, blue light is illuminated with magenta at its base as dawn starts to rise over the Congo River. WIDE: ALI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in a pale green shirt and slacks, walks towards the water, followed by Zairians, teenagers, some kids who snuck into the compound, two older men. No media; no elite; no hype. One policeman who staggers, drunk. Ali doesn't so much as walk to a destination as amble. He rubs the head of a 12- year-old boy who starts shadowboxing five feet in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<ALI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think you got a chance, chump? Now you in trouble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALI>
<DIRECTION>
Ali begins to spar with the 12-year-old, who is fast and knows a little bit about boxing.
</DIRECTION>
<ALI>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You even dream of beating me? You better wake up and apologize!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Kid throws a punch. Ali collapses to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<ALI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He too much for me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALI>
<DIRECTION>
Some laughter. Then Ali stands and puts his hand on the boy's shoulder. He ambles with the group towards the river. The sun's coming up on the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.
