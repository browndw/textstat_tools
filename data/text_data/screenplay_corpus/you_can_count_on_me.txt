INT./EXT. A CAR (MOVING). NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shifting lights from the odd passing car play over the faces of MR. and MRS. PRESCOTT, a pleasant-looking couple in their late thirties, dressed up for a night out. Mr. Prescott drives them along a dark hilly two-lane highway.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_PRESCOTT>

EXT. THE PRESCOTTS' FRONT DOOR. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SHADOW of a big man looms up onto the front door. A big finger RINGS the BELL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AMY, a thirteen-year-old baby-sitter with braces, opens the door and looks up. In the b.g. we see TWO CHILDREN, SAMMY (Samantha) and TERRY PRESCOTT, in their pajamas, lying on their stomachs in the living room, watching television. Sammy is eleven. Terry is eight.

<DIRECTION>
CREDITS BEGIN OVER a blustery April day. The steeple of the little white church stands out against the sharp blue sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOWN CHURCH. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a small church and a small congregation, but it's full. There's a CHOIR of mostly SENIOR CITIZENS arrayed in the back. TWO CLOSED CASKETS are laid out in front of the MINISTER, a fiftyish woman with thick glasses and salt-and- pepper hair, who is giving a eulogy MOS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Among the mourners in the second row sit Terry and Sammy, both redeyed, and uncomfortable in their dress-up clothes. Their Aunt Ruth, a pinch-faced woman in her forties, sits next to them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sammy and Terry are holding hands tightly. Terry wipes his eyes with his free hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Minister addresses her remarks to the children. Sammy is hanging on the Minister's every word; Terry is shifting his eyes and his seat as if it will kill him to sit still another minute.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the beautiful hill overlooking the beautiful windy green country, SAMMY, twenty-seven years old now, puts flowers on her parents' graves with quick, practiced movements.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is a nice-looking young woman of a neat appearance, saved from primness by an elusive, pleasantly flustered quality. An unsuccessfully neat person. She is dressed in office clothes -- white blouse, dark skirt, high heels, light raincoat over everything. She picks out a couple of weeds and then bows her head and closes her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREDITS END.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SCOTTSVILLE -- MAIN STREET. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scottsville is a small town. Main Street. Run-down old stores next to a new bank, a couple of chain stores, a few restaurants of varying ambitions. Civil War statue. World War I statue. World War II statue. Residential streets wandering away from Main Street up and down hills. You know there's a minimall somewhere nearby. A fair amount of activity during the daytime.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAMMY'S CAR pulls up across the street from where an eight- year-old BOY in a secondhand baseball jacket and a school knapsack is waiting at the curb. This is her son, RUDY. SAMMY calls out the car window.

<SAMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rudy, come on! I'm really late!

	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMMY>

<SAMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's wrong with that?

EXT. MERCHANTS NATIONAL TRUST -- PARKING LOT. DAY
</DIRECTION>

Sammy gets out of her car, which is parked in one of the half dozen spaces in the little parking lot allocated for bank employees.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, come in!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Sammy swings open the door. BRIAN EVERETT, the new branch manager, is unpacking a box. Sammy is surprised to see he is in his early thirties and very good-looking in a boyish sort of way; he wears shirt-sleeves and tie, and a wedding ring.
</DIRECTION>

Sammy sits in front of Brian's desk. Brian is behind the desk listening.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- so I always just run out at 3:15 to pick him up and then run him real quick over to the sitter's house. Anyway, Larry never minded about it and I was just hoping it would be OK with you too...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMMY>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- Samantha -- I realize that Scottsville is not exactly a major banking center...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<SAMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No it's not...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMMY>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- I know it's not... But it's kind of a personal challenge to me to see what we can do to bring local service up to the same kinds of standards we'd be trying to meet if we were the biggest branch in the state. And that means I don't want anybody running out at 3:15 or 3:30, or whenever the bus happens to come in that day. Now is there anybody else who can pick your son up after school? Does your husband work in the area? Do you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<SAMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh -- No -- Rudy Sr. isn't "on the scene." So to speak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMMY>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I can give you a couple of days to make some other arrangement, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<SAMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- Brian? I understand what you're saying, and I think it's great. I do. Because there's a lot of things around here that could use some attention. Believe me. But I've honestly been meeting that bus every day for four years now and it really does take just fifteen minutes, and if I take the time out of my lunch hour...
	</DIALOGUE>

<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd really prefer it if you would make some other arrangement. OK?

The same house that Sammy grew up in, with sixteen years' more wear on it.

<SAMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He can stay in the little room.

<DIRECTION>
(Pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you know what? He's not going to live here. He's only gonna stay for a little while... And it's OK if you don't remember him, because you were only six the last time he was here... But it'll be nice if you got a chance to get to know each other a little bit. Don't you think?

INT. DAWSON'S GRILL. NIGHT

Sammy and BOB STEEGERSON are eating dinner at Dawson's, the only fancy restaurant in town. Bob is in his mid-thirties, a Realtor, a decent, ordinary guy.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, Bob, it's sort of this adventure story, and Rudy's father is this secret agent or something, working for the government... And it just made me feel weird. You know? Because I never really say much to him about Rudy Sr., because I don't know what to say. And I don't know whether I should just let him imagine whatever he wants to imagine, or whether I should sit him down sometime and tell him, you know, that his father is not such a nice person. You know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMMY>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... I don't know, Sammy. What have you told him already?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<SAMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not much. He knows I don't have the highest opinion of him. And he knows I don't want to see him or know anything about him, ever. But I tried to keep it kind of neutral. Anyway... I could go into a lot more detail, believe me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMMY>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... It's an interesting problem. But I don't really know what to tell you... It's a little outside my personal field of expertise...

INT. BUS (MOVING) -- BATHROOM. DAY
</DIRECTION>

Terry is seated on the toilet seat in the cramped bathroom smoking a joint. He takes a huge hit and holds it in for as long as humanly possible. He blows out what's left, takes another equally huge hit and holds it in.

<DIRECTION>
Terry shifts uncomfortably in his seat.
</DIRECTION>

INT. KITCHEN. SIMULTANEOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Loud country-western music is blaring as Sammy, wearing an apron, sets a big vase of flowers on the kitchen table and hurries to the oven. There are also cookies, a pie, evidence of massive fancy cooking. She puts on her oven mitts and takes a lasagna out of the oven, as the phone rings. She picks up.

Terry secrets himself in a small dark alley. He takes out his carefully wrapped half joint and lights it. SMOKING, he looks at the sunlit slant of street beyond the alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAIN STREET. A FEW MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terry, fairly well stoned, walks along Main Street. A skinny man emerges from his hardware store to greet Terry and shake hands. Terry says "Hi," but keeps on walking. He passes some other people.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He almost runs right into SHERIFF DARRYL, sixteen years fatter and grayer.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF>

<TERRY>

<SHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God damn! Terry Prescott! How you doin'? Gimme a cuddle!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF>

The Sheriff gives Terry a big bear hug. Terry is wasted and selfconscious but smiling. He pats the Sheriff's back.

EXT. MAIN STREET. A FEW MOMENTS LATER

The Sheriff walks along with Terry. Terry, very self-conscious about smelling like pot, fumbles to light a cigarette. The Sheriff does not seem to notice.

</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Darryl walks away. Terry stands outside the restaurant looking for Sammy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him in the restaurant Sammy is sitting at a table, talking to the waitress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sees Terry and gets up immediately, smiling like crazy as she threads her way through the tables toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terry turns and sees her. He breaks into a big smile, tosses his cigarette and goes into the restaurant. Through the window we see them make their way toward each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sammy throws her arms around him. He hugs her back with a big involuntary smile as the GLASS DOOR slowly CLOSES.

	No, I was just wondering if we could get some more refreshments, actually.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs. Looks down. Silence. He looks up at her.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've actually got to confess to you, Sammy... that the reason you may not have heard from me for a little while is that I've been kind of unable to write... on account of the fact that I was in jail for a little while.

</TERRY>
<SAMMY>

A couple of people in the restaurant look at them. Terry notices but Sammy does not.

</TERRY>
<SAMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- What happened?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMMY>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got into a fight in a bar down in Florida. Which I was not the one who instigated it, at all. But they worked up all this bullshit against me and they threw me in the pen for three months. I didn't write you because I didn't want you to get all upset about it. I just figured you'd figure I was on the road for a little while. I know it was stupid and I'm sorry. I really didn't mean to make you worry. But you know what? I can't run around all the time doin' stuff or not doin' stuff because it's gonna make you worry! Because then I come back here, and I tell you about my fuckin'... traumas, and I get this wounded little "I've Let You Down" bullshit, over and over again, and it really just -- cramps me! Like I just want to get out from under it!... And here I am back in this fuckin' hole explaining myself to you again!

	OK -- Can you please stop cursing at me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMMY>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, I realize I'm in no position to, uh, basically say anything, ever -- But it's not like I'm down there in some redneck bar in Florida having an argument with some stripper's boyfriend and I suddenly think, "Hey! Maybe this'd be a good time to really stick it to Sammy and get myself locked up for a few months."
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<SAMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.

	Um, yeah. Because I think it's ridiculous.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- can you tell me without like, denigrating what I believe in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMMY>
<TERRY>

	Because I think it's primitive, OK? I think it's a fairy tale.

	No.

</DIRECTION>
<SAMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK. So we'll drop Rudy off at the bus, then all you have to do is drop me off at the bank, and just pick Rudy up at 3:30 in front of town hall, and drive him over to Carol's house. And that's it. She's on Harvey Lane, right past where the Dewitts used to live.

EXT. ORRIN'S BACKYARD. DAY

</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>

	Hey. Look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
He moves Rudy's hand down toward the end of the handle.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hold it further down, you're gonna get a lot more power. You should be able to put that nail down with two or three hits. Look:

With two swift strokes he drives the nail flush into the wood.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. IN FRONT OF ORRIN'S HOUSE. A MOMENT LATER

INT. RUDY'S BEDROOM. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DOOR OPENS, and TERRY COMES IN, smoking a cigarette. He's plastered. He looks around the room. Looks at Rudy's toys. Picks up some superhero comics and sits on Rudy's bed. Then he spies Rudy's COMPOSITION BOOK, picks it up and starts reading it.

<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you say that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. He was always -- He always had to be better than you at everything. You know. Like if you were all playing basketball or something, everybody's havin' like a friendly game and he's like ready to kill somebody if his team didn't win. Or like if you told like a joke or a story, he always had to tell a better one? Kinda gets annoying after a while. Plus it was pretty scummy how he split on your mom and you... He was a prick. Probably still a prick. Fortunately for you though, your mom is like, the greatest. So you had some bad luck and you had some good luck.

He picks up the remote...
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...!
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
...and turns off the TV. They sit there in the sudden silence.

The Wild Moose is a noisy roadside bar sitting under the stars. Terry and Rudy get out of the car. Rudy looks apprehensive.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think they let kids in there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<TERRY>

<DIRECTION>
INT. THE WILD MOOSE. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV RUDY: A lot of men and women at the bar or in booths, eating and drinking. Smoky, crowded and very loud. As he follows Terry through the crowd various patrons notice him -- some of the looks are friendly, some blank, some cold, i.e., what's a kid doing in here?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE POOL TABLE: Terry and Rudy stand side by side facing the players and waiting players gathered around the table. Terry waves a few bills.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got a hundred bucks here says me and my nephew can beat anybody in here. Only we gotta get the next game 'cause he's gotta be in bed by ten o'clock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
A MOMENT LATER: RUDY, very nervous, and the 1st Pool Player are side by side shooting for break. Terry is behind Rudy coaching him.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just hit it nice and soft... Nice and soft.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
They hit the balls. Rudy just clips his ball and it doesn't go anywhere. 1st Pool Player's ball hits the opposite bank and comes almost all the way back.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
(To TERRY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.

</RUDY>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy doesn't answer. Terry winks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MOMENT LATER: 1ST POOL PLAYER BREAKS -- WHACK! -- The balls scatter. Nothing drops. TERRY steps up to the table, chalking up his cue.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>

	Well, you could always say "Yes."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<SAMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. WILD MOOSE. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terry has sunk everything but the eight ball. He leans over to sink it. It's a fairly easy shot. He lines it up carefully, and deliberately shoots it so it stops two inches from the corner pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ohhhh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
A FEW MOMENTS LATER: Terry and Rudy sit side by side watching as the 2nd Pool Player passes back and forth between them and the camera, running the table. "Oohs" and "All rights" emit from the spectators.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sudden silence. Then the clack of the balls connecting. A great common GROAN goes up. RUDY looks up at Terry.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all yours, baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy looks at the TABLE: The eight-ball is two inches off the corner. The cue ball is a few inches away from it. A piece of cake, for an adult. Rudy looks deeply unconfident.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up and tries to line up the eight-ball. Terry is right next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just make sure to hit it really gentle. But firm. And hit it a little low so you get some backspin. Don't even hit it. Just kiss it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
A long moment.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean, kiss it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean tap it. Firm but very, very softly. And don't shoot until you know it's going in. OK?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDY>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone is relatively quiet. Rudy takes a few practice strokes and then hits the cue ball, straight, but too softly. It crawls toward the eight and taps it toward the corner, slower and slower, hangs there, and DROPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GENERAL "HEYYY!" GOES UP and everyone claps and cheers. Terry grabs Rudy. Rudy smiles, ecstatic.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was great!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>

<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<RUDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't get my sleeve out...!

<DIRECTION>
They HEAR Bob's CAR DOORS SLAM. Terry makes a comic panicked face and leaps up the stairs two at a time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE THE HOUSE: Sammy waves to Bob. Bob waves back as he drives off. Sammy goes to the front door, opens it:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terry and Rudy are in a giggly tangled panicked heap at the top of the stairs, shaking Rudy's arm and sleeve, frantically trying to get the jacket off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sammy comes in. They freeze.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is going on in here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMMY>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um -- We were just out doing some star-gazing, and, uh, Rudy lost track of the time. Which I totally warned him about.

INT. KITCHEN. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kitchen is dark. Sammy comes in, her hair a little wet, and turns on the light. She goes to the telephone.

Sammy jumps, startled. Terry is in the kitchen doorway.

</SAMMY>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kind of a late dinner, ain't it?

EXT. PORCH. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sammy and Terry stand side by side on the porch, passing a joint back and forth. It has stopped raining but the trees and roof are still dripping. The crickets are chirping loudly.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So... Bob asked me to marry him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMMY>

(Pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you going to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<SAMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. If he'd've asked me this time last year I would have probably said yes. But the minute he said it, I don't know, I felt like somebody was trying to strangle me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMMY>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... bad sign.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<SAMMY>

</TERRY>
<SAMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMMY>
<DIRECTION>
He passes her the joint. She declines. He puffs away. The water drips off the porch and the crickets chirp. She puts her head on his shoulder. He puts one arm around her and puffs away with the joint in his free hand.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terry, I'm sorry I got so mad before. I just don't want him, you know -- terrified of "telling," if there's --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMMY>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, well, that's not really his problem, Sammy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Sammy straightens up.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh really? What's his problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMMY>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His problem is that he's like totally sheltered because you treat him like he's three, instead of eight, so that's how he behaves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<SAMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah? And how do you think he should behave?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMMY>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think he shouldn't have to run and tell his Mommy every time he does something she might not like, for one thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<SAMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh huh. And what do you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMMY>
<TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(On "and")
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean I took him to play pool! It was a little clandestine thing we did for fun! It wasn't like a big secret, I mean who cares? I was actually trying to be nice to him. But he's so freaked out that he disobeyed your orders that he has to fuckin' squeal on me and I have to listen to your fuckin' shit all day when I didn't even fuckin' do anything!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<SAMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First of all, he didn't tell me anything: Darryl did. OK? Second of all, I don't really give a shit if you took him to play pool: I was mad at you because you left him standing at the bus stop in the rain. But no, I don't want you telling him not to squeal, because I don't want him put in that position!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMMY>
<TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(Losing ground)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... that... is a perfect example of what I'm talking about.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, good morning. Could you get the door?

INSIDE THE OFFICE: Sammy stands by the closed door. Brian comes out around his desk.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMMY>

Brian kisses her. She drops her folders and they make out against the door.

<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE THE OFFICE: The employees click away at their PCs. Mabel exchanges a quiet word with Chuck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE OFFICE: Brian has Sammy pressed against the wall with her skirt hiked up and is trying to get both of their underwear out of the way. It's not so easy in their office clothes. Sammy tears away.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brian, that's enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMMY>
<DIRECTION>
BRIAN falls back, breathless.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK. Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
He lunges at her again. They kiss some more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE THE OFFICE. A MOMENT LATER: Sammy comes out of the office, more or less composed, carrying her folders. She heads down the hall past the other employees, including Mabel, and surreptitiously readjusts her scrunched-up underwear.

	I don't know... I... Maybe this is... Last year I sort of thought you were possibly interested in that... idea... but I was the one who, you know, wasn't "ready" at that point -- So that's why I thought things kind of slowed down with us...

	Well... I'm not really sure why you're here, Ron. I mean, I realize I haven't exactly been a model citizen since I got here, but compared to how things have been goin' for me lately, I thought I was doing pretty well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to Sammy.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I also find it kind of discouraging that you seem to think I need some kind of spiritual counseling or what have you, so much so that you're willing to disregard the fact that I don't believe in any of this stuff at all --

<SAMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... I didn't mean to discourage you --

</RON>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How would she know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<RON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm really not here to try to get you to do anything, or to believe anything. And I'll tell you the same thing I told her, which is that as far as I'm concerned the only way she can help you is by her example -- by trying to be a model for you, by the way she lives her life...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RON>
<DIRECTION>
Terry smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<RON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that doesn't mean she's supposed to be a saint, either, if that's what you're smiling about.

</RON>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great job you got.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<RON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... I like it. Because even in this little town, I feel like what I do is very connected with the real center of people's lives. I'm not saying I'm always Mr. Effective, but I don't feel like my life is off to the side of what's important. You know? I don't feel my happiness and comfort are based on closing my eyes to trouble within myself or trouble in other people. I don't feel like a negligible little scrap, floating around in some kind of empty void, with no sense of connectedness to anything around me except by virtue of whatever little philosophies I can scrape together on my own...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RON>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well --
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRY>
<RON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I ask you, Terry: Do you think your life is important?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RON>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean -- Like, me personally, my individual life?

</TERRY>
<RON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RON>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... I'm not sure -- What do you mean? It's important to me. I guess. And like, to my, you know, the people who care about me...

</RON>
<TERRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I don't think... I don't particularly think anybody's life has any particular importance besides whatever -- you know -- whatever we arbitrarily give it. Which is fine. I mean we might as well... I think I'm as important as anybody else...

	I don't know: A lot of what you're saying has a real appeal to me, Ron. A lot of the stuff they told us when we were kids... But I don't want to believe something or not believe it because I might feel bad. I want to believe it because I think it's true or not... I'd like to think that my life is important... Or that it's connected to something important...

</RON>
<SAMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it was better when you came in and they screamed at you for having sex with your married boss, and were really mean to you, and told you what a terrible thing it was. Maybe it'd be better if you told me how I'm endangering my immortal soul, and if I don't quit I'm going to burn in hell. Don't you ever think that?

</SAMMY>
<RON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um... No.

That's all.

Your Mom's gonna live in this town for the rest of her life, and you know why? Because she thinks she has to. Don't ask me why, but that's the truth. She thinks there's all these things she has to do, but you want to know one thing about your Mom? She's a bigger fuck- up than I ever was. I mean, I know I messed up. You think I enjoy getting thrown in jail because I wanted you to face that prick your Dad like a little man and see what kind of a guy he is? I know I got a little carried away, and I lost my temper just a little bit -- which is not the end of the world either, by the way, just for future reference --And now she's kickin' me out of my own house because -- you know, because I fucked up a little bit.

	I do know where I'm going. I'm going to Worcester and I'm gonna try to see that girl. And then depending on what happens there, I thought I'd try to see if there's any work for me out West. And if there is, I'm gonna head out there for the summer and try to make some money. And if there isn't, I'll figure something else out. Maybe I'll stay around the East. I don't know... I really liked it in Alaska. It was really beautiful. You just -- It made me feel good. And before things got so messed up I was doin' pretty well out there. Seriously. But I couldn't stay here long, Sammy: I don't want to live here. But I'm gonna stay in touch. And I'll be back. 'Cause I want to see you and I want to see Rudy. I'll come home for Christmas. How about that? We'll have Christmas together.
