"Medical journals report only 31 cases in history of people swallowing their toothbrushes. The champion toothbrush swallower was a Soviet psychiatric patient who downed 16 in 1984. The all-time champion swallower of any object swallowed 2533 objects in 1927."

INT. BOB WILEY'S BATHROOM, MORNING

BOB WILEY, thirties, anxious, begins brushing his teeth. Suddenly, in trying to brush a back molar, Bob looses control of the toothbrush and swallows half of it whole. Choking, gasping, he tries to pull the toothbrush out.

PAN and TILT up from a woman walking her dog on the streets of Manhattan to a third floor apartment window. There is Bob struggling frantically with the toothbrush.

INT. BOB WILEY'S BATHROOM, MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bob is losing the battle, and in three excruciating swallows, like a mouse going down the throat of a snake, the toothbrush disappears down his throat. Bob pounds his chest, swallowing as he does. Then, delicately, he belches. He takes a deep breath, relaxes somewhat, and opens the medicine cabinet. There sit ten packaged toothbrushes. Bob opens one.

The striking thing about DR. LEO MARVIN's office is order and neatness. As Marvin talks on the phone, he unconsciously adjusts the already meticulously placed gewgaws on his desk. Marvin is mid-forties, authoritative, stiff, perfectly manicured. Adorning the office are diplomas, personal mementos, primitive masks, Mondrian-like paintings, his framed medical school grades, a bust of Freud, and diplomas. On his desk is a book titled Baby Steps TM with Marvin's picture on it.

The decor is New England cottage-y with a strong dose of Leo Marvin: incredibly ordered. On a pedestal is a bust of Sigmund Freud. On the mantle sit the family puppets: -- Anna, Siggy, Fay, and Leo.

Marvin turns down the volume, sits in his big easy chair, then takes a deep breath. He picks up Freud's Understanding Dreams. Anna puts on headphones and dances around wildly. Marvin tries to read. Suddenly a face appears in the window. It is Bob. He sees Marvin and taps on the window. Marvin looks up and sees Bob.

<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hardly. I analyze everything to death. Every time a guy smiles at me, I ask myself is he really smiling or is he just orally fixated? When I smile back, I wonder, am I really attracted or just smiling out of some residual Cro-Magnon instinct? If I ever actually have sex, I'm not sure I'll know the difference between an orgasm and an anxiety attack!

Marvin turns and stares at Bob.

<BOB>

	I couldn't miss your birthday!

Marvin suddenly leaps at Bob and grabs him by the throat. He pushes him through three rooms of the house, choking him.

<MARVIN>

	I want you dead! Dead, you hear me, dead!

Marvin falls on the floor on top of Bob. Guests go to pull him off.

INT. THE MARVIN BEDROOM, NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marvin lies in bed in the darkened room. He can hear the party guests huddle outside in the hall, whispering. A guest whom we recognize as the Doctor 3 from the boat, (the man who is telling this story), enters carrying his doctor's bag. He approaches Fay who is wringing her hands. Both speak in whispers loud enough for Marvin to decipher.
</DIRECTION>
<FAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never seen him like this, Phil. He's got this delusion about Bob Wiley being the cause of all his problems and I don't know what to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAY>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's under a lot of stress, Fay. His book, his interview which frankly didn't go so well, his birthday. That's a lot to bite off all at once. I'll give him a sedative and he'll be fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<FAY>

Phil puts a hand on Fay's hand and nods.

Bob sits on the couch beside Siggy. Anna approaches.

</ANNA>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine. It's your dad I'm worried about. How is he?

</BOB>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Upstairs. Resting. I can't understand why he'd attack you like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Anna sits next to Bob. Bob sees George Stark, standing across the room, smiling at Anna.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't either. But one thing I've learned about psychiatrists: they're brilliant manipulators. I trust your dad completely. I'm sure everything he's done has been to help me.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bob, we've talked about this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you've talked about it and I've listened. In my opinion, George Stark's smile is not Oedipal regression and it's not confused libido. It's one good looking guy drooling over you, Anna Marvin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bob...

</ANNA>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>

Phil empties a large syringe into Marvin's buttock. He swats Marvin's behind and Marvin pulls up his pj's.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That should give you some interesting ideas for your next book. You might even wake up feeling happy.

<MARVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I doubt it. Phil, do you remember a classmate named Fensterwald?

</MARVIN>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carswell Fensterwald? Sure. Who could forget?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<MARVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've forgotten and I don't know why. Did anything unusual happen with him?

</MARVIN>
<PHIL>

	You're joking.

</PHIL>
<MARVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I act like a man who's joking?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARVIN>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax, Leo. I just can't believe you'd block something like that out. Carswell was at Harvard with us. You turned him in for cheating.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<MARVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARVIN>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you remember? You brought action against him for stealing your psychoanalysis notes and they booted him. The only place that would take him after that was University of Guadalajara.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<DIRECTION>
Marvin tries to speak but nothing comes out of his mouth. Tomsky watches with concern.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMKSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leo, is there something about Carswell that's disturbing you? Leo...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMKSY>
<MARVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Phil. Enjoy the party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARVIN>
<DIRECTION>
Phil lingers then leaves, closing the door. Marvin begins shaking all over. As he does the bed rattles rapidly against the wall. Leo's losing it. He's no longer the same sane man. In the darkness we hear:

INT. BOB'S COTTAGE, MORNING

The place looks completely anonymous except for Gil in a bowl and Bob's bag of clothes. Marvin sits on the floor, filling a pair of milk cartons with gray powder.

Marvin removes a wired mechanism from the bag and a timer. He delicately pushes the wires into the milk cartons then carefully ties on some fuse wires. He puts the milk cartons and wired mechanisms into a BACKPACK and puts it under Bob's bed. He begins laying the fuse wire along the floor towards the door.

<MARVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... if you gave a new toothbrush and taught dental hygiene to every student at your school... In the long run you'd save them thousands of dollars. I mean look at the cost of dental bills. I bet I could have put my kids through college with what I've spent on fillings.
