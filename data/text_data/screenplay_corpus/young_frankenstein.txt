:SC: EXT. FRANKENSTEIN CASTLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BOLT OF LIGHTNING!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CRACK OF THUNDER!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a distant, rainy hill, the old Frankenstein castle, as we knew and loved it, is illuminated by ANOTHER BOLT OF LIGHTNING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC: AN EERIE TRANSYLVANIAN LULLABY begins to PLAY in the b.g.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as we MOVE SLOWLY CLOSER to the castle. It is completely dark, except for one room -- a study in the corner of the castle -- which is only lit by candles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we are just outside a rain-splattered window of the study. We LOOK IN and SEE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. STUDY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An open coffin rests on a table we can not see it's contents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the CAMERA SLOWLY CIRCLES the coffin for a BETTER VIEW...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CLOCK BEGINS TO CHIME: "ONE," "TWO," "THREE," "FOUR..." We are ALMOST FACING the front of the coffin. "FIVE," "SIX," "SEVEN," "EIGHT..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA STOPS. Now it MOVES UP AND ABOVE the satin-lined coffin. "NINE," "TEN," "ELEVEN," "T W E L V E!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE EMBALMED HEAD OF BEAUFORT FRANKENSTEIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Half of still clings to the waxen balm; the other half has decayed to skull. Below his head is a skeleton, whose bony fingers cling to a metal box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reaches in to grasp the metal box. It lifts the box halfway out of the coffin -- the skeleton's fingers rising, involuntarily, with the box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, as of by force of will, the skeleton's fingers grab the box back and place it where it was.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the "Hand" -- using its other hand -- grabs the box back from the skeleton's fingers. The skeleton no longer resists.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CORNELIUS WALDMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
whose "Hands" we have just seen, now carries the box to a small table. He takes a tiny key out from his vest pocket and begins to unlock the metal box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NINE PEOPLE watch him closely. They are seated on chairs in the study, waiting to hear the contents of Beaufort Frankenstein's will. Their dress is turn-of-the-century Transylvanian.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cornelius Waldman fumbles with the lock, emitting strange grunts as he tries to open it. With each grunt, the face of a "potential Heir" is SEEN, squirming with frustration or anger.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The once proud name of Frankenstein has been dragged, by my only son, Victor, into an abyss of shame. There was a time when the name 'Frankenstein' conjured dreams of virtue, of honor and devotion. Now, no guilt, no malignity, no misery can be found to equal mine. And the catalogue of sins of my once devoted son will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them forever -- so supremely frightful is the effect of any human endeavor to mock the stupendous mechanism of the Creator of the world. Did you get all that? Are you sure you got 'rankle in my wounds'? I'll kill you if you screw this up. All right, all right. Now as to the disposition of my estate.

	This so called 'brain stem' consists of the midbrain, a rounded protrusion called the pons, and a stalk tapering downwards called the medulla oblongata which passes out of the skull through the foramen magnum and becomes, of course... the spinal cord.

Freddy turns to Carlson, who hands him the scalpel. Freddy makes a small slit down the center of the cauliflower.

	...and then, ever so gently, gently, gently... pull it apart...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>

Freddy has some difficulty pulling the cauliflower apart.

<DIRECTION>
It begins to crumble, but he goes on, professionally.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...we should find, with any luck at all... a stalk of... celery!

There is no celery inside the cauliflower. Freddy flushes red.

</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Freddy turns back to his audience.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With any normal cauliflower, we would have found a stalk of celery, or... 'Brain Stem' which brings us to the practical application of our study.

Freddy moves behind the Patient on the table.

(to Mr. Hilltop)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you be so kind enough to hop up on your feet and stand beside this table.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Hill top gets off of the table and stands erect.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Hilltop! Would you raise your left knee, please!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Hilltop raises his left knee.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have just witnessed a 'Voluntary' nerve impulse. It begins as a stimulus from the cerebral cortex, passes through the brain stem and then to the particular muscle involved. Mr. Hilltop, you may lower your knee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
He lowers his knee.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reflex movements are those which are made independently of the will, but are carried out along pathways which pass between the periphery and the central nervous system. You filthy, rotten, yellow son of a BITCH!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Freddy pokes his knee close to Mr. Hilltop's balls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Hilltop reacts accordingly.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are not aware of the impulses, neither do we intend them to contract our muscles. Yet -- as you can see -- they work by themselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
By this time, Mr. Hilltop has lowered his protective thigh... a little nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now then! Modern research has shown us that by simply applying local pressure of 'blocking' the nerve impulse... which can be done with any ordinary metal clamp...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Freddy reaches out his hand. Carlson hands him a bicycle clamp. Freddy holds Mr. Hilltop's head and places the clamp behind Mr. Hilltop's ears.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Just at the swelling on the posterior nerve root -- for, oh say five or six seconds...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
A short pause. Freddy looks at his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why you mother-grabbing BASTARD!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Freddy once again jerks his knee close to Mr. Hilltop's balls. This time Mr. Hilltop doesn't move. He is almost ready to pass out.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All communication is shut off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Similarly, damage to a nerve will mean that not all the impulses can get through and there will be weakness of a muscle...

Freddy, holding the candle above them, follows the MUSIC down a narrow, winding stairway. The source of the MUSIC gets CLOSER and CLOSER, as they follow the yellow candlelight down, down, down... brushing against the cobwebbed walls. As they pass one section of wall, an ancient sign can just barely be made out in the after glow of their light. It reads:

FREDDY'S LAUGHTER is still HEARD from below. There is a GIANT CRACKLE OF LIGHTNING -- as if in reply.

Inga goes to a medicine case and prepares a hypodermic.

The Monster raises its head and makes little circles with its hands, asking to be "free."

	Careful, master -- you never can tell with these chaps.

<FREDDY>

<DIRECTION>
Freddy takes the strap across the Monster's thighs and unties it. Then he unties the strap across its chest... and steps back. ALL EYES ARE ON THE MONSTER. TINGLY MUSIC. The Monster looks at them all for a moment while he is still lying down. A slightly sly grin comes to his mouth. He rises... slowly, carefully, to a sitting position.
</DIRECTION>
<MONSTER>

	MMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmm.

PRODUCTION NUMBER - "ALIVE"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...in which Freddy, the Monster and Igor do a SONG and DANCE that teaches the Monster how to move. Occasionally, Inga and an unseen FIFTY-PIECE ORCHESTRA join in. The Monster tries, in his own special way, to imitate the gentle, "Soft Shoe" examples of Freddy and Igor. But where they "Ping" and "Clink"... he "PONGS" and "CLONGS."
</DIRECTION>

ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a big finish, the Monster beams ecstatically. He bows out of instinct: "Show Business" is in his blood.

<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whew! I'm glad that's over with.

</FREDDY>
<IGOR>

</IGOR>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

</FREDDY>
<IGOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the point of my setup? It's not funny unless you repeat exactly what you said.

</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
The Monster stares at Freddy in fascination.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have given you one of the finest minds of this century. You are a brilliant endocrinologist. You are a superb scientist. And you are making naughty! Now that's enough. Finished! From now on, you will behave like a man, and not a spoiled, snot-nosed, sniveling brat who thinks he can get anything he wants by bullying people with sheer brute force.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Care for a jujubee?

</IGOR>

The Monster lowers one hand -- holding Freddy up with the other -- and takes the box of jujubees. He sniffs them.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>

Igor MOVES OFF in search of the MUSIC. The Monster -- deeply affected by the LULLABY -- slowly sets Freddy down.

	And now, my fellow scientists and neurosurgeon...I must ask you to... suspend belief. For up until now, you have seen the Creature perform the simple mechanics of motor activity. That this Creature was an inanimate blob, which I endowed with the secret of life -- yes!...in all honesty -- that showed some measure of skill on my part. But for what you are about to see next... we must enter -- quietly -- into the realm of genius. I say this modestly, only because I am, myself, as in awe of the gifts I possess as if I were observing them in some other person. I think of them, only, as a loan. Grateful, of course... that my credit is good. Thus, with the accumulated knowledge of Chemistry, Electricity, Neurosurgery... and art... I now present what was once an inarticulate mass of lifeless tissues. Ladies and gentlemen... Mesdames et Messieurs... Damen und Herren...The Creature!

Do you understand what it means -- never to see a kind or happy face? You could imagine then, perhaps, how such bitterness led me, at last, to the brink of another kind or life.

But even at the height of his quest -- this ego- driven, brilliant and half-crazed scientist... always... always... held an image of me as something beautiful. And then, at the moment of truth, when it would have been easy enough to run and stay out of danger... he used himself as a guinea pig, in order to give me a calmer brain... and a slightly more eloquent way of speaking. Yes! I am 'The Monster"... sometimes known as 'Him,' or occasionally, 'The Creature.' But they're one and the same. I am that tall, peculiarly attractive stranger, with the winning smile.

:SC: INT. CASTLE BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freddy is sitting in an easy chair near the fire, dressed in pajamas and reading a newspaper. (Probably the Transylvania Tribune -- International Edition).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the bathroom comes the SOUND of Inga, HUMING a pleasant tune to herself.
</DIRECTION>
<INGA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(o.s., from the bathroom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you have a nice day today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INGA_S_VOICE>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, just the usual: sore throats, a few colds. Someone who thought he was a werewolf, and two bladder transplants.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
She goes on humming.
</DIRECTION>
<INGA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you notice the new drapes I put up in the bedroom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INGA_S_VOICE>
<FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
(looking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes!... They're very nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<INGA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm glad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INGA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
A short pause of silence, and then Inga begins humming the EERIE TRANSYLVANIAN LULLABY, quietly unconsciously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freddy's face is hidden behind the newspaper, but he is suddenly completely motionless.
</DIRECTION>
<INGA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was hoping you'd like them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INGA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
She continues humming the Lullaby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freddy lowly lowers the newspaper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He touches his fingertips to his temple. His eyes open and close, as if he were trying to focus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inga comes out of the bathroom, dressed in her nightgown, and folds back the covers of their large double bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She continues humming.
</DIRECTION>
<INGA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right if I turn out the lamp, sweetheart?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INGA>
<FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
(answering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MMmmm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
She turns out the lamp as she goes on humming. The bedroom is lit only by moonlight and the glow from the fireplace.
</DIRECTION>
<INGA>
<DIRECTION>
(as she is arranging the pillows)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall I set the alarm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INGA>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MMMmmm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<DIRECTION>
She goes on humming, as she pulls out the stopper on the alarm clock. Freddy rises. His arms hang away from his body, STIFFLY. He walks in fits and jerks.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MMMMmmmmm!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<INGA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sweetie... I heard you. So! I'm ready for you, meine Liebe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INGA>
<DIRECTION>
Freddy is standing at the edge of the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<INGA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you ready for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INGA>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MMMMmmmmm!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<INGA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ready for Fuchsmachen???
	</DIALOGUE>
</INGA>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MMMMMMmmmmmmmmm!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>
<INGA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love it when you're excited. Come then, my Apfelstrudel! Come into my arms and let me hold you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INGA>
<DIRECTION>
Freddy kneels onto the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long pause.
</DIRECTION>
<INGA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweetheart... Is this really you???
	</DIALOGUE>
</INGA>
<FREDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MMMMMMMMMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDDY>

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TURRET AT THE TOP OF THE CASTLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Igor sits in the window, blowing his trumpet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK SLOWLY, until the whole castle in SEEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
