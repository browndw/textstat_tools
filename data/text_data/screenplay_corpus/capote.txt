EXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA follows a SIXTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL, long hair, pretty Sunday church dress, walking toward a peaceful farmhouse. At the door she lifts the knocker. The door opens slightly. The girl turns and looks past the camera at her MOTHER, sitting in an old Plymouth idling in the driveway. Her mother shrugs, motions for her to go inside.

<DIRECTION>
The girl's POV: the CAMERA pans across the bedroom of a high school coed. We see the desk, the bureau, the bed. On the bed lies NANCY CLUTTER, her wrists and legs bound in rope, SHOT in the head. There is blood on the wall. The sixteen year-old girl stands immobile. Before she starts to scream,

	So Jimmy Baldwin tells me the plot of his book, and he says to me: the writing's going well, but I just want to make sure it's not one of those problem novels. I said: Jimmy, your novel's about a Negro homosexual who's in love with a Jew -- wouldn't you call that a problem?

<DIRECTION>
C/U of article being snipped out of PAGE 39 of the Times, November 16, 1959. As the page gets turned around with each snip, we see a small PHOTO of a middle-aged man wearing glasses, with the caption: "FOUND DEAD: Herbert W. Clutter, a wealthy Kansas farmer..." We read the headline: "WEALTHY FARMER, 3 OF FAMILY SLAIN. Parts of the story: "HOLCOMB, Kan., Nov. 15 (UPI) -- ...wheat farmer, his wife... two young children found shot today..."

Truman opens the door. Inside the cabin his childhood friend from Monroeville, Alabama, NELLE HARPER LEE (yes, that Harper Lee), is reading. She looks up, deadpan --

In the reception area, ALVIN DEWEY and the two other KBI AGENTS assigned to the Clutter case are getting their jackets on and straightening their ties. They've completely taken over the office. They are: HAROLD "Brother" NYE (34); and ROY "Curly CHURCH (60 - bald). They all smoke.

Sheriff WALTER SANDERSON -- 60's, kind, overweight -- is office-less (though he and his wife DOROTHY still live on the fourth floor of the Courthouse.) WALTER lurks in the background, nowhere to go, emptying one of many FILLED ASHTRAYS, BOTHERED by the SMOKE. Truman and Nelle enter as:

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll talk facts but I won't speculate. The main fact here we need to be clear on is not one, but four people were killed. A lot of folks say Herb Clutter had to be the main target because he was dealt with the most brutally --

	George, it's good to see you again. I do have an opinion whether this was the work of one man or a whole bunch, as you said, but it doesn't matter a whole lot whether it was Mexicans or Methodists or Eskimos.

No people, low light. Four CLOSED CASKETS at the back of the room. Truman walks over slowly. After a moment, he checks to make sure he's alone. Then he LIFTS THE TOP of one of the caskets. It's Bonnie Clutter's body, in a long-sleaved navy- blue dress; but her head is wrapped in layers and layers of white cotton gauze, and lacquered with a shiny substance -- like an enormous cocoon. Truman stares.

Jazzy Christmas music on the RADIO. Nelle sits in the big armchair with a drink. She laughs. We HEAR Jack on the phone:
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're celebrating.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
We see Truman wearing a YELLOW SILK SHORT ROBE with white lace, bare legs. He's on the phone and walking, for Nelle's enjoyment, back and forth, like a runway model.
</DIRECTION>
<TRUMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember Nelle's manuscript she sent me in New York?

Truman puts down his drink and marches out of the room, shuts the door. Nelle's unsure whether she really insulted him. From the HALL, we hear a WOMAN SHRIEK, and a MAN saying:

Truman, Nelle, Marie and Alvin. Drinks. A FULL ASHTRAY on the coffee table in front of Alvin. He's distracted, smoking. Marie holds a WOMEN'S MAGAZINE, checking what Truman says with what's written there.

	Two men did it. They know who. One of them used to have a cellmate who gave him up for the thousand dollar reward. They passed through Kansas City last week writing bad checks -- by the time Alvin's boys got up there they'd skipped out again.

EXT. COURTHOUSE SQUARE, GARDEN CITY - LATE AFTERNOON

	<DIALOGUE>
	...This is KERG radio, Garden City. A friendly broadcast from a friendly place. Our lead story:

</RADIO_ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, the sounds of a CROWD emerge in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE UP ON: HIGH SCHOOL kids sitting on the hood and front seat of a CHEW parked at the edge of a CROWD of 200 people. Truman watches. It is COLD. A fat, shivering CO-ED reads the headline in the Kansas City Star: "Police Fear Lynch Mob." The CAR RADIO is on.
</DIRECTION>
<RADIO_ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</RADIO_ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
Truman moves from the car into the large crowd. Old ladies; ranchers; local businessmen; moms with kids; journalists INTERVIEWING citizens; photographers lined up at the bottom of the COURTHOUSE STEPS. We hear snippets of conversation as we pass. A CITIZEN is being interviewed by a JOURNALIST; a MOM WITH BABY standing with a FRIEND; a MIDDLE-AGED man in an overcoat CRYING silently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Truman approaches Nelle and Marie Dewey, standing together at the curb in front of the courthouse, near the photographers. They are talking quietly, turn to Truman --
</DIRECTION>
<NELLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NELLE>
<DIRECTION>
We hear LOUD CROWD NOISE at the south end of the square. A CONVOY of FOUR CARS enters the square. It pulls around to the front of the courthouse. STATE TROOPERS spill out of the lead and rear CARS. Nye gets out of the second car. He opens the back door. The crowd falls SILENT. Two state troopers get DICK HICKOCK -- handcuffed, pale -- out of the car and lead him up the steps. FLASH. FLASH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dewey and Church open the third car's back door. Silence. They retrieve PERRY SMITH. Perry is extremely SHORT, STRONG, ODDLY BEAUTIFUL, with the dark skin and hair of his American Indian mother, and the pug features of his Irish father. As he stands, he has trouble straightening his stubby LEGS, as if they are arthritic. Truman stares.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Motorcycle accident. He broke them and they never healed right.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alvin told me.

</MARIE>
<DIRECTION>
Truman watches Perry, transfixed. Perry seems terrified of the crowd, all the faces, like a child. Perry scans the crowd. His eyes fall on Truman. FLASH. FLASH. Truman and Perry look at each other as Perry is led slowly past. At the top of the steps the COURTHOUSE DOORS slam shut.

FADE OUT:

<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"For the maiden of the Midwest, the priestess of the plains, the queen of the kitchen: my first novel. Truman."
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
It is "Other Voices, Other Rooms" and we see on the back of it the INFAMOUS JACKET PHOTO of Truman at 23 draped sexily on a couch. Truman curtsies. The PHONE RINGS.

INT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, FOYER - CONTINUOUS

Truman walks into the residence. To the left is the kitchen; to the right is the living room. Truman looks back at Dorothy -- she's still on the phone. He heads for the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Truman walks slowly through the doorway of the large kitchen. On the far side of the kitchen is a JAIL CELL. Inside the cell is PERRY SMITH. (Now we know why Truman came here.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Truman STARES. Perry doesn't see him -- he's resting his head on a small table, the tip of his THUMB in his mouth. The chair seems too tall for Perry. He looks like a lonely kindergartner, told to take his afternoon nap. After several moments, Dorothy enters, flustered:
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Truman. I meant in there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(points to living room)

Perry sits up quickly, rubs his legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the women's cell. It's hardly ever used. But they wanted to, um, separate... Please. Let's sit in the living room. I'll set up in the living room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
She gathers a tray of Truman's PASTRIES, and COFFEE CUPS.

She goes -- Truman starts to follow, then lingers.

Judge ROLAND TATE, white-haired, imperious, bangs his gavel. The packed crowd quiets down. Perry and Dick sit at the defense table chewing JUICY FRUIT GUM. Next to them: their aged court-appointed lawyer, Franklin Weeks (70).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dick wears a SHIRT AND TIE. Perry wears jeans rolled up at the cuff, his SHIRT OPEN at the collar. He draws on a piece of paper with a STUBBY PENCIL -- a rather good picture of a LARGE PARROT. Truman sits with Nelle, watching Perry --

Crowd gets up. Much talk. Truman watches Perry and Dick through the forest of bodies. They are led away in handcuffs. Franklin Weeks stands slowly, then begins gathering his things -- he's old and it takes him ages to collect his papers. Truman watches.

INT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

Truman sits near the bars of the cell. Perry draws on a scrap of paper at the small table. Dorothy watches from the door to the living room. The BOOK Truman gave to Dorothy lies on the floor next to Perry's meticulously made bed.
</DIRECTION>
<TRUMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was it your choice to waive the hearing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRUMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Perry doesn't answer. Dorothy checks her watch, leaves. Truman takes a bottle of BAYER ASPIRIN out of his pocket.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I could kill you if you got too close.

Perry puts the aspirin in his mouth, CHEWS THEM, holds out his hand for more. Truman gives him more, which Perry puts in his pocket for later.

<TRUMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On the night of November 14, two men broke into a quite farmhouse in Kansas and murdered an entire family. Why did they do that? It's been suggested that this subject is tawdry -- it's not worthy of literature. I disagree. Two worlds exist in this country -- the quiet conservative life, and the life of those two men -- the underbelly, the criminally violent. Those worlds converged that bloody night. I spent the past three months interviewing everyone in Kansas touched by that violence. I spent hours talking to the killers -- and I'll spend more.

Jack sits. Nelle opens the letter, reads:

<NELLE>

	"Dear Friend Truman. Where are you? Read this item in a medical dictionary: "Death by hanging is caused by asphyxia, by fracture of the cervical vertebrae, by laceration of the trachea." Not too comforting as we lost our appeal. Missing you -- alone and desirous of your presence. Your amigo, Perry."

<TRUMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know how to answer that... It's as if Perry and I started life in the same house. One day he stood up and walked out the back door while I walked out the front. With some different choices, he's the man I might have become.

	The village of Holcomb stands on the high wheat plains of western Kansas, a lonesome area that other Kansans call "out there."

	The four coffins, which quite filled the small, flower-crowded parlor, were to be sealed at the funeral services -- very understandably, for the effect... was disquieting. Nancy wore her dress of cherry-red velvet, her brother a bright plaid shirt; the parents were more sedately attired, Mr. Clutter in navy-blue flannel, his wife in navy-blue crepe; and -- and it was this especially that lent the scene an awful aura -- the head of each was completely encased in cotton, a swollen cocoon twice the size of an ordinary blown- up balloon, and the cotton, because it had been sprayed with a glossy substance, twinkled like Christmas- tree snow.

	Imagination, of course, can open any door -- turn the key and let terror walk right in. [One] Tuesday, at dawn, a carload of... strangers, ignorant of the local disaster -- were startled by what they saw as they crossed the prairies and passed through Holcomb: windows ablaze, almost every window in almost every house, and, in the brightly lit rooms, fully clothed people, even entire families, who had sat the whole night wide awake, watchful, listening. Of what were they frightened? "It might happen again."

Mrs. Murchak looks like a female Perry, dark and small, attractive and nervous. Through the window, we see THREE LITTLE CHILDREN playing on a DECREPIT JUNGLE GYM in the yard. Truman sits at the table, leafing through a PHOTO ALBUM.

	We heard there was ten thousand dollars in that house. Once we'd tied up everybody and searched all over, I knew the guy who told us about it was wrong. There wasn't any money. But Dick wouldn't believe it. He went tearing through the house again, banging on the walls, looking for a safe. He said when he was done, he was going to come up to Nancy's room and have his way with her. I wouldn't allow it. I told him that. I sat with Nancy.

I figured if I just waited him out he'd give up and leave them tied up there. We'd drive all night, they'd never find us. Mr. Clutter's wrists were tied to a pipe over his head.

	Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me.

<CHAPLAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

</CHAPLAIN>
<DIRECTION>
The BLACK SACK goes over Perry's head. Truman watches. He stands next to Alvin Dewey.

Truman, seated on the aisle, next to William Shawn. After a long silence, he extracts from his leather briefcase a PACKAGE wrapped in BROWN PAPER. Hands it to Truman.
</DIRECTION>
<SHAWN>

	It came to the hotel this morning. I told them I'd give it to you.

The package says KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY and is addressed to Truman. Truman opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes out PERRY'S NOTEBOOKS -- the DIARY and PERSONAL DICTIONARY. He opens the Diary. Toward the end, he finds Perry's final entry. He READS silently. We hear Perry's VOICE:
</DIRECTION>
<PERRY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did we not know we were to die, we would be children. By knowing it, we are given the opportunity to mature in spirit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PERRY>
<DIRECTION>
Truman turns the page. It's BLANK. He closes the Diary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We CONTINUE to hear Perry's VOICE as Truman takes out a SNAPSHOT -- the one of Perry (at age 3) and Linda splashing in the puddle.

<PERRY>

Truman takes out a PENCIL DRAWING Perry did of him. It's very good, though Truman looks old and weary in it.

Truman finds, at the bottom of the package, his TIE. He takes it out, clutches it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Truman grasps for William Shawn's HAND, finds it, holds on tightly. Shawn sits stoically, hoping no one will notice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA pulls back, up the aisle. Truman clutches the tie, and holds on to Shawn's hand, for dear life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.
