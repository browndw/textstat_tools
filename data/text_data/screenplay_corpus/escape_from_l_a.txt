Suddenly we are hit by the loudest, booming, rolling concussion you have ever heard. The buildings begin to shake, swaying wildly. The Bonaventure Hotel implodes, collapses inward in the thudding, slamming freight train of an earthquake. The 4-level Interchange as the Santa Monica Freeway shatters, crumbles, pulling exit ramps, cars, trees, and nearby buildings with it.

SEQUENCE OF RAPID CUTS

Buildings shaking. Streets buckling. Cars rolling, crashing. People running. Gas mains exploding. Buildings convulsing and dropping like tinder against an inferno.

TRAVELING SHOT low, across the top of the water's surface. Climb up the side of a massive, rusted supertanker, abandoned, years ago. Break over the railing to reveal a gigantic neon sign which screams "NEW LAS VEGAS." The supertanker has been transformed into a floating resort.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera increases speed, moves past huge billboards displaying gigantic glitzy ads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"NUCLEAR NIGHTS IN HAVANA" - an extravaganza with fabulous showgirls and laser recreations of Fidel's final night.

EXT. ALLEY - NEW LAS VEGAS, 2013 - NIGHT

An alley strangled with tourists, gamblers, hookers, hustlers, and con men - professional expatriates from the West mingling with excited visitors from all over the world.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Salesman with a chin-mike speaks non-stop, unintelligible Chinese. A frenzied crowd gathers around him, waving money, placing bets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two men sit at either end of a long table. They are in deep shadows, facing each other. We only get glimpses of them: One fat. Mirrored sunglasses. Chinese. His fingers tap on the table. A cockroach scurries past. Ammo belts. A sheathed combat knife the size of your arm. .45 automatics in holsters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other, dressed in black. An eye-patch. Dangerous. A flash of two six-guns in holsters. A futuristic gunfighter. The cockroach dashes past his fingers. WHAP! He squashes it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd goes nuts, placing bets, yelling and screaming in a dozen languages.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The salesman places three different shaped, clear shot glasses in front of the two men. Then he leans over to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A VAT OF POISONOUS SNAKES. He reaches in, grabs a cobra, pulls it out. The cobra hisses and squirms. Deftly, the salesman continues to talk non-stop into his chin-mike as he milks the cobra venom into the first glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls out an ice-pick, jabs it into the snake's throat, and bleeds a thick green-white liquid into the second glass. Finally, he slits open the cobra with a large knife, and cuts out the heart and liver. Tossing aside the dead snake, the salesman squeezes the heart and liver with his fingers. The juice drips into the third glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the salesman stirs the glasses. The poison is clear. The blood is milky-green. The heart and liver are red. He places the glasses on the table between the two men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two men stare at each other, motionless. The crowd continues placing bets at a fevered pitch. A titanium white tube floats above the center of the table. A laser beam of light shines from one end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The salesman leans over and flicks on side with his finger, sending the tube spinning on its axis like a bottle, the light circling the room before stopping on the fat man's forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fat man reaches slowly toward the glasses. His hand shakes slightly. He hesitates. Finally he takes the glass with the red liquid (the heart and liver), lifts it to his lips, pauses, then gulps it down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd explodes. More bets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The salesman leans over and spins the light tube again, this time it lands on something black, an eye-patch. Pull back to reveal a man with an eye-patch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man with the eye-patch reaches forward, his hand paused between the remaining two glasses. He takes the one filled with milky-green blood and downs it fast. The crowd roars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One glass left. The two men stare at it intently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The salesman spins the light tube with more force than before. It circles again and again, slowing down, speeding up, finally stopping on the fat man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The salesman begins yelling over the din of the crowd, shouting at the fat man. The fat man reaches for the glass of clear poison. His trembling fingers hover above it. Then he quickly withdraws his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd reacts, boos, as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man with the eye-patch smiles. A slightly, cynical smile. And without hesitation, he reaches out, grabs the glass of poison, and drinks it down. The crowd surges forward, but the salesman stops them with a sweep of his arm. All bets are off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two men stand from the table. Take several steps away toward the end of the alley. Stand facing each other. Two gunfighters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flashes of the two men. A piece of a black military boot. A hand positioned over a six-shooter. Mirrored sunglasses. A sweaty, trembling lip. And the eye-patched man's one good eye, blue and clear, staring - hard and calm as a sunny day...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The draw. It happens in an instant. The alley thunders with gunfire. The guns buck and flash. Then silence. The two men stand there for a beat, until one of them, the fat man, slumps, falls face first into the alley, dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd goes completely ape shit as SNAKE PLISSKEN emerges from the shadows of the alley, holsters his guns, grabs his take of the money...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SNAKE PLISSKEN. Long hair. A black eye-patch. A tight-lipped grimace. The impression of coiled aggression and intense cynicism. The toughest, most dangerous man on planet earth. A legend.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLISSKEN strolls out of the alley into the crowd. He counts his money, pockets it, as a cigarette girl approaches him. PLISSKEN stops her, pays for a pack of cigs. As she eyes him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP OF PLISSKEN'S ARM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... the cigarette girl touches him, pricks his skin with her fingernail. A drop of blood appears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLISSKEN turns, stares after her, as the sound of helicopters rises from above in the night sky. The crowd suddenly starts to disperse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helicopter searchlights blast down on the street. PLISSKEN is suddenly caught in the glare. He starts to move away...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KACLANG!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of the blackness above a huge steel net drops out of nowhere. The net slams down on top of PLISSKEN, trapping him, driving him down to the pavement with its weight... PLISSKEN struggles inside the net as black figures - United States Police Force Officers - rush toward him, grab the net, tightening it. More cops move for him as we SLOWLY FADE TO BLACK...

EXT. CONTAINMENT WALL - FIREBASE SEVEN - L.A. - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Searchlights sweep down across a column of policemen marching past a concrete wall. Camera begins to crane up the wall. Sound of roaring turbines. The howl of the Santa Ana wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera reaches the top of the wall. Armed police troops stand on the battlements. Across what looks like an ocean is L.A. The view is from the Newhall Pass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hidden by the Santa Monica Mountains, L.A. glows in the distance with a hundred fires. Smoke surges from the jagged horizon. Above, the sky is an angry orange.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - TOP OF THE WALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Res sensor lights glow in evenly spaced intervals. Searchlights sweep into the darkness. Cannons are in place every 200 feet, manned by police guards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAN FERNANDO SEA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Water stretches into blackness. This was once the San Fernando Valley, but now it's all underwater. Pieces of debris - tops of buildings, the tail of an airplane, a radio tower - stick up above the surface. We can make out the letters of an old, half-sunken sign: "SAN FERNANDO VALLEY MALL"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE WALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wall stretches to the northwest up to the Santa Susanna Pass. Portions of the 118 Freeway arch up out of the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - BEHIND THE WALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Firebase Seven is a fortified base camp in the San Gabriel Mountains. It is a sprawling police complex with low concrete bunkers, gun emplacements, satellite communications, vehicles, troops, the works. ON A LARGE ASPHALT FIELD, opposite the main complex is Rotor City - row after row of black, multi-bladed, totally evil police battle helicopters parked like giant bugs on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A throng of policemen gather at the edge of Rotor City yelling and cheering, their fists in the air. Cops with camcorders videotape the event. A police anchor reports...
</DIRECTION>
<POLICE_ANCHOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's been the Force's Most Wanted Man for 10 years. Convicted of 27 moral crimes. I can tell you, the excitement around here is...

	Here he comes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICE_ANCHOR>
<DIRECTION>
A MASSIVE 7-ROTORED, 40-BLADED HELICOPTER TRANSPORT comes slamming down out of the black sky and lands. The growing crowd of cheering cops goes nuts like fans at a football game. They slap hands, dance wildly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mammoth room filled with high-tech instrumentation. A glowing holographic map of L.A. fills one wall. Most of the control personnel have left their work stations and gather around TV sets all showing the Police Channel: a view of the helicopter transport sitting on the asphalt and the cheering crowds at the edge of Rotor City.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tall, steel-faced officer sits at his desk. This is Firebase Commander MAC "BIG DOG" MALLOY. Hard, battle weary features. BRAZEN, a section Lieutenant, comes up.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAZEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Commander Malloy. They're bringing him out, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAZEN>
<DIRECTION>
Malloy rises from his chair, steps to a nearby TV set, watches the scene from the Police Channel.

	Hold one! The door is opening!
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICE_ANCHOR>
<DIRECTION>
The door of the helicopter transport slowly lowers like a drawbridge. Out of its black belly comes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SNAKE PLISSKEN. A steel collar is clamped around his neck. Eight lengths of chain stretch to eight armed guards who escort Plissken down the ramp. Plissken is bruised, badly beaten and tortured, his face a mess, but he doesn't seem to care. A line of battle-ready cops stand with their guns aimed right at Plissken's head as he is marched into camp. An army of camcorders move ahead of the Police Anchor as he scampers along in front of PLISSKEN, interviewing him.
</DIRECTION>
<POLICE_ANCHOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Plissken. Welcome to L.A.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICE_ANCHOR>
<DIRECTION>
Celebrating cops cheer as Plissken is lead to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SIGN ABOVE A CONCRETE BUNKER - DEPORTATION CENTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bunker has one large opening, into which hundreds of deportees march. Guards in towers monitor the condemned as they trudge out of fenced-in containment areas, down walled corridors to the bunker entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The deportees are minorities, the poor, prostitutes, pimps, thieves, adulterers, atheists - the Morally Guilty, outcasts of society. Single mothers carry babies. Teenage runaways huddle together. There are abortion doctors, drug dealers, pornographers, the prisoners of a massive cultural war.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Plissken is marched toward the entrance, a loudspeaker blares out:
</DIRECTION>
<POLICE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are now entering the Deportation Center. You have been found guilty of moral crimes against the United States of America.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
A great cheer goes up from the cops as the Police Anchor conducts his interview...
</DIRECTION>
<POLICE_ANCHOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	S.D. Bob Plissken. Special Forces, Black Light, Texas Thunder. Two Purple Hearts. Youngest man ever decorated by the President.

Plissken's face remains so impassive as to be almost blank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SODIUM VAPOR CORRIDOR - DEPORTATION CENTER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A glowing, vaporous-orange corridor. More cops gather to watch Plissken as he is escorted into the bowels of the Deportation Center.
</DIRECTION>
<POLICE_ANCHOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been convicted of 27 moral crimes, Plissken. The murder of an Internal Revenue agent. The kidnapping of a bank president. Gun fighting for profit. The list goes on and on...

</POLICE_ANCHOR>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONCRETE HALLWAY - DEPORTATION CENTER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deeper into the Deportation Center. Camera tracks along the deportees, some bleeding, some wrapped in rags. Plissken, the Police Anchor, camcorders and the armed escort move through the dark, low concrete passageway.
</DIRECTION>
<POLICE_ANCHOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You used to respect the law. Served your country like no man before you. Role model to a generation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICE_ANCHOR>

The Police Anchor leans in as close as he dares to Plissken's face.

STEEL-WALLED HALLWAY - DEPORTATION CENTER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steel walls. Deeper into the Deportation Center. The deportees here are in worse shape. Some appear to be dead. Plissken and his entourage continue along, as the speaker echoes a pre-recorded message...
</DIRECTION>
<POLICE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are sentenced to permanent expulsion beyond the borders of the U.S. You now have the option to repent of your sins and be electrocuted on the premises. If you elect this option, notify the Cleric Sergeant in your Processing Area.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken and his entourage pass deportees kneeling and praying in front of cloaked cleric cops, government holy men. Beyond, through opened doorways, see Death Row deportees being strapped into futuristic electric chairs.
</DIRECTION>
<POLICE_ANCHOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The whole world's watching. Every good and decent person who works and hard and follows the rules. What would say to them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICE_ANCHOR>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken's expression is blank.
</DIRECTION>
<POLICE_ANCHOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would you say to all of us who believed in you, who looked up to you, who thought you stood for right over wrong, good over evil? Be my guest. What do you have to say, Plissken?

Malloy, Brazen, and a 3rd man, tall, charismatic, grim, move urgently along a corridor.

	ComStat did a psychosearch on him. Used a database of 5 million sociopathic personalities. He hit the bottom of the curve.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Perfect for the mission. Nobody else can pull it off - not an army, not a man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<BRAZEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zero emotional developments. Total lack of compassion. A highly developed psychopathic instinct to survive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAZEN>
<DIRECTION>
3RD MAN Let's get this over with.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONCRETE CELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cell door slams shut. Plissken turns around. Writ and leg irons. He looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the concrete cell he sees a simple table with an overhead light above it. A watch lies on the table. Plissken shuffles over, picks up the watch, examines it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cell door opens. Malloy, Brazen, and the 3rd Man enter the room unarmed. The door closes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malloy and Brazen move forward, to the edge of the light. The 3rd Man stays back in the shadows by the door.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How you doin' Plissken?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(no reply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You like the watch?

</MALLOY>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You assholes didn't bring me here to give me this for 20 years of dedicated service. What'ya want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<DIRECTION>
Malloy looks back to the 3rd Man in the shadows...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
3RD MAN Get to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malloy raises a control unit, pushes the button. The lights go down and a computer-enhanced image appears on the wall...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PROTOTYPE DEFENSE LAB - SURVEILLANCE CAMERA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the point of view of a surveillance camera. The lab is huge. Banks of processors, disk drives, test bays, prototype assembly areas. High tech. A group of government officials is being given a tour. Utopia, 17, the President's daughter is among them. Pretty, virginal, she wears a "True Love Waits" button on her flowered dress.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At 1030 hours Wednesday, a group of government officials began a tour of the Livermore Defense Lab. The President's daughter, Utopia, was among them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken continues to watch the image on the wall...
</DIRECTION>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An hour later, she boarded Air Force 3 to Washington.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<DIRECTION>
The 3rd Man reacts as the image in front of Plissken changes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIN CABIN OF 747 - CAMCORDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the point of view of a camcorder. Utopia stands inside the main cabin of a plush, government 747. In one hand she holds a black anodized box the size of a transistor radio with a button on top. In the other, a machine gun.
</DIRECTION>
<UTOPIA>
<DIRECTION>
(to the camcorder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To the American people - it is time to rise up and demand the surrender of the President and his corrupt theocracy of lies and terror.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UTOPIA>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At 1140 hours, she hijacked the plane. We scanned the videotape on VR. Check it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the surveillance room the President stares grimly as Malloy presses a button. Suddenly the image in front of Plissken spreads out all around him. He is in a virtual reality re-creation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIN CABIN OF 747 - VIRTUAL REALITY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken stands manacled in the main cabin. A group of secret service men and congressmen watch as a flight attendance operates a camcorder. He's videotaping Utopia as she rants into the camera. She's pent up with such anxiety she's like a panther in a cage.
</DIRECTION>
<UTOPIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Today is Day One of a brand new world. The days of the empire are finished.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To the President - my father, you know what this is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UTOPIA>
<DIRECTION>
She holds up the anodized box with the red button and thrusts it at the camcorder.
</DIRECTION>
<UTOPIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what it will do. Unless you abdicate your throne by tomorrow night, I will use it - on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UTOPIA>
<CONGRESSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Utopia, please. Give us the prototype. If something should happen -
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONGRESSMAN>
<UTOPIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It will be in my hands - and the hands of my lover.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UTOPIA>
<DIRECTION>
She says "lover" with all the drama a 17-year-old virgin can muster. The others are shocked.
</DIRECTION>
<UTOPIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, my lover. My man. The only real man I've ever known. I'm on my way to his arms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UTOPIA>
<DIRECTION>
She moves to the rear of the main cabin, bends down, opens a small hatch in the floor, scrambles down...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM! The VR image suddenly disappears and Plissken is again standing inside the concrete cell. Malloy and Brazen stand in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somehow during the tour, she came into possession of a prototype transmitting device. We don't know how.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<BRAZEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Utopia became depressed after her mother's suicide, began to withdraw into her virtual reality simulator. She'd punch up her own little world in cyberspace and stay in it for days at a time.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Somebody else was in there with her.

</BRAZEN>
<DIRECTION>
AN IMAGE APPEARS
</DIRECTION>

In front of Plissken: A computer-rendered VR picture of clouds and sunshine, green grass and happy animals frolicking. A Garden of Eden. There, coming toward us, is CUERVO JONES. South American terrorist. Fiercest warrior of the Third World. He wears a gleaming ancient Aztec battle helmet. Bandoliers strapped around him.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cuervo Jones. Shining Path. Peruvian terrorist. Runs the biggest baddest gang in L.A.
	</DIALOGUE>

Cuervo Jones takes off the helmet He is blindingly handsome, charismatic. He smiles, reaches out his arms to camera as if to embrace it. The image suddenly pops back to the beginning - it's on a loop. The image disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights in the cell come up.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAZEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Utopia made tapes of her VR experiences, then tried to erase them. She missed this fragment on the end of her last tape. Cuervo Jones must have tapped into the VR master data bank - and then went prowling around for innocent blood, someone vulnerable to corrupt. Utopia was lonely, looking for something to believe in.

Plissken takes a step toward him. Malloy holds up a large hypodermic.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBMARINE - NIGHT

EXT. THE WALL - NEWHALL PASS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

A door in the wall opens, revealing the circulator tunnel. In a roaring explosion, the sub rockets out of the tunnel, shot from the wall like a cannonball. The submarine is airborne for several seconds, then drops down, and slams into the San Fernando Sea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBMARINE

<DIRECTION>
EXT. UNDERWATER - UNIVERSAL CITY - THE BLACK TOWER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sub smacks into the side of the Black Tower, powers through it, blasts out the other side through a window, tilting and wobbling. The sub rights itself momentarily but is slammed downward out of frame by a huge, dark, slimy object.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KING KONG looms overhead - his fist rising and falling with the currents. Plissken has maneuvered himself into the wreckage of the Universal Studios Tour.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sub zips through the King Kong ride into Back To The Future, passing 1950's signage from that film, dodging a rusting Delorean. It slams into the open mouth of JAWS, shattering the model into a million pieces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sub continues on, bouncing through the narrow openings of the Earthquake Ride - broken pipes, cracked sidewalks, split walls - hard to tell what was the ride and what was The Big One.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken struggles, then rips open the hatch, scrambles out. The sub slowly slips backwards, down into the water. As the rear exhaust tubes hit the surface, a blast of steam. Plissken leaps out of the hatch. The sub sinks faster and faster. He scampers up the side, leaps for ground... and lands on the hillside, as the sub sinks into the sea, bubbling, churning, hissing.

A bleeping sound. He takes out his pocket walkie, raises the antenna.

<DIRECTION>
WHAM! Standing above him is a dark figure. Hooded. Carrying something huge and rounded at the ends.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken raises his submachine gun...
</DIRECTION>

Two old cars come zooming up Mulholland, side by side. Windows down. Guns blazing at each other. They pass Plissken, continue down Mulholland, ripping each other apart with gunfire. Plissken darts across Mulholland, down the mountainside.

EXT. MOUNTAINSIDE - NIGHT - RAIN

</PIPELINE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HILLS ABOVE THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL - NIGHT - RAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rain is coming down in a torrent as Plissken makes his way down the hillside. Then, all at once, the rain lets up, then stops. The trees drip with moisture. Suddenly, a huge KATHUMP from above him. Plissken looks back. A huge mudslide is roaring its way down the hill toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken races down the hill, but the mudslide cascades downward like a freight train, catches up with him, sweeps him off his feet... and Plissken goes riding down the hill, rumbling and sliding in the mud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STAND OF TREES - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mudslide hits a flat area near a stand of trees, spreads out, slows. A completely mud-covered, black Plissken climbs out of the goo. He's dripping with it. His one good eye shines in the moonlight. He takes a couple steps toward the edge of the treeline when...
</DIRECTION>
<A_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(SPINAL) (V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut-up, fuck! Stop makin' noise!
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken spins. He's standing right next to SPINAL, the leader of the Black Cowboy Gang. Dressed in black, boots with spurs, black duster, black cowboy hat, he carries an automatic rifle. He looks just like Charles Barkley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken looks around, realizes he's in the middle of a small army of Black Cowboys, crouched behind the trees, waiting in ambush. Covered with mud, Plissken blends right in.
</DIRECTION>
<SPINAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take cover, fool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINAL>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken jumps behind a tree, looks down the hillside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLISSKEN'S POV - THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below his position is the Hollywood Bowl. A huge cross is on stage, and the cross is on fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER - HOLLYWOOD BOWL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of white hooded men, the K.K.K., stand in front of the burning cross holding a ceremony. Next to the cross on stage, a hooded K.K.K. string quartet begins playing a Hayden concerto.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken reacts.
</DIRECTION>
<SPINAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's take him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINAL>
<DIRECTION>
A Black Cowboy raises his M79 grenade launcher, as the others quickly race down the hillside. He fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A 40mm armor-piercing grenade leaves a blazing fire trail as it rockets toward the burning cross and - KABLAMMO! A fireball blows pieces of the cross into the air. The K.K.K. spin around...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A blast of lightning illuminates the Black Cowboys attacking from the hills. They open fire. A K.K.K. Grand Dragon is picked off his feet, buffeted in mid-air, flesh and robe shredded by gunfire. A hail of bullets hits the K.K.K. They return fire, but are overwhelmed. They are hit, jerking and twisting. Fire from the Black Cowboys is withering, racking the hooded figures like bolts of lightning. The Black Cowboys keep advancing, firing, as it starts to rain again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the cloudy wash of dribbling rain water, the firefight continues. Four K.K.K. leap out from behind a row of seats and jump Plissken, knocking his gun to the ground. In a blinding flash, using hands, feet, and head, Plissken sends them flying. As he reaches down to pick up his submachine gun, he sees that the rain is washing the mud off his body...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND SO DOES SPINAL, who stands nearby, watching as Plissken is washed clean by the rain. Spinal raises his weapon, then stops.
</DIRECTION>
<SPINAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. I know you. Snake Plissken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINAL>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken slowly stands, his submachine gun in his hand. Behind them, the firefight is almost over. The K.K.K. scatter into the rain...
</DIRECTION>
<SPINAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, what's going down, Snake?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINAL>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm looking for somebody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<SPINAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who ain't?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINAL>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken pulls out his tracer. It is blipping red, just south of the Bowl.
</DIRECTION>
<SPINAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say, is it true what they say about Cleveland, man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINAL>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken doesn't answer. He moves on through the rain...
</DIRECTION>
<SPINAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Later, Snake. Thanks for the help. You can always shift down and mojo with us anytime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINAL>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VINE AVENUE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ruins of the Capital Records building. The rain has stopped again. Plissken is a lone figure walking along the street. In the distance, the sound of thumping music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD AT HIGHLAND - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pandemonium! Music blares. It's the old Supremes hit, "Love is Like An Itchin' In My Heart." Crowds dance in the street. It's like a block party. Black, Latino and Native American gangs celebrate. Plus the usual Hollywood Boulevard street traffic. Plissken moves through the carnival. Gorgeous hookers stand under the marquee of the ruined Chinese Theater. The marquee now reads: "SAFE SEX", "NO CONDOMS NEEDED", "POLYPROPYLENE ORIFICES", "SATISFACTION GUARANTEED"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the hookers struts in front of Plissken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - THE HOOKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Opening her mouth, she gives a sensuous puff. A polypropylene orifice attached to the inside of her lips expands outward like a small, pink balloon. She sucks it back in and puckers, kissing the air. Plissken turns, as the sounds of car engines rises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV - COMING DOWN HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... is a caravan of vehicles. The crowd parts to let them through, cheering insanely. Plissken ducks into an alley, watches...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The caravan passes Plissken's position. Two men on horseback lead a convoy of rumbling, fuming old cars, buses, motorcycles - all scarred and ripped and jerry-rigged - bumps down the Boulevard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken watches from his spot in the alley, as a blonde-haired hooker joins him, rubs his arm. She has no polypropylene, at least none that we can see.
</DIRECTION>
<BLONDE_HOOKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's winnin' time, baby. How about you and I do some celebrating?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLONDE_HOOKER>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You look familiar. Have I done you before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLONDE_HOOKER>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken grabs the hooker.
</DIRECTION>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's happening?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<BLONDE_HOOKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy, man, easy. It's Cuervo Jones' gang. Mescalito Justice. He's the big boss man 'round here tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's gonna take down the police and make 'em kiss his fine ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLONDE_HOOKER>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken lets her go, stares...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV - A CADILLAC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... is perched ten feet off the ground on monster truck wheels. Severed doll heads are glued all over the hood, and a large glittering disco ball spins atop the roof, catching shards of light and flicking them back into the night...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the disco ball stands the real Cuervo Jones, at least. And there next to him is Utopia. She's dressed in black lace underwear and bra, garters and stockings. A Playboy fantasy. She holds the prototype. Delgado, Cuervo Jones' second-in-command, stands behind her. He is huge and evil. Dressed like Pancho Villa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken stares as the Cadillac passes. The hooker cheers along with the rest of the crowd, and doesn't notice that Plissken's moved off...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several motorcycles bring up the rear of the caravan. Mescalitos ride with their women slung behind them. As the last bike passes, Plissken darts out of the alley, yanks the woman off the back of the cycle, jumps on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE MOTORCYCLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mescalito biker turns to react...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHACK! Plissken takes him out with a head-butt, shoves him off the bike, hops up on the seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAVROOM! Plissken guns the motorcycle and it roars off, around the other bikers, toward the head of the caravan. Plissken zooms along, makes the turn onto La Brea Avenue with the caravan...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LA BREA AND SUNSET BOULEVARDS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the caravan turns west onto Sunset, Plissken blasts around the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON PLISSKEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coming right behind him are four Mescalitos on Harleys - chains, iron bars, and swords in their hands. Plissken stares up ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV - THE CADILLAC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... is just a few feet away. Cuervo Jones and Utopia.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken guns it when suddenly two Mescalitos pull up on either side of him. One of them swings a chain. Plissken grabs it with one hand, and with his other hand, aims his submachine gun and fires! The Mescalito and bike go flying, and Plissken holds on to the chain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Atop the Cadillac, Cuervo Jones reacts to the sound of gunfire. He turns to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLISSKEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the other Mescalito riding behind him swings a chain. Plissken swings his. The two chains snap together, intertwining. Then Plissken squeezes his hand-brake. He screeches to a stop. The Mescalito keeps going, and is yanked over backward by his own chain, off the Harley. Finally the Harley flops over, skids, explodes. Plissken guns it again, takes off after the Cadillac.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two more Mescalitos pull up on either side of Plissken. They take aim at him with their automatic rifles. Plissken pulls a sudden wheelie, lifts the front of his bike up into the air, rides on the back wheel. The two Mescalitos fire - directly into each other. They fall and their bikes go crashing to the pavement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken surges the bike forward, coming up on a Mescalito on horseback who turns and fires. Plissken ducks and the bullet rips through the rear tire. The tire blows and the bike swerves out of control. Plissken leaps from the bike and grabs the back of the saddle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HORSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken pulls himself up behind the Mescalito and wrestles for control of the mount. Plissken grabs the reins and wraps them around the Mescalito's neck, squeezing until his eyes burst. Plissken slams his arm against the Mescalito, throwing him off the saddle, bouncing onto the pavement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken gallops ahead, circling a lasso high above his head, pounding down on a biker. The lasso takes flight and finds it mark, the biker's neck. Plissken pulls the lasso taut, ties the end to the saddle horn, rides his mount parallel to the biker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BIKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With one quick yank to the lasso, Plissken pulls the biker off, jumps on the bike and smacks the hell out of the horse's rump.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HORSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Takes off down the street, dragging the biker by the neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CADILLAC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Speeds up as Plissken moves up to the Mustang five cars behind. He swings off the bike and jumps onto the trunk. Plissken climbs up to the roof, leaps on the hood, then jumps to the trunk of the car in front - leapfrogging, jumping to the next car, the next car...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MESCALITOS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lean out their car windows, firing at him, but Plissken keeps moving toward the Cadillac...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY A HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reaches out a car window and grabs Plissken's submachine gun. Plissken turns to snatch it back -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHEN CUERVO JONES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leaps from the Cadillac and takes Plissken down to the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<CUERVO_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Snake Plissken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUERVO_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
They struggle. Cuervo raises his machete. Plissken grabs his wrist, flips him over, knocks the machete off into the street, smacks Cuervo in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BOLAS-SWINGING MESCALITO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Comes roaring up on his bike, throws the bolas...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLISSKEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the bolas hit him, wrap around his neck, the balls thunking him in the face, sending him flying...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAWHAP! Plissken hits the pavement hard. He skids, rolls, and at last slams into the edge of the sidewalk. The caravan rumbles away down Sunset. The hand in the car window still holds Plissken's submachine gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cuervo crouches on the roof, hissing at Plissken.
</DIRECTION>
<CUERVO_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Later, Snake. We finish it later.

<DIRECTION>
PLISSKEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lies there for several beats, then climbs to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV - THE CARAVAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... disappears up Sunset.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLISSKEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stands alone in the deserted street. The ruins of a supermarket, cheap motels, liquor stores - all empty, desolate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks over to see the broken remains of his pocket walkie. After a beat, he starts moving up Sunset, checking his two 9mm handguns, slipping them into their holsters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUNSET AND DOHENY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the border of Beverly Hills, Sunset stretches off into the darkness beyond the intersection. A slight wind blows litter aimlessly along. There are occasional sounds: Creaks, distant clangs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken approaches the intersection. He carries Utopia's compass homing device. It is silent. The small screen's blank. Then Plissken glances at his wrist watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - WRIST WATCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three hours gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken stands for a moment, staring off down Sunset...

He spins around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sits in an old beach chair on the sidewalk, a map to the stars sign in front of him. In his late 50's, he's a petty thief, con man. He's been hustling tourists and everybody else all his life.
</DIRECTION>
<MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow! Snake Plissken!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Map To The Stars Eddie listens to WAYWARD WIND by Gogi Grant on a small, metal-plated portable radio. He clicks off the radio, rises, walks over to Plissken.
</DIRECTION>
<MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>

<MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>

<MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>

</MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken releases him, as suddenly the tracer beeps. On the device Plissken sees a small red pulsing dot. West.
</DIRECTION>
<MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice little gizmo you got there.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Look, Snake. I've got connections in this town. You need something, I'm your man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Without a word Plissken turns, walks away down Sunset Boulevard toward Beverly Hills.
</DIRECTION>
<MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey - you can't go there, Snake. You can't walk through Beverly Hills.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken's figure disappears...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUNSET - SIGN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The old Beverly Hills sign. It's been painted over in dripping red letters: "QUIET - SURGICAL ZONE - STAY OUT"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken ignores the sign, keeps walking down a completely dark Sunset Boulevard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUNSET BOULEVARD - BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken walks past the once-beautiful mansions along Sunset. Now they are dark, ruined.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER - BEVERLY HILLS MANSION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As a twisted, mechanical hand sewn awkwardly to the flesh of the wrist pulls aside a window curtain. The face behind the window is in shadows, but we can just make out its pale, discolored features. The other hand brings up a walkie-talkie...

EXT. BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL - SUNSET AND BEVERLY DRIVE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken moves into the intersection of Sunset and Beverly Drive. The ruins of the old Beverly Hills Hotel are ahead and to his right. He stops, stares down Sunset...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV - A FIGURE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emerges from the shadows. This is the gatekeeper. Strange, mismatched body parts. A black-skinned arm attached to a pale white body. His face is unnaturally smooth - too many face lifts. He carries a torch.
</DIRECTION>
<GATEKEEPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Halt!

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you here for the auction?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GATEKEEPER>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND PLISSKEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Figures have suddenly moved out into the street, all with mismatched body parts - heads too large for their torsos, female body parts mixed with male heads, all sewn together with large, uneven stitches. Plissken is surrounded.
</DIRECTION>
<GATEKEEPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome to Beverly Hills.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GATEKEEPER>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken raises his gun, starts to move, when suddenly a figure rises behind him out of the shadows...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MULTI-COLORED FLESH HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raises a lead pipe, brings it down hard...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON PLISSKEN'S HEAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUNK! He goes out like a light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Plissken slumps unconscious to the street, the figures move for him. Their arms lock around him, drag him away with amazing speed - a pack of wolves on a deer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - PLISSKEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken bolts awake, to find himself tied to a cross. It's lurching back and forth as though the ground is moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RODEO DRIVE - BEVERLY HILLS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken is being carried down Rodeo Driveon the cross by a throng of surgical failures. They carry torches. Dressed in tatters. Their faces look only partially human sewn together raggedly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rodeo Drive is a bizarre marketplace of body parts. The once beautiful storefronts of famous designers are now in shambles. Human body parts are on display like filets of fish on ice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gucci now offers body pieces fashioned from spare car parts and Armani displays more eclectic, high priced pieces sewn together like sculptures in their windowfronts. A giant rift runs down the street's center. Acrid smoke rises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The throng stops at an intersection, and Plissken's cross is anchored in the middle of the street. Surrounding the intersection are patients of every size, age, sex.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken looks over, sees another cross being carried up and planted right next to his. A beautiful girl is tied to this cross. This is TASLIMA, 20's, Iranian, the face of a Persian princess. She's dressed in black leather, and basically has an IQ of around 50.
</DIRECTION>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Snake. It's so great to meet you. My name's Taslima. I'm a fan of yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you crazy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A little bit. But pretty soon I'm gonna be dead. So are you, Snake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken looks across the street. Our of the ruins of the once famous red door of Elizabeth Arden come an arm of women facialists with acid-burned faces from one-too-many skin peelings wielding knives, saws, horrible-looking carving instruments...
</DIRECTION>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe I got caught.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I run with Midnight Jihad. Iranian gang. Only they kicked me out, cause I screw up sometimes. I forget stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken struggles with his bonds.
</DIRECTION>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I left my boyfriend's place tonight, took a wrong turn...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Snake, I'm really kind of out of it sometimes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<DIRECTION>
OUT OF THE RED DOOR come more interns and nurses carrying surgical pans and pushing gurneys to collect dismembered body parts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The throng of facialists, patients, interns and nurses surround Plissken and Taslima on the crosses. They move back to the sidewalks as the auction for body parts cut freshly from Plissken and Taslima is about to begin. The gurneys are wheeled into place and set up as large cutting tables. The facialists take their positions behind the tables waiting to carve fresh meat.
</DIRECTION>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They live here, used to be like us. But after too many silicon implants, their muscles turned to jelly. The only way they survive is to have body parts transplanted over and over again.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Snake, nobody who comes into Beverly Hills gets out alive.

</TASLIMA>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Surgeon General of Beverly Hills.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<DIRECTION>
THE DOCTOR, THE SURGEON GENERAL OF BEVERLY HILLS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steps out into the street. He appears incredibly gorgeous, a hunk of a man, put together by the finest body parts available in Beverly Hills - a millennium Fabio - but upon closer examination, he's got no lower jaw. Instead, there is a rusting metal grid-work attached beneath each ear. It never moves. He can actually speak through a metal box attached to his windpipe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DOCTOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stands in front of them. He raises his hands to quiet the crowd. He walks around the cross, admiring the beautiful bodies before him. He tickles the fine flesh with his right hand, which is made up of 10 gleaming scalpels which form a 360 degree cutting edge.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never seen more beautiful specimens. There will be no auction tonight. These body parts will go to those who need them the most.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd gumbles.

<DIRECTION>
PLISSKEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Turns his head sideways, to a small hidden pocket near his neck. With his teeth, he pulls out the silver mouth dart, slips it onto his tongue, closes his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doctor raises his gleaming scalpel hand and steps toward Plissken.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a beautiful blue eye. It's a shame you only have one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
A nurse brings over a small step-ladder. The doctor positions it in front of Plissken, slowly climbs up the rungs until he is face to face with him. The doctor looks ready to pluck Plissken's good eye from its socket with his scalpel tips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FFFTTT! Plissken spits the mouth dart!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHACK! The dark hits the doctor squarely in the forehead. He freezes, his scalpel hand raised, his eyes clouding. He falls forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scalpel hand swings, misses its mark, and instead hits the rope tied around Plissken's wrist. WHATCK! The rope's cut!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken grabs the scalpel hand with his free hand, cuts his other hand and legs loose in a flash and pushes the doctor backward off the step-ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHUMP! Plissken falls to the intersection, almost at the same time as the doctor hits the pavement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The patients are stunned. Motionless. They stare at their doctor lying in the street, moaning, moving slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Snake starts to run...
</DIRECTION>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Snake, help me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<SNAKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SNAKE>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<DIRECTION>
Almost on a whim, Plissken cuts her free. Then he runs. Taslima follows him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken heads toward a side street, looks over his shoulder, sees Taslima following...
</DIRECTION>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't follow me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like hell I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<DIRECTION>
Then Plissken comes to a dead stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV - DOWN THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Comes a mass of patients right at him. Taslima grabs Plissken, pulls him with her. They take off down a dark cobblestone street...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DARK ALLEY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken and Taslima run as behind them the patient horde gives chase. They stop at another small alley between two large buildings.
</DIRECTION>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Down this way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<DIRECTION>
They disappear into the small alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SMALL ALLEY - CUL DE SAC - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's long and narrow and completely enclosed by the buildings on either side. Suddenly Plissken and Taslima come to the end - a 75 foot high four-story building blocking the passageway to Wilshire.
</DIRECTION>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a dead end.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You took us into a dead end!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just thought you wanted to get away. I didn't know you wanted to go someplace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<DIRECTION>
KACLANK! They turn...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doctor staggers down the alley, the dart still sticking from his forehead. Behind him, the patients follow...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken shoves Taslima toward a broken window.
</DIRECTION>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<DIRECTION>
He follows Taslima through the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECOND FLOOR BALCONY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken and Taslima climb dilapidated stairs, move along the balcony railing. A torn and tattered Roy Lichtenstein painting hangs crooked on a wall. Twenty foot high bright red letters - "CAA" - lie strewn across the marble floor. Various offices are wrecked and dark, scripts lay all over the place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stop at a dark hallway. Taslima moves cautiously ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be careful of the bald cats. They live in these buildings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken reaches for his other 9mm in its holder, but his hands are trapped by the doctor's body. Closer and closer moves the claw dagger toward Plissken's good eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taslima scrambles, picks up Plissken's 9mm, then stares at the two men.
</DIRECTION>
<PLISSKEN>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you gonna stand there? Give me the gun!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<DIRECTION>
Taslima starts to hand it to him. Both Plissken and the doctor fight to reach it. Finally, it's in Plissken's grasp. He blasts three times - each one hitting. The doctor shudders, rolls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken gets to his feet. He blasts one more time for good measure, then follows Taslima down the hallway...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FIRST FLOOR - REAR EXIT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They come down a flight of stairs, stop at the rear door.
</DIRECTION>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do we get out of here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sewers. Come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<DIRECTION>
She pushes open the door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEVERLY HILLS STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken and Taslima run from the building, as a chorus of wails rises. Patients swarm around the building in pursuit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taslima stops at a sewer grate in the street.
</DIRECTION>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Down there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken lifts the grating. Taslima jumps in, followed by Plissken...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SEWER TUNNEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dim, greenish light. Plissken and Taslima begin running down the sewer tunnel. Through the hole behind them drop patients, giving chase. Plissken and Taslima race through a half-filled storm drain seeping with slime. They turn a corner into another tunnel, and run smack into a horde of patients. Instantly, the patients overpower them. Hands reach out and drag them down...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, from down the tunnel comes an unearthly sound, a weird whispery screech like a demon unleashed from the underworld. It gets louder and louder. The patients freeze, then begin screaming and, as the sound gets louder still, they all disappear, escaping back down the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM DOWN THE TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An eerie light appears, coming nearer and nearer every moment.
</DIRECTION>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Snake - what is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How the hell am I supposed to know? This is your damn city.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, the light takes form. It is a single, gigantic eye - floating in pitch-black darkness. It continues coming - growing larger and larger. Suddenly the sewer begins to echo with a blasting, ringing sound. Music!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's incredibly LOUD SALSA MUSIC!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From out of the tunnel drives an ancient golf cart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a metal pole in front is a huge, lighted eye such as an optometrist might use to advertise his services. Salsa music blares at top volume from loudspeakers strapped to the sides of the cart. At the wheel of the vehicle is a large man dressed in jeans, cowboy boots and a flak vest, wearing a gas mask. A lariat is hooked to his belt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls up near Plissken and Taslima, shuts off the motor and the music, lifts a shotgun from the seat beside him, climbs down. He holds the gun on them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Removing his head gear, his face becomes visible. He is PENDEJO BOB, a Mexican wearing sunglasses under the gas mask. He takes off the sunglasses, and his apparently blind in one eye. He looks like Los Lobos' lead guitarist.
</DIRECTION>
<PENDEJO_BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you doing in here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENDEJO_BOB>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looking to get out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<PENDEJO_BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. I want you out. This is my sewer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENDEJO_BOB>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which way?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<DIRECTION>
With a grunt of curiosity, Pendejo Bob moves up to Plissken. Suddenly his blind eye flashes on like a tiny, built-in spotlight. With it, he examines Plissken's face.
</DIRECTION>
<PENDEJO_BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're Snake Plissken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENDEJO_BOB>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Isn't he cool?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<DIRECTION>
There is a clicking sound and the lighted eye is extinguished. Pendejo Bob extends his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<PENDEJO_BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An honor, Snake. Amigo. They call me Pendejo Bob.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENDEJO_BOB>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken doesn't shake. From down the tunnel the shouts and footfalls of the patients gets closer...
</DIRECTION>
<PENDEJO_BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those damn patients are coming back. You'd better climb aboard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENDEJO_BOB>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken and Taslima climb into the rear of the golf cart. Pendejo Bob spins the cart, takes off in the other direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The golf cart streaks along through a dark sewer passage. The only light comes from the eye on the front of the vehicle.
</DIRECTION>
<PENDEJO_BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I use the eye and the music to scare em off. They're so whacked out, man, it works great. Chased a whole bunch of em right off the edge there a few months ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENDEJO_BOB>
<DIRECTION>
He points to a sheer, pitch-black drop-off on one side of the passage.
</DIRECTION>
<TASLIMA>
<DIRECTION>
(she peers over the side)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How far down does it go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<PENDEJO_BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't know - never do hear em land. Earthquake opened it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENDEJO_BOB>
<DIRECTION>
The golf cart creaks into a narrow tunnel...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guards, Hispanics in biker denims, fatigues, with rifles and sunglasses, line the walls. They watch as the golf cart passes. Up ahead is a door marked: "SEWAGE RECLAMATION CONTROL"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SEWER RECLAMATION CENTER - CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cart pulls into the remains of a mammoth underground control center. It's lined with ladders, catwalks, machines full of gauges and levers. A few are still working - most are broken and covered with dust and grime.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Filling the room is an underground enclave: Men, women, children, all Hispanic, living in tents and lean-to's, cooking over open fires next to old rusted cars on blocks, lots of weapons, lots of sunglasses. Also, high-tech, futuristic rifles, cannons, grenade launchers - an amazing arsenal. Crates of explosives are stacked everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The golf cart comes to a stop and they get off.
</DIRECTION>
<PENDEJO_BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I own this whole place. Used to work here in the old days. I was right in this room when the big one hit. What a mess. We were waist high in shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns proudly to them)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody else ran, but not me. I stayed at my post. Now it's all mine. I brought my whole family, my amigos, down here to live with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENDEJO_BOB>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gun runners.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<PENDEJO_BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, it's a living, baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENDEJO_BOB>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you get out of L.A.? Take a boat to China, take an airplane to Brazil?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at Taslima)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Earthquakes, death, shit. Why do you stay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Somehow, I just can't leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<PENDEJO_BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Y'know, L.A.'s not such a bad place, Snake. We got our problems, sure - but this is paradise, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENDEJO_BOB>
<DIRECTION>
Pendejo Bob leans in close and whispers conspiratorially to Plissken.
</DIRECTION>
<PENDEJO_BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say, you need anything, Snake? Guns? Explosives? I can get you a crate of hellfire grenades, no problem - five hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENDEJO_BOB>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. So how do I get to Venice?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<PENDEJO_BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All the sewers are collapsed under Venice. You have to go topside. Right up there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENDEJO_BOB>
<DIRECTION>
He leads Plissken and Taslima to a ladder that goes up into the darkness. A line of men steadily climb up, one after the other, carrying crates of weapons.
</DIRECTION>
<PENDEJO_BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Comes out near the Santa Monica Freeway. Just follow the signs. Get off at the Lincoln Exit, turn left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENDEJO_BOB>
<DIRECTION>
Pendejo Bob interrupts the line of men. Plissken starts up the ladder, followed by Taslima...
</DIRECTION>
<PENDEJO_BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice to meet you, Snake. You too, Miss. You're welcome down here anytime. Anytime at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENDEJO_BOB>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET UNDER SANTA MONICA FREEWAY OVERPASS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken, gun in hand, sticks his head out of the open grate. Taslima follows. The Hispanic men who have climbed up out of the sewers load their weapons crates into various low-rider cars in heavily-armed groups. They rumble off into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taslima points to a freeway on-ramp.
</DIRECTION>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The freeway's over there. But, Snake - I don't think it's such a good idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken starts toward the on-ramp. Taslima doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The freeways are dangerous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<DIRECTION>
He keeps walking.
</DIRECTION>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, Snake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken stops, turns back, looks at her - a half-smile. It's as close to 'thank you' as he gets.
</DIRECTION>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sun's coming up in a few hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<DIRECTION>
She walks up to him.
</DIRECTION>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	UV's gonna be bad today. I have a friend who's got a place near here. We can crash there if you want, Snake.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she moves close to him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd love to take care of you. Make you feel good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<DIRECTION>
Without an answer Plissken turns and walks away...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SANTA MONICA FREEWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As far as the eye can see there are lines of rusting cars and trucks, bumper to bumper like a giant junkyard rush hour.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken walks up the on-ramp, onto the freeway. He strides past rows of junked cars. A few of them have people inside...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a Mercedes rusted to its frame, its driver an 80-year-old in sunglasses, drinking from a bottle. A pickup truck full of old illegal aliens packed in like sardines. Someone cooks from a barbecue grill. An RV. An old man sits in the opened doorway, staring at Plissken as he passes. Two old ladies in housecoats stare at him through the windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK, CLICK! A sound behind Plissken. He spins, 9mm ready...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Taslima, running to catch up with him.
</DIRECTION>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I changed my mind. I'm going with you, wherever you're going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<PLISSKEN>
<DIRECTION>
(gestures to the cars)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The freeway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know that. There are people in some of these cars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's where they live. I guess after everything happened, they just needed to do what they'd always done before. During the daytime, they just pull down the shades on their windows and sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken continues walking. Taslima catches up...
</DIRECTION>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you gonna do in Venice?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Find Cuervo Jones.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Stay away, Snake. He's mucho muerte.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a shot rings out. Taslima is struck and falls. Plissken drops between the cars and crawls over to her.
</DIRECTION>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run, Snake...They're coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<DIRECTION>
She touches his hand and looks at him softly.
</DIRECTION>
<TASLIMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TASLIMA>
<DIRECTION>
Taslima dies. Plissken stares at her for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More shots ring out - landing very close to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREEWAY EMBANKMENTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From out of the heavy bushes along the freeway storm a dozen Mescalitos moving quickly - firing as they go. Behind them grinds an ancient garbage truck mounted with a 50-caliber machine gun. Atop the truck is Delgado. He wears a flame thrower on his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLISSKEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Returns fire, rolls under a car and begins crawling. All around him people jump out of their cars, begin firing back at the Mescalitos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GARBAGE TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smashes through a rusting Volkswagen, heading straight toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLISSKEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reaches the edge of the freeway, dives for the bushes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AS THE GARBAGE TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roars past, firing into the vehicles on the freeway, the people running, screaming...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDE STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clawing his way through the undergrowth, Plissken bursts onto a side street. Behind him come the Mescalitos on foot. Plissken runs, firing back every step of the way...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AHEAD ON THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, in the blowing mist in front of him, a car screeches into view. It's a perfectly restored, 1966 Cadillac convertible. Candy-apple red. The stereo blasts "Last Night" by the Satellites.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And behind the wheel is Map To The Stars Eddie.
</DIRECTION>
<MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hop in, Snake!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
THE UNDERGROWTH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the garbage truck bursts through. Delgado is behind the machine gun, blasting away, burning up the street. Bullets are flying everywhere as Plissken runs to the Cadillac and dives into the back seat. He's still not fully inside when Map To The Stars Eddie roars away in a blaze of rubber and smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DELGADO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Takes aim with his flame thrower... KAWHOOSH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GIANT TONGUE OF FLAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shoots out from the nozzle like a flaming spear. It streaks down the street, just missing the tail of the Cadillac as it swerves around a corner...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Map To The Stars Eddie races along a dark street. Plissken climbs into the front seat.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Snake - that was great. They almost burned your ass off!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Map To The Stars Eddie drives like Satan himself. Plissken is almost thrown out as they spin around curves, up onto sidewalks. Delgado and the garbage truck can't keep up with them. Finally, the Mescalitos are left far behind as Map To The Stars Eddie slows down to a cruise of 70.
</DIRECTION>
<MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too many people know where you're going, Snake. That's not good. Delgado and his men were back there waiting for you.

</MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
He points. Plissken looks off, as Map To The Stars Eddie hits a button on the steering wheel with his finger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE DASHBOARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small panel in front of Plissken flips down, revealing a two- inch machine gun barrel. Before he can do anything, four rounds rip straight into his chest, blasting him into the seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLISSKEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grits his teeth and gasps. His gun drops. Blood runs from four holes in his shirt. His face grows red as he fights for air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Map To The Stars Eddie pushes the button again and the panel closes up over the barrel.
</DIRECTION>
<MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty neat, huh? This is Cuervo's car. He lets me use it sometimes.

As Plissken sags, losing consciousness, Map To The Stars Eddie's voice begins to fade...

	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'd love to represent you, too. We could make a bundle together. I know I could really help your career...I mean, you're a legend and all - but the last couple years, man, it's like you've fallen off the face of the earth.

EXT. INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL LAX - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like a giant, scorched daddy-long-legs, the architectural identity of the LA airport rises above the empty parking lot littered with the skeletal remains of burned-out cars and airport shuttles. The wrecks of old 747s lie twisted and bent across the tarmac.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND IT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Surrounded by Mescalitos with torches and guns, sits the former Bradley Terminal defaced with graffiti, the sign now reading: "MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLISSKEN'S GOOD EYE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Opens. Looks around fuzzily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is in Cuervo Jones lair. Huge. Torch-lit. Plissken lies in the center of the room, chained to a treadmill. He is surrounded by Mescalitos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In one corner of the room is lots of high-tech equipment. Computers. A VR simulator. Most of the Mescalitos are gathered around a big screen TV. They watch the 207th Annual Academy Awards from Carefree, Arizona.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cuervo Jones strides toward Plissken. Map To The Stars Eddie scurries along at his side.
</DIRECTION>
<MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Cuervo. I delivered him, didn't I? All I'm asking for is what you promised.

<CUERVO_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUERVO_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
Cuervo Jones stops in front of Plissken. Sees that he's awake. Holds out a glass filled with red liquid.
</DIRECTION>
<CUERVO_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carrot juice?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(no response)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Laced with tequila, Snake. Good for you. No?

<DIRECTION>
(no response)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your health.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUERVO_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
Cuervo Jones downs the carrot juice. Plissken lifts his head, grimaces. Sweat pours down his face. He gasps for air.
</DIRECTION>
<CUERVO_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're coming out of it, Snake. It hurts real bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)

<CUERVO_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dying isn't good enough for you. You need pain. You'll never make it to where you want to go without a little pain.

</CUERVO_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
He stands, considers Plissken for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<CUERVO_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Snake Plissken. American outlaw. So typical of American idealism. The old west, Snake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUERVO_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
Cuervo Jones tosses the glass to Map To The Stars Eddie. He's beginning to enjoy the moment, performing for Plissken.
</DIRECTION>
<CUERVO_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man against the sky. The individual. Freedom. No wonder they hate you so much in America, Snake. You remind them of what they used to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUERVO_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
Cuervo Jones walks to a door, opens it. Beyond is a huge courtyard filled with people - families, teenage runaways, the elderly, illegal aliens, orphans - people with nowhere to go. They are being fed and cared for by Mescalitos.
</DIRECTION>
<CUERVO_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here is the real L.A., Snake.

</CUERVO_JONES>

<CUERVO_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>

</CUERVO_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses back to Plissken...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know what they want? One word. Liberation.

</CUERVO_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
He gestures to his men, who move to Plissken and begin carefully unlocking him from the treadmill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still wobbly, Plissken crawls to his feet...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Utopia comes bounding up from the big screen TV. Still dressed in her racy underwear, she gives Cuervo Jones a kiss. She still carries the prototype with her.
</DIRECTION>
<UTOPIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cuervo! LaToya Jackson just won Best Actress.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UTOPIA>
<DIRECTION>
Cuervo Jones reaches out to take the prototype from her. She holds on to it.
</DIRECTION>
<UTOPIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said I could hold it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UTOPIA>
<DIRECTION>
He yanks it out of her hands, more violently than she expected. Recovering, she casts a contemptuous glance at Plissken.
</DIRECTION>
<UTOPIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's that?

<CUERVO_JONES>

Cuervo Jones gives her a slap on the butt, which startles Utopia.

<UTOPIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ooww!

</UTOPIA>
<CUERVO_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on now. Do as I say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUERVO_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken watches as Utopia walks away, out of the terminal.
</DIRECTION>
<CUERVO_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to show her what it means to be a woman - for the first time in her pathetic little life.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Given her love, Snake. Everybody needs love.

</CUERVO_JONES>

He moves slightly closer to Plissken - though not too close.
</DIRECTION>
<CUERVO_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to hook up with us? Join the revolution? We're all getting out of here tomorrow night.
	</DIALOGUE>

(holds up the prototype)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're gonna rule the world. Come with us, Snake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUERVO_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken says nothing. His good eye glares.
</DIRECTION>
<CUERVO_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No? Too bad. Well, I told you we'd finish it later. So guess what? It's later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUERVO_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
He motions to his men, who grab Plissken and drag him away...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BAGGAGE CLAIM AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The baggage claim area is an industrial wasteland filled with machinery and hanging cables and wires. A door opens and Plissken is hurled in. The door slams shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken stands a moment, trying to get his balance, when a man steps out of the shadows. It is Delgado.
</DIRECTION>
<DELGADO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're mine now, Snake. All mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELGADO>
<DIRECTION>
Delgado slowly moves towards Plissken, swinging two huge gleaming machetes around his head. Plissken steps back, glances at his wrist watch. 4 hours and 20 minutes gone.
</DIRECTION>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken looks up as Delgado flings a machete at him. He just barely dives out of the way, rolls on the floor...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Delgado charges toward him, machete poised like a bayonet. Plissken rips off an edge guard from the baggage carousel and wings it at Delgado. The machete is blocked with a direct hit. KA- CLANG!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Delgado is thrown sideways. Plissken runs, launches himself through the air, twisting his body sideways, and lands a hard kick right in Delgado's face. Delgado goes sprawling. One of the machetes CLANKS to the floor...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken grabs the machete, just as Delgado rises...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOSH! Plissken's arm is a blur as he throws...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUMP! The machete sticks out of Delgado's chest. He looks down at it in horror, then crumbles to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The caravan is starting up again. Wearing hot pants, a tank top and full-length mink coat, Utopia is escorted up a ladder by Cuervo Jones to the opened door of the Cadillac perched up on those monster truck wheels. The other Mescalitos mount up in their cars and motorcycles, and roar away from the terminal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above, on top of the terminal, see a figure move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOP OF MESCALITO JUSTICE HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Plissken. He grabs an electrical wire and throws it over the side...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PARKING LOT - A MESCALITO GUARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stands watching the caravan pull away. He doesn't see the wire dangling behind him, and Plissken shinnying down it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHACK! Plissken takes him out with one blow, lowers himself to the ground, takes his rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken quickly moves down the dark street after the caravan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE FORUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cuervo Jones' caravan comes rolling down Manchester, into a vast parking lot toward the Forum. Portions of the gigantic sports arena have been damaged in the earthquake, but crowds still pour into the entrances.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The caravan pulls up at the Forum Club entrance. Cuervo Jones, Utopia, Map To The Stars Eddie and the others enter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AS PLISSKEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Approaches, ducks behind an old junked car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FORUM - DAMAGED WALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken sneaks up to a crumbled, broken wall of the Forum, crawls inside through a large crack...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOCKER ROOM - THE FORUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken's in the backstage area, near the locker rooms. Hear cheering from the main arena. Slowly Plissken moves to a door, opens it, steps out...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FORUM HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cheering is louder is Plissken makes his way along the dingy hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the sound of gunfire from someplace up ahead. Plissken tenses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly from down the hallway come two Black Muslims carrying a body on a stretcher. As they pass, Plissken notices the body is wearing a bloody basketball uniform full of bullet holes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves forward...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FORUM ARENA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken peers into the main arena. A basketball game is underway. The Korean Dragons sit on one side, the Black Muslims on the other. They cheer wildly for their respective teams. Pipeline is in the crowd, enjoying the game...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken moves closer, among the crowd along the baseline. The whole place is lit by torches and clumsily-wired lighting. Above his head is the shot clock, slowly ticking down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's blood everywhere on the floor. The referees wear bullet- proof body suits and helmets. Trainers with stretchers stand by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHOT CLOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ticks down: 5 - 4...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BLACK MUSLIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dribbles the ball towards the basket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHOT CLOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ticks down: 3 - 2...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A whole row of Korean Dragons with rifles stand and take aim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BLACK MUSLIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulls up into a jump shot, releases the ball into the air. It sails through the basket just as the horn goes off, beating the 24-second violation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Black Muslim crowd cheers. The Korean Dragons sit down. Plissken watches...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUERVO JONES, UTOPIA AND THE OTHERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving through the seats on the Korean Dragon side of the court. Map To The Stars Eddie stands near the baseline, listening to the game on his silver portable radio...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE REFEREE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hands the ball to a Korean Dragon guard. The Korean Dragon dribbles the ball down court, into the corner and passes it off. The Korean Dragons can't get a shot off...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHOT CLOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above Plissken's head ticks down: 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1... HONK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE KOREAN DRAGON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guard still has the ball - the shot clock horn has gone off - 24 second violation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A whole row of Black Muslims with rifles stand up, take aim, and fire!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM! BLAM! BLAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Korean Dragon guard is riddled with bullets. He falls dead on the floor. The Trainers with stretchers quickly collect his body and hurry off the court.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ball boys quickly wipe up the blood with mops.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (sound of effect of breaking glass)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shot clock!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
The Black Muslim crowd is cheering and screaming! "I Love L.A." begins playing on the loudspeaker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The players wear do-rags and black uniforms that look a whole lot like the black leather that Plissken wears. One of the players, JAMAAL, notices Plissken.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMAAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey - Snake Plissken, you knew my brother Abdul. He was with you in Cleveland.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMAAL>
<DIRECTION>
The other players react, greet Plissken, slapping his hand, thumping chests, high-fiving each other.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMAAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome aboard, Snake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMAAL>
<DIRECTION>
But Plissken pays no attention. He sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUERVO JONES AND UTOPIA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting in the Korean Dragon section near the other end of the court.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER - CUERVO JONES AND UTOPIA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sit next to Xi-Ping, the leader of the Korean Dragons, a fierce man with green and brown psychedelic camouflage on his face. Utopia watches the game while the two men confer. Cuervo Jones has a firm grip on the prototype.
</DIRECTION>
<CUERVO_JONES>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CUERVO_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
Xi-Ping nodes. They clasp hands...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLISSKEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Realizes he's got to get to the other side of the court. He jumps into the huddle with Jamaal, peering at him with his one good, cold eye.
</DIRECTION>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your brother died owing me, so I'm taking it out in trade. I need a favor...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<JAMAAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, Snake. Anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMAAL>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to get across the court now... without drawing attention to myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<JAMAAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like you ain't gonna stick out like a sore thumb. But we'll do what we can, Snake. Use the clock. Screen and roll. Now let's kick some butt!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMAAL>
<DIRECTION>
The players knock fists. Plissken puts on a do-rag. Yelling, they move onto the court, creating a shield for Plissken.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMAAL>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You play much pick-up ball, Snake?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMAAL>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken's watching Cuervo Jones and Utopia at the other end.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMAAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever happens, watch the shot clock, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMAAL>
<DIRECTION>
The referee blows his whistle. A Black Muslim guard inbounds the ball. The game is underway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken ducks down the court using the rest of his team as cover. They go into a set play.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The game is a cross between basketball and kung-fu. Players use slashing fists, spin-kicks, elbows and hard back-hands. It's full combat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Korean Dragon guarding Plissken chops him. Plissken knocks him flat. No foul.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Utopia sees Plissken, nudges Cuervo Jones.
</DIRECTION>
<UTOPIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's that weird guy again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UTOPIA>
<DIRECTION>
Cuervo Jones grabs her and heads for the exit...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken sees this, stops playing, moves after them... when suddenly the basketball lands right in his hands!
</DIRECTION>
<JAMAAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Snake! Shot clock!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMAAL>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHOT CLOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ticks down: 4 - 3 - 2...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A whole row of Korean Dragons with rifles stand up, take aim at Plissken. Cuervo Jones watches expectantly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken spins, executes a beautiful-looking jump shot. The horn sounds just as it leaves his hand...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BASKET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Swish. Nothing but net.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Korean Dragons sit back down, put away their rifles, disappointed. Cuervo Jones, Utopia, Xi-Ping and their henchmen quickly leave. The Black Muslims go crazy, and Plissken dashes toward one of the exits. He stops, sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With his portable radio, trying to get out of the arena, hiding behind a crowd of Dragons. Plissken races through the crowd, grabs Map To The Stars Eddie.

<MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Snake, man... Great shot!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>

Without hesitation, Snake whacks him across the jaw. Map To The Stars Eddie goes down like a sack of laundry. Plissken grabs him by the collar, drags him off toward an exit...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FORUM PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cuervo Jones, Utopia, Xi-Ping and their men rush out to the caravan of waiting vehicles. Xi-Ping has his own armada of vehicles and an army of evil-looking guards. Cuervo Jones pulls Xi-Ping aside.

ANOTHER EXIT - THE FORUM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Plissken drags Map To The Stars Eddie out into the night, crouches behind a row of cars, watches Cuervo Jones' caravan start their engines.
</DIRECTION>

Plissken shakes Map To The Stars Eddie, waking him...

</MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Without looking, Plissken slams his elbow into Map To The Stars Eddie's jaw with a WHACK! He flops unconscious on the pavement...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cuervo Jones' caravan led by that huge Cadillac on monster wheels, moves away from the Forum toward an exit. Plissken moves after them, ducking behind the row of cars...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FORUM EXIST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The caravan picks up speed as it approaches the exit...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken appears behind an old truck, just as the Cadillac moves past him. He crouches on the balls of his feet, and as the rear of the Caddy drifts closer, he springs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And grabs on to the rear bumper. The monster wheels spin like huge, black scythes on either side of him. Plissken reaches under the Caddy, finds a purchase on the undercarriage, and swings under the Cadillac. He hangs dangling above the street by one hand as the caravan pulls out onto Manchester. With the other he raises his 9mm and aims it at the undercarriage, right about where the front seat should be...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM, BLAM, BLAM, BLAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front seat explodes, bullets screaming upward through the leather seats, tearing and shredding fabric and flesh, killing the driver and Xi-Ping instantly!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the back seat sit Cuervo Jones and Utopia. The Caddy begins to swerve, the wheel spinning. Cuervo Jones lunges forward across the seat and grabs it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Under the Cadillac, Plissken continues to fire: BLAM, BLAM, BLAM, BLAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front seat disintegrates. Metal, leather, padding fly everywhere. Cuervo Jones ducks against the door, covering his face with one hand, still grasping the wheel with the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAWHUMP!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entire front seat and floor underneath it fall down out of the Cadillac and hit the street below. The bodies of the driver and X- Ping flop under the monster wheels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken swings over to the hole and pulls himself up into the opening that used to be the front seat. Cuervo Jones stares at him in total shock, but before he can speak...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken rips the prototype out of his hands! Then jumps into the back seat next to Utopia. Then grabs her and turns to the side door. Cuervo Jones releases the wheel for a moment, turns to grab Plissken...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Plissken opens the side door, kicks it wide, and with Utopia under his arm, slides across the seat...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and sails out of the Cadillac...
</DIRECTION>
<CUERVO_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUERVO_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken and Utopia fly through the air, and land with a thud on top of a Mescalito car as the Cadillac begins to swerve wildly. Cuervo Jones grabs the wheel, desperately tries to control the Caddy... but fails. The Cadillac careens off the street, slams into the palm tree, spins around and crashes into the remains of a hot dog stand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE ROOF OF THE MESCALITO CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken and Utopia roll and tumble. He still has a hold of her, and she fights him tooth and nail...
</DIRECTION>
<UTOPIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lemme go...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UTOPIA>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE MESCALITO CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driver swerves, hits the brakes... and the car hops the curb, slides along the sidewalk, burning rubber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLISSKEN AND UTOPIA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Are thrown forward. They tumble off the roof... across the hood... and land on the sidewalk in front of the car. They roll to a stop, as the car screeches to a stop, inches from their heads, as the caravan suddenly puts on its brakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Screaming tires. Cars jackknifing, spinning in a massive traffic collision...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cuervo Jones emerges from the remains of the Cadillac.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken drags Utopia into the street, grabs the lid of a manhole in the street, pries it up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mescalitos pour out of their vehicles, as Cuervo Jones charges into the street, pointing at Plissken...
</DIRECTION>
<CUERVO_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill him, kill him...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUERVO_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken lifts Utopia to her feel, hauls her over to the manhole opening, and dives inside... just as the Mescalitos open fire! The street around the manhole opening explodes with screaming hot lead...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SEWER TUNNEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken and Utopia land in the half-filled storm drain. He gets to his feet, pulls her with him, and heads off sloshing through the water. The sound of gunfire echoes above them...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANCHESTER AVENUE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cuervo Jones and the Mescalitos charge the open manhole as Map To The Stars Eddie appears groggily shuffling up the street from the Forum...

(grins to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
He heads off down the street...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SEWER TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken and Utopia race along through the water. He literally has to drag her with him. They turn a corner, go down another slimy drain away from the main tunnel...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERGROUND PASSAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black belly of the sewer system. Plissken and Utopia move along, slow as they come to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHEER, PITCH-BLACK DROP OFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One side of the passage, the same one we saw earlier on our journey with Pendejo Bob.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken spins Utopia around, pushes her backward toward the drop- off, his eye burning into her...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her feet reach the very edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken holds her there. Utopia's face is a mask of sheer terror. She gulps air in staccato bursts...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken can't do it. He can't push her off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He releases her, backs up, looks at the prototype, then pulls one of his revolvers from its holster, cocks the hammer, aims...
</DIRECTION>
<UTOPIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My... father sent you... didn't he?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Plissken raises the pistol. She's dead in his sights.
</DIRECTION>
<UTOPIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't he?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(begins to cry)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Plissken can't. He can't kill her. The toughest man on planet Earth can't kill this 17-year-old runaway.
</DIRECTION>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken sags, clicks the hammer back, holsters the gun. He stares at her.
</DIRECTION>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<DIRECTION>
Utopia wipes her eyes, confused, afraid.
</DIRECTION>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly Utopia moves from the edge of the drop off, starts away down the tunnel, then stops, looks back at Plissken. She stares at the prototype in Plissken's hand...
</DIRECTION>
<UTOPIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't take it back. Don't give it to him. Please. Let me have it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UTOPIA>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken glances at the prototype, then at her.
</DIRECTION>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does this thing do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<UTOPIA>
<DIRECTION>
(her eyes grow wide)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UTOPIA>
<DIRECTION>
KABLAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken's shoulder explodes as a bullet tears through his flesh! He spins, drops the prototype...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... as Map To The Stars Eddie emerges from the darkness of the sewer tunnel. He holds a gun in one hand, aims...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He fires again, hits Plissken's leg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken staggers backward toward the edge of the drop off, as Map To The Stars Eddie moves quickly forward...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and snatches the prototype from the wet floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken's gun hand is useless, numb from the shoulder wound. He slowly, painfully transfers the pistol to the other hand, tries to raise it...
</DIRECTION>
<MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So long, Snake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Map To The Stars Eddie takes aim - a head shot ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken spins, and dives off the edge...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... down into the drop off...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLISSKEN'S BODY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Airborne. Falling through black space. Down, down, down, straight to hell below, until we can't see him anymore as the darkness swallows him up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Map To The Stars Eddie steps to the ledge, looks down, as Cuervo Jones and his Mescalitos slog up through the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<CUERVO_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUERVO_JONES>
<MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	He's dead, Cuervo. I did it. I killed Plissken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>

Cuervo Jones looks over the edge, at the silent blackness below. Then he turns to Map To The Stars Eddie.
</DIRECTION>
<CUERVO_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give it to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUERVO_JONES>
<MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>

<MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, Cuervo, but look here. I've done it all, man. I killed Plissken, I got your girl back, I got it all. Just for you, Cuervo. Just for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Dead silence. Cuervo Jones stands with his hand extended. Finally Map To The Stars Eddie gives up, starts to hand Cuervo the prototype...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... but slips on the wet floor...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... and drops the prototype with a CLANK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - PROTOTYPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A red light comes on, blinks urgently.
</DIRECTION>
<PROTOTYPE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(tiny, filtered)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am now armed and ready for use. Use extreme caution. The location of the effected blast area can only be determined by the orbital position of the SatStar Ring.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROTOTYPE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone in the tunnel is frozen, unable to move. Slowly Cuervo Jones picks up the prototype, stares at it, then breaks into a smile...
</DIRECTION>
<CUERVO_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is turning out to be my lucky day.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(stares coldly at Map To The Stars Eddie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get this asshole outta here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUERVO_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
Several Mescalitos grab Map To The Stars Eddie, pull him back along the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cuervo, wait. Please...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Cuervo Jones turns to Utopia, who stands numbly staring off at the drop-off. He walks over to her, then slaps her hard, viciously, across the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Utopia reacts to the stinging slap.

	</DIALOGUE>
</CUERVO_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
The others follow them...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANCHESTER AVENUE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Cuervo Jones and Utopia emerge from the manhole cover, hear the sound of hundreds of helicopters rise.
</DIRECTION>
<CUERVO_JONES>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, baby. They're all mine.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
POV - THE SKY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above Manchester and the Forum is filled with helicopters. All models, all makes, mostly the older, discarded military Blood Phoenix 14-bladed attack choppers that scream through the blackness like scythe-slashing robot bugs. They are on their way southeast, toward Orange County.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKY VIEW OF L.A. BY NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking out at L.A. from above Mount Lee, see the Hollywood Sign, and wave after wave of helicopters thundering across the city.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE TWIN TOWERS OF CENTURY CITY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're like buck teeth, sheered off and crumbling, stuck up in to the sky. Chopper roar overhead. A group of vagrants cluster around a camp fire on the top floor of one of the towers. They're watching a futuristic big-spin lotto on a large screen TV. The sound of the choppers brings them to the edge of the building - the walls of the floors beneath have been torn away. Desk, furniture, rugs, everything hangs out over the empty space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIREBASE SEVEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pandemonium. Troops, vehicles, helicopters, everything is in urgent motion. A loudspeaker voice blares:
</DIRECTION>
<POLICE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Full stage battle alert. All personnel to battle stations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY INTO COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malloy, the President and Brazen charge down a hallway into Command HQ. The place is jumping. Full scramble alert.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A sky full of enemy choppers on radar. Moving over the city to the southeast.

A COM Officer rushes up to Malloy...

<DIRECTION>
DARKNESS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Creaking. The WHOOSH of something swinging through the air...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge blue eye opens. Looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DARKNESS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken's boot is hooked in a twisted wire mesh...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DARKNESS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then Plissken swings like a pendulum, hanging from a long strand of wire mesh attached somewhere above in the blackness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken's eye blinks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DARKNESS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Begins to reveal details: slimy walls. Below, a black pit of hell. Wind gushing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then a light stabs across the void...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - PLISSKEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... The light hits Plissken's good eye...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light is from inside the eye of Pendejo Bob. He stands on a small ledge, at the mouth of a cave leading into the howling pit.
</DIRECTION>
<PENDEJO_BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Snake. You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(unhooks the lariat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard gunfire down here...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(begins to swing the rope)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never been down this far before...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(swings the rope in a huge arc)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grab this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENDEJO_BOB>
<DIRECTION>
Pendejo Bob tosses the lariat. The noose flies across the pit, and Plissken grabs it with his good hand.
</DIRECTION>
<PENDEJO_BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now hang on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENDEJO_BOB>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken wraps his good hand and arm in the noose, as Pendejo Bob jerks the line hard. Plissken is in mid-swing, and the rope jerking pulls him abruptly in the opposite direction...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken's boot slips out of the wire mesh...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Plissken falls like a brick, stops abruptly as the line catches, and swings against the side of the pit. He dangles with only his one good arm holding on to the rope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pendejo Bob pulls the line upward, straining against Plissken's weight. Slowly Plissken rises, a tug at a time, hauled up the edge of the pit toward the cave above...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... when suddenly he passes another opening, a storm drain below Pendejo Bob. He swings into the drain, grasps the side with his hand, and pulls himself in...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pendejo Bob stares down at his rope disappearing into the side of the pit.
</DIRECTION>
<PENDEJO_BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Snake...where are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENDEJO_BOB>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken crawls into the slimy drain, pulls the rope off of him. Ahead in the darkness is the rushing of water. He turns on weak legs, back toward the pit behind him. Bleeding. Numb in one hand. His leg on fire.
</DIRECTION>
<PLISSKEN>
<DIRECTION>
(yells)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm in another opening... Storm drain... There may be another way up to you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken crawls along the drain. The sound of rushing water gets louder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes to the edge of the drain. Right below him is another drain filled with water rushing through it like a river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken is stuck. He turns, in great pain, and starts back toward the pit... when suddenly everything starts shaking. Booming. It's a small earthquake, a pre-shock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SNAP!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the concrete bottom on which he stands gives way, cracks, disintegrates...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Plissken falls backward into the rushing water, and is pulled suddenly downstream into the drain, disappearing from sight...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PENDEJO BOB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stands silently above, listening...
</DIRECTION>
<PENDEJO_BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Snake...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(no reply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Snake!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENDEJO_BOB>
<DIRECTION>
Booming. The whole pit shudders, shaking. Another earthquake. Pendejo Bob drops the rope, turns and dashes away down the vibrating storm drain...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STORM DRAIN - WILSHIRE CANYON - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Black oil-slicked water rushes in the moonlight, out of a huge opening in what appears to be a canyon wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE EDGE OF THE DRAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As an arm shoots out, clutching the edges of the drain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLISSKEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emerges from the hole, slides out, tumbles down to a water-filled canyon bottom. He lies there for a moment, trying to focus his eye. Stabbing pain in his shoulder and leg. Finally he rises unsteadily to his feet, looks around, trying to get his bearings. He finds himself at the bottom of...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WILSHIRE CANYON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Straight down Wilshire Boulevard is an enormous canyon, a river bottom gouged out of concrete in the big earthquake. At least 30 feet deep, it is a vast trough leading past skyscrapers and buildings above, off into the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken warily glances at his watch: 1 hour 10 minutes to go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Plissken is struck by a pair of headlights. Pipeline's dune buggy comes bumping along the canyon bottom, sloshing through water, pulling up next to Plissken.
</DIRECTION>
<PIPELINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Snake. Saw you at the game tonight. Great shot.

</PIPELINE>
<DIRECTION>
A thumping sound skyward. More choppers thunder over them, on their way southeast. Plissken grabs Pipeline with his good hand...
</DIRECTION>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take me there...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<DIRECTION>
But he's too weak. His hand slides off. Plissken sinks to his knees. Pipeline stares at him.
</DIRECTION>

<PIPELINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's connected with the Black Cowboys, and they don't take shit from nobody...

</PIPELINE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly that booming, shuddering rumble begins. The canyon starts to shake. The water in the canyon floor sloshes wildly.
</DIRECTION>
<PIPELINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yo', man. It's a big one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIPELINE>
<DIRECTION>
And the earthquake hits like a roaring sledgehammer. The walls of the canyon crack. Plissken and Pipeline are thrown to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Skyscrapers above them on Wilshire rock and tremble in the quake. Pieces of the building sheer off, fall. A parking garage caves in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thunder shakes the earth around Plissken and Pipeline. The canyon floor splits open. Water pours into the cracks. Huge boulder-sized chunks of concrete tumble down the canyon walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then suddenly it all stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The booming subsides. The earth stops shaking. Plissken and Pipeline get to their feet, look around. The water around them continues to slosh about violently.
</DIRECTION>
<PIPELINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tsunami, Snake.

His eyes wide, a smile on his face, Pipeline hurries over to the dune buggy, grabs another surfboard from the back, hands it to Plissken.
</DIRECTION>
<PIPELINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Surf's up big time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIPELINE>
<DIRECTION>
Now there is another deep sound rising, coming from the west behind them: A bass roar that slowly climbs from the very bottom of the register upward, as if some massive wall of doom were on its way...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pipeline kneels, positions his surfboard in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<PIPELINE>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Plissken looks behind him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV - THE FRONT EDGE OF THE TSUNAMI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is blasting down the Wilshire Canyon, coming right for them. It is a 25-foot wall of ocean water, moving fast, bellowing like a thunderclap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken sees he can't climb out of the canyon in time, moves over to Pipeline, kneels down...
</DIRECTION>
<PIPELINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let the front edge pick you up. Don't get on your board till it peaks.

THE FRONT EDGE

<DIRECTION>
Of the tsunami sweeps under them. Pipeline and Plissken push off from the canyon floor just as the water shovels them upward like a cow catcher on a train. The water sweeps them up until they disappear under the blackness...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Until suddenly Pipeline pops up on top of the tsunami, riding on his surfboard, arms outstretched, feet braced.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then Plissken pops up beside him, surfing clumsily on top of the tsunami wave, kneeling on his surfboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They blast down Wilshire Canyon at 80 miles an hour. Plissken is wobbly on the surfboard, but he manages to stay on top of the wave. Finally, he gets the hang of it, glances over at Pipeline, who grins from ear to ear.

<DIRECTION>
Five feet from street level. An old van speeds along what's left of Wilshire Boulevard, right on the canyon's edge. It veers around debris in the street, changes lanes suddenly, hell bent for leather.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken and Pipeline move closer and closer to the van as the tsunami sweeps them along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now they move alongside the van and Plissken stares over...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER - THE VAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the wheel is Map To The Stars Eddie, driving like a lunatic, his teeth bared and set, madder than shit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken's eye widens, burns.
</DIRECTION>
<PLISSKEN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Pipeline)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<DIRECTION>
And suddenly Plissken shifts his weight, and the surfboard tips and slides sideways, across the surface of the tsunami all the way over to the edge, right next to the van. Map To The Stars Eddie glances to his left...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV - PLISSKEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is surfing the tsunami not 10 feet away from him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Map To The Stars Eddie stares in absolute horror. Plissken tips the board again, and slides another 5 feet closer...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AS MAP TO THE STARS EDDIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jams the pedal, and the van screams forward...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AS PLISSKEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stands up and leaps from the surfboard...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment he is airborne, leaping across the gap to the van... and slams into the side of the van. He grabs on to the roof, hangs on with one hand, his body whipping against the rocking, bucking side. Map To The Stars Eddie starts swerving, trying to throw Plissken off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VAN - WILSHIRE BOULEVARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The van shoots back and forth across Wilshire, Plissken dangling inches from the tsunami-filled canyon. Plissken pulls himself up and crawls onto the roof...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE VAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Map To The Stars Eddie pulls his gun, cocks it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When suddenly Plissken's hand snakes down from the roof, reaches in the driver's window, grabs his hair, and slams his forehead into the steering wheel with a THOCK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Map To The Stars Eddie goes out like a light. He slumps over in the seat... but his foot is stuck on the accelerator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken grabs the wheel with his left hand, and manages to steer the van from the roof. The van lurches wildly, hits a chunk of concrete in the street, skids, fishtailing violently from the impact. It smashes against the curb, screeches and bumps along concrete.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Map To The Stars Eddie's foot is bumped right off the accelerator, and the van slows to a wobbling, grinding stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken slowly climbs down from the roof, opens the driver's door, shoves Map To The Stars Eddie out of the way, and jumps in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VAN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken pulls out into the street and speeds off down Wilshire. Map To The Stars Eddie starts to come around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken grabs his gun, cocks it, puts the barrel up against Map To The Stars Eddie's temple just as he comes to.
</DIRECTION>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen up. I need directions. Downtown. Somebody named Hershe.

CLOSE ON A TV SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cuervo Jones' image fills the screen. He addresses the camera, holds the prototype in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<CUERVO_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Abandon your firebases by 0500 hours. Have the news media standing by for my coronation. I'm arriving in style.

INT. MAIN CONTROL ROOM - COMMAND HQ - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malloy, the President, Brazen, and the other Controllers and Police Personnel stare silently at their TV screens.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAZEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He must be bouncing the signal from one of our communications satellites.
	</DIALOGUE>

</CUERVO_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
SSSZZZ. The image blinks off into static.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A grim silence.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The prototype appears to be armed, Mr. President.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(the President nods grimly)
</DIRECTION>

	Well, yeah. All you have to do is push the button.

<BRAZEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Plissken? He could still be -

</BRAZEN>
<PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget him. He's dead.

</PRESIDENT>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That may not be true, Mr. President.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's one tough case. Plissken's been dead so many times I can't count. But he never stays down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALLOY>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<MALLOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are two choices, Mr. President. Wait for Plissken, or surrender. It's your decision.

The President sighs heavily.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jammed next to the remains of the Bonaventure Hotel is the Queen Mary, permanently dry-docked between the broken skyscrapers by the Big One.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The van stops next to a huge hole in the side of the ship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. QUEEN MARY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The glow of Map To The Stars Eddie's flashlight takes him and Plissken deeper and deeper into the hulking remains of the ship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DECK OF SHOPS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They walk through a dimly lighted area lined with shops. Their glass display windows are covered with layers of impenetrable dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LONG CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They enter a long, narrow corridor. At the end is a doorway. There is light in the room beyond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VICTORIAN SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken and Map To The Stars Eddie enter a long room lit by gas jets on the walls. In it is a crumbling, Victorian swimming pool. A heavy mist rises from the pool's surface and hangs over everything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the far end is a group of people. Spinal and the Black Cowboy Gang. Boots, spurs, dusters, and guns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mojo Dellasandro. Jamaican Voodoo witch doctor. A brutal, scowling face. And a beautiful woman in a bathing suit, her back facing us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken and Map To The Stars Eddie approach.
</DIRECTION>
<MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Hershe. How're you doin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
The woman turns and faces them. This is HERSHE, an absolutely drop-dead, gorgeous transvestite who looks completely convincing as a woman but talks in Isaac Hayes' voice.
</DIRECTION>
<SPINAL>
<DIRECTION>
(eyes brightening)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hershe - it's Snake Plissken.
	</DIALOGUE>

<MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, Hershe. I brought him to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken walks right up to Hershe, has no reaction at all to the transvestite.
</DIRECTION>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need a favor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<HERSHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's in it for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERSHE>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken stares, a glimmer of recognition on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute. I know that voice.

<DIRECTION>

Plissken is seething. Hershe remains calm, glacial.

	You owe me. You left me holdin' everything back there in Cleveland.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<SPINAL>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hershe, you were in Cleveland?

<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. With me and Texas Mike O'Shay.

</PLISSKEN>
<HERSHE>

</PLISSKEN>
<HERSHE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</HERSHE>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got a new deal for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken raises Map To The Stars Eddie's gun, aims it right between Hershe's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You help me, you live.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<DIRECTION>
The others tense, hands on guns.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't be doin' that, Snake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINAL>
<HERSHE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	I'm already dead.

	</DIALOGUE>
</HERSHE>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say goodnight, Carjack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken cocks his gun, starts to squeeze the trigger...
</DIRECTION>
<HERSHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute. All right. Hold on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERSHE>
<SPINAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cuervo Jones has more firepower than two armies. No one gets near him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINAL>
<MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he's got the prototype. And the girl. He holds all the cards.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
<HERSHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly what is this prototype? What does it do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERSHE>
<MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You push the button, it sends a signal to a ring of space defense satellites. They're orbiting bombs. Nukes. They explode. Huge space burst.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	EMP. Electromagnetic Pulse. It happens instantly when a nuke is airburst. EMP shuts down every power source below the satellites - instantly. All electrical devices, computers, cars, airplanes, cities. It's the dark ages again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
<HERSHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So whoever has it runs the show.
	</DIALOGUE>

<MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>

	They were gonna use it on South America, Africa, Asia - any country hostile to the United States.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Only Cuervo's got it now.

EXT. QUEEN MARY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken, Hershe, Map To The Stars Eddie, Spinal and the Black Cowboy Gang stand on the top deck of the Queen Mary. Mojo Dellasandro straps each man into his own hang glider rig. The wind whips around them. The hillsides in the distance are on fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look like strange oversized moths lined up on the edge of the deck. The wind picks up Map To The Stars Eddie's rig. He bumps up and down, side to side, buffeted wildly until Mojo Dellasandro brings him back down to the decking.
</DIRECTION>
<MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know about this thing.

</SPINAL>
<HERSHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Hershe Hernandez, do you understand, cowboy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERSHE>
<DIRECTION>
As Mojo Dellasandro passes out various weapons to the men, Map To The Stars Eddie leans over to Plissken, their hang glider rigs thumping clumsily into each other. Eddie holds up that small, metal-plated portable radio he was carrying when we first met him.
</DIRECTION>
<MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got an idea, Snake.
	</DIALOGUE>

</MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, kinda.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So maybe we can pull off a Texas switch on Cuervo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
<PLISSKEN>

	If he lets you get close enough.

<HERSHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The wind's up. Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERSHE>

The men brace themselves. Map To The Stars Eddie looks like he wants to die.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hershe looks over at Plissken and grins.
</DIRECTION>
<HERSHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you in hell, Snake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERSHE>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I'm late, Carjack, don't start without me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<DIRECTION>
With that Plissken launches himself off the deck, sailing out over open space, then down toward the street...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLISSKEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gliding through the air, as the wind picks him upward. He arcs away from the street level, up toward the remains of the downtown skyscrapers. Behind him, one after another, the group takes off into the wind, diving, rising with the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Map To The Stars Eddie makes a rapid suicidal dive right down toward the pavement below. He screams like a madman until the wind lifts him at the last possible second.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOPS OF SKYSCRAPERS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The group of hang gliders sweep past the buildings. A bracero family is having dinner by candlelight two feet from the edge of a sheer precipice, as the side of the skyscraper they live in has been torn off. They wave to Plissken as he passes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two floors down, someone has hooked up huge speakers and a croaking male voice is singing a Barbra Streisand hit to a background track.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beautiful girl in a sheer diaphanous gown dances far out on a narrow girder, waving a scarf at the moon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken and the others now fly in formation, like avenging bats through the night, except for Map To The Stars Eddie who keeps rising and plunging violently, barely in control.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DISNEYLAND - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An army of vehicles and people pour into Disneyland - but it's a Disneyland gone to hell. A huge sign reads: "THE HAPPY KINGDOM"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gates no longer exist. The overhead tram lies broken on the ground. Slowly vehicles drive straight inside...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A battered old limousine carries Cuervo Jones and a grim-looking Utopia past the ruins of the train and around the ghost-town square of Main Street. Ahead is the fairy castle, broken and crumbling, like some relic from a nightmare. Around it are the thrill rides, tossed in to a jumbled mass by the force of the original earthquake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crowds are waiting. Gangs of every conceivable description. Ethic gangs. Female gangs. Gangs of children. Also families with hangers-on. As soon as the limousine appears, the crowds begin cheering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cuervo Jones stares out at the masses.
</DIRECTION>
<CUERVO_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're simple people. They love a party.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're gonna throw them one hell of a party when we get to America. Right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUERVO_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
Utopia is silent, sullen. Cuervo raises his hand to her and she jumps, cowering.
</DIRECTION>
<CUERVO_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put a smile on your face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUERVO_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
A terrified smile spreads across Utopia's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the limousine inches down Main Street, suddenly a wall of headlights pop on. 100 or so battered old vintage Chevys rev their engines, begin bouncing up and down wildly on hydraulic lifts. Gangs begin cheering, firing their weapons into the air like New Year's Eve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the end of Main Street is a huge open area - almost an arena, beyond which are parked a literal army of helicopters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the limousine stops, and Cuervo Jones emerges, Utopia on his arm, the cheering begins, a wall of sound through the park. Three Black Muslims step out to greet Cuervo, dressed in turban-like headgear and sunglasses, wearing black capes and carrying old Thompson machine guns. They stop, give the right-handed power salute. One of them, BIVOUAC, speaks to Cuervo.
</DIRECTION>
<BIVOUAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cuervo Jones. Welcome, my Brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIVOUAC>
<DIRECTION>
Cuervo Jones turns to the crowd, extends his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<CUERVO_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you ready for the New World?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUERVO_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
And the loudest, longest cheer you've ever heard goes up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKIES ABOVE DISNEYLAND - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken and the group sail through the sky like silent avenging angels toward Disneyland below them and several miles away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLISSKEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Glances at his wrist watch. Only 20 minutes left. Map To The Stars Eddie swings wildly over in his direction, manages to stabilize his glider for a few moments.
</DIRECTION>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Cuervo Jones leads Utopia toward a large attack helicopter out in front of all the others. The choppers are all starting up, roaring, blades turning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly shooting down out of the sky is a screaming, yelling, Map To The Stars Eddie diving out of control, eyes wide as he passes Cuervo Jones and Utopia.

Map To The Stars Eddie crash lands into the ruins of a fast food restaurant - KACRUNCH!

</MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Map To The Stars Eddie suddenly grabs Cuervo as if to protect him, and manages to wrap himself around the prototype in Cuervo's hand. At the same moment Bivouac and the Black Muslim open fire on an old storefront behind Cuervo Jones. The place is shredded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cuervo Jones pulls Map To The Stars Eddie up off the ground, and grabs what looks like the prototype out of his clutches.
</DIRECTION>
<CUERVO_JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've lied to me for the very last time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUERVO_JONES>
<DIRECTION>
Cuervo Jones pulls out a pistol, cocks it, aims at Map To The Stars Eddie's face...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLOOM! No, not the pistol. A huge explosion rocks Main Street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOSH! Suddenly out of the night sky Spinal and the Black Cowboys dive right down across Main Street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLAM! Another explosion sends everyone scurrying for cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spinal pulls the pin on a grenade, throws it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAMM! BLOOM! Explosions erupt everywhere!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cuervo Jones grabs Utopia, turns to run toward to the lead helicopter when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken roars down out of the sky and his him full force. Cuervo, Plissken and the hang glider go tumbling and crashing in a heap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF FAST CUTS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chaos and pandemonium. Hershe dives down over the gangs, ripping hellfire from his automatic rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People running. Explosions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Map To The Stars Eddie grabs Utopia.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken and Cuervo Jones get to their feet and have at it!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through flames and running people Plissken and Cuervo battle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In Cuervo's hand is a long black knife. Just as he's plunging it, Plissken steps aside and grabs him. Locked together, they battle savagely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The knife cuts Plissken's chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cuervo moves for Plissken's throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken smashes him in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They both grip the knife in a deadlock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From above, Spinal dives down and hurls a grenade. Cuervo and Plissken disappear in a huge flash of fire and smoke as the grenade erupts out of the pavement nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the smoke clears, three things are on the ground. Plissken. Cuervo Jones. The prototype.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instantly Plissken and Cuervo dive for the prototype. Plissken has it, kicks Cuervo in the face, drags himself to his feet and takes off running (as fast as a man can run with one bullet in his leg)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Map To The Stars Eddie drags Utopia toward the lead helicopter, as Hershe comes in for a landing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spinal comes in for a landing, continues to throw grenades. The other Black Cowboys land, provide covering fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken races for the chopper. Behind him, Cuervo Jones is on his feet and in pursuit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hershe opens fire at Cuervo. Cuervo dives behind a smoking, burning Chevy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HELICOPTER COCKPIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As everyone scrambles in. A Black Cowboy is hit by gunfire, slides down the bulkhead and out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken jumps in the left seat, takes the controls. Utopia and Map To The Stars Eddie both climb in the right seat together. The others are in the back, firing back at the gangs. Plissken pulls in power.

As Plissken inches it forward...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HELICOPTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Begins sliding across the ground, skids grinding along the pavement, sparks flying - slowly at first, now picking up speed...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the cockpit, the ship lurches and jumps and slams! Everyone is bounced around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The helicopter moves fast now - faster -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOW ANGLE ON THE SKIDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they rise up, an inch off the ground - then two inches - then a foot -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cuervo Jones emerges from the smoke, running ahead of the other gangs, barreling toward the ever-so-slowly rising chopper...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LEAD HELICOPTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it lifts - five feet - climbing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The helicopter pulls away from the charging gangs and Cuervo's sprinting figure.

<DIRECTION>
See the Matterhorn ahead, coming closer and closer. Hershe leans out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<HERSHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not gonna make it over the fuckin' mountain!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERSHE>
<DIRECTION>
The helicopter moves right toward the edge of the Matterhorn, 15 feet... 10... Plissken tries to maneuver out of the way... 8 feet... 5...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The helicopter wobbles over the top of the mountain, the right skid catching on the Matterhorn's edge! A horrible cracking sound, and the right skid is ripped off from its front mounting, hanging half off the ship!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the ground, Cuervo Jones jumps into one of the waiting helicopters as now the gangs race into ships and begin lifting off into the sky. Finally Cuervo's chopper lifts off...

EXT. SKY OVER THE SAN FERNANDO SEA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lead helicopter is surrounded by enemy choppers. Above, below, on either side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Right next to Plissken, Cuervo's chopper pulls up just ten feet away. Cuervo grins out at Plissken evilly, unhooks himself from his seat...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the other side, another chopper with Bivouac and the Black Muslims pull up. In the rear compartment, a Black Muslim aims what looks like a huge harpoon gun mounted to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAWHAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The line shoots out and a gleaming grappling hook slams into the side of Plissken's chopper, the prongs clawing in, holding. In the lead helicopter, the Black Cowboys, Spinal and Hershe aim their weapons.
</DIRECTION>
<PLISSKEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't shoot! They can drag us down into the sea.

Cuervo Jones leaps from the opened door of his chopper, flies through space, lands on Plissken's door with a WHUMP! He smashes through the side window and grabs Plissken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLAM! KABLAM! Gang choppers open fire, riddling the rear compartment with bullets. Spinal and several Black Cowboys are hit!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken fights Cuervo through the door.

<DIRECTION>
But Cuervo wrenches the door open, grabs Plissken, and pulls him out of the seat. Utopia grabs the controls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lead helicopter goes wild, lurching and swinging and dropping. Plissken and Cuervo are locked in a death grip, hanging on to the doorway, one foot in, one foot out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken embraces Cuervo and throws them both over the edge...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They fall through space, locked together, until...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAP! They are jolted to a dead stop, swinging in mid-air, Plissken's arm wrapped around the dangling right skid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lead helicopter bucks and spins and swings, Plissken and Cuervo suspended below, struggling to the death, whipped back and forth by the helicopter's gyrations.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the cockpit, Utopia grabs the controls. The ship is shaking, swinging like a pendulum. Hershe is hit with gunfire, flops in the rear compartment. Map To The Stars Eddie slowly regains consciousness, stares in horror at Utopia.
</DIRECTION>
<MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Plissken?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>

Outside, Cuervo clutches Plissken around the neck, struggling and thrashing. Plissken head butts him, dazing him for a second...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KA-CRACK! The dangling skid is breaking loose from its mounting on the helicopter above. Plissken and Cuervo Jones stare up, then at each other, then both begin pulling themselves up the skid, climbing hand over hand, in a desperate race...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both men reach the bottom of the helicopter and leap across to the left skid as the dangling right skid breaks off and falls into the San Fernando Sea. Plissken and Cuervo kick at each other. Plissken slides away from him, looks up... sees the grappling hook stuck into the side of the helicopter...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken swings up, straddling the skid. He reaches up and begins prying loose the grappling hook. Cuervo's coming right up behind him, reaching for him, a huge knife in his hands. He raises the knife - when Map To The Stars Eddie leans out of the cockpit door, lowers a gun and aims it right at Cuervo.
</DIRECTION>
<MAP_TO_THE_STARS_EDDIE>

Plissken rips out the grappling hook...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AS BOOM!
</DIRECTION>

Map To The Stars Eddie is hit with gunfire, dies, falls out of the seat, out of the door, out of the helicopter - plunges to the water below.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Police battle helicopters thunder toward them. In unison, the police helicopters launch their missiles from gun platforms. Burning, white-sulfurous napalm shells streak across the darkness and hit enemy choppers. The sky around the lead helicopter is filled with explosions, waves of rolling fire, falling flaming wrecks plunging past, as enemy choppers begin to hit the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a dreamlike, slow-motion ballet. Huge black police gun ships circle lazily around the enemy choppers, their flex-guns and rockets spitting blue-white fire. The pound the living hell out of the enemy choppers. In f.g. Plissken's helicopter sweeps over the wall.

	All right, baby. Don't be too rough on me. We're gonna land.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PLISSKEN>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken slowly drops the collective control. The left skid sets down, and the ship continues to descend, tips, begins to roll. Inside, as the chopper rolls over, Plissken braces himself. As the blades hit the ground, the chopper goes wild. The fuselage jumps and twists in a grinding fury. Smoke and debris fly. The blades snap off...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM BEHIND PLISSKEN - INSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking out the front, the blades smash through the windscreen, barely missing the top of Plissken's head. Plissken is splattered with glass, a piece of metal debris protrudes from the fleshy part of his biceps. Blood pours. The rear compartment explodes into flames as the engine grinds into the gas tank. Fire billows into the cockpit, engulfing Plissken...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside, Plissken pulls himself out of the door. He is on fire. Dives away from the copper and rolls across the ground just as the flaming mid-section of the ship explodes in a roaring fireball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plissken climbs to his feet, smoking, wounded...
