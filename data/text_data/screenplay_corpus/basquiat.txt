<DIRECTION>
Fade out music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A well-dressed black BOY and his MOTHER walk through several galleries.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stand before Picasso's "Guernica," holding hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mother is disturbed. Crying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy looks up, confused and frightened, concerned to see his mother crying in public. She looks at him tenderly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her brow furrows. She stops crying. She stares just above his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something's happening: she looks with wonder at the top of his head... his eyes roll upward, trying to see - it's a crown!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He raises his hands. He touches it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beam of light illuminates the crown, casting its glow on his mother's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beam gets whiter, the rest of the screen gets black.

INT. CARDBOARD BOX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. In darkness, we hear a VOICE - imbued with a sense of its own history:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody wants to get on the Van Gogh boat. There's no trip so horrible that someone won't take it. The idea of the unrecognized genius slaving away in a garret is a deliciously foolish one. We must credit the life of Vincent Van Gogh for really sending this myth into orbit. How many pictures did he sell? One? He couldn't give them away. We are so ashamed of his life that the rest of art history will be retribution for Van Gogh's neglect. No one wants to be part of a generation that ignores another Van Gogh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The beam of light shines through a small hole. It falls upon a sleeping, dreaming, delighted face. It belongs to JEAN MICHEL BASQUIAT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTDOOR, DAYTIME SOUNDS filter in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hearing the voice, Jean frowns at being woken up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOMPKINS SQUARE PARK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long, rectangular cardboard box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPER: "NEW YORK CITY"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RENE RICARD (early 30's), seated at a park bench, hunched over a notebook. He's a raggedy dandy: A poet in a hooded sweatshirt and white hightops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he writes, he reads aloud, as if addressing Posterity.
</DIRECTION>
<RENE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (sighing theatrically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In this town one is at the mercy of the recognition factor. One's public appearance is absolute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENE>
<DIRECTION>
Beyond him, a HAND gropes its way out of the box. It tosses a can of YOOHOO chocolate drink.
</DIRECTION>
<RENE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I consider myself a metaphor of the public. I am a public eye. I am a witness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENE>
<DIRECTION>
A HEAD appears from the box. It's Jean's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean sees the start of a crisp, colorful autumn day. The urban park around him is alive with a typically full range of the good and bad in life. He eases himself out of the oversize box in which he has spent the night. There's something about the way that he stands while waking up that suggests he's almost surprised at his own body, the adultness of his limbs - just a subtle hint of him coming out of a dream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He squints in the sunlight. He has a soft, gentle, Haitian face. His hair is pulled tight to his head. He wears two pairs of blue jeans (one cut like chaps over the other) a paint-covered Wesleyan University T-shirt, and the inside lining of an overcoat. His appearance is unruly, but it's deliberate. He's stylish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes himself off and collects his stuff, which includes: a small book of Pontormo drawings, a can of black spray paint. and a cigar box made into a loudspeaker with pencil holes and masking tape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean walks out of the park and looks up past the buildings at the sky:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERIMPOSED IN THE SKY - STOCK FOOTAGE OF A HAWAIIAN SURFER

<DIRECTION>
Jean sees the surfer, 'riding the nose' in glistening, shimmering

</RENE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE ST. - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he speaks, we see Jean pass the wall of a funeral parlor. He spraypaints: "SAMO AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO GOD"
</DIRECTION>
<RENE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D, O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you first see a new picture, you don't want to miss the boat. You have to be very careful because you may be staring at Van Gogh's ear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENE>
<DIRECTION>
Jean signs his words with his 'logo', a triple pointed crown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he presses the spray can, we HEAR the roar of a breaker.

Pressed into the concrete is a pair of EYEGLASSES. A light- colored piece of rock completes the picture to make a face.

<DIRECTION>
Bending over a countertop, we see GINA CARDINALE, 22. He fixates on her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up and notices his stare. She continues to work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still staring at her, he sits down at a table. He pours maple syrup onto the table. He draws in the syrup with his fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON SYRUP ON TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER WAITRESS arrives at his table. She's put off by the syrup.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'll it be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<DIRECTION>
Jean thinks about it, eyes still following Gina.
</DIRECTION>
<BASQUIAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ummm. It'll be great. We'll live together in peace. What's her name?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicates Gina)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up at the waitress.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gina. What'll it be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<BASQUIAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pancakes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASQUIAT>
<DIRECTION>
She leaves and whispers something to Gina. Gina turns and glances over at Jean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean pours more syrup and starts writing his name.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the grill, LESHKO, the burly Owner/Cook, has his watchful eye on Jean. He doesn't like what he sees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean smears the syrup thinly, so it doesn't erase itself. He draws a picture of Gina, using his fingers and the silverware, rendering her last expression strikingly with a few quick lines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GAUNT YOUNG MAN saunters up to Jean's table. He's sort of a tall Puerto Rican Alain Delon with sleepy eyes. He is BENNY.
</DIRECTION>
<BENNY>

Suddenly, Rene Ricard enters - a one-man parade. He beckons to Gina, snapping his fingers.

Rene lands at the counter.

Jean's gaze is still on Gina.

<DIRECTION>
She waits on a MAN at a nearby table.
</DIRECTION>

She hurries past Jean.

<BASQUIAT>

She slows down, not wanting to.

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASQUIAT>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at her portrait in the syrup... She can't resist smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<GINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's me. I've never been done in maple syrup. Here's a rag.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GINA>
<DIRECTION>
Gina smiles. She offers him one. As she holds it out, their eyes lock. She tries to resist his smile.
</DIRECTION>
<BASQUIAT>
<DIRECTION>
(gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gina?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASQUIAT>
<DIRECTION>
She puts her finger in the syrup and licks it off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Benny takes it all in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leshko is upon them.
</DIRECTION>
<LESHKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright. Look at you, staring at this girl, making a mess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESHKO>
<DIRECTION>
He waves Jean toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean takes Gina's rag and begins cleaning his mess, seemingly compliant.
</DIRECTION>
<BASQUIAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about those pancakes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASQUIAT>
<DIRECTION>
He brings out a roll of dimes to the tabletop and splits it open. Dimes roll all over the table and stick in the syrupy parts. The manager explodes.
</DIRECTION>
<LESHKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK! Goodbye!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESHKO>
<GINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.

<LESHKO>

They stand outside, not knowing quite what comes next.

	Catch you later.

Benny leaves.
</DIRECTION>

A CHILLY WIND picks up.

Jean's mood is suddenly downcast.
</DIRECTION>

They button up their overcoats, about to leave.

	What's a job, anyway?

He runs after her.

Gina turns and looks back at Jean.

<GINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate the Mudd Club.

He writes her number on his pant cuff with a big fat magic marker.

PSYCH. PATIENTS fill a cavernous day-room engaged in arts and

crafts. Some of the sadder patients stare off into space as Jean crosses the room. He carries a plate of cookies and a full glass of milk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He approaches a sad, nice-looking, middle-aged black woman - the same one from the dream, earlier. She sits alone fondling a pillow in her lap. It's his mother, MATILDE. She doesn't see him coming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he sets the plate in front of her, she notices him. She recognizes him and seems pleased, even in her isolation. He kisses her on the cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<BASQUIAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASQUIAT>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles slightly.

Jean takes a cookie. She does likewise.

They eat in silence, looking at each other, communicating what they can.

Jean tries to sleep in the box. RAIN falls heavily onto it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drops of water hit his face.

He wills it to stop. It doesn't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, he can't stand it. Rain forces his blinking eyes open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BENNY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A door opens to reveal Jean's wet face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Benny lets him in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean enters a rundown railroad flat crammed with musical instruments, beer cans, and homemade art. There's a couch with a sheet over it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Junk is piled in a corner - mostly art books and drawings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Benny sits down at an electric piano, which he's evidently playing. He sings along, softly, working out the words, concentrating, absorbed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean sets his belongings on the couch, walks to a mic stand and starts making up his own words.
</DIRECTION>
<BASQUIAT>

	"She loves me. Oh yeah she loves me! She loooooooves me, Oh yeah she loves me!" Bring me some chicken, baby!

Benny turns off the piano and lights a roach, angry at Jean's self-centeredness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean digs through a pile of garbage. Finally, he finds what he's looking for - a pile of "SAMO baseball cards" - color Xeroxes of his favorite images and words. He pockets them.

Benny grins. He grabs a basketball and spins it expertly on his

index finger.
</DIRECTION>
<BENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	G'night... See you in court tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Jean turns on the TV. He notices the roach. He picks up the paper Benny gave him with the message from his father and sets it on fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lights the roach with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up; on television, we see a BUM being interviewed. Jean turns up the volume.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bum's on the ground, looking beat up. Jean picks up a pocket recorder and turns it on:
</DIRECTION>
<BUM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The guy just hit me and I was on the ground!!!! Boom, for real.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUM>
<DIRECTION>
Jean mutes the sound on the TV. He rewinds and proudly plays back the words "Boom, for real."
</DIRECTION>

He picks up the phone and dials. He turns on the speakerphone.

Jean holds the recorder to the speaker as someone answers the phone. (Jean walks in and out of frame throughout the following.)

INT. MUDD CLUB - HALLOWEEN NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean and Benny are on stage with two other GUYS, members of the band Gray. Everyone but Jean is dressed in some sort of Halloween costume.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We HEAR the words "Boom, for real" blasting from the P.A. system.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What follows is a continuation, a collage of words from Jean's "suicide hotline" call -
</DIRECTION>
<P_A>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One philosopher said "Give me my liquid hijack Marlboros. Life's beautiful. You have someone to live for. What do you want? RKKKK! That's a beautiful name... French?
	</DIALOGUE>
</P_A>
<DIRECTION>
Jean sits in a chair onstage with his band members. Benny plays the organ. The other band members play percussion and guitar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It works. The crowd loves it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The song ends abruptly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We begin to hear James Brown's "Sex Machine."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean looks out into the crowd and notices Gina. She's looking right back at him from the bar. Pleased to see her face, he says to himself -
</DIRECTION>
<BASQUIAT>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. MUDD CLUB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIGH, WIDE ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's raining heavily. Jean motions for Gina to wait under the entrance. He tries to hail a cab... And another. And another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A parade of them passes, but each time they slow down, they get a glimpse of Jean and drive off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Gina steps out of the entrance. She raises her hand, and a car pulls over instantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

They scurry into the backseat.

The cab pulls off.

Through a steamy, rain-wet window, we see Jean and Gina seated at a table, dining.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They seem to be having a nice time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GINA'S APARTMENT - NEXT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gina lays in bed. Daylight streams into the apartment. Jackhammers RATTLE outside. (Music: REGGAE SONG - Errol Scorcher's "Cockroach in de Corner.")
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTREME CLOSEUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cockroach crawls from Gina's bedroom across the floor and into the kitchen where Jean sits naked on the floor, working on a drawing. It crawls over his drawing towards a cardboard box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean rummages through a cabinet. He finds a can of bugspray. Jean tears off a side of the box. With cardboard in one hand and bugspray in the other, he forgets the cockroach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's mesmerized by the list of ingredients on the aerosol can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Someone POUNDS furiously at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ignoring the pounding, he starts listing the ingredients on the piece of cardboard, finishing his new drawing by including a symbol of a cockroach to the left of the list.

Jean draws on a piece of paper on the counter next to him. He hands it to the landlady. It's a a little shack with a big head next to it that says "'Here' For Rent."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The landlady looks at him like he's crazy. She balls up the drawing and puts it in her pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gina arrives in the doorway, wearing a robe. The landlady's trapped between them.

INT. MARY BOONE GALLERY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
White dust sprinkles down onto Jean's face from the ceiling. Unable to use his hands, he tries to blow the dust out of his eyes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His boss, GREG, a mild-mannered hippie electrician, works above him on the ladder. Jean steadies the ladder. Greg's head is out of frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gallery is an impressive space under preparations for an opening.
</DIRECTION>
<GREG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jean, could you get me a Phillips screwdriver?

Jean shakes his head and puts it back. He tries a couple more - they each say "CRAFTSMAN." He puts them back.

<DIRECTION>
Finally, he finds one with a different handle. It says "G.S.C. 2000."

<BASQUIAT>

A GROUP of people arrives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Albert Milo comes into view, tailed closely by Rene Ricard and MARY BOONE - well dressed, petite, intense, 30. Milo, (also about 30), wears casual clothes splattered with paint. Mary Boone is engaged in conversation with Milo. Rene chatters away.
</DIRECTION>

Greg climbs back up the ladder. He holds a piece of wire down to Jean. Jean stares at the group while trying to be invisible.

(beat - he sees why Jean's so distracted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll get there. But it's good to have something to fall back on. That's why I became an electrician. It pays the rent. Y'know, I'm an artist, too.

EXT. BOONE GALLERY - ALBERT MILO OPENING - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ART WORLD CROWD fills the gallery. Jean lurks across the street, watching through the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cabs and limousines line the block. A crowd outside blocks the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean's obviously impressed, jealous and estranged - he feels entitled to all this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses the street to get a closer look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees Albert Milo talking with ANDY WARHOL and BRUNO BISCHOFBERGER. Andy, of course, is thin, silver-haired, and nearly albino. Bruno is a Swiss art dealer in his 40's. He exudes money - a pillar of security.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the other side of the room, Rene Ricard is surrounded by a coterie of young, mostly BLACK AND HISPANIC MALES. Rene looks drunk, enjoying the moment, holding court.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rene crosses to Albert and Andy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People pass by.

<DIRECTION>
Jean starts to walk.

<DIRECTION>
About half a block away, he sprays on a wall:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"THE WHOLE LIVERY LINE BOW LIKE THIS WITH THE BIG MONEY ALL CRUSHED INTO THESE FEET"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks pleased. He turns and looks up West Broadway beyond the buildings at the sky:

We see a surfer emerging from a HUGE WAVE. He looks powerful and exalted.

A basketball bounces against a wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean and Benny amble onto a basketball court. Jean's changed his hairstyle. Now the dreadlocks stand straight up from his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Benny dribbles with skill while Jean puffs furiously on a cigarette. He doesn't look like he's slept, but he's happy.
</DIRECTION>

Benny throws the ball to Jean. It bounces off a puddle and splashes Jean.

	And you gotta do your work all the time when you're not doing that. The same kinda work, the same style - over and over again, so people recognize it and don't get confused.

<RENE>

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... 'APT 20'... The church bells would ring at noon and six a.m.. 24 strokes: How many times we counted them. We called our bed the cloud. And there we'd float. The bathtub was in the kitchen and took forever to fill up. We'd bathe together afterwards. Oh the countless cigarettes and take out Chinese food... The bed was so narrow Three years we made it fit. The sheets were green the sheets were pink the sheets white linen from the past. Little home, farewell, The broken windows and the bodega on the corner. Now from my balcony I look out over all New York...

INT. GINA'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean watches "The Little Rascals" on TV in the living room. The sound is turned off and a record player PLAYS Gypsy music loudly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rolled up in a large drop cloth, Gina is asleep on the floor. Next to her, Jean works on all fours, drawing figures, crowns, and houses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Working feverishly, he writes "HEY, HEY, HEY" in big clusters, then writes other words: SHARK, IMMORTALITY, JOHN THE REVELATOR, FAME, INK, TEETH, HAWAII SUPERMARKET, POLE STAR, BABOON and TAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has an acoustics manual and Bible open on the floor. He copies the technical blueprints from the manual. He reads the Bible, following the text with a dirty finger. It seems that he watches TV, draws, listens to the music and reads at the same time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He mixes Liquitex paints and puts some colors on the drawings. He draws a long blue line and carries it over onto the floor. Up the wall. Through the fridge. Across the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes off his paint-covered clothes and changes into Gina's black slip. He rummages around the room, gathering pieces of his and Gina's clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He spreads the clothes on the floor, and selecting wide brushes with long bristles, picks up the cans of Liquitex paint.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When paint spills on the clothes, he spreads it into shapes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gina wakes up. She reaches for one of the painted shirts.
</DIRECTION>
<GINA>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>

Jean wipes his hands off on his thighs and puts his arms around Gina, holding her.
</DIRECTION>
<BASQUIAT>

</BASQUIAT>
<GINA>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Jean lets her cry for a moment, then notices the music playing on the stereo - a Gypsy song sung in Spanish.
</DIRECTION>
<BASQUIAT>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Gypsy, Gypsy, your hair, your hair, your face, your face.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASQUIAT>
<DIRECTION>
No longer crying, Gina leans her head against Jean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We HEAR a CALL from the window:
</DIRECTION>

</BASQUIAT>
<CUT_TO>
<DIRECTION>
Benny and two GUYS come barreling into the apartment. Immediate chaos. Benny holds up a packet of drugs and jiggles it temptingly. They make themselves at home. Jean sits with them and starts to chop up the drugs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gina gives Jean a look. She stands, still wrapped in the drop cloth. She lets it fall to the floor. She's wearing only her underwear. She walks to the bedroom. Benny watches her.
</DIRECTION>
<BASQUIAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gina, don't you want any of this? You could use some.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASQUIAT>
<DIRECTION>
Gina doesn't respond. She comes out of the bedroom with a small suitcase.
</DIRECTION>
<GINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you later.

She leaves.

<DIRECTION>
They start to laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GINA'S APARTMENT - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kneeling on the floor, Jean covers the surface of the refrigerator door with fast, rushing strokes. He mixes paint in a large soupbowl and dips his hair in the bowl. Pressing his head to the door, he paints with his hair. He stops to examine the marks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He HITS his head against the door harder and harder.
</DIRECTION>
<FADE_TO_WHITE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GINA'S APARTMENT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PULLS BACK: Revealing Jean's eyes. They're open and motionless. His head is tilted toward his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OFF SCREEN WE HEAR the sounds of Gina coming home:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The LOCK turns. The door OPENS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gina comes in and drops a bag on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<GINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Basquiat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GINA>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. She picks up the mail from under the door and walks into the room. There's a lump on the floor. It's Jean.
</DIRECTION>
<GINA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wake up! I'm back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GINA>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes his arm. No result. She lifts his head, revealing his painted hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes him harder. His body is totally limp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The whites of his eyes are red; his pupils slowly float up, vanishing.
</DIRECTION>
<GINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jean, what did you do to yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GINA>
<DIRECTION>
She listens to his breath, then to his heart.
</DIRECTION>
<GINA>
<DIRECTION>
(panicking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She finds heroin sprinkled into some pot on the floor near him.

<GINA>
<DIRECTION>
(slapping his face)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do this to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GINA>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes him until his eyes unglue. His pupils float into their proper place.
</DIRECTION>
<BASQUIAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... What's the matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASQUIAT>
<GINA>
<DIRECTION>

	Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?

</BASQUIAT>
<GINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Basquiat, what did you take?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GINA>
<DIRECTION>
Jean tries to pick himself up from the floor. He gets up stiffly, like Pinnocchio. The long sleep made his limbs wooden.
</DIRECTION>
<BASQUIAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing special - just some weed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASQUIAT>
<DIRECTION>
He finds an old joint and lights it up.
</DIRECTION>
<GINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Basquiat, don't lie.

</DIRECTION>

</BASQUIAT>
<DIRECTION>
He offers her the joint.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ST. MARK'S PLACE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean and Benny walk along, sharing a beer in a brown paper bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They approach a DRUG DEALER and exchange money for dope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean finds a discarded window frame in a pile of trash and carries it with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They sit down on a stoop. Jean rolls up a dollar bill, empties the dope onto the window, and splits it into two lines. He hands the rolled up bill to Benny, who snorts the line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Benny shakes his head involuntarily, making a violent face, as though the dope burned a hole in his sinus.
</DIRECTION>
<BENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got beat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENNY>
<BASQUIAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For real?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASQUIAT>
<DIRECTION>
Jean takes a taste with his finger... He tastes his tongue and makes a face..
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He snorts part of his line, anyway, to make sure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He frowns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They continue onwards. Jean still carries the window.
</DIRECTION>
<BENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gonna carry that around all night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENNY>
<BASQUIAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... I'll paint on it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASQUIAT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARTY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The party's winding down - hip-hop kids, Lower East Side types. Jean and Benny pass through the room, ignoring the two or three clusters of people - maybe fifteen in all...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean encounters a familiar face: an enormous red-haired dealer - ROCKETS (35). They greet each other as friends.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rockets leads Jean aside. They stand near a wall where a painting hangs ("Flats Fixed"). It bears Jean's three-point crown.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKETS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did that, didn't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKETS>
<DIRECTION>
Jean shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<BASQUIAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gave it to Maripol. She let me stay here for awhile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BASQUIAT>
<DIRECTION>
Jean hands him twenty dollars. Rockets hands him two dime bags. As if thinking better, he hands the bill back to Jean.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKETS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do one for me and it's free. How's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKETS>
<DIRECTION>
Jean re-pockets his money. He gestures to Rockets as if to say "fine - it's a deal."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He and Benny sit down across the room and split a bag onto the window, as before. This time, it's good. They lean back into it, slumping down into the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nearby, Rene sits on a couch with THREE STREET KIDS - artists (who we've seen at Milo's opening). They sit on their knees looking out a window passing binoculars back and forth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARTIST #1 looks through the window with a pair of BINOCULARS. He points down towards the street, trying to get Rene's attention.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTIST_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Check this out, Rene.
	</DIALOGUE>

Rene lunges towards the window. The stereo BLARES (Curtis Blow's "Survival")

Another ARTIST (#2) a young black man, runs up and tries to turn down the volume.

Rene grabs his crotch.

	Oh my, there goes the neighborhood. Who's house is this, anyway?

Artist #2 is still mad at Rene.

Rene weaves across the room. Suddenly, he stops cold. He's staring at Jean's painting. He doesn't move.

</DIRECTION>
<ARTIST_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck, man, where'd he go? Where's Jean?

<DIRECTION>
Benny looks around ineffectually and shrugs.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rene, man, check this out. Whoa... He's kinda cute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTIST_1>
<DIRECTION>
Rene looks to him and back at the painting. He takes one last look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stumbles towards the window and grabs the binoculars from Artist #1..
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We look through the binoculars' POV at a GUY coming down the street. He's wearing all black, cowboy boots, and sunglasses.
</DIRECTION>
<RENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naaaa. Poor thing has a little dick.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Little silver thingies on his cowboy boots? Honey, I don't think so.

He looks around the room again as if looking for Jean.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTIST_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa - check it out. It's him!

Rene grabs binoculars.

BINOCULARS POV:

<DIRECTION>
Jean pauses before one of his own graffiti pieces:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"PLUSH SAFE, HE THINK"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rene watches in awe. Jean, moving a bit slowly, `signs' his tag with the copyright sign. He walks off.
</DIRECTION>
<RENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MOTHAFUCKAH!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENE>
<ARTIST_2>

EXT. ANNINA NOSEI GALLERY - DAY

Jean looks around him. He's in a large, empty cement-floored room lit by fluorescent lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT, ANNINA'S - (LATER) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean bends over, beginning several canvases. He pours paint on them - kind of like photographs we've seen of Jackson Pollock. We HEAR Miles Davis' "Flamenco Sketches."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT - BASEMENT, ANNINA'S - DAY (LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRANDMASTER FLASH'S "WHITE LINES" fills the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The walls are covered with half-finished, unstretched CANVASES. Two or three more lie on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He works like a maniac, buzzing back and forth from one painting to another, adding figures, crossing out words, all the while smoking and eating cookies. The crumbs fall onto the paintings. He walks on them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Every so often, he refers to a book of DaVinci drawings. Torn pages litter the floor beneath the book.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear someone THUMPING down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Rene. A PUPPY follows him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He dumps a huge load of paint supplies, art books, and carryout ribs. The puppy sniffs around happily, licking at Jean and walking over the paintings, wagging his tail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops the tape player and inserts some Persian music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean empties some foil-wrapped bags of coke. He cuts a line of coke on a foil plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rene starts reading from a poem he's evidently written:
</DIRECTION>
<RENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	3rd night I called him 'boy' He sed "don't call me 'boy'" "Well Then don't call me 'Boss'" That Was the end for us and I've Been seeing him for 2 1/2 years. In kangaroo court I want to be

	Able to say I never kept a Slave. But he tricked me in To Tying him up and busting his Face. He'll jump up at my Trial Yelling 'He wupped me gud.'
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jean warms the plate 'til the coke crackles, and then "chases the dragon," sucking the smoke through a straw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He offers it to Rene, who refuses. He lights and hands Rene the joint. Rene takes a hit. Jean takes it back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean starts to work again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PUPPY runs around, chasing after him, getting in his way, running across the paintings. Jean laughs, playing tag. The puppy gets a hold of Jean's sleeve. It unravels about ten feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While Jean's playing, Rene spots a painting with the words "Famous Negro Athletes."
</DIRECTION>
<RENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh man! That's one looks famous already.

SOMEONE (the big red-haired dealer we met earlier) walks in front of us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal a crowd in a gallery. It is literally filled with people. Again - all this takes place in silence.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd realizes Jean's amongst them. People start approaching him. Someone removes the headphones.

Annina beckons to him. Beyond her, he sees Albert, Andy, and Bruno. He's being escorted or maybe just pushed - it's hard to tell. Each step of the way, he's pounced upon by INDIVIDUALS we've never met. The room is wall-to-wall with people. People are swept along in currents.

Looking past the Krugers, Jean looks for Gina. He sees her. His path is blocked.

He presses forward, looking for Gina, getting caught in the crowd.

Jean strains to keep an eye on Gina and Big Pink..

Nearby, Benny sees this meeting and walks off, disgusted, thinking this is why Jean gave him the brush off.

Gina slaps her in the face.

Everyone's eyes are shut.

<RENE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The picture a mother's son does in jail hangs on her wall as proof that beauty is possible even in the most wretched. And this is a much different idea than the fancier notion that art is a scam and a rip-off. But you could never explain to someone who uses God's gift to enslave that you have used God's gift to be free."

George arrives and pours a sip for Jean to taste. He nods. George moves off. Two or three of the executives break out laughing.

</DIRECTION>

The birds. We see the statue in the middle of the park, but we have no idea where we are until we see the Mays Dept. Store sign. The birds circle in flocks, never lighting on the trees.

INT. THE FACTORY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean enters a broad, high-ceilinged studio. It's neat. Paintings lie on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy's back is turned to him. As Jean gets closer, he sees that Andy's assistant FRANK is peeing on canvas covered with copper pigment. We hear the SOUND of the piss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank holds a bottle of beer in his hand.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Piss painting?

	That death-warmed over person on drugs? He's just using you."
	</DIALOGUE>
<ANDY_WARHOL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee. You shouldn't take it so seriously, Jean. That's why you can't stop taking drugs. You always think people don't like you. Everyone likes you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY_WARHOL>
<BASQUIAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People are only interested in you because you're famous, not because they know a fuckin' thing about your work.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY_WARHOL>
<BASQUIAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I was poor, everybody doubted I could make it. When I got rich, everyone said, `yeah, but he'll never keep it up.' Now everyone says `he's killing himself.' So I clean up, and then they say `Look. His art's dead.' I don't take drugs, anyway. I'm healthy now.

<DIRECTION>
Jean obliterates Andy's logo.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY_WARHOL>

As Shenge opens the door, a CROWD of people spill out. They pour into the loft. The studio is crowded with PEOPLE. (Many of them we recognize from earlier scenes in Mudd Club, Jean's opening, etc). On the wall there is a portrait of Jean by Andy. The background is a piss painting.

	You're asking me this because of the 'lapdog' remark. I read that. The person that wrote that has the compassion of a housefly. That's your enemy, not your audience. Your audience hasn't even been born yet. It's a lie that art is popular. The only thing popular about it is that it's written about in newspapers. I'm surprised when anybody comes to my openings. There're about ten people on the planet who know anything about painting, and Andy's one of them.
