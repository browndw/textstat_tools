</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MAIN and CREDIT TITLES are SUPERIMPOSED on a series of line drawings of elves, small forest creatures, tree limbs, and other grotesqueries drawn in the delicate, fanciful, and yet frightening style of Arthur Rackham, The DISSOLVES from one card to another are accomplished by a gust of wind blowing autumnal leaves past the title as the card begins its dissolve. The drawing on the last card shows an oddly shaped tree trunk.

EXT. FOREST PATH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA IS SHOOTING PAST the actual tree which we have seen depicted in the last card. Up the path, marching two by two, are a dozen children of kindergarten age. At their head is Miss Callahan, a young, pleasant-looking teacher. The children are singing rounds and she directs this operation by blowing a pitch pipe and extending her hand first to the left hand column which starts the first lines of the round.

EXT. BRIDGE CROSSING A SMALL STREAM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With Miss Callahan at their head, the children march onto the bridge. Here Miss Callahan halts and the children stop with her. She turns to face them and makes a motion for them to gather around her. With them grouped about her, she half turns facing the sunny glade on the other side of the stream.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_CALLAHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take a good look, children. It may seen just a little valley with a stream running through it. But, no. It's Sleepy Hollow. Just because you are lucky enough to be the kindergarten class of Tarrytown, you can run and play in Sleepy Hollow --

	for exactly fifteen minutes.

</MISS_CALLAHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Almost with the grace of a child she rises and begins to run. As if this were a signal for them to begin their play, the children run after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT of children as they begin to run past the camera, laughing end shouting. Finally, one little girl comes running past the camera and the CAMERA TRUCKS WITH her. This girl is Amy Reed. There is a haunting quality about her childishness; almost a feeling such as Wordsworth expressed, that her youth still keeps her in touch with the memory of another world, a memory which fades with each passing day, and whose fading leaves a sense of emptiness and loss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT - Amy. Apart from the other children, she raises her arms and looks up to the sun and the sky. A butterfly, perched on a stalk of mullen, attracts her attention, and she tiptoes softly toward it, kneels beside it, and begins to speak to it. Her voice can be heard, but the words cannot be distinguished. Suddenly the butterfly spreads its wings and flies away. Amy rises with a smile and runs after it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED CLOSE SHOT - a stand of goldenrod in the meadow. The butterfly flies into the scene and lights on one of the blossoms. A moment later Amy comes and kneels beside it. She whispers, but only a word or two can be heard.

<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you going â€” why do you fly? The whole wide world -- -- my friend -- you're my friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
The butterfly flutters its wings and soars into the air. Amy chases after it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT of several children ruthlessly pulling up the goldenrod. The butterfly goes fluttering past them. Amy, her face rapt and concentrated, runs past in friendly pursuit. One of the boys, a stocky, heavy-set youngster named Donald, looks after her and begins to run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DONALD_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
He runs ahead of her, and before she can protest, snatches off his cap and with a quick sweeping movement catches the butterfly and presses his cap closely to him. As Amy and tho CAMERA HALT together, he opens the cap with a smile, puts in his hand and brings out the torn, crushed body of the butterfly. He offers it to Amy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP of Amy. The shock and hurt have hit so deep in her childish mind that her face is almost expressionless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT - Amy and Donald. He still stands stupidly smiling at her. Amy makes a quick movement with her hand and slaps him hard across the face.

INT. KINDERGARTEN SCHOOLROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A kindergarten schoolroom in one of the public schools of Tarrytown. In the room are blackboards and tacking boards on the walls; it is antiseptically clean and cheerfully light with afternoon sunlight, The little chairs and tables are arranged in an orderly semi-circle facing the teacher's desk. Grouped around this desk are Miss Callahan and Oliver and Alice Reed.

	I know it may seem stupid of me--but it isn't the slap I'm worried about -- it's the reason.

<MISS_CALLAHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something to do with a butterfly-- they were quarreling about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_CALLAHAN>
<OLIVER>

	No. Amy slapped Donald because he had hurt the butterfly -- and it was her friend.

Miss Callahan disregards this. She looks seriously into Oliver's face
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_CALLAHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can see you're worried. And she is a very sensitive and delicately adjusted child.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_CALLAHAN>

She makes a slight pause as if hesitant to go on; then, abruptly, resumes talking.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_CALLAHAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But a good deal of the blame for that may lie with you, Mr. Reed. Perhaps you're over- anxious -- watch her too closely -- worry too much. The child's bound to feel it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MISS_CALLAHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Oliver is about to answer, but Amy, who has been in the corridor suddenly comes into the room

Miss Callahan and Amy go down the corridor. The teacher walks quickly and the child trots along beside her. The two parents walk along sedately, Alice pausing now and again to examine the pictures, crude childish daubs, displayed on the tack-up boards. Ore drawing catches her eye. She stops.

	That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death. And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<OLIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It's not that. It's because I know what can happen when people begin to lie to themselves -- imagine things. I love Amy too much to let her lose herself in a dream world where butterflies become pals. I saw what happened to Irena with her Cat People.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVER>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, dear. I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking. And especially today â€” let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?

INT. REED DINING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP of a party favor held between two hands - Oliver's and Amy's, The hands pull and the party favor explodes with a loud snap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PULLS BACK TO show a pathetic little party in progress. Amy sits at the head of the table with Oliver and Alice on each side of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almost as if the snap of the party favor were a signal for his entrance, Edward comes in from the kitchen bearing aloft the huge birthday cake with its six shining candles and places it before Amy.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got to blow 'em all out in one blow, Amy.

Amy prepares to blow, gathering herself for the effort.

</OLIVER>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her for a second, the strange inconsistency of adult counsel to children completely lost to him.

Amy blows mightily. The candle flame streams out and flickers. As her breath is exhausted, she inhales sharply and the candles go out.

EXT. SUBURBAN SIDEWALK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy lets herself out of the gate and starts skipping down the sidewalk, humming to herself. She skips along, sometimes hopping on one foot as if she were playing a game of hopscotch, sometimes swinging herself diffidently around the trunk of the tree and continuing on in the sunlight. Up the sidewalk toward her comes Jack on his tricycle. Amy sees him and stops. As he passes her, she calls out to him:
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Jack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT of Jack as Amy sees him. He passes her on his tricycle, but turns his head and makes a face at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSEUP of Amy as she reacts to this new slight. She is distinctly troubled. Thoughtfully she starts walking on down the street. Occasionally she turns and looks after Jack, frowning. She reaches a corner, where she stops for a second, pulling herself backward and forward contemplatively as she holds on to the cornerpiece of a fence. She still is looking after Jack, puzzled. She shakes her head, giving the problem up, and turns down the side street. She stops almost immediately, her face brightening again with the anticipation of new joy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT as Amy sees them, of three little girls sitting on the sidewalk playing a game of jacks. One of them looks up, sees Amy, motions to the others, and they whisper very briefly. They all turn around, look at Amy, and then return to their game of jacks, devoting their entire attention to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT as Amy walks down the street toward the three little girls, the CAMERA PANNING WITH her. She stops when she reaches the three children. They do not look up, but go on with their game as if it were the only thing taking place in life. Evelyn, the little girl whose turn it is, makes a grand final play, throwing the ball, catching up eight jacks, knocking with her forefinger knuckle on the pavement, and catching the ball.

The three little girls simply look at Amy; to them she is a complete liar. They put their heads together and whisper. One of them giggles. Dorothy looks up and points down the street behind Amy.

<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at the giraffe!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOROTHY>
<DIRECTION>
Amy turns her head, and the minute she turns around the three little girls scramble to their feet and with screams of laughter start running down the street. Amy turns around, puzzled, and then starts after the children. The three little girls can be heard screaming to one another:
</DIRECTION>
<GIRLS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run! Run faster! Ditch her!

</GIRLS>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>

EXT. FARREN HOUSE & GARDENS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A late Victorian house, with gables and cupolas and a wide piazza, stands on the fringe of the forest. It is overgrown with ivy, morning glories, and wild honeysuckle. The yard, too, which had once been a formal garden, is a tangle of wild growth. The house is silent, no sign of life about it. A very low, crumbling, and in some places completely broken iron rail sets the garden off from the dirt pathway. There are ornate statues in the garden, and in front of the entrance is an old elaborate carriage post. The children come running into the scene, screaming and laughing.

</CHILDREN>
<DIRECTION>
LONGER SHOT of the children as they near the other end of the fence. Their courage suddenly leaves them, and they all make a frantic run for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT of Amy as she comes up to the old house. She is out of breath and quite evidently her playmates have gotten out of her sight. She looks with interest at the strange house and the overgrown garden. She stands gazing about her. A voice from an upper window begins to call her. The voice is sweet, professionally trained and full of enticement.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Little girl. Little girl. Come into the garden. It's pleasant and cool here -- ever so pleasant -- ever so cool out of the hot sun --
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Amy is fascinated. She looks up, and still looking up, slowly and hesitantly begins to go into the garden. She passes under the pergola and peers at the frightening heraldic lion in the bushes. With an occasional glance in the direction of the voice which still can be heard calling, she goes on to the path and approaches the sculptured figure of "Comedy." On the porch steps from above her the voice calls:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Little girl, step back away from the house so that I can see you. Step back, little girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Amy looks puzzled, but to get a better view she takes one or two natural steps backward, looking up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP of an open window. A gentle breeze is blowing the lace curtains. Through the opening between the curtains, a woman's gnarled hand appears in a velvet sleeve. This hand holds a handkerchief weighted at one corner, and tosses the handkerchief out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FARREN GARDENS -- DAY

<DIRECTION>
Amy watches as the handkerchief flutters down. She makes a futile effort to catch it. It falls near her. She picks it up and examines it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT AMY'S HANDS as she holds up the handkerchief. One corner of it has been drawn through a silver ring. She removes the ring and tries it first on one finger and then another. It fits her thumb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT of Amy. She puts the ring on her thumb and stands a moment, holding the handkerchief up between her two hands. Suddenly and silently from behind a bush beside her a thin, white arm and hand appears. The hand grasps the handkerchief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT of Miss Barbara Farren, cadaverously tall and thin, with only her bright hair to speak of a beauty which is quickly fading, as she steps out into the sunlight from behind the bush. As she does so, she tears the handkerchief from Amy's hands. Amy, stunned and silent, relinquishes the handkerchief and watches while Barbara Farren paces stately across the garden and around the corner into the house. From above her the voice can be heard calling:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go away, little girl. Go away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Amy looks up and starts to move away. At first she walks slowly with many & backward glance, but upon reaching the protective shadows of the pergola, she breaks into a run.

</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>

Amy comes in from the back yard. She is hot and breathless as if she had been running. Edward takes a look at her and a quick look at the kitchen clock. He leaves his former companion lying on the table and crosses to the icebox.

</AMY>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>

</EDWARD>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.

Edward looks up in concern, and Amy hastens to bury her face in the glass of milk.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your daddy isn't going to like that. He had his heart set on your playing with the other kids.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes his head, uttering a clucking sound of disapproval. Amy takes her face out of tho glass long enough to say:

INT. OLIVER REED'S WORKSHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a pleasant, many-windowed room with a neat array of shelves, nail bins, work benches, and small power tools. Oliver, in an old sweater, flannel trousers, and moccasins, is working on a ship model. It is a planked model of the "Half Moon." Oliver very carefully fits a plank and drives in two brads to hold it. Amy comes in and stands watching until he has finished.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your daddy's so pleased with you he's building a model ship for your very own. Come take a look at it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVER>

He takes her by the hand to show her the model on the bench. Amy looks at it, but she is not particularly happy. Her father's kindness makes it all the more difficult for her to tell him what she has to say.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see, when you are a good girl and play with other children instead of moping and dreaming by yourself, your daddy wants to do everything he can to make you happy.

Oliver is annoyed at having been interrupted and further angered by the fact that he had jumped to his own conclusion of the child's "goodness." He sits down on a little stool to bring himself on the same level with the child.

Amy, still dabbing at her eyes, comes a few feet out of the workshop door and turns back to look at her parents.

Edward, with a kindly pat on her shoulder, picks up his wheelbarrow and starts off. Amy looks after him, absorbed. Then she turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE. Amy ambles along the walk. In one hand she carries the hoop and stick. Idly she kicks up & pebble with the toe of her shoe. As she passes a bush, she tears off a leaf and chews on it. She reaches a snail pond and drops down beside it with a sigh. Amy locks down into the pond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT THE SURFACE OF THE POND. A large goldfish is lazily swimming around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE. Amy smiles and leans over tho pond. She puts one hand in the water and ripples the surface. Then, staring at her hand, she stops, fascinated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP of Amy's hand under the surface of the water. The silver ring glistens brightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy draws her hand out of the water and stares at the ring. A smile lightens her face. She knows now what she will wish for. She sits down on a large rock, closes her eyes, and firmly turns the ring on her finger as she makes her wish.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish for a friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
For a second she remains with her eyes closed; then, slowly, she opens her eyes looks about her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE WOODS -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT. The trees stand still and quiet. At first, no breeze rustles the leaves, the yaddo lying on the lawn is motionless. Then a whisper of a breeze moves the branches of the trees, and the yaddo flutters gently, coming to life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. REED YARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy is standing up and looking with anticipation at the, moving sunlight and shadow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the picket fence, on the fringe of the woods, a cluster of dandelions grow. The breeze blows the dandelions, and they incline their tufted heads toward the yard. The little spears of dandelion fluff are loosened in the air and enter the yard, sailing on the wind. The musical motif of Irena's song sounds faintly, growing stronger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy looks about her as the dandelion tufts come dancing by her. She laughs happily and in the moving sunlight and shadow begins to roll her hoop. Irena's song, which fills the track, is gay and happy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OLIVER REED'S WORKSHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oliver is at his handsaw. He is feeding a long thin strip of wood into the saw and Edward stands behind him holding up the other end of the stick. Ho has on a carpenter's apron. Through the window Amy can be seen playing, happily racing along the path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The saw cuts to the end of the stick and Oliver turns it off. Both men look out of the window.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>

INT. REED LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of one of Oliver's model sailing craft; the sails flutter and stir as if it were sailing before a strong breeze. Over this shot is the sound of Edward's voice singing, "Blow The Man Down."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PULLS BACK TO show him working with a vacuum cleaner, blowing the dust from the model. Suddenly there is a click. The wind that filled the model sails dies abruptly, leaving them flat and becalmed. Edward turns to look at the body of the vacuum cleaner which lies on the floor. Amy is kneeling beside it. She has a shy smile on her face. It was she who had turned it off.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Little miss, you're stopping me in my work.
	</DIALOGUE>

</AMY>
<EDWARD>

</EDWARD>
<DIRECTION>
He snaps on the vacuum cleaner and goes back to his work. Amy sits down on the vacuum cleaner, astride, puts her elbow's on her knees, her chin in her hands and watches him patiently. Suddenly she flicks off the switch again. The vacuum cleaner stops.

INT. HALL -- FARREN HOUSE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The great heavy draperies of this room are drawn. As the door closes behind Amy, the twilight of this somber ante chamber closes around the child. The weird ornaments, the rococo furniture, the angular stairway, loom darkly around her. In front of her, tall and pale, stands Barbara Farren.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBARA>
	<DIALOGUE>

Frightened, and keeping her eyes on Barbara, Amy hoists herself up into the chair. Without a word, Barbara turns and goes out. The child looks around. She glances at the sphinxes that guard tho stairway and the grinning statue of a Negro serving maid. She tries to see beyond into tho darkened living room. She moves trying to find a more comfortable position in this stiff, high chair.

Edward, is gardening. At least he has on his gardening outfit, the brown sweater and cap and he has a pair of pruning shears in his hand but at the moment he has stopped to survey Miss Callahan's bicycle.

Miss Callahan wheels her bicycle down the drive, eases it off the curb and prepares to mount. She waves. Alice waves back.

<DIRECTION>
INT. FARREN HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy is sitting, a tiny figure in the big chair. She looks around her. The hallway is still silent. She slips the ring on her finger, and then slides down off the chair, and starts toward the door. A slight rustling sound attracts her attention, and she turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entrance to the drawing room, as Amy sees it. A portiere like curtain separates the drawing room from the hallway. Inside the drawing room in the half-light are weird shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy timidly steps forward to the drawing room. She reaches the curtain, gently pushes it aside, and steps within the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FARREN DRAWING ROOM -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The drawing room, like the hallway, is deep with shadows. The drawing room is cluttered with useless Victorian and Edwardian antiques. Amy moves slowly into the room, her attention going from one baroque object to another. On a small mahogany table there is a glassed dome enclosing a stuffed dove that flutters over a mossy column of artificial forget-me-nots. A low, cackling laughter sounds o.s. Startled, Amy looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A corner of the room. In the dim light, the furniture throws large shadows. An amused, cackling laughter is heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy, frightened, listens a moment. The laughter ceases. Amy takes a step toward the hallway. Suddenly, there is a sharp, quick, rattling sound, and sunlight floods the scene. Amy cowers, hiding her eyes from the bright light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julia Farren stands at the window, one hand still resting on the center rod of the old-fashioned shutter, through which bright sunlight now pours. Mrs. Farren is a fabulous creature. Her face is painted, rouged, and powdered; and she wears a thick wig of outrageously red hair. There are jeweled pendants glittering in her ears, rings on her fingers, bracelets on her wrists. She wears a diamond necklace, and around her throat is a grosgrain ribbon with a huge ruby shining in the center. Her gown is of the period 1915, and was once a very elaborate Worth model. It is a tea gown of gold lace over velvet, but some of the panels of lace are torn and sagging. She leans on a black walking stick that has a diamond top. Her scarlet lips open in a smile as she looks down at Amy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy slowly lets her hands fall from her face, and stares up at Julia Farren, blinking her eyes in the unaccustomed light. Julia Farren adjusts the rod on the shutter so that the light is softer and no longer glaring. She smiles at Amy.
</DIRECTION>

Amy moves to the sofa and slides up onto it. A large white cat leaps onto the lap of Mrs. Farren, who caresses it gently. Amy is unable to take her eyes from the fabulous woman before her. Mrs. Farren smiles a glittering smile.

She starts to pour, but there is a light sound of footsteps in the hall. Mrs. Farren looks around. Her whole body seems to freeze. An icy, hateful gleam comes into her eyes. Amy looks at Mrs. Farren, then, apprehensively, glances around.

<DIRECTION>
Barbara Farren stands in the doorway, staring at her mother. Barbara is a woman of around thirty-five, tall blonde, beautiful. Her eyes, lynx-like, glint as she stares; she looks as if she might pounce, like a panther, into the room. Her lip curls with faint contempt, and turning, she quits the room.

	<DIALOGUE>
	-- If you stand on that bridge at the wrong hour -- the hour when he rides by, his great cloak sweeps around you, he swings you to his saddle bow, and you have to ride forever your eyes seeing for his blind eyes, your ears listening for his ears long deafened and dead, and always his cold arms around you, crushing you into the cavity of his bony chest. Then forever you must ride and ride and ride with the Headless Horseman.

Amy and Edward come out of the living room and go down the hallway to the front door. Edward fusses with the numerous bolts and chains which hold this structure closed. Suddenly, two slender, white hands come into the scene and, with a single twist, effortlessly unbolt the door. Amy and Edward look around.

INT. AMY'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy is in bed asleep. Moonlight fills the room. Amy lies perfectly still in quiet sleep, her hair tousled on the white pillow. At the window a branch of a tree is beating its leaves against the panes of class. In the distance, muffled and faint, issuing from no known direction, comes the beat of horse's hoofs. Mrs. Farren's voice can be heard.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_FARREN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He comes riding, riding, riding. On the dark nights-- on the nights of storm...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_FARREN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The words are repeated in and, out of sequence, a mad and irritating cacophony of verbiage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the darkness of the window, against the background of beating boughs, great hooves appear, striking at the air, bright shoes flash, the calks catching the light. The hairy fetlocks are dank and wet. The chest of the horse, his flaring nostrils, the wildly rolling eyes, the mane, wind tossed and merging with the agitated branches of the tree, come into terrifying CLOSE UP. Then, suddenly, the Headless Horseman in Hussar uniform, the braid, white and ghastly, stretched across the darkness of his uniform, comes into view. Crooked in bias arm is his dead head, surmounted by a Hussar's cap. The eyes are closed and drooping. The cheeks hang putrescent and flabby. Only the spiked mustaches are upright and give the lie to death. Around this horse and figure, whips the great black cloak. One fold of it swoops across the face of the sleeping child and she wakens, sits up in bed and screams.

INT. AMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Amy is huddled in bed, badly frightened. There is only the pitiful, sighing sound of the branch of the tree outside, swaying in the wind. Amy, clutching her hands together, looks down and spies the ring on one finger. She turns the ring, whispering:

FULL SHOT of Amy's window. The soft curtains billow out far into the room. In the moonlight the leafy branches of the trees seem to dance, throwing shadows into the room. The shadows dance across to Amy's bed, the CAMERA FOLLOWING them,

Her eyes close in sleep, and as she nestles her head back against the shadow, the shadow gains the vague, gray outline of a woman's figure holding the sleeping child against her breast. Very softly a woman's voice sings the old French lullaby. In her sleep Amy smiles in contentment.

Amy laughs, end Oliver goes into the kitchen. While Alice continues with her cleaning, Amy, kneeling on the chair, leans over the table to inspect the photographs.

She stops and looks down at the picture which Amy is looking at with rapt attention.

EXT. REED GARDEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Amy walks along the garden path, she is bouncing a large gaily-colored ball. She is bouncing it at first in an aimless sort of way; then she throws it up into the air and catcher it. Over the scene comes the strain, of Irena's song, and Amy, with the ball in hand, looks up. Her eyes brighten with a curious interest, and her lips part in a friendly smile. She tosses the ball toward the camera. After a second it comes back to her. This time the CAMERA TRAVELS WITH the ball to show Amy's friend, who catches the ball and tosses it back to Amy. Amy's friend is a woman in gray, chiffon garments. This is the first-complete materialization of the friend, and it is evident that she has the pretty, kitten-like face of Irena, Oliver's first wife.

EXT. REED GARDEN - DAY

<DIRECTION>
On the other side of the fence, its delicate fetlocks deep in snow, outlined against the green pine trees, stands a doe. Its great mild eyes look at the child.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT of Amy looking at the doe. An expression of great delight and enthrallment is on her young face. Suddenly, from behind her, Irena steps and stands there watching the deer. Without turning her head, the child speaks.

<AMY>

	I can sea its breath in the cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<IRENA>

	It's a warm breath -- warm and strong â€” warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.

</IRENA>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I pet the deer?

Irena smiles. The child runs forward down the steps and into the yard. With one great bound, the deer leaps away and is gone from sight. The child stops. From behind her she hears the heavy clumping of Edward's galoshes on the porch. Irena has vanished.

Mrs. Farren is seated on the sofa. She wears one of her fabulous creations, a Lucille tea gown, with long flowing sleeves and web-like lace.

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with a sigh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, well, it's a bad generation -- forgetting all the beautiful words. I'll tell you plainly -- there's a wild huntsman who scours the forest with his dogs and his men. He winds his horn and the woods echo with it. Everywhere he passes the animals are slaughtered and lie dead beneath his trampling feet. If he should catch up with anyone walking in the wood, forever and forever they would have to hunt with Herne, the Huntsman and his wild rout. Hear his horn?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_FARREN>
<DIRECTION>
The question is addressed to both persons. Amy nods and Edward shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And does he kill people?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<MRS_FARREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.

<DIRECTION>
Edward, getting alarmed by now, decides that the visit has lasted long enough. He looks toward the shuttered windows.

EXT. ROAD - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Early winter darkness is in the air. It is not snowing, but a wind is blowing, rustling the garments of Edward and Amy, who walk down the road. The colored man is leading Amy by one hand; in his other hand is a pocket flash, which he now turns on. The ray of the flashlight cuts through the darkness, the beam falling upon the snowy road. Suddenly Edward stops short, staring down before him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PANS ALONG the ray to where it discloses lying upon the snow in a pool of blood the mangled body of the little deer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edward quickly tries to hide the pathetic sight of the dead deer from Amy's eyes by switching the flashlight off the object and by putting an arm around the child, shielding her from viewing the carcass.

	Mustn't look, little miss. Mustn't look.

</AMY>
<EDWARD>

	Because it can't. It's dead.

</EDWARD>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it was alive â€” it was fast and strong!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It got hit.

</EDWARD>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But where has it gone? Where's all the strength and the quickness?

Edward cannot answer the child's question, so he makes a secret of it. He raises his finger to his lips. He shrugs

Amy realizes by the seriousness of his tone that once more she has offended her father. She has no way, however, of knowing the reason for that offense.

Miss Callahan comes up behind Alice, who watches Oliver go on upstairs with Amy. From upstairs o.s. sounds the noise of a door closing. Alice takes a step forward, then, thinking better of it, turns to confront Miss Callahan. She tries to smile at the woman. Miss Callahan puts an arm around Alice and leads her back to the fire.

Oliver is looking at Miss Callahan. Alice is by his side.

<OLIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything you say is no doubt very true. But what worries me is that Amy keeps escaping from reality. I went through that once- with Irena. I saw her... Alice and I both saw Irena lose her mind. Do you think I can sit here calmly and watch my child.

INT. AMY'S BEDROOM - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy stands at the window, looking out the window after her friend. She turns, sees her coat on the chair, and makes up her mind. Still sobbing from her grief, she puts on her coat, crosses to her closet, gets out her galoshes, puts them on, wraps a scarf around her neck, and crosses to the door. Very quietly she opens the door. Downstairs, o.s., the voices of Oliver, Alice, and Miss Callahan are heard, although what they say is indistinquishable. On tiptoe Amy steals out into the hall. Through the open door of her bedroom she is seen to go down the hall and start softly down the stairs, her shadow looming up large on the wall at the head of the stairs.

Miss Callahan has picked up the portrait of Irena and is studying it. She turns to Oliver and Alice.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's perfectly normal for a child to dream. I can see how a sensitive little girl, finding this portrait, would take the image of this woman and make of her an imaginary friend. That image dwells only in her imagination, and that image can go as quickly as it was born.

Miss Callahan's words silence Oliver. He looks from her to Alice, who tries to smile encouragingly at him. Oliver looks upstairs.

Amy walks down the road, the CAMERA TRUCKING IN FRONT OF her. It is very quiet, and there is only the rhythmical sloshing of Amy's shoes as she plows her way through the heavy snow. She looks from side to side as she walks along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP of Amy's face as she walks along, looking from left to right. Suddenly she looks ahead and stops abruptly.

The snail bridge that crosses the frozen stream, as Amy sees it. The bridge is blanketed with snow and is illumined by the full glare of the cold moonlight.

CLOSEUP of Amy's face as she looks round about her.

<DIRECTION>
Amy swallows hard and then steps forward onto the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA PANS WITH her as she walks along. About the time she has reached the halfway point in her journey across the bridge, she stops, stilled with terror. In the distance is a sound that seems very much like that of the hoofs of an approaching horse galloping closer through the winter night. Amy turns and looks behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The post road, as Amy sees it, stretching out into the shadows. There is nothing stirring, but the sound of the approaching horseman grows louder and louder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy turns her head away and starts to run. The sound grows louder, closer, filling the screen. Amy stumbles and falls. She cowers against the side of the bridge, as the rider thunders down upon her. The sound tears past her, and a shadow brushes by her and is gone. Timidly she looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REAR SHOT of an old automobile, as Amy sees it, driven as fast as possible across the snowy road. The car has no lights.

CAMERA PANS DOWN TO a CLOSEUP of a back tire of the automobile. It is covered with a chain, but the chain has become; loose and is flapping rhythmically against the road, making a sound like that of horse hoofs.

REAR SHOT of the automobile as it disappears into the forest.

Amy rises to her feet. She brushes the wet snow off her coat and continues on across the bridge. As she reaches the end of the bridge, a few snowflakes begin to fall upon her. It is snowing again. Amy looks up.

As Amy looks up, the clear glow of the moonlight vanishes, and there is only an ominous gray reflection of suffused light upon her face. It snows harder, faster. Amy starts walking again, the CAMERA PANNING WITH her.

Amy hesitates a moment, looking at the tulip tree.

Amy hesitates, reluctant to pass the tree. It is snowing hard now, and a shrill wind is blowing. The gaunt tulip tree is even more dreadful now, with the wind waving the branches about against the snow. The shadows are long and wavering. Suddenly with a gust of wind the branches blow downward, like long thin arms, reaching to ensnare Amy. Amy, terrified, turns, leaves the road, and runs into the adjoining snow covered meadow.

EXT. MEADOW - NIGHT

Amy stops running and begins to walk, the CAMERA PANNING WITH her. Suddenly she sinks into a spot of soft snow, and it is only with a great effort that she pulls herself out. She crawls onto the hard snow and makes her way onward, disappearing into the snowstorm.

Julia Farren is sitting by a lamp, going through an old prompt book. She looks up, and the faintest shadow of a smile shows on her face as she looks at Barbara. The wind beats against the house.

Amy stumbles onward through the snowstorm. She falls and lies for a moment, her cheek against the cold whiteness. Then she drags herself to her feet and stands wearily, swaying with fatigue. She forces herself on and reaches a great boulder. She rests there for a moment, leaning hard against the frozen rock of ice and snow. She slips to her knees and leans back against the rock. She can go no further, The snow falls relentlessly upon her.

She pulls herself up another step. The wind fills the hallway with echoes of the storm. The great tapestries and long somber drapes billow out, weirdly shroud-like, whipping in the gusts of wind.

<DIRECTION>
Amy shrinks away, terrified. From upstairs comes a disparate sobbing and then there is quiet. Amy looks about her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wind fills the hallway again like a cavern. The drapes and tapestries flap dismally, reaching out toward her like talons. Amy looks down the stairs into the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT of the hallway as Amy sees it, with the drapes billowing, the wind moaning and sighing. The hounds sound, O.S., very close.
