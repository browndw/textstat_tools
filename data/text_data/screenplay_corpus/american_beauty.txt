<DIRECTION>
On VIDEO: JANE BURNHAM lays in bed, wearing a tank top. She's sixteen, with dark, intense eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need a father who's a role model, not some horny geek-boy who's gonna spray his shorts whenever I bring a girlfriend home from school.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(snorts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a lame-o. Somebody really should put him out of his misery.

<DIRECTION>
Her mind wanders for a beat.

EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're FLYING above suburban America, DESCENDING SLOWLY toward a tree-lined street.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Lester Burnham. This is my neighborhood. This is my street. This... is my life. I'm forty-two years old. In less than a year, I'll be dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're looking down at a king-sized BED from OVERHEAD:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LESTER BURNHAM lies sleeping amidst expensive bed linens, face down, wearing PAJAMAS. An irritating ALARM CLOCK RINGS. Lester gropes blindly to shut it off.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, I don't know that yet. He rolls over, looks up at us and sighs. He doesn't seem too thrilled at the prospect of a new day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And in a way, I'm dead already.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
He sits up and puts on his slippers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MASTER BATH - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lester thrusts his face directly into a steaming hot shower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE from outside the shower: Lester's naked body is silhouetted through the fogged-up glass door. It becomes apparent he is masturbating.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (amused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at me, jerking off in the shower.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This will be the high point of my day. It's all downhill from here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on a single, dewy AMERICAN BEAUTY ROSE. A gloved hand with CLIPPERS appears and SNIPS the flower off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAROLYN BURNHAM tends her rose bushes in front of the Burnham house. A very well-put together woman of forty, she wears color-coordinated gardening togs and has lots of useful and expensive tools.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lester watches her through a WINDOW on the first floor, peeping out through the drapes.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my wife Carolyn. See the way the handle on those pruning shears matches her gardening clogs? That's not an accident.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JIMS' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the fenced front yard of the house next door, a dog BARKS repeatedly. A MAN in a conservative suit (JIM #1) chastises the barking dog.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hush, Bitsy. You hush. What is wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM_1>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's our next-door neighbor Jim.

A second MAN in a conservative suit (JIM #2) comes out of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (CONT'D)

	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's his lover, Jim.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<JIM_2>
<DIRECTION>
(re: barking dog)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What in the world is wrong with her? She had a walk this morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM_2>
<JIM_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And a jerky treat.

</JIM_1>
<JIM_2>

Jim #1 walks toward the fence to greet Carolyn.

	I just love your tie! That color!

<JIM_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just love your roses. How do you get them to flourish like this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM_1>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'll tell you. Egg shells and Miracle Grow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
Jim #1 and Carolyn continue to chat, unaware that Lester is watching them.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man. I get exhausted just watching her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Lester's POV: We can't hear what Jim and Carolyn are saying, but she's overly animated, like a TV talk show host.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She wasn't always like this. She used to be happy. We used to be happy.

INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - JANE'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JANE is seated at her desk, working at her computer.

<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My daughter Jane. Only child.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on the COMPUTER MONITOR: A PERSONAL BANKING SOFTWARE window suddenly disappears to reveal another window: a PLASTIC SURGERY WEBSITE, featuring clinical "before" and "after" photos of surgically augmented breasts.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Janie's a pretty typical teenager. Angry, insecure, confused. I wish I could tell her that's all going to pass...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Outside, a CAR HORN BLARES. Jane stuffs items into her BACKPACK.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I don't want to lie to her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
We HEAR the CAR HORN again from outside. Jane studies herself in a mirror, then shifts to get a good profile of her breasts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carolyn stands next to a platinum-colored MERCEDES-BENZ ML320, reaching in through the drivers' window to blow the HORN again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane shuffles out of the house, her backpack slung over her shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jane. Honey. Are you trying to look unattractive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, congratulations. You've succeeded admirably.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
Jane gets in the car. Lester hurries out the front door, carrying a BRIEFCASE.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lester, could you make me a little later, please? Because I'm not quite late enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
Lester's briefcase suddenly springs open and his papers spill all over the driveway. He drops to his knees to gather everything.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice going, Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Lester smiles sheepishly, trying to lighten the moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His POV: Carolyn looks down at us, contemptuous but also bored, as if she gave up expecting anything more long ago.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Both my wife and daughter think I'm this gigantic loser, and... they're right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - A SHORT TIME LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carolyn is driving; Jane stares out the window. Lester is asleep in the back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have lost something. I'm not exactly sure what it is, but I know I didn't always feel this... sedated. But you know what? It's never too late to get it back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lester sits at his workstation, a BEIGE CUBICLE surrounded by IDENTICAL BEIGE CUBICLES. He's staring at a computer monitor and talking on a HEADSET PHONE. The beleaguered expression on his face is at odds with the light, friendly tone of his voice.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, this is Lester Burnham from Media Monthly magazine, I'm calling for Mr. Tamblin, please?... Well, we're all under a deadline here, uh, but you see, there is some basic information about the product launch that isn't even covered in your press release and I... Yeah. Can I ask you a question? Who is Tamblin? Does he exist? 'Cause he doesn't ever seem to come in... Yeah, okay, I'll leave my number...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
BRAD, a dapper man in his thirties, approaches and observes Lester, who is unaware of his presence.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's 555 0199. Lester Burnham. Thank you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Lester disconnects the call, obviously irritated.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Les. You got a minute?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<DIRECTION>
Lester turns around, smiling perfunctorily
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For you, Brad? I've got five.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BRAD'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brad is seated behind his desk in his big corner office.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure you can understand our need to cut corners around here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<DIRECTION>
Lester sits across from him, looking small and isolated.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, sure. Times are tight, and you gotta free up cash. Gotta spend money to make money. Right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. So...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<DIRECTION>
Brad stands, ready to usher Lester out.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(blurts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like the time when Mr. Flournoy used the company MasterCard to pay for that hooker, and then she used the card numbers and stayed at the St. Regis for, what was it, like, three months?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<BRAD>
<DIRECTION>
(startled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's unsubstantiated gossip.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's fifty thousand dollars. That's somebody's salary. That's somebody who's gonna get fired because Craig has to pay women to fuck him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus. Calm down. Nobody's getting fired yet. That's why we're having everyone write out a job description, mapping out in detail how they contribute. That way, management can assess who's valuable and--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's expendable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<BRAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(angry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been writing for this magazine for fourteen years, Brad. You've been here how long, a whole month?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<BRAD>
<DIRECTION>
(frank)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm one of the good guys, Les. I'm trying to level with you. This is your one chance to save your job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD>
<DIRECTION>
Lester stares at him, powerless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MOVING VAN is parked in front of the COLONIAL HOUSE next door to the Burnhams'. Movers carry furniture toward the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mercedes-Benz pulls into the Burnham driveway. Carolyn drives, Lester is in the passenger seat.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--there is no decision, you just write the damn thing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't think it's weird and kinda fascist?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Possibly. But you don't want to be unemployed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, well, let's just all sell our souls and work for Satan, because it's more convenient that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you be just a little bit more dramatic, please, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
As they get out of the car, Carolyn scopes out the MOVERS next door.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So we've finally got new neighbors. You know, if the Lomans had let me represent them, instead of--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(heavy disdain)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--"The Real Estate King," that house would never have sat on the market for six months.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
She heads into the house, followed by Lester.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, they were still mad at you for cutting down their sycamore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Their sycamore? C'mon! A substantial portion of the root structure was on our property. You know that. How can you call it their sycamore? I wouldn't have the heart to just cut down something if it wasn't partially mine, which of course it was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - DINING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We HEAR EASY-LISTENING MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lester, Carolyn and Jane are eating dinner by CANDLELIGHT. RED ROSES are bunched in a vase at the center of the table. Nobody makes eye contact, or even seems aware of anybody else's presence, until...
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom, do we always have to listen to this elevator music?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
(considers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No, we don't. As soon as you've prepared a nutritious yet savory meal that I'm about to eat, you can listen to whatever you like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat. Lester suddenly turns to Jane.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So Janie, how was school?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(suspicious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Dad. It was spec-tac-ular.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you want to know how things went at my job today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Now she looks at him as if he's lost his mind.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They've hired this efficiency expert, this really friendly guy named Brad, how perfect is that? And he's basically there to make it seem like they're justified in firing somebody, because they couldn't just come right out and say that, could they? No, no, that would be too... honest. And so they've asked us--
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off her look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--you couldn't possibly care any less, could you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Carolyn is watching this closely.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(uncomfortable)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what do you expect? You can't all of a sudden be my best friend, just because you had a bad day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She gets up and heads toward the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, hello. You've barely even spoken to me for months.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
She's gone. Lester notices Carolyn looking at him critically.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, what, you're mother-of-the-year? You treat her like an employee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
(taken aback)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
Lester is quiet, staring at his plate.

<CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (more authority)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>

Lester gets up and starts after Jane, taking his plate with him.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to get some ice cream.

Carolyn watches him go, irritated.

<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, I'm sorry. I...

</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Jane turns and stares at him, waiting for him to finish.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry I haven't been more available, I just... I'm...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
He's looking to her for a little help here, but she's too uncomfortable with this sudden intimacy to give him any.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (finally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, you don't always have to wait for me to come to you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, great. So now it's my fault?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't say that. It's nobody's fault. Janie, what happened? You and I used to be pals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On VIDEO: We're looking through GREENHOUSE WINDOWS at Lester and Jane in the kitchen We can't hear what they're saying, but it's obvious it's not going well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane puts her plate in the dishwasher and leaves. We FOLLOW HER out the door, then the camera JERKS back to Lester calling after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on the face of RICKY FITTS, illuminated by the screen of his DIGICAM as he videotapes. Ricky is eighteen, but his eyes are much older. Beneath his Zen-like tranquility lurks something wounded... and dangerous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His POV, on VIDEO: Through the kitchen window, we see Lester at the sink, rinsing off his plate, muttering to himself. His head suddenly jerks up and he looks at us, as if he realizes he's being watched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lester's POV: We're looking out through the kitchen window at the point where Ricky was just standing, but he's no longer there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lester turns off the faucet, dries his hands, then tosses the towel on the counter on his way out, where it lands next to a framed PHOTOGRAPH of Lester, Carolyn, and a much-younger Jane, taken several years earlier at an amusement park.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's startling how happy they look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SALE HOUSE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
OPEN HOUSE TODAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BURNHAM & ASSOCIATES REALTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
555-0195 Carolyn Burnham
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sign is planted in front of a RUN-DOWN HOME in a run-down neighborhood. The Mercedes is parked in front of the house. Carolyn, wearing a smart business suit, is unloading a box of cleaning supplies and a BOOMBOX from the back of the Mercedes when something across the street catches her eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her POV: In front of a different house with much more curb appeal is another SIGN, featuring a picture of a handsome silver-haired MAN. It reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another One SOLD By Buddy Kane
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carolyn frowns and slams the back of the Mercedes shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SALE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The interior of this house is ugly, oppressive and tasteless. Carolyn opens the front door, breathes deeply and solemnly announces:
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will sell this house today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
She neatly arranges her sales materials on a desk, then strips down to her undergarments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MONTAGE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Carolyn, working with fierce concentration as she:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cleans glass doors that overlook the patio and pool;
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doggedly scrubs countertops in the kitchen;
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Perches on a stepladder to dust a cheap-looking ceiling fan in the master bedroom;
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And vacuums a dirty carpet that will never be clean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Throughout all this, she keeps repeating to herself:
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>

</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will sell this house today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
She says this as if it were a threat, then notices a smudge on the mirror and wipes it off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SALE HOUSE - FRONT YARD - LATER
</DIRECTION>

The front door opens to reveal Carolyn, greeting us with the smile she thinks could sell ice to an Eskimo.

Carolyn stands with a different couple: African American, late twenties. The woman is pregnant.

Carolyn stands by the pool next to two fortyish WOMEN.

	You know, you could have some really fun backyard get-togethers out here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<WOMAN_1>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<WOMAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, I think "lagoon," I think waterfall, I think tropical. This is a cement hole.

INT. SALE HOUSE - SUN ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carolyn enters, alone. She's furious. She locks the sliding glass door and starts to pull the vertical blinds shut, then stops. Standing very still, with the blinds casting shadows across her face, she starts to cry: brief, staccato SOBS that seemingly escape against her will. Suddenly she SLAPS herself, hard.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up. Stop it. You... Weak!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
But the tears continue. She SLAPS herself again.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Weak. Baby. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>

She SLAPS herself repeatedly until she stops crying. She stands there, taking deep breaths until she has everything under control, then pulls the blinds shut, once again all business. She walks out calmly, leaving us alone in the dark, empty room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We HEAR CHEERING and APPLAUSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're at a high-school BASKETBALL GAME. Teenage boys play a fast and furious game. One team wearing pale blue and white uniforms scores a basket. Perky cheerleaders jump up and down as the CROWD goes wild.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seated in the bleachers, next to the high school BAND, is a group of about twenty TEENAGE GIRLS, dressed in pale blue and white uniforms. Among them, Jane sits next to ANGELA HAYES. At sixteen, Angela is strikingly beautiful; with perfect even features, blonde hair and a nubile young body, she's the archetypal American dream girl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane stands and scans the bleachers.

	What makes you so sure she wants us to be there? Did she ask us to come?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course not. She doesn't want us to know how important this is to her. But she's been practicing her steps for weeks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I bet money she's going to resent it. And I'm missing the James Bond marathon on TNT.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lester, this is important. I'm sensing a real distance growing between you and Jane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Growing? She hates me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<CAROLYN>

In the crowded stands, Lester and Carolyn find seats.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can leave right after this, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
The HIGH SCHOOL BAND plays "ON BROADWAY." On the gym floor, the girls perform. They're well-rehearsed, but too young to carry off the ambitious Vegas routine they're attempting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lester, watching from the stands, picks out his daughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His POV: Jane performs well, concentrating. Dancing awkwardly next to her is Angela. Suddenly Angela looks right at us and smiles... a lazy, insolent smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lester leans forward in his seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His POV: We're focused on Angela now. Everything starts to SLOW DOWN... the MUSIC acquires an eerie ECHO...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We ZOOM slowly toward Lester as he watches, transfixed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His POV: Angela's awkwardness gives way to a fluid grace, and "ON BROADWAY" FADES into dreamy, hypnotic MUSIC. The light on Angela grows stronger, and the other girls DISAPPEAR entirely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lester is suddenly alone in the stands, spellbound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His POV: Angela looks directly at us now, dancing only for Lester. Her movements take on a blatantly erotic edge as she starts to unzip her uniform, teasing us with an expression that's both innocent and knowing, then... she pulls her uniform OPEN and a profusion of RED ROSE PETALS spill forth... and we SMASH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>

Angela, fully clothed, is once again surrounded by the other girls. The HIGH SCHOOL BAND plays its last note, the Dancing Spartanettes strike their final pose, and the audience APPLAUDS.

Carolyn claps along with the rest of the audience. Lester just sits there, unable to take his eyes off Angela.

	It's okay. I'm used to guys drooling over me. It started when I was about twelve, I'd go out to dinner with my parents. Every Thursday night, Red Lobster. And every guy there would stare at me when I walked in. And I knew what they were thinking. Just like I knew guys at school thought about me when they jerked off.

	No, I liked it. And I still like it. If people I don't even know look at me and want to fuck me, it means I really have a shot at being a model. Which is great, because there's nothing worse in life than being ordinary.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her POV: We're looking at the COLONIAL HOUSE next door where the moving van was parked earlier. The front porch is shrouded in darkness... then a PORCH LIGHT abruptly reveals Ricky. As usual, he's dressed conservatively. There is a BEEPER attached to his belt, and his DIGICAM dangles loosely around his neck.

Irritated, Jane stares at him, hard.

He looks back at her curiously, then raises his Digicam and starts to videotape her.

Jane turns back into the room, her heart racing... and smiles.

CLOSE on an ADDRESS BOOK: A man's hand flips to the H page and then his finger stops at the name Angela Hayes.

Lester, dressed for work, goes through Jane's address book. We HEAR the SHOWER running in the adjacent bathroom. He grabs Jane's phone and dials, then stands with the receiver to his ear, nervous.

	Hey. That's how things really are. You just don't know, because you're this pampered little suburban chick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELA>
<TEENAGE_GIRL_2>

	So are you. You've only been in Seventeen once, and you looked fat, so stop acting like you're goddamn Christy Turlington.

The two TEENAGE GIRLS move away from Jane and Angela.

	I am so sick of people taking their insecurities out on me.

The Colonel's Ford Explorer pulls up, and Ricky gets out.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God. That's the pervert who filmed me last night.

</JANE>
<ANGELA>

</ANGELA>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<ANGELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. We were on the same lunch shift when I was in ninth grade, and he would always say the most random, weird things, and then one day, he was just like, gone. And then, Connie Cardullo told me he his parents had to put him in a mental institution.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELA>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? What did he do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<ANGELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?

</ANGELA>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, they can't put you away just for saying weird things.

</JANE>

Angela stares at Jane, then her mouth widens into a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<ANGELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You total slut. You've got a crush on him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELA>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Please.

</JANE>
<ANGELA>

</ANGELA>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up.

</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Jane suddenly finds Ricky standing in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<RICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. My name's Ricky. I just moved next door to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICKY>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. I kinda remember this really creepy incident when you were filming me last night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<RICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't mean to scare you. I just think you're interesting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICKY>
<DIRECTION>
Angela shoots a wide-eyed look at Jane, who ignores it.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, but I really don't need to have some psycho obsessing about me right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<RICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not obsessing. I'm just curious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICKY>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her intently, his eyes searching hers. Jane is unnerved and has to look away. Ricky smiles and walks off.
</DIRECTION>
<ANGELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a freak. And why does he dress like a Bible salesman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELA>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's like, so confident. That can't be real.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - DEN - THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on a TV SCREEN: "Hogan's Heroes" on Nick at Nite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Colonel and Barbara are seated on a couch, watching television. The Colonel is smiling, enjoying the show; Barbara just stares. The Colonel CHUCKLES at a joke and startles her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We HEAR a door opening elsewhere in the house, and Ricky enters.
</DIRECTION>
<RICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICKY>
<DIRECTION>
He sits on the couch, next to his father, and watches TV along with them. The Colonel's smile fades.

INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We HEAR MUSIC under a room full of people all talking at once, as Lester and Carolyn enter a hotel ballroom. We FOLLOW THEM as they pass a SIGN that reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GREATER ROCKWELL REALTOR RESOURCES GROUP
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--everyone here is with their spouse or their significant other. How would it look if I showed up with no one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you always end up ignoring me and going off--
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the ballroom, well-dressed real estate professionals stand in clumps, chatting. Catering waiters serve hors d'eouvres.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now listen to me. This is an important business function. As you know, my business is selling an image. And part of my job is to live that image--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just say whatever you want to say and spare me the propaganda.

Carolyn's jaw tightens, then:
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
(spots someone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh! Buddy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
She drags Lester toward a silver-haired MAN and his much younger WIFE. We recognize the Man as BUDDY KANE, The Real Estate King.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (shakes Buddy's hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buddy! Buddy. Hi! Good to see you again.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a pleasure.

	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay. I wouldn't remember me either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
He LAUGHS. A little too loudly. Carolyn quickly joins in.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
(forced gaiety)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey. Don't be weird.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles her most winning smile at him. He knows this persona well, only it's never pissed him off as much as it does right now.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, honey. I won't be weird.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(his face close to hers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be whatever you want me to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
And he kisses her--a soft, warm kiss that speaks unmistakably of sex--then turns to the others and grins.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have a very healthy relationship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<BUDDY>

	I see.

</BUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
Carolyn's smile is frozen on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. I don't know about you, but I need a drink.

</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses off. Carolyn, Buddy and Christy watch him go.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lester stands at the bar. A bartender pours him a drink.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa. Put a little more in there, cowboy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
The bartender complies. Lester takes his drink and turns to face the center of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His POV: Carolyn is talking to Buddy and Christy. She's on: smiling, animated, LAUGHING too loud at their jokes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lester shakes his head. Ricky approaches him, wearing a waiter's uniform, carrying a tray of empty glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<RICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me. Don't you live on Robin Hood Trail? The house with the red door?
	</DIALOGUE>

	Yeah.

	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<RICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Lester Burnham.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICKY>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Lester looks away, scans the crowd, then downs the rest of his drink in one gulp. Ricky just stands there, watching him. Finally Lester turns back to Ricky: what does this kid want?
</DIRECTION>
<RICKY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you party?

Lester's surprised, but instantly intrigued.

INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carolyn and Buddy are deep in conversation. Christy has wandered off. Carolyn is nervous; Buddy seems amused.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I probably wouldn't even tell you this if I weren't a little tipsy, but... I am in complete awe of you. I mean, your firm is, hands down, the Rolls Royce of local Real Estate firms, and your personal sales record is, is, is very intimidating. You know, I'd love to sit down with you and just pick your brain, if you'd ever be willing. I suppose, technically, I'm the "competition," but... I mean, hey, I don't flatter myself that I'm even in the same league as you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd love to.

(shocked)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?

</CAROLYN>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely. Call my secretary and have her schedule a lunch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll do that. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>

They look at each other for a beat, then look away. This situation is loaded and they both know it.

EXT. HOTEL - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ricky and Lester stand next to a dumpster behind the service entrance to the hotel, smoking a JOINT.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...did you ever see that movie, where the body's walking around holding its own head? And then the head goes down on that babe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<RICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Re-Animator.

Suddenly, the service entrance opens, and a large CATERING BOSS in a cheap suit peers out at them. Ricky hides the joint.

	I quit. So you don't have to pay me. Now, leave me alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICKY>
<CATERING_BOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATERING_BOSS>
<DIRECTION>
He goes back inside. Lester looks at Ricky, who shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you just became my personal hero.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't that make you nervous, just quitting your job like that? Well, I guess when you're all of, what? Sixteen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<RICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eighteen.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just do these gigs as a cover. I have other sources of income. But my dad interferes less in my life when I pretend to be an upstanding young citizen with a respectable job.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Ooh, is that root beer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELA>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches inside the refrigerator to grab a bottle. As she does, she moves to place her other hand casually on Lester's shoulder. He sees it coming. Everything SLOWS DOWN, and all sound FADES...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTREME CLOSE UP on her hand as it briefly touches his shoulder in SLOW MOTION. We HEAR only the amplified BRUSH of her fingers against the fabric of his suit, and its unnatural, hollow ECHO...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK IN REAL TIME: She grabs the root beer and smiles at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on Lester: his eyes narrow slightly, then:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He cups her face in his hands and kisses her. She seems shocked, but doesn't resist as he pulls her toward him with surprising strength. He breaks the kiss, looking at her in awe, then he reaches up and touches his lips. His eyes widen as he pulls a ROSE PETAL from his mouth right before we SMASH CUT TO:

</JANE>

	It's that psycho next door. Jane, what if he worships you? What if he's got a shrine with pictures of you surrounded by dead people's heads and stuff?

	Shit. I bet he's filming us right now.

EXT. BURNHAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On VIDEO: We're across from Jane's window, looking in. Jane tries to shut the drapes, but Angela won't let her. Irritated, Jane retreats into the room. We ZOOM toward her, even as Angela poses in the window; we're clearly not interested in Angela. The ZOOM continues, searching for Jane, who has disappeared. Finally, we settle on the small make-up MIRROR where we see a REFLECTION of Jane, back at her computer. She's smiling. Then suddenly the DRAPES CLOSE and she's gone.

Ricky sits in darkness with his DIGICAM, videotaping. He lowers the camera and smiles... then something below catches his attention. He leans out the window to get a better look at:

Lester digs through stuff stored on the shelves, searching for something as if his very life depended on it.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit. Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
He yanks aside COLLEGE YEARBOOKS, a racquetball RACQUET, boxes of old HOT ROD MAGAZINES, an unopened remote-controlled MODEL JEEP KIT, stacks of old vinyl LPs... finally his face lights up when he finds:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pair of DUMBBELLS obviously unused for many years.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lester rips off his jacket and tie and unbuttons his shirt. He glances around, finding his REFLECTION in the WINDOW as he pulls off his shirt, then the T-shirt underneath. He eyes himself critically: Angela was right, he's not in bad shape. Just a few extra pounds around his middle that wouldn't be hard to shed. He kicks off his shoes and begins to step out of his pants.

Ricky's POV, on VIDEO: Through a WINDOW on the side of the Burnham's garage, we see Lester step out of his pants and briefs. Then, naked except for his black socks, he grabs the dumbbells and starts lifting them, watching his reflection in the window as he does.

Suddenly we HEAR someone trying to open a locked door.

<COLONEL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ricky!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLONEL>
<DIRECTION>
Moving swiftly, Ricky pulls the drapes shut and switches on a light. His room is a haven of high-tech. A state-of-the-art multimedia COMPUTER crowds his desk, and high-end STEREO and VIDEO EQUIPMENT line the shelves, as well as HUNDREDS OF CDs. There is easily twenty thousand dollars worth of equipment in this room.

Ricky opens the door. The Colonel stands outside, eyeing him.

<RICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, I must have locked it by accident. So what's up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICKY>
<DIRECTION>
The Colonel holds out a small PLASTIC CUP WITH A CAP.
</DIRECTION>
<COLONEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need a urine sample.

</COLONEL>
<RICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. It's been six months already. Can I give it to you in the morning? I just took a whiz.

(an awkward beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. Good night, son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLONEL>
<DIRECTION>
He disappears down the hall. Ricky smiles, shuts and locks his door. He puts the plastic cup on the shelf, then crosses to a MINI REFRIGERATOR in the corner of his room and takes out a cup-sized TUPPERWARE CONTAINER from the freezer, already filled with urine, albeit frozen, and places it on a saucer to thaw overnight.

<DIRECTION>
Lester enters and switches on the LIGHT. The room is filled with STEAM. Lester looks around, confused, then focuses on:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His POV: Across from us, in a PEDESTAL BATHTUB, is Angela. She smiles and beckons us, and we MOVE CLOSER. ROSE PETALS float on the surface of the water, obscuring her naked body.
</DIRECTION>
<ANGELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been waiting for you.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I was hoping you'd give me a bath... I'm very, very dirty.

Lester gives her a hard look, then slowly slips his hand into the water between her legs. Her eyes widen and she throws her head back... and we SMASH CUT TO:

CLOSE on Carolyn, her eyes wide, listening to the rhythmic BRUSH of Lester's hand as he masturbates under the covers.

He turns to her, trying to look innocent, then gives up.

<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, so shoot me. I was whacking off.

Carolyn gets out of bed, repelled. Lester LAUGHS.

	Lester. I refuse to live like this. This is not a marriage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This hasn't been a marriage for years. But you were happy as long as I kept my mouth shut. Well, guess what? I've changed. And the new me whacks off when he feels horny, because you're obviously not going to help me out in that department.

	Oh. I see. You think you're the only one who's sexually frustrated?

</CAROLYN>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On what grounds? I'm not a drunk, I don't fuck other women, I don't mistreat you, I've never hit you, or even tried to touch you since you made it so abundantly clear just how unnecessary you consider me to be. But. I did support you while you got your license. And some people might think that entitles me to half of what's yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
She sinks into a chair, stunned. It's clear he knows where she's most vulnerable. He sees this, and likes it; it feels good to win for a change. He curls up under the covers contentedly.

</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Still running, the Jims turn back in perfect unison, as Lester runs INTO FRAME, wearing a baggy sweatshirt and a pair of faded old sweatpants. The Jims slow down until he catches up, then the three men run together in the early morning light.

The Colonel stands, scowling, as Ricky comes out of the house, holding the URINE SAMPLE in front of him.

	What is this, the fucking gay pride parade?

Lester breaks off from the two Jims and jogs up to Ricky and the Colonel, out of breath. He grabs hold of his knees and bends over, panting.

	Hey! Yo! Ricky!

	Are you kidding? You just smoked with me last night.

Carolyn, carrying a basket of fresh cut ROSES, passes by the GARAGE WINDOW. From inside the garage, we HEAR ROCK MUSIC.

Carolyn stops and SNIFFS the air, frowning. She peers through the window.

<DIRECTION>
ROCK MUSIC blasts from a new BOOMBOX on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The garage is in the process of becoming Lester's sanctuary. An ugly but comfortable 70's BOWL CHAIR has been pulled out and cleaned off, his old hot rod magazines strewn across it, and the remote-controlled MODEL JEEP KIT is spread across a card table. The SHELVES that Lester tore through earlier have been dismantled, leaving a blank wall on which now hangs a DART BOARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lester finishes his last rep, straining, then puts the weights in their rack and sits up. As he takes a drag off a joint, the GARAGE DOOR suddenly starts to open. Lester looks up, squinting at:

	Whatever. Management wants you gone by the end of the day.

</CAROLYN>
<BUDDY>

(bitterly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, according to her, I'm too focused on my career. As if being driven to succeed is some sort of character flaw. Well, she certainly knew how to take advantage of the lifestyle my success afforded her. Oh. Wow.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, it's for the best.

Jane and Ricky sit on the bed, watching his WIDE-SCREEN TV.

<RICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was one of those days when it's a minute away from snowing. And there's this electricity in the air, you can almost hear it, right? And this bag was just... dancing with me. Like a little kid begging me to play with it. For fifteen minutes. That's the day I realized that there was this entire life behind things, and this incredibly benevolent force that wanted me to know there was no reason to be afraid. Ever.

	Your father seems to think this kind of behavior is something to be proud of.

	I wish that you hadn't witnessed that awful scene tonight. But in a way, I'm glad.

	Why, so I could see what freaks you and Dad really are?

She stares at Jane, then starts to cry.

	Aw, Christ, Mom.

</JANE>
<CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
(tearful)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm glad because you're old enough now to learn the most important lesson in life: you cannot count on anyone except yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You cannot count on anyone except yourself. It's sad, but true, and the sooner you learn it, the better.

</CAROLYN>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Mom, I really don't feel like having a Kodak moment here, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
Carolyn suddenly SLAPS Jane, hard.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ungrateful little brat. Just look at everything you have. When I was your age, I lived in a duplex. We didn't even have our own house.
	</DIALOGUE>

Embarrassed, she quickly leaves. Jane looks in a mirror and rubs her cheek, then crosses to the window and looks out.

EXT. FITTS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jane's POV: We're across from Ricky's room, looking in. He stands at the window with his DIGICAM, videotaping us. On the WIDE-SCREEN TV behind him, we see Jane standing in her window as she looks across at him. She waves. Ricky just keeps videotaping. A beat, then she starts to take off her shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're behind Ricky as he videotapes Jane in her window. She has now removed her shirt. She stands there in her bra, then reaches behind her back to unhook the bra.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On VIDEO: We ZOOM toward her as she takes off her bra clumsily. She's obviously embarrassed, but she's gone this far and there's no turning back. She stands there with her breasts exposed, trying to look defiant, but she's achingly vulnerable...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the door is thrown open and the Colonel enters, incensed. Startled, Ricky turns around. As soon as his eyes meet his father's, he knows what's up.
</DIRECTION>
<COLONEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You little bastard--

The Colonel stands, still breathing heavily. Tenderness fills his face, and he reaches out to touch Ricky's cheek.

In darkness, we HEAR repetitive GUNSHOTS.

INT. INDOOR FIRING RANGE - ONE MONTH LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carolyn, wearing PROTECTIVE HEADGEAR, is holding a GLOCK 19 AUTOMATIC REVOLVER with both hands, FIRING it directly at us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She empties a round and stands there, exhilarated. An ATTENDANT approaches with a new round of ammunition.
</DIRECTION>
<ATTENDANT>

	I gotta say, Mrs. Burnham, when you first came here I thought you would be hopeless. But you're a natural.

And she starts FIRING again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby Darin sings "DON'T RAIN ON MY PARADE" on the RADIO. Carolyn SINGS along as she drives. Her face has lost its usual resolute determination; she's actually enjoying herself spontaneously, and the lack of her usual self-consciousness allows us to see just how beautiful she is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON the GLOCK 19 sitting on the passenger seat amidst some CDs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carolyn takes the gun and holds it at arm's length, admiring it as she continues to SING.

<DIRECTION>
Carolyn's POV: We turn into the Burnham driveway. A 1970 PONTIAC FIREBIRD with racing stripes blocks our access to the garage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on Carolyn: She doesn't like having things in her way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lester's REMOTE-CONTROLLED MODEL JEEP is zooming across the floor of the family room, expertly maneuvering corners and narrowly avoiding crashing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lester is sprawled on the couch in his underwear, drinking a BEER and controlling the car. His working out is beginning to produce results. The room, too, seems changed: sloppier, more lived in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carolyn enters through the kitchen, flushed and angry. She just stands there, staring at Lester. After a moment, he looks up at her.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>

</CAROLYN>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jane not home. We have the whole house to ourselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles at her playfully. She stares back, annoyed. It's the same look she had at the beginning, when he dropped his briefcase, but whatever power that look had is gone. Lester just LAUGHS.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ, Carolyn. When did you become so... joyless?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>

	Joyless?! I am not joyless! There happens to be a lot about me that you don't know, mister smarty man. There is plenty of joy in my life.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever happened to that girl who used to fake seizures at frat parties when she got bored? And who used to run up to the roof of our first apartment building to flash the traffic helicopters? Have you totally forgotten about her? Because I haven't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
His face is close to hers, and suddenly the atmosphere is charged. She pulls back automatically, but it's clear she's drawn to him. He smiles, and moves even closer, holding his beer loosely balanced. Then, just before their lips meet...
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
(barely audible)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lester. You're going to spill beer on the couch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
She's immediately sorry she said it, but it's too late. His smile fades, and the moment is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what? It's just a couch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a four thousand dollar sofa upholstered in Italian silk. This is not "just a couch."

Carolyn stares at him, on the verge of tears, then turns and walks out of the room before he can see her cry.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>

We're watching the WIDE-SCREEN TV in Ricky's room.

A CORD leads from the TV to Ricky's DIGICAM. Ricky holds the camera, sitting naked in a chair. It's been almost a month since his father beat him up, and there are still slight SCARS on his face. He's aiming his camera at Jane.

<RICKY>

	When I was fifteen, my dad caught me smoking dope. He totally freaked and decided to send me to military school. I told you his whole thing about structure and discipline, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, of course, I got kicked out. Dad and I had this huge fight, and he hit me... and then the next day at school, some kid made a crack about my haircut, and... I just snapped. I wanted to kill him. And I would have. Killed him. If they hadn't pulled me off.
	</DIALOGUE>

He grabs a half-smoked JOINT from an ashtray and lights it.

Jane looks into the camera, a loopy, stoned grin on her face.

	Well, now, I too need structure. A little fucking discipline.

</JANE>
<DIRECTION>
They LAUGH. She lays back on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm serious, though. How could he not be damaging me? I need a father who's a role model, not some horny geek-boy who's gonna spray his shorts whenever I bring a girlfriend home from school.

She stands and sticks out her breasts, then falls back on the bed, LAUGHING.

	Well, I guess I'm just not a very nice girl, then, am I?

We're FLYING above Robin Hood Trail. We see the BURNHAM'S HOUSE below us as we APPROACH it steadily.

We're almost on top of the Burnham house now, as Lester, wearing sweatpants and running shoes, bursts out of the front door and dashes up the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROBIN HOOD TRAIL - A SHORT TIME LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're now at street level, as Lester runs toward us. He carries a WALKMAN and wears EARPHONES, and we HEAR ROCK MUSIC as he runs. The endorphins have kicked in, and Lester grins, reveling in the sheer physical pleasure of his body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - A SHORT TIME LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blender GRINDS as Lester, still in his sweatpants, makes himself a high-protein shake. He's in excellent shape; even his posture has changed, and he moves with the confident, easy swagger of an athlete. Jane watches him blankly from the kitchen table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carolyn enters. Lester leans against the counter, drinking his shake directly from the blender pitcher, eyeing her. He's got a newfound sexual energy that makes her uncomfortable, and he knows it. Carolyn quickly rinses off her coffee cup, avoiding his eyes, and starts out.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>

	Well, of course, she's always welcome.

	You know, I thought maybe you two had a fight. I haven't seen her around here in a while.

And she's gone. Jane continues staring at her father. Finally, he glances over at her.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<JANE>
<DIRECTION>

We're outside Ricky's room, MOVING slowly toward the open door, through which we can see Ricky, standing at his bureau mirror, combing his hair. The scars on his face are almost gone now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A REVERSE ANGLE reveals the Colonel standing outside the door looking in, watching Ricky with great tenderness. Then Ricky looks up at him, and the Colonel is suddenly self-conscious.

Ricky emerges from the house, followed by the Colonel, who watches his son as he heads toward the Burnham house.

Ricky pulls his door shut, but not before Lester mouths "call me" and Ricky gives a slight nod in acknowledgment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on the Colonel's face: he looks confused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the Mercedes backs out of the driveway, Lester glances over at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lester's POV: The Colonel watches the car driving off, then looks at us. His face tightens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LESTER studies him for a moment, then grins and salutes before going inside the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on the Colonel, deeply troubled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FITTS HOUSE - RICKY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door swings open silently and the Colonel enters. He starts going through Ricky's bureau. He opens the DRAWER in which we know Ricky keeps his marijuana, but he doesn't discover its false bottom. He stands and looks around, his eyes finally landing on:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DIGICAM and a stack of CASSETTES on a shelf. The camera is still connected to the TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Colonel turns on the TV, examines the Digicam and presses "play." The TV's blank screen suddenly gives way to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On VIDEO: Barbara Fitts sits at the kitchen table, staring off into space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Colonel watches, at first baffled, then impatient. He takes the cassette out of the Digicam and inserts another. On the TV screen we see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On VIDEO: Through the Burnham's GARAGE WINDOW, we see Lester step out of his pants and briefs. Then, naked except for his black socks, he grabs the dumbbells and starts lifting them, watching his reflection in the window as he does...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Colonel sinks slowly onto Ricky's bed, mesmerized.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MR. SMILEY'S - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lester, wearing a Mr. Smiley's uniform, is happily flipping burgers on a grill.
</DIRECTION>
<CO_WORKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Lester, I need that Super Smiley with cheese, A.S.A.P.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CO_WORKER>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need more than that, my little hombre.

Lester looks up suddenly when he HEARS:

Lester's face darkens, then... he smiles. He puts his spatula down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MR. SMILEY'S - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mercedes pulls around to the DRIVE-THRU WINDOW. Carolyn drives; Buddy sits beside her.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we deserve a little junk food, after the workout we had this morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<BUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
(nuzzles her neck)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm flattered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<DIRECTION>
They are too involved with each other to notice Lester watching them from the drive-thru window.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(overly cheerful)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smile! You're at Mr. Smiley's!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Carolyn almost jumps out of her skin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lester leans out of the drive-thru window, grinning at her, holding bags filled with fast food. The Counter Girl stands next to him, staring blankly.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like to try our new beef and cheese pot pie on a stick, just a dollar ninety-nine for a limited time only?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Carolyn struggles to appear nonchalant.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
(re: Buddy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were just at a seminar.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then, all business)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buddy, this is my--

</CAROLYN>
<LESTER>

	Her husband. We've met before, but something tells me you're going to remember me this time.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa. You are so busted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUNTER_GIRL>
<CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
(flustered)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, this really doesn't concern you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, Janeane is senior drive-thru manager, so you kind of are on her turf.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Carolyn, quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. This makes sense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
(miserable)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Lester--
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, it's okay. I want you to be happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like Smiley Sauce with that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lester, just stop it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-uh. You don't get to tell me what to do. Ever again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Carolyn closes her eyes, defeated, then grabs the wheel, shifts gears and drives off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOP HAT MOTEL - A SHORT TIME LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sky is filled with ominous gray clouds. Wind whips garbage across the parking lot as Carolyn's Mercedes pulls in next to Buddy's Jaguar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MERCEDES-BENZ ML320 - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carolyn grips the wheel tightly, staring straight ahead. Buddy looks at her unhappily.
</DIRECTION>
<BUDDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I guess we should cool it for a while. I'm facing a potentially very expensive divorce.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<CAROLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no. I understand completely.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sarcastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In order to be successful, one must project an image of success. At all times.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
She regrets it the second it's out of her mouth, and turns to him. He just looks at her sadly, then gets out of the car and shuts the door. She starts to CRY. As before, she SLAPS herself, hard.
</DIRECTION>
<CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it. Stop it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAROLYN>
<DIRECTION>
She closes her eyes tight, trying to stop the tears, then suddenly SCREAMS as loud as she can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOP HAT MOTEL - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Buddy's Jaguar speeds off, leaving the Mercedes alone in the parking lot. We can still HEAR Carolyn's muffled SCREAMING. There is a sound of distant THUNDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's RAINING outside. We HEAR ROCK MUSIC as Lester pumps iron. He puts the weights down and looks at his REFLECTION in the window:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His POV: His arms are pumped. He smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches under the bench and grabs a CIGAR BOX. Opening it, he digs through MARIJUANA PARAPHERNALIA, only to pull out an empty ZIP-LOC BAG.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ricky and the Colonel sit at the table, eating in silence. Barbara rinses off a pan at the sink, then stares at it as if she can't quite remember what she meant to do with it. We suddenly HEAR a BEEPING noise. Ricky pulls his BEEPER off his belt and checks it.
</DIRECTION>
<RICKY>
<DIRECTION>
(getting up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to run next door. Jane left her geometry book in my bag and she needs it to do her homework.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICKY>
<DIRECTION>
He heads into the hall. The Colonel watches him go, uneasy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANGELA'S BMW - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Angela drives, squinting through the windshield as the wipers move back and forth.
</DIRECTION>
<ANGELA>

	Oh, come on. You can tell me. Does he have a big dick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELA>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I'm not gonna talk about his dick with you, okay? It's not like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANE>
<ANGELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not like what? Doesn't he have one?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you want to talk about it? I mean, I tell you every single detail about every guy that I fuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELA>
<JANE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, and maybe you shouldn't, all right? Maybe I don't really want to hear all that.

<DIRECTION>
INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Colonel rinses off his plate at the sink. Something outside catches his eye, and he cranes his neck to get a better look at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His POV: Through the window over the sink, we can see into the Burnham's GARAGE WINDOW. Our view is blurred by the RAIN, but we see Lester, his upper body pumped and glistening in sweat as he counts out a wad of BILLS... and then Ricky walks into view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Colonel's face tightens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His POV: Lester drapes his arm around Ricky as he gives him the money. We can only see Lester from the waist up, so he looks naked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - GARAGE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ricky, his hair wet from the rain, puts the cash in his pocket. Lester's arm remains draped around his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<RICKY>
<DIRECTION>
(grins)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got any papers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICKY>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, in the cigar box, right over there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, put up a fight, dude! You are such a pushover. "No I can't. Really. Okay."
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
And he slaps Ricky playfully on the chest. Ricky grins, then squats down and reaches under the weight bench.
</DIRECTION>
<RICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should learn to roll a joint.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICKY>
<DIRECTION>
Lester sits in the bowl chair and leans back, his hands behind his head, watching Ricky roll the joint.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Colonel's POV: Lester leans back in his chair. We see only Ricky's back and shoulders as he rolls the joint. After a beat, Lester's jaw drops, then he throws his head back. From our perspective, it looks very much like Ricky is giving Lester a blow job.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Colonel watches, incredulous. Then we HEAR a CAR APPROACHING, and the Colonel glances over at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His POV: Angela's BMW pulls into the driveway, stopping behind Lester's Firebird. As Angela and Jane get out and run toward the house, our focus MOVES back to the GARAGE WINDOW. Ricky stands, looking a little panicked. Lester pulls on his T-shirt, and both he and Ricky cross out of view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BURNHAM HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lester leans nonchalantly against the counter. Jane and Angela enter. Jane frowns when she sees him.

</LESTER>

He's trying to remain cool, and doing a pretty good job.
</DIRECTION>
<ANGELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. Look at you. Have you been working out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELA>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
Jane rolls her eyes and exits. Angela walks over to Lester.
</DIRECTION>
<ANGELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can really tell. Look at those arms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELA>
<DIRECTION>
She places her hand on his arm flirtatiously, looks up at him and smiles, fully expecting to intimidate him by doing so.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But something has changed, and he isn't intimidated at all. He looks directly back at her, leans in and smiles slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<LESTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You like muscles?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LESTER>
<DIRECTION>
His voice is low and intense. She moves away, suddenly insecure.
</DIRECTION>
<ANGELA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I--I should probably go see what Jane's up to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELA>
<DIRECTION>
And she heads out quickly. Lester watches her go, baffled.

Ricky eyes the Colonel. He's finally discovered a way to break free from his father, and he can't believe it was this simple.
</DIRECTION>
<RICKY>

	What a sad old man you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICKY>
<COLONEL>

Ricky grabs his backpack, turns and walks out the door, leaving the Colonel standing there, glassy-eyed and breathing heavily.

INT. FITTS HOUSE - KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ricky enters to discover Barbara standing in the middle of the room, clutching a dish, frightened. She's obviously heard his argument with his father, and she looks into his eyes, searching, aware that something eventful is taking place.

<RICKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom, I'm leaving.

Something at the edge of the counter catches his eye, and he reaches for...

CLOSE on a framed PHOTOGRAPH as he picks it up: It's the photo we saw earlier of him, Carolyn and Jane, taken several years ago at an amusement park. It's startling how happy they look.

Lester crosses to the kitchen table, where he sits and studies the photo. He suddenly seems older, more mature... and then he smiles: the deep, satisfied smile of a man who just now understands the punch line of a joke he heard long ago...
