EXT. DESERT OF THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mountain peak dominates the landscape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES BEGIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Riders on horseback cross the desert. From this distance they appear to be a company of Army Cavalry Soldiers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ANGLES ON THE RIDERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reveal only details of saddles, hooves and uniforms. The riders are silhouetted against the rising sun as they ride into an ancient CLIFF PUEBLO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The OFFICER IN COMMAND raises his hand halting his troops.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dis-mount!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
RIDERS climb down from their mounts... and only now do we realize that this is a TROOP OF BOY SCOUTS, all of them about thirteen years of age. The "Commanding Officer" is only their SCOUTMASTER, Mr. Havelock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the Scouts, a pudgy kid named HERMAN, steps away from his horse, bends over and pukes. The other Scouts rag on him.
</DIRECTION>
<FIRST_SCOUT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Herman's horsesick!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRST_SCOUT>
<DIRECTION>
A BLOND SCOUT, however, befriends Herman. He has a thatch of straw-colored hair and the no-nonsense expression common to kids whose curiosity and appetite for knowledge exceed what they teach in school. Additionally, he has adorned his uniform with an authentic HOPI INDIAN WOVEN BELT.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOUTMASTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chaps, don't anybody wander off. Some of the passageways in here can run for miles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOUTMASTER>
<DIRECTION>
Two Boy Scouts climb up the rocky base of the cliff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PASSAGEWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two boys head down the passageway. It's dark, and the temperature drops several degrees. Spiders have built huge webs that get caught in the boys' hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HERMAN appears very uncertain as to the wisdom of this enterprise, but he's drawn on by his companion's adventurous curiosity.
</DIRECTION>
<HERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think this is such a good idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
LAUGHTER is HEARD; the Blond Scout pulls Herman forward toward its source.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The VOICES GROW LOUDER now as the boys get closer to their source. The light of kerosene lanterns dances on the tunnel walls ahead. The boys approach cautiously, careful to stay hidden.
</DIRECTION>
<HERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
This is what they see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOUR MEN digging with shovels and pick-axes. They have broken into one of the pueblo's SECRET CHAMBERS... called "Kivas."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men are ROUGH RIDER (his name describes his dress), ROSCOE (a Bowery Boy bully of 14) and HALFBREED (with straight black hair that cascades over his shoulders).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the fourth man wears a LEATHER WAIST JACKET and BROWN FELT FEDORA HAT. He has his back turned to us, but we would be willing to bet anything that this is INDLANA JONES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
However, when the man turns, and his face is illuminated by the lantern's glow, we are shocked to discover that it is someone else.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We'll call him FEDORA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES END.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TWO BOYS are mesmerized by what they see.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we realize that the Blond Scout is actually young INDIANA JONES.
</DIRECTION>
<FEDORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alfred, did you get anything yet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEDORA>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. Dig in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Two of the men stand and look at ROSCOE who steps forward holding a box in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSCOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I've got something!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSCOE>
<DIRECTION>
Whoops from the other men.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSCOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got something, Garth!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSCOE>
<DIRECTION>
ROSCOE rushes forward and gives FEDORA the box. Fedora steps toward a lantern resting on a rock.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSCOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got something... I got something right here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSCOE>
<DIRECTION>
More whoops from the other men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FEDORA puts the box on the rock next to the lantern. HALFBREED pushes ROSCOE as he jumps with excitement. ROUGH RIDER steps forward to look at the box as Fedora opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSCOE>
<DIRECTION>
(more whoops; then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, look at thatl
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(more whoops)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're richl We're rich!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSCOE>
<HALFBREED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up. Shut up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALFBREED>
<DIRECTION>
FEDORA takes a BEJEWELED CROSS from the box and holds it aloft. Fedora's comrades practically salivate at the sight of it.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSCOE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we're rich, ain't we?l
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSCOE>
<DIRECTION>
INDY takes off his hat and looks down at the o.s. action.
</DIRECTION>
<HERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indy? Indy? What are they doing? Indiana? Indiana?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERMAN>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shhhl
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
FEDORA blows dust from the Cross, turning it in his hand, silently appraising its beauty... and its value. He seems aloof from the others; somehow superior to them.
</DIRECTION>
<HALFBREED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, we got to find more stuff to bring back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALFBREED>
<DIRECTION>
INDY stays hidden, but is astounded by what he sees.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(hushed; urgent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the Cross of Coronadol Cortes gave it to him in 15201
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
FEDORA continues to admire the Cross, then places it on the rock next to its box and the lantern.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY turns back to observe the men.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That Cross is an important artifact. It belongs in a museum.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
A look of resolve comes into INDY's expression, and he turns back toward HERMAN.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run back and find the others. Tell Mister Havelock that there are men looting in the caves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
HERMAN doesn't seem to be listening. Instead, he watches in wide-eyed horror as a SNAKE SLITHERS ACROSS HIS LAP.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have him bring the sheriff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY matter-of-factly picks up the snake and tosses it aside. HERMAN gasps.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's only a snake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY grabs HERMAN's scout scarf and pulls him closer.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you hear what I said?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Run back. Mister Havelock. The Sheriff. What, what are you gonna do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERMAN>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know... I'll think of something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY releases the scarf, gives HERMAN a pat and Herman dashes off. Indy sees the Cross on the rock next to the lantern. As the Robbers continue to search for additional valuables, Indy is able to work his way unseen to within arm's reach of the Cross...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FEDORA looks over at the men digging in a hole b.g.
</DIRECTION>
<FEDORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dig with your hands.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEDORA>
<DIRECTION>
INDY picks up the Cross.
</DIRECTION>
<FEDORA>
<DIRECTION>
(O . S . )
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not with your mouth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEDORA>
<DIRECTION>
As FEDORA stands watching the other men digging, INDY puts the Cross in his pants and begins to pull himself up a rope hanging nearby. As he climbs, Indy's feet break a wooden beam, attracting the men's attention.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSCOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's got our thing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSCOE>
<HALFBREED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get 'im!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALFBREED>
<DIRECTION>
The three Robbers are so eager to get their hands on INDY, they almost knock each other over in the attempt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only FEDORA is unperturbed. He casts a disgusted glance in the direction of his fleeing companions—then sets off after INDY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE CLIFFS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY EMERGES from the darkness of the Pueblo into the brightness of day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pauses—squints—shields his eyes—looks in all directions.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister Havelock! Anybody Everybody's lost but me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
He hears RUNNING FOOTSTEPS BEHIND HIM and dashes off. ROUGH RIDER, HALFBREED, and ROSCOE are quick to appear and run after him.
</DIRECTION>
<FEDORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There he isl
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEDORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	MEN
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(AD-LIBS) Let's go! Let's get him! Let's go!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy jumps from one rock to another; the SCOUT TROOP HORSES are below. Indy puts two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES for his horse, who trots over. Indy puts the Cross in his belt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY PREPARES TO JUMP into the saddle. Hesitates. Then... he JUMPS. But the horse moves exactly at the wrong moment and Indy lands flat on his feet in a standing position. The impact sends a shock wave up his body that rattles his back teeth. Indy stands up and successfully mounts his horse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FEDORA AND HIS MEN ARRIVE at the roof's edge in time to see INDY climb into the saddle and gallop off.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hyahl Hyah!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<ROSCOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Come back here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSCOE>
<DIRECTION>
FEDORA puts two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES... and A VINTAGE TRUCK AND AUTOMOBILE come ROARING OUT from behind the Pueblo (Driven by two more gang members). Now we glimpse...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The passenger in the car. His face is concealed by the hat's wide brim. His arm is out the window, however, and we see an olive-colored hand protruding from the sleeve of an expensive white linen suit. He gestures to the Robbers, now in the truck.
</DIRECTION>
<PANAMA_HAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. Get him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANAMA_HAT>
<DIRECTION>
INDY SPURS his mount on to greater speeds but the autos not only keep pace with his horse... they begin to squeeze in on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Speeding Autos. Thundering hooves. Rushing wind. Flying dust. INDY crouched low and leaning forward in the saddle, his heart pounding, his adrenalin pumping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY VEERS OFF in a new direction—toward a RAILROAD TRACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A CIRCUS TRAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train is barreling down the track. INDY rides up beside it. He glances over his shoulder and sees the car and truck gaining on him. No other choice... he LEAPS FROM HORSE TO TRAIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He clings to the side of a BOXCAR, as HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER leap from the truck onto the train.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HALFBREED tries to grab INDY, but Indy leaps onto another boxcar. Halfbreed runs after him but Indy leaps from the boxcar onto some covered boxes stacked on a flatcar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY loses his balance but regains it. With HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER still running after him, Indy enters the trap door of...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE REPTILE CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and finds himself CRAWLING on a CATWALK suspended from the car's ceiling. Several feet below are NUMEROUS VATS containing all manner of reptiles: Alligators, crocodiles, giant lizards, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, HALFBREED ENTERS through the trap door—followed by ROUGH RIDER. Halfbreed grabs hold of INDY's feet, but Indy kicks at him and he loses his grasp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY crawls away, toward an opening on the opposite side. HALFBREED grabs at Indy's feet again; Indy rolls away and we SEE large bins of squirming snakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The combined weight of the three people is more than the catwalk was intended for, and the BOLTS BEGIN TO RIP FROM THE CEILING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone holds their breath, afraid to make another move. Too late. SEVERAL BOLTS TEAR FREE. HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER SCREAM... but it's Indy's end of the catwalk that DROPS DOWN... PLUNGING INDY to the floor of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lands hard, with a SPLASH into a vat of water... where he finds himself eye- to-eye with an—
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ENORMOUS ANACONDA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The head of this snake is so damn big, it looks more like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY jumps back in horror... only to land with a SQUISH into the SNAKE VAT.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... Oh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
Hundreds of slippery, squirming snakes. INDY sinks into them. They cover him. Engulf him. Almost smother him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY jumps out of the side of the vat, freeing himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY locates a clean-out door at the bottom of the car and uses it to escape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HALFBREED, meanwhile, tries to open the closed window of the car. He groans. ROUGH RIDER moves to assist him.
</DIRECTION>
<ROUGH_RIDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, let me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROUGH_RIDER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE TRAIN- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY stops, checks to see the Cross still lodged in his belt. Suddenly he looks worried as he frantically reaches into his shirt, REMOVES A SNAKE FROM and tosses it away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROSCOE APPEARS atop the reptile car and manages to grab INDY. Indy kicks at him. Roscoe grabs onto the side of the reptile car as Indy moves on to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A FLATCAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY climbs over canvas-covered circus equipment. ROSCOE follows, grabbing a long stick with a hook on it. He reaches forward and trips Indy, who falls onto the roof of the rhino boxcar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as a lamp falls from the ceiling with the impact of Indy's fall, hitting a HUGE BLACK RHINOCEROS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROSCOE grabs INDY by the ankle and yanks him off his feet. The two struggle, rolling from side to side, coming perilously close to rolling right off the edge. Things get even more serious when Roscoe PULLS A KNIFE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BOXCAR BELOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... THE FEROCIOUS BLACK RHINO is becoming extremely agitated by the commotion going on atop his cage. Finally, he raises his head and THRUSTS HIS HORN THROUGH THE ROOF.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO THE ROOFTOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the horn SMASHES through the wood only inches from INDY's head. Indy and Roscoe stare at the horn in amazement as they continue to struggle. SMASH! The horn comes up again—RIGHT BETWEEN INDY'S LEGS.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy smokes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY kicks ROSCOE away. Roscoe rolls to the edge of the car but keeps from falling. Indy flips over onto his stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE REPTILE CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WOODEN TRAP DOOR EXPLODES as a BULLET is FIRED from within. The door is pushed open and HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER hurry out of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE RHINO BOXCAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY gets to his feet—looks ahead—sees a WATER TANK alongside the track directly up ahead. Indy gets an idea...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In an instant, he calculates his approach—times the distance—and LEAPS for the tank's WATER SPOUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He catches it perfectly... but his velocity causes the water spout to ROTATE A FULL 360 DEGREES. With INDY hanging on, feet kicking, the water spout deposits him back on the train, onto the ROOF OF A STOCKCAR, where he looks up to see FEDORA walking toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<FEDORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, kid. There's no way out of this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEDORA>
<DIRECTION>
As INDY edges away from FEDORA, a portion of the STOCKCAR'S ROOF COLLAPSES and Indy FALLS THROUGH into the car below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE STOCKCAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY CRASHES down from above. Dust rises.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ohhh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY's eyes take a moment to adjust to the dark. A bit of sunlight leaks in through the cracks between the boards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then INDY sees it. At the far end of the boxcar. Rising slowly to its feet... an AFRICAN LION. The Lion ROARS. The boxcar walls shake. Indy gasps. Dust swirls up into the shafts of sunlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And INDY has one more surprise in store: The Cross of Cortes has been dislodged from his belt during the fall...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY glances around, sees a coiled LION TAMER'S WHIP hanging on a nail. He carefully takes it down by the handle. The Lion sees this and GROWLS SOFTLY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY swallows hard and gives the whip a try. It unravels awkwardly, its TIP flying back and HITTING INDY IN THE FACE... CUTTING his chin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Lion GROWLS LOUDER. Indy quickly gathers up the whip, wets his lips, and tries again. This time—success! The WHIP CRACKS SHARPLY. The Lion BELLOWS and SWATS the air... and steps back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY looks amazed and delighted. He CRACKS the whip again. The Lion backs away even more. Indy inches forward—bends down (never taking his eyes off the Lion)—picks up the Cross—and steps back again, sweat pouring down his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But now... how to get out?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up at the opening through which he fell and sees FEDORA LOOKING DOWN AT HIM. Fedora extends his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<FEDORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Toss up the whip.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEDORA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ROOFTOP OF STOCKCAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FEDORA, assisted by HALFBREED and ROUGH RIDER, "reels" INDY out of the Stockcar as the Lion ROARS and lunges and Indy screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men, including ROSCOE, pull INDY through the hole in the roof. He stands to face them as ROUGH RIDER points a gun in his direction.
</DIRECTION>
<FEDORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got heart, kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicates Cross)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that belongs to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEDORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	INDY
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(takes Cross from his belt) It belongs to Coronado.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	FEDORA
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coronado is dead. And so are all his grandchildren.
	</DIALOGUE>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This should be in a museum.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<ROSCOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now give me thatl
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSCOE>
<DIRECTION>
ROSCOE makes a grab for the Cross—but INDY doesn't let go. A tug-of-war ensues until a SNAKE WIGGLES OUT FROM INDY'S SHIRTSLEEVE and WRAPS AROUND Roscoe's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROSCOE SCREAMS BLOODY MURDER—releases his grip on the Cross and tries to shake off the snake. This is all the opportunity Indy needs. He LEAPS ONTO THE NEXT CAR.
</DIRECTION>
<FEDORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't let him get awayl
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEDORA>
<DIRECTION>
INDY swings down to the caboose. He sees a sign above the caboose door reading "DR. FANTASY'S MAGIC CABOOSE."
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Magic?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
He glances back at the men and quickly opens the door to the caboose, stepping inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FEDORA puts out his arm, gesturing for the others not to follow INDY.
</DIRECTION>
<FEDORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold it. Make sure he doesn't double back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEDORA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CABOOSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
which contains the circus MAGIC EQUIPMENT. INDY rushes to the rear door of the caboose but can't open it. He hears FEDORA coming, and dives into a MAGIC BOX.
</DIRECTION>
<FEDORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, kid. out of the box. Now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEDORA>
<DIRECTION>
FEDORA smiles confidently and advances toward the box. The box unexpectedly collapses; all four sides flop away... revealing NOTHING. INDY has completely vanished.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FEDORA is mystified, frustrated and angered. Then he feels a breeze at his back. He turns and discovers that the caboose door is open. He rushes out onto the balcony and sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY RUNNING along the tracks, turning up a street of modest clapboard houses.
</DIRECTION>
<FEDORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEDORA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - SMALL TOWN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as INDY runs from the railroad tracks and approaches his house we see the name "JONES" painted on the mailbox.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY bursts through the front door holding the Cross in his hand. A Husky BARKS as Indy runs past in search of his father.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE STUDY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY charges in. The study is cluttered with books. Pictures, charts and maps clearly reflect the father's passion for Medieval studies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PROFESSOR HENRY JONES is absorbed at his desk. In fact, he is studying a very ancient parchment volume which lies open on the desk. The page shows a beautifully illuminated picture of what might be a stained-glass window. The sketch incorporates a series of Roman numerals. The Professor is not just studying it, he is copying it into his own notebook.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We never get to see the PROFESSOR's face in this scene. So INDY CHARGES IN.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's important!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then wait—count to twenty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Dad. You listen to me—
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(now he shouts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Junior!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
No question who is the boss here. INDY gulps, his look says "What am I going to do with this guy?" And obeys— starts counting, VERY, VERY FAINTLY.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One, two, three, four...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
Now we see what HENRY is concentrating on. We see his hand sketching; then, he holds up one finger.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In Greek.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY's reaction:
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(louder, in Greek)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One... two... three... four...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
An ancient car is heard arriving. Perhaps INDY glimpses it going past the window. Anyway, it stops outside the house. Two men sit in the front seat. HERMAN sits in the rear, BLOWING A TRUMPET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY's reaction: Trouble!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY is just finishing the sketch.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May he who illuminated this... illuminate me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE FRONT ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The study door is just closing, INDY closing it behind him... just as HERMAN comes through the front door, still playing the trumpet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY reaches for the trumpet, pulling it from HERMAN's mouth. Herman continues to spit—right into Indy's face. Indy flinches.
</DIRECTION>
<HERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I brought the Sheriff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
HERMAN means the SHERIFF, who now enters the house.

<DIRECTION>
INDY shows the CROSS, more or less handing it to the SHERIFF to make his point. The Sheriff takes it casually.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad to see that... because the rightful owner of this Cross won't press charges, if you give it back.

<DIRECTION>
FEDORA enters the house, followed by ROSCOE, ROUGH RIDER and HALFBREED. He politely removes his hat and holds it in his hand. He nods at INDY in a friendly manner.

<SHERIFF>

	He's got witnesses, five or six of them.

As ROSCOE runs outside INDY sees—through the screen door—the MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT waiting patiently beside the car that is parked out front. Roscoe approaches and gives the Man the Cross—the Man hands Roscoe some money in exchange.

<DIRECTION>
The SHERIFF tips his hat and leaves.

<SHERIFF>

FEDORA remains behind for a moment. He turns and speaks to INDY in an ironic man-to-man way.

Then, FEDORA takes off his hat and takes a step towards INDY. He holds the hat by the crown, and puts it on Indy's head, a show of respect and admiration for the boy. The hat blocks Indy's face.

THE DECK OF A PORTUGUESE CARGO SHIP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's NIGHT. RAIN POURS down. We're in the middle of a violent STORM AT SEA. Thirty-foot waves crash across the deck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TWO PORTUGUESE SAILORS (who have Indy's arms pinned behind his back) propel INDY across the deck toward the rail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they pass a BUNDLE OF FUEL DRUMS, INDY uses the Two Sailors as leverage to KICK UP HIS FEET and break open the CLAMP on the metal bands that hold the drums together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY jabs his elbows into the stomachs of the startled Sailors and rushes toward the MAN IN THE PANAMA HAT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PANAMA HAT sees INDY coming and hurries toward the ladder that leads up to the bridge. Indy withstands the force of waves crashing on the deck and makes his way to where Panama Hat is climbing the ladder. He pulls him off the ladder from behind the two men fall down on the deck. Indy takes the cross back from Panama Hat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sailor delivers a powerful blow to Indy's face, sending the cross flying out of his grip and skittering across the deck. Indy grabs a crowbar and fends off two sailors who attack him from the sides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY sees that the Cross is about to be swept overboard. He lunges for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He SNATCHES UP the Cross only to be knocked down to the deck by a giant wave. He struggles to his feet, managing to avoid the giant fuel drums sliding across the deck around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEVERAL MORE DRUMS come INDY's way. He sidesteps them all.
</DIRECTION>
<PANAMA_HAT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grab him, he's getting away! Grab him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANAMA_HAT>
<DIRECTION>
Indy turns around and pummels two sailors with one punch. Indy sees a large Stevedore's hook above him and he climbs up on crates to reach it. He grabs a hold of the hook and uses it to swing all the way across the deck, narrowly avoiding a huge wave behind him. He jumps into the rollicking ocean, still holding onto the cross. On the ship, a giant fuel drum rolls wildly, falling directly onto a crate of TNT. The crate explodes, causing the entire ship to blow, sending an enormous orange fireball into the sky.

INDY BOBS UP

in the water amid the debris, holding the Cross in his hand. He grabs for something to keep him afloat. It turns out to be one of the ship's LIFE PRESERVERS. INDY loops his arm through the preserver.

Only now do we see the FADED LETTERING on the preserver revealing the destroyed ship's name and city of port:

INDY is ushered into a large Art Deco apartment and left alone. Numerous museum-quality artifacts are displayed around the room. Indy takes this opportunity to examine them.

After a moment, WALTER DONOVAN enters from across the room. During the brief time that the door is open, we HEAR a COCKTAIL PARTY going on in the next room: VOICES and SOFT PIANO MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DONOVAN strides across the room toward INDY. Although in his late fifties, Donovan has the broad shoulders and trim physique of a much younger man. Dressed in a tuxedo, he exudes both confidence and power.

	I trust your trip down was comfortable, Doctor Jones. My men didn't alarm you, I hope.

DONOVAN goes to a table where an object is wrapped in cloth. He throws back the cloth revealing a flat STONE TABLET—about two feet square, inscribed with letters and symbols.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY looks impressed. He puts on his glasses to make a closer examination.

	Well, it's sandstone. Christian symbol. Early Latin text. Mid- Twelfth Century, I should think.

	Grail lore is his hobby. He's a teacher of Medieval Literature. The one the students hope they don't get.

He leans over and kisses her cheek. MRS. DONOVAN sighs to herself and returns to the party. INDY, meanwhile, has turned his attention back to the Grail Tablet, obviously hooked by its archaeological promise. He moistens his finger with champagne and rubs it over the tablet. DONOVAN steps up next to Indy.

	Hard to resist, isn't it? The Holy Grail's final resting place described in detail!

	What good is it? This Grail Tablet speaks of deserts and mountains and canyons. Pretty vague. Where do you start looking? Maybe if the Tablet were intact, you'd have something to go on. But the entire top portion is missing.

	Just the same, an attempt to recover the Grail is currently underway.

INDY has to shake his head at DONOVAN's apparent lack of judgment.
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me tell you another "bedtime story, " Doctor Jones. After the Grail was entrusted to Joseph of Arimathaea, it disappeared and was lost for a thousand years before it was found again by three Knights of the First Crusade. Three brothers, to be exact.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've heard this one as well. Two of these brothers walked out of the desert one hundred and fifty years after having found the Grail and began the long journey back to France. But only one of them made it. And before dying of extreme old age, he supposedly imparted his tale to a—to a Franciscan friar, I think.

DONOVAN produces an ANCIENT LEATHER-BOUND VOLUME with very brittle pages. INDY views the manuscript with considerable interest.
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the manuscript in which the friar chronicled the Knight's story... it doesn't reveal on location of the Grail, I'm afraid... but the Knight promised that two "markers" that had been left behind would.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicates the Tablet)

As INDY asks the question, he turns to a PAINTING on the wall: A depiction of Christ on the Cross, his blood being captured in a golden chalice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SECOND PAINTING on the wall shows Eleventh Century Crusaders plummeting to their deaths over a high cliff. One Crusader, however, floats safely in midair because he holds the Grail in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you believe the Grail actually exists?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The search for the Cup of Christ is the search for the divine in all of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
BRODY sees that INDY is unsatisfied by this response.
</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But if you want facts, Indy, I have none to give you. At my age, I'm prepared to take a few things on faith.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call Donovan, Marcus. Tell him I'll take that ticket to Venice now.

EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LIMO is parked beside a PRIVATE AIRLINER that bears the DONOVAN CORPORATE LOGO. BRODY peers inside to DONOVAN and INDY.

<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, well. That's good. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
BRODY and DONOVAN shake hands. INDY steps from the back seat of the limo. He turns back to Donovan and shakes his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doctor Jones. Good luck. Be very careful. Don't trust anvbody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AIRLINER - FLYING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY opens the Grail Diary and thoughtfully turns through the pages. He stops at one page and glances at a PENCIL SKETCH of what might be a stained-glass window. Below the sketch is a SERIES OF NUMBERS.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. VENICE - BOAT LANDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY and BRODY disembark from the Water Bus onto the Boat Landing as other Gondoliers steer their boats in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, Venice...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Uh, how will we recognize this Doctor Schneider when we see him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Maybe he'll know us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a WOMAN comes up to him. Attractive features. Blonde hair. Eyes that are bright and intelligent.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doctor Jones?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew it was you—
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him with an appraising expression that is brazenly flirtatious.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	—you have your father's eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
INDY is instantly attracted to her.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And my mother's ears. But the rest belongs to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like the best parts have already been spoken for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
INDY grins, enjoying the repartee. The WOMAN turns to BRODY, who tips his hat.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marcus Brody?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
The Woman, DR. ELSA SCHNEIDER, extends her hand to BRODY.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
(introducing herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doctor Elsa Schneider.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
INDY's grin fades. BRODY registers a look of surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh... how do you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<CUT_TO>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VENICE CANAL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY, BRODY and ELSA walk along the narrow canal, lined with buildings on either side.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The last time I saw your father we were in the library. He was very close to tracking down the Knight's Tomb. I've never seen him so excited. He was as giddy as a schoolboy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who? Attila the Professor? He was never giddy, even when he was a schoolboy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY can't take his eyes off ELSA. Perhaps he's feeling a bit like a schoolboy himself right now. As they cross over a bridge to the opposite side of the canal, Indy steals a flower from a street vendor. He holds it out to Elsa.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fraulein—will you permit me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I usually don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I usually don't either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In that case, I permit you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
INDY gives her the flower.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would make me very happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm already sad—by tomorrow it will have faded.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tomorrow I'll steal you another.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<BRODY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate to interrupt you—but the reason we're here—
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I have something to show you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
She hands a slip of paper to INDY.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I left your father working in the library. He sent me to the map section to fetch an ancient plan of the city. When I got back to his table—he'd gone—with all his papers—except for that scrap which I found near his chair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
INDY extends the scrap of paper to BRODY.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roman numerals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VENICE PIAZZA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA leads INDY and BRODY into the large piazza. People walk about and sit at tables in front of a large building.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here is the library.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
They have arrived at the front steps of the library.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That doesn't look much like a library.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It looks like a converted church.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA leads the way inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LIBRARY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY, BRODY and ELSA enter, their heels CLICKING across the marble floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We notice, along with INDY and BRODY, that the library contains many stained- glass windows.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In this case it's the literal truth. We're on holy ground. These columns over here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
She indicates FOUR HUGE MARBLE COLUMNS that go from floor to ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... were brought back as spoils of war after the sacking of Byzantium during the Crusades.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
INDY glances at the Columns, then notices a Stained-Glass Window that depicts a Knight of the Crusades. Indy lingers for a moment in front of the window.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now please excuse me. The library's closing in a few moments. I'll arrange for us to stay a little longer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
The minute ELSA is out of earshot.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marcus—I've seen this window before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY whips out the Grail Diary and opens it to the sketch he noticed in the airplane.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right here. In Dad's Diary. You see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
BRODY glances at the Diary, then at the window—noticing that the Roman numerals in question have been worked into the window's design.
</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Indy. The Roman numerals!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad was onto something here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, now we know the source of the numbers, but we still don't know what they mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY and BRODY now see ELSA approaching. Indy quickly tucks the Diary back into his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(explaining to Brody)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My dad sent me this Diary for a reason. Until we find out why, I suggest we keep it to ourselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Find something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
INDY doesn't reply. He's looking in five directions at once. His eyes moving across the walls and ceilings—charged with the thrill of discovery.
</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
(to ELSA)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, yes. Three, seven and tent That window seems to be the source of the Roman numerals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God, I must be blind
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad wasn't looking for a book about the Knight's Tomb... he was looking for the Tomb itself
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA wears a blank expression.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you get it? The Tomb is somewhere in the library! You said yourself it used to be a church! Look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY's eyes travel up one of the four huge marble columns.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY looks again to the stained-glass window. He points.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY has discovered that each Column is numbered with a Roman Numeral. Indy hurries away toward Column VII. All BRODY and ELSA can do now is try to keep up with him.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
He points again to the stained-glass window.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seven... Ten.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down to the scrap of paper in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And ten. Now where's the ten? Look around for the ten.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY walks past aisles of book-lined shelves. He stops, turns, then looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three, seven and ten.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
He climbs a spiral staircase leading up to a LOFT and looks down at BRODY and ELSA. The floor beneath their feet is an elaborate tile design containing a huge "X"—visible only from this higher angle.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(wryly; to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"X" marks the spot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY rushes down the staircase and goes to the CENTER TILE where the two sides of the X intersect. He blows dust away from the tile and tries to pry it up, but cannot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY rushes past BRODY to a cordon held in place by a brass stand underneath the stained-glass window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY raises the brass stand and timing his actions, hits the tile precisely as the Librarian stamps a book. The Librarian regards the stamper curiously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY continues to pound at the tile as the Librarian resumes his stamping, still puzzled by the SOUND ECHOING through the library.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally INDY breaks the tile. As he bends to remove the pieces of broken tile, a TWO-FOOT SQUARE HOLE IS REVEALED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cold air and a wet, rancid smell escape from the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bingo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't disappoint, Doctor Jones. You're a great deal like your father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Except he's lost, and I'm not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lower me down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
INDY is impressed with Elsa's spirit, and cooperates agreeably—holding her by the hands and lowering her into the hole. When her feet finally touch ground below, Indy releases his grip on her and slips the Grail Diary to BRODY.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look after this for me, will you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
Then INDY disappears into the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CATACOMBS BELOW LIBRARY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY jumps down a steep step. He reaches back to help ELSA.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY and ELSA glance around. This is really a horrid place. Dark and dank. foul smelling. Elsa turns. She removes a cigarette lighter with a unique ivory four-leaf clover design.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY and ELSA inspect markings carved onto the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pagan symbols. Fourth or Fifth Century.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Six hundred years before the Crusades.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Christians would have dug their own passages and burial chambers centuries later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
INDY takes the lighter from her and lights their way down a dark passageway.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. If there's a Knight of the First Crusade entombed down here, that's where we'll find him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIBRARY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREE MEN carrying guns make their way down the spiral staircase toward an unsuspecting BRODY. One of the Men, KAZIM, raises his gun and brings it down hard on Brody's head.
</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ohhhh. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
KAZIM gestures with his gun toward the now-unconscious BRODY. The other two men take Brody's hands and drag him into one of the book-lined aisles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DECOMPOSING CORPSES rest in niches carved into the stone walls. Grotesque skeletal remains with rotting linen stretched across blackened bones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY holds the lighter up as he and ELSA inspect symbols carved into the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA spots a symbol cut into the wall that she doesn't recognize. As she blows away some cobwebs:
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
INDY only has to give it a quick glance to know.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Ark of the Covenant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(deadpan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY holds the lighter up and he and ELSA enter another dark passageway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY steps to the wall and runs his hand over the stone. He scrapes the cobwebs away to reveal the ROMAN NUMERAL "X."
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA now holds the lighter as INDY rams his shoulder into the wall. The wall collapses on impact and Indy falls through into another room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ROOM - THE CATACOMBS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as INDY falls through the hole in the wall onto rocks surrounded by bubbling, green, slimy liquid. More skeletons surround him, resting in their carved niches. ELSA holds the lighter as she peers in at him through the hole in the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Petroleum. I could sink a well down here and retire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY reaches up and tears a piece of cloth from one of the skeletons, which breaks apart and falls into the oil-slick water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY uses the scrap of cloth and a bone to fashion a crude torch, which he then dips into the oily water.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me the lighter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Using the cloth-wrapped bone torch to guide their way, INDY and ELSA come upon a NARROW PASSAGEWAY. The water is knee-deep and TEEMING WITH RATS. Thousands of them Crawling on one another's backs. SQUEALING. Squirming. Thrashing in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, rats...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA gasps as the rats scamper between her legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY moves forward through the rat-infested water as ELSA follows, still gasping in horror. Suddenly he slips into a hole. Recovering his balance, he reaches out to Elsa.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come onl
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
She gasps once again, terrified. INDY lifts her and carries ELSA as he moves forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CATACOMBS - THE HOLE IN THE WALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAZIM and his men step to the opening Indy made earlier and shine their flashlights through to the rat-infested water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER PART OF THE CATACOMBS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More rat-infested water as ELSA, now walking again, follows INDY through another passageway lined with skulls and bones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY reaches for a wall to steady himself and inadvertently grabs a skeleton. A bone comes loose in his hand as rats scurry about and leap at him from all directions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a moment to compose himself, then steps across the water to ELSA's side. He steps into the water, then reaches up to help Elsa do the same.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
LARGE BURIAL CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chamber is flooded with black, briny water.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
In the center of the chamber, jutting up above the water, is what amounts to an "island altar" on which SEVERAL ANCIENT COFFINS rest. They move toward the altar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY and ELSA begin to inspect the ornately carved COFFINS like the scholars of antiquity that they are. These are big oak caskets held together by straps of etched brass.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It must be one of these...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at the artistry of these carvings and the scrollwork.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
One coffin is elevated above the others.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's this one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
Together they begin to push on the lid—STRAINING and GROANING until it slides away and BANGS against the stone platform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE COFFIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lie the DECOMPOSED REMAINS of a KNIGHT IN ARMOR. INDY and ELSA look in...Elsa gasps.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is itl we found it! Look— the engraving on the Shield. It's the same as on the Grail Tablets The Shield is the Second Marker!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY unfolds a piece of paper and holds it over the shield.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a rubbing Dad made of the Grail Tablet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
The missing portion of the rubbing is completed by the shield.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just like your father—giddy as a schoolboy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
INDY laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wouldn't it be wonderful if he were here now to see this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(chuckles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He never would have made it past the rats! He hates rats! He's scared to death of them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - A HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it lights a match.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK TO REVEAL KAZIM dropping the lighted match into the oil-slick water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY AND ELSA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA holds the torch. INDY looks around. Listens. Something is wrong. And then he sees the GLOW OF FIRELIGHT dancing across the Catacomb walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is followed by THOUSANDS OF RATS FLEEING from around the corner of the Narrow Passageway, STAMPEDING toward ELSA and INDY—SHRIEKING and SQUEALING as they approach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rats literally wash over them—like a rodent tidal wave—in their efforts to escape a:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HUGE ORANGE BALL OF FIRE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROARING around the corner hurtling towards them—feeding on the oil slick; consuming the oxygen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get back! Back against the wall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY braces his back against the altar and TOPPLES THE COFFIN with his feet. It CRASHES against the stone platform and SPLASHES into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quick! Under it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
They jump into the water beside the bobbing, overturned coffin.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Air pocket!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA hesitates. INDY literally DUNKS her and pushes her underneath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDER THE COFFIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA surfaces into the air pocket created by the coffin, SPUTTERING and SPITTING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now INDY pops up into the air pocket. He looks at ELSA—they are both soaking wet.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't wander off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
INDY disappears under the water and swims out from under the coffin.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
UNDER THE WATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY swims, looking for an escape route.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDER THE COFFIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rats are beginning to force their way inside, swimming through the water and climbing on ELSA, who squirms and screams in terror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY pops back up through the water.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I've found a way out. Deep breath.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA groans. They take a deep breath and both dive under the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VENICE PIAZZA - OUTDOOR CAFE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The perfect picture postcard—St. Mark's Square and the Grand Canal beyond. Cafe customers are startled to see INDY and ELSA climb out of the sewer, wet and smelly. Indy looks around at the postcard-perfect setting and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(wryly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, Venicel
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
Indy's delight, however, is short-lived since KAZIM and TWO OTHER TURKISH AGENTS are running towards them with drawn guns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs ELSA by the hand and the two of them run down the dock and LEAP INTO A MOTORBOAT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE MOTORBOAT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY fires up the engine and pulls away from the dock... but not before a Turkish Agent JUMPS in with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA grabs the wheel and begins to steer the boat while INDY and the Turk trade punches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE HARBOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy's Speedboat BOUNCES across the choppy waters heading in the direction of the DOCKED STEAMSHIP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAZIM and his men rush to TWO MORE SPEEDBOATS tied to the dock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They chase after INDY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY grapples with the Turkish Agent. As Indy grips his arms, we SEE a GUN in the Agent's hand. It FIRES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As INDY fights with the Turk, he becomes aware of the Speedboats behind him and two enormous Freighters ahead of him, joined together by two giant ropes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY, having gained the advantage, leans on top of the Turkish Agent.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(to ELSA)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you crazy?! You don't go between them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA can barely hear INDY over the noise of the motor.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go between them? Are you crazy?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
INDY finally delivers the punch that sends the Turkish Agent flying overboard. Turning, Indy sees that ELSA has committed the speedboat to a course BETWEEN the two Freighters, now being pushed even closer together by a Tugboat.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said go around!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said go between them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said don't go between them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
It's purely academic at this point since the hulls of the the two Freighters loom up on either side of them like cavern walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FULL SHOT - THE HARBOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One Enemy Speedboat chases INDY between the two Freighters. But the Speedboat containing KAZIM veers off and goes around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BETWEEN THE TWO FREIGHTERS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a race for daylight as the two Freighters drift ever closer to one another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy's Speedboat just manages to squeeze through the gap. But the Enemy Speedboat EXPLODES as it is crushed between the two Freighters, FLYING INTO THE AIR and SPLASHING back down into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY AND ELSA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
spin their boat around in a sharp half-circle to see KAZIM'S SPEEDBOAT appear racing toward them. He stands in the moving boat, FIRING A MACHINE GUN at INDY and ELSA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAZIM'S SPEEDBOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
matches Indy's move for move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - THE HARBOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two boats race across the water nearly side-by-side. A CHATTERING MACHINE GUN from Kazim's boat SPLINTERS the wood of Indy's boat, until finally the rear of the boat CATCHES ON FIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The machine gun runs out of ammunition. KAZIM puts it down and takes control of the wheel from one of the Turkish Agents in the boat with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Indy's boat drifts toward the GIANT, TURNING PROPELLERS at the STERN of ANOTHER STEAMER, Kazim's boat draws up alongside and hits them. INDY steps into Kazim's boat. He knocks one of the Turkish Agents to the deck, then turns his attention to KAZIM. The two men trade punches as the boat spins helplessly in the churning water.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
INDY kicks KAZIM in the face, knocking him into the water, then pulls him back into the boat, now being SUCKED THROUGH THE CHURNING WATER toward the Steamer's giant propeller blades.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you trying to kill us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<KAZIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because you're looking for the Holy Grail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAZIM>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father was looking for the Holy Grail. Did you kill him too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<KAZIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAZIM>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is he? Talk—or you're dead. Damn it, tell me! Tell me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<KAZIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you don't let go, Doctor Jones, we'll both die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAZIM>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then we'll die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<KAZIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My soul is prepared. How's yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAZIM>
<DIRECTION>
By now half the boat has been chopped up into matchwood and the blades are getting closer.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is your last chance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<KAZIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Doctor Jones. It's yours!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAZIM>
<DIRECTION>
The wind of the blades is on their necks. INDY grabs KAZIM just in time and jumps... into the motorboat, driven by ELSA, which gets alongside in the nick of time.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right! Where's my father
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<KAZIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you let me go, I will tell you where he is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAZIM>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<KAZIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Kazim.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAZIM>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And why were you trying to kill me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<KAZIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The secret of the Grail has been safe for a thousand years. And for all that time the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword has been prepared to do anything to keep it safe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAZIM>
<DIRECTION>
KAZIM pulls back his shirt to reveal a birthmark... or is it a tattoo? Whatever it is, it's a cruciform sword; a Christian cross which tapers down, like the blades of a broadsword.
</DIRECTION>
<KAZIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me get off at this jetty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAZIM>
<DIRECTION>
The boat is close to the edge of the canal. INDY gives ELSA a nod, telling her to bring the boat in. KAZIM steps ashore.
</DIRECTION>
<KAZIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ask yourself, why do you seek the Cup of Christ? Is it for His glory, or for yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAZIM>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't come for the Cup of Christ. I came to find my father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<KAZIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In that case, God be with you in your quest. Your father is being held in the Castle of Brunwald on the Austrian-German border.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAZIM>
<DIRECTION>
KAZIM walks away.

CLOSE ON THE WATER-SOAKED PAPER IMPRESSION: The rubbing taken from the shield of the Grail Knight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRODY is giving it careful study while he dabs the lump on the back of his head with an ice pack.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's the head?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's better, now I've seen this. It's the name of a city. "Alexandretta?" Hmmm...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY, wearing a bathrobe, leans over to study the impression.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Knights of the First Crusade laid siege to the city of Alexandretta for over a year. The entire city was destroyed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
BRODY lowers the ice pack from his head and looks at INDY.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The present city of Iskenderun is built on its ruins. Marcus— you remember what the Grail Tablet said. "Across the desert and through the mountain to the Canyon of the Crescent Moon."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But where exactly?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your father would know. Your father did know. Look. He made a map.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
BRODY picks up the Grail Diary.
</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He must have pieced it together from clues scattered through the whole history of the Grail Quest. A map with no names.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT: A PENCIL-DRAWN MAP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It covers two pages of the Diary. BRODY's finger moves across it.
</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, he knew there was a city with an oasis due east. Here. He knew the course turned south through the desert to a river, and the river led into the mountains. Here. Straight to the canyon. He knew everything except where to begin, the name of the city.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(solemnly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alexandretta. Now we know.

</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY approaches another door (Elsa's bedroom) and knocks.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>

He goes in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELSA'S BEDROOM - DAY

<DIRECTION>
... and finds that Elsa's bedroom is in a similar ransacked state to his own. The room is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is worried for her, knocks and calls out:
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elsa?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
He steps into the room and knocks upon the bathroom door.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the bathroom door, peering inside.

<DIRECTION>
INT. ELSA'S BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
INT. ELSA'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA joins INDY, waiting in the ransacked room. she looks around in shock.

</ELSA>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mine, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What were they looking for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
She looks to INDY, who pulls the Grail Diary from his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Grail Diary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had it? You didn't trust me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
She looks hurt and beautiful. She comes closer to him.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't know you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
She's awfully hard to resist.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least I let you tag along.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes. Give them a flower and they'll follow you anywhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Knock it off. You're not mad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You like the way I do things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's lucky I don't do things the same way. You'd still be standing at the Venice pier.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
She stomps her foot angrily. INDY flinches. She starts to walk away but Indy grabs her.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, what do you think is going on here? Since I've met you, I've nearly been incinerated, drowned, shot at, and chopped into fish bait. We're caught in the middle of something sinister here. My guess is Dad found out more than he was looking for. And until I'm sure, I'm going to continue to do things the way I think they should be done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls her to him and kisses her.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How dare you kiss me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
Now ELSA reaches for INDY and kisses him.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave me alone. I don't like fast women.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
But he embraces her, and ELSA begins to nibble at his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I hate arrogant men.

	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTLER>
<DIRECTION>
INDY, followed by ELSA, steps inside, shaking the water from his overcoat. He adopts a Scottish accent.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And not before time! Did you intend to leave us standing on the doorstep all day? We're drenched!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
As INDY says this he pushes his way past the startled BUTLER, pulling a handkerchief from the man's pocket. ELSA follows, taking off her coat. INDY SNEEZES HARD.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now look! I've gone and caught a sniffle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you expected?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTLER>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
<BUTLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tapestries?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTLER>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dear me, the man is dense. This is a castle, isn't it? There are tapestries?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<BUTLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a castle. And we have many tapestries. But if you're a Scottish lord, then I am Mickey Mouse.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY and ELSA move cautiously and quietly down the wide, vaulted hallway. APPROACHING VOICES ARE HEARD. Indy and Elsa creep past a room full of NAZI SOLDIERS working around a large table with a map atop it..
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY reacts to the sight of them.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(to ELSA; softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nazis. I hate these guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY and ELSA continue down the hallway. Indy carries a gun in his hand and his whip hangs from his belt. He steps to a closed door and listens.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<ELSA>

</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
INDY points out an ELECTRICAL WIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because it's wired.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
He studies the situation for a moment, then decides to enter one of the other doors. He knocks at the door—there is no response. He looks back at ELSA and enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is dark and empty. INDY throws open the window shutters and looks out. RAIN comes down in sheets. There is a wide ledge beneath each window— but below that is a SHEER DROP. Indy wants to get out onto the window ledge, which is several yards away.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indy? Indy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
INDY reassures her.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry... this is kid's play. I'll be right back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
He leans out the window and wraps his bullwhip around some wires that protrude from the castle wall above the next window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gives the whip a forceful tug to make certain it will hold his weight.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. THE CASTLE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
INDY SWINGS from the window to the stone gargoyle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE WINDOW LEDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PAIR OF WOODEN SHUTTERS seals the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY takes hold of the bullwhip with both hands, pushes off with his feet... swings toward the shuttered window with his feet extended... CRASHING THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS as a CLAP OF THUNDER disguises the noise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY CRASHES THROUGH SHUTTERS AND GLASS into the room. The broken shutters hang by their hinges. Rain and cold air whip through the open window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No sooner does Indy get to his feet, than a VASE COMES CRASHING DOWN ON THE BACK OF HIS HEAD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stunned, INDY sinks to one knee... and Indy's father, PROFESSOR HENRY JONES, steps out of the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Junior?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY gets to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(a reflex)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sirl
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
This reply is a kneejerk reaction on Indy's part. Now they look at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is you Junior!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(an old familiar irritation)

<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>

</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came to get you! What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
NAZI VOICES ARE HEARD approaching. INDY and HENRY press themselves against the wall, Henry still holding the broken vase in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY steps to the window and looks down. HENRY moves to a lamp, holding the vase under the light for a closer look.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Late Fourteenth Century, Ming Dynasty.

	Oh, it breaks the heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>

</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY has clearly been concentrating entirely on the vase... he is examining the broken end carefully.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... it's fake. See, you can tell by the cross section.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY throws the vase against the wall where it SHATTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Dad, get your stuff. We've got to get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I am sorry about your head, though. But I thought you were one of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad, they come in through the doors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY steps to the door and stands, listening.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But better safe than sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY slides his umbrella through the straps of his bag.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Humpf—so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(excited)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Through the library?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew it. And the tomb of Sir Richard?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY nods.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Found it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(breathless)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was actually there? You saw him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what was left of him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(trembling with anticipation)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alexandretta.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a great moment in HENRY's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to INDY with joy.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY winces, and would interrupt but suddenly it's not the moment.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... you did it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If only I could have been with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There were rats, Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rats?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They want my diary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(interested)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY's interest is a moment which becomes important later but for now it passes.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew I had to get that book as far away from me as I possibly could.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY's hand moves unconsciously to his pocket. His eyes turn inward.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(thoughtfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
Then... BAMI The door is kicked open and three NAZIS enter. One is an S.S. OFFICER. The other two are SOLDIERS with machine guns. HENRY and INDY raise their hands.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	S.S. OFFICER
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Doctor Jones!!
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY_INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What book?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY_HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	S.S. OFFICER
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to INDY) You have the Diary in your pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY laughs genuinely, believing himself to be laughing at the expense of the S.S. OFFICER.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You doltl Do you think that my son would be that stupid that he would bring my Diary all the way back here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
At which point an awful thought strikes HENRY.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't, did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't bring it, did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, uh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, can we discuss this later?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should have mailed it to the Marx Brothers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you take it easy....!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it easy?! Why do you think I sent it home in the first place?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(points towards the NAZIS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it wouldn't fall into their hands!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came here to save you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah? And who's gonna come to save you, Junior??
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY's eyes blazes His nostrils flares He's so pissed off, he literally RIPS A MACHINE GUN from the hands of one of the startled soldiers... and for a moment we think he's going to use it on his dad.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you--
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and sprays the room with machine gun fire, cutting all three NAZIS to ribbons and blowing them backwards across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--don't call me Junior!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY looks shocked and horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look what you did!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
Indy grabs him and pushes him ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(aghast)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe what you just....
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASTLE HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY leads HENRY down the hallway as he searches for Elsa.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elsa? Elsa?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
He opens a door and enters:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FIRST CASTLE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY and HENRY rush back into the room where ELSA had been left, only to find: A Nazi COLONEL HOLDING ELSA HOSTAGE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His name is VOGEL: a vicious-looking, lantern jawed brute. One arm is wrapped around Elsa's waist, the other hand presses the muzzle of a LUGER behind her ear.
</DIRECTION>
<VOGEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's far enough Put down the gun, Doctor Jones. Put down the gun or the Fraulein dies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOGEL>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But she's one of them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indy, please!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's a Nazi!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY is thrown. He doesn't know what to do. He looks at ELSA, then back to his father. Everyone is yelling at once:
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trust me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indy, no!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<VOGEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will kill her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOGEL>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah? Go ahead!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Don't Shoot!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Indy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. He won't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indy, please! Do what he says!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And don't listen to her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<VOGEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough! She diesl
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOGEL>
<DIRECTION>
VOGEL jams the barrel of the luger painfully into ELSA's neck. Elsa SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait! Waitl
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
And then Indy gives in. He drops the machine gun to the table and it slides across, SHATTERING GLASS. HENRY GROANS audibly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VOGEL releases his grip on ELSA and shoves her toward INDY. She is propelled directly into his arms. He holds her tightly. She buries her face in his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
INDY comforts her.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, don't be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
Her hand slips into his coat pocket and removes the Grail Diary.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you should have listened to your father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
She steps back next to VOGEL. INDY is stunned. HENRY gives him his most withering look of reprimand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BARONIAL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large baronial room decorated with ancient tapestries and suits of armor. Firelight—from the giant fireplace—dances across the ceiling and walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY and HENRY are ushered in, hands tied behind back, accompanied by VOGEL and ELSA and TWO NAZI GUARDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA crosses the room toward a high-backed chair facing the fireplace. INDY and HENRY do not have the advantage of seeing who is sitting in that chair. They only see a HAND REACH OUT AND TAKE THE BOOK.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly to HENRY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She ransacked her own room and I fell for it. How did you know she was a Nazi?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Umh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you she was a Nazi?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She talks in her sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY nods, and then the statement catches up with him. He looks at HENRY with surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't trust her. Why did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<MAN_IN_CHAIR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because he didn't take my advice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_IN_CHAIR>
<DIRECTION>
The MAN IN THE CHAIR gets to his feet and turns, revealing himself to be... WALTER DONOVAN. INDY and HENRY react with stunned expressions.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Donovan
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't I warn you not to trust anybody, Doctor Jones?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
DONOVAN smiles benignly and flips through the Grail Diary.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I misjudged you Walter—I knew you'd sell your mother for an Etruscan vase. But I didn't know you'd sell your country and your soul to the slime of humanity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly erupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doctor Schneider There're pages torn out of thisl
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA rushes to DONOVAN's side. she takes the Grail Diary from him. Elsa takes a look for herself—then glances up at Indy.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This book contained a map—a map with no names—precise directions from the unknown city to the secret Canyon of the Crescent Moon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are these missing pages? This maps we must have these pages backs
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY gives INDY a look of surprise. Indy smirks.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
(to Donovan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're wasting your breath. He won't tell us. And he doesn't have to... it's perfectly obvious where the pages are...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at Indy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... he's given them to Marcus Brody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY now wears a pained expression.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Indy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marcus?! You didn't drag poor Marcus along, did you? He's not up to the challenge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He sticks out like a sore thumb. We'll find him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The hell you will. He's got a two-day head-start on you, which is more than he needs.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brody's got friends in every town and village from here to the Sudan. He speaks a dozen languages, knows every local custom. He'll blend in. Disappear. You'll never see him again. With any luck, he's got the Grail already.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY looks amazed and impressed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRAIN STATION - CITY OF ISKENDERUN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRODY disembarks from the train along with the other PASSENGERS, a cross- section of ARABS and TUSKS.
</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does anyone here speak English? Or even ancient Greek?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
A Man in the crowd holds out a cup of water to BRODY.
</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No water, no thank you. No, fish make love in it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
BRODY continues through the crowd past various STREET VENDORS. A Woman holds a chicken out to him.
</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you so much. No, I don't like that. No, I really don't want... No, no, thank you very much. No, thank you, madam. I'm a vegetarian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
The Woman walks away, leaving BRODY alone in the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does anyone understand a word I'm saying here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
SALLAH shoulders his way through the mob toward BRODY.
</DIRECTION>
<SALLAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister Brodyl
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLAH>
<DIRECTION>
They meet and hug, then begin to walk.
</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Sallahl What a relief!

</BRODY>
<SALLAH>

<BRODY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<SALLAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are on your own?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLAH>
<DIRECTION>
A Woman runs in and tugs on BRODY's coat. He waves her away.
</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but don't panic. Everything's under control. Have you. . .have you arranged our supplies?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<SALLAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes, of course. But where are we going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLAH>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, this map will show you. It was drawn by, uh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
BRODY searches in his coat pocket for the map as a SINISTER MAN approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<SINISTER_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister Brody?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINISTER_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
BRODY puts the map back in his pocket. The SINISTER MAN clicks his heels and bows quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<SINISTER_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome to Iskenderun. The Director of the Museum of Antiquities has sent a car for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINISTER_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
BRODY takes off his hat.

</SALLAH>
<SINISTER_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</SINISTER_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The man turns and joins a SECOND MAN. BRODY and SALLAH follow them.
</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My reputation precedes me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<SALLAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no museum in Iskenderun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLAH>
<DIRECTION>
The SECOND MAN overhears SALLAH. He and his companion turn quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Papers please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_MAN>
<SALLAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Papers?

<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course.

<DIRECTION>
SALLAH puts Brody's luggage down and glances at BRODY.
</DIRECTION>
<SALLAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLAH>
<DIRECTION>
BRODY does not run. SALLAH pats his clothing, searching for his papers.
</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<SALLAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Papers, sir. Got it here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLAH>
<DIRECTION>
SALLAH laughs and pulls out a newspaper.
</DIRECTION>
<SALLAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just finished reading it myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs; then, to Brody)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLAH>
<DIRECTION>
BRODY looks confused. SALLAH shows the newspaper to the SECOND MAN.
</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</BRODY>
<SALLAH>
	<DIALOGUE>

</SALLAH>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you say...? Uh, uh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
SALLAH puts the newspaper in front of the SECOND MAN's face, then punches him through the newspaper.
</DIRECTION>
<SALLAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLAH>
<DIRECTION>
The SECOND MAN falls, knocking over a vendor's stand. SALLAH and BRODY begin to run. SALLAH knocks the FIRST MAN into another vendor's stand. The STAND COLLAPSES on impact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SALLAH grabs BRODY and pulls him through the crowded streets.
</DIRECTION>
<SALLAH>
<DIRECTION>
(to Brody; pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, okay, quick, quick, quickl Hide in that doorl Hide in that door!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLAH>
<DIRECTION>
SALLAH points to a DARKENED DOORWAY, hung with a curtain, at the top of a ramp. BRODY runs up the ramp, throws back the curtain and disappears into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then—METAL DOORS ARE SLAMMED behind Brody and we realize that he has actually run into the back of a Nazi TROOP TRUCK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SALLAH runs after the Truck until he reaches a wall, then leans against the wall dejectedly as the Truck drives away with BRODY inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is dark. Ancient, floor-length drapes cover the windows. A HUGE FIREPLACE that's nearly large enough for a man to stand upright in dominates one wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The NAZI GUARDS have tied INDY and HENRY back-to-back in a pair of chairs. ELSA and DONOVAN stand over them. VOGEL enters.
</DIRECTION>

</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
He hands her the Grail Diary.
</DIRECTION>
<VOGEL>
<DIRECTION>
(to DONOVAN, meaning Indy and Henry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me kill them now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOGEL>
<ELSA>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to VOGEL, with a helpless shrug)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Always do what the doctor orders.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
DONOVAN leads VOGEL out. The NAZI GUARDS follow. Once they are gone, ELSA turns to INDY.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't look at me like that—we both wanted the Grail, I would have done anything to get it. You would have done the same.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>

INDY shakes his head "no."

<INDY>

She runs her hand down the side of his face. INDY pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY and HENRY are still tied back-to-back of course. ELSA bends to speak quietly into INDY's ear... which is near enough to Henry's ear.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't forget... how wonderful it was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. It was rather wonderful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles and kisses INDY passionately. HENRY glances back and looks rather disappointed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VOGEL appears to remind ELSA of her appointment.
</DIRECTION>
<VOGEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doctor Schneider! Your car is waiting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOGEL>
<ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
(to INDY, after finishing the kiss)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's how Austrians say goodbye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA exits. VOGEL stays behind for another moment.
</DIRECTION>
<VOGEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this is how we say goodbye in Germany, Doctor Jones.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOGEL>
<DIRECTION>
VOGEL punches INDY in the jaw. A hard and vicious jab that snaps Indy's head around.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ohh. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
VOGEL exits. INDY shakes his head clear.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ooooh... I like the Austrian way better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So did I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's try and get these ropes loose. We've got to get to Marcus before the Nazis do!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said he had two days' start. That he would blend in. Disappear!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you kidding?—I made that up! You know Marcus—he got lost once in his own museum!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
Indy and Henry are pulling at the ropes with great urgency.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you try and reach into my left jacket pocket?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY is able to wiggle his hand towards Indy's coat pocket. INDY squirms his body around towards Henry's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I looking for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lucky charm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Feels like a cigarette lighter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try and burn through the ropes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY's fingers open the lighter and ignite the flame.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY yelps as the cigarette lighter burns his hand. He drops the lighter to the floor. Henry kicks at the lighter, trying to reach it, but cannot. The rug starts to burn. INDY doesn't know it yet.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ought to tell you something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't get sentimental now Dad— save it 'til we get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The floor's on fire! See?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(turns and sees)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What???
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the chair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, movel Move! Rock your Chair. Do what I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
They begin to rock their chair legs, inching their way off the burning carpet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CASTLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as ELSA is driven away. VOGEL and DONOVAN remain behind, flanked by NAZI SOLDIERS .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another car pulls up and VOGEL holds the door open for DONOVAN who gets into the rear seat. A LIEUTENANT approaches with a written message for Donovan.
</DIRECTION>
<LIEUTENANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Etwas wichtig, mein Herr.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LIEUTENANT>
<DIRECTION>
DONOVAN puts on his glasses to read the message.
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we have Marcus Brody. But more important, we have the map.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
A RADIO OPERATOR steps forward with yet another written message for DONOVAN.
</DIRECTION>
<RADIO_OPERATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aus Berlin, mein Herr.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RADIO_OPERATOR>
<DONOVAN>

	"By the personal command of the Fuhrer. Secrecy essential to success. Eliminate the American conspirators."

(to VOGEL)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Germany has declared war on the Jones boys.

</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
The car drives off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY and HENRY are still in their chairs, tied back-to-back. Indy tries to communicate with Henry, but each time he calls him, the men turn their heads in opposite directions.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
Finally they turn their heads in the same direction.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Head for the fireplace!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
BANGING, ROCKING and HOPPING their chairs, they work their way INTO THE FIREPLACE—the only safe place from the now ROARING FIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I can get these ropes off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
Indy struggles to free his hands. His foot kicks out and accidentally hits a metal grill that operates a Secret Door.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoopsl
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
The fireplace floor rotates like a Lazy Susan and Indy and his father find themselves in the:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where a NAZI RADIOMAN wearing headphones sits at an elaborate panel of dials, switches and meters, and a WOMAN stands over a map plotting coordinates. Their backs are turned to INDY and HENRY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The floor begins to rotate again, and INDY and HENRY find themselves back in:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
inside the fireplace, still tied back-to-back.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our situation has not improved.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY glances over his shoulder at HENRY.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen Dad... I'm almost free.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY's foot hits the grill again... and the fireplace rotates to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOUR NAZI RADIOMEN and the WOMAN are still hard at work with controls and coordinates. Suddenly the Woman looks up and spots HENRY and INDY. She screams.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alarm!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Now the RADIOMEN turn to see HENRY and INDY.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Schnel!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
TWO NAZIS draw their revolvers and FIRE SEVERAL SHOTS at INDY and HENRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY and HENRY rotate into the room which is now an INFERNO. The carpet, drapes and furniture are all ablaze.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is intolerable!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm out, Dad!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY finally breaks free. And he immediately begins to untie his father.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well done, boy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All FOUR RADIOMEN now have their guns drawn. They activate the lever and begin to rotate through the Secret Door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASTLE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The RADIOMEN appear in the fireplace on the other side—but there is NO SIGN OF INDY AND HENRY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The RADIOMEN move cautiously toward the flame, shielding their faces with one hand, holding their guns with the other. Is it possible that INDY and HENRY escaped through these flames?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not a chance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They've hidden themselves UP THE CHIMNEY. And now they DROP DOWN, BEHIND the RADIOMEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the RADIOMEN grabs INDY by the neck. As they struggle they fall against the rotating wall and disappear into the next room, leaving a frightened HENRY behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY presses against the wall, which rotates again. As he disappears into the next room, a DEAD NAZI RADIOMAN swivels into the room. The other NAZIS rush forward to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY picks up a BUST OF HITLER and uses it to jam the rotating wall in place, sealing the NAZIS inside the burning room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASTLE HALLWAY- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vogel strides purposefully down the hallway. He BARKS an order, and TWO MORE NAZIS fall into step with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RADIO ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY grabs his whip, his leather sack and Henry's case from a table. He hands the case to HENRY and they begin to run.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECRET ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY and HENRY step into an empty room.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dead end.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY looks horrified by what he's been forced to do as INDY searches frantically for an exit.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's got to be a... a secret door around. A passageway or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY begins to run his hands over the walls—frantic.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I find that if I just sit down and think...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY sits on a chair which tips back, hitting the wall behind it. The floor at INDY's feet suddenly begins DROPPING AWAYI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY grabs a railing to keep from falling, but loses his grip and plunges through the opening which has formed a SPIRAL STAIRCASE. He rolls down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... the solution presents itself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY follows INDY down the staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAVERN/UNDERGROUND HARBOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stairway deposits Indy and Henry into an enormous WATERY CAVERN beneath the mountain on which the castle was built.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A full-scale Nazi BOAT DOCK has been built inside the cavern. We see MOTORBOATS, GUNBOATS, SUPPLY BOATS, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. More boats.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY boards one of the motorboats and STARTS THE MOTOR.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you say this has been just another typical day for you? Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY tosses his case at INDY who catches it and angrily throws it back to his father.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(ironically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ooofl No! It's been better than most.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY moves back to the dock and pushes the boat away. HENRY looks confused.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Dad. Come onl
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the boat? We're not going on the boat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SECRET ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VOGEL and the NAZI SOLDIERS enter the room and spot the spiral staircase leading below. They quickly descend the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAVERN/UNDERGROUND HARBOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as VOGEL and the NAZI SOLDIERS rush to the dock. Vogel sees that a motorboat is missing. He orders the Nazi Soldiers into a boat.
</DIRECTION>
<VOGEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sie alle ins Boat. Schnell!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOGEL>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL a large box which suddenly BREAKS APART as INDY, now on a motorbike with HENRY in the sidecar, ROARS PAST THE DOCK, hitting TWO NAZI SOLDIERS who scream as they fall into the river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VOGEL screams after INDY and HENRY as they drive off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STRAIGHT CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY looks pleased as he drives the motorbike along the road, but HENRY appears worried.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
FOUR NAZI SOLDIERS ON MOTORCYCLES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They chase down the road after INDY and HENRY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY turns the motorbike down a smaller, dusty tree-lined road. HENRY gasps as he is jostled about in the sidecar. One of the NAZI SOLDIERS gives chase along a higher road running in the same direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD BARRICADE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY approaches the barricade from one direction as one of the NAZI SOLDIERS approaches from a higher road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GUARD steps from the road station and calls to the vehicles as INDY and HENRY SMASH THROUGH THE BARRICADE.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Halt! Halt!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
THE NAZI SOLDIER rides his motorcycle through the other side of the barrier-- IT SHATTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY AND HENRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY grabs at a FLAGPOLE as they roar past—it snaps off in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The NAZI SOLDIER drives his motorcycle toward INDY and HENRY. He unshoulders his machine gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY uses the broken flagpole as a lance and knocks the NAZI SOLDIER from his motorcycle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE RIDERLESS MOTORCYCLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
drives on toward the other NAZI SOLDIERS now approaching the guardhouse, COLLIDING WITH TWO OF THEM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The remaining NAZI SOLDIER maneuvers his motorcycle around his fallen comrades and continues the chase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY AND HENRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the remaining NAZI SOLDIER rides alongside their motorbike he cocks his gun, preparing to fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY quickly jams the remaining portion of the flagpole through the spokes of the Nazi's front wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The NAZI SOLDIER'S MOTORCYCLE FLIPS THREE TIMES, throwing him high into the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY glances back and smiles, but the smile fades as he looks forward again to see a sign at a CROSSROAD. Arrows pointing in opposite directions indicate the way to BERLIN or VENEDIG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy starts down the road marked VENEDIG.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop! Stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
The motorbike skids to a stop.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going the wrong Way! We have to get to Berlin!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing towards Venedig)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brody's this way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My Diary's in Berlin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't need the Diary, Dad. Marcus has the map.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is more in the Diary than just the map.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right Dad—tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, he who finds the Grail must face the final challenge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What final challenge?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three devices of such lethal cunning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Booby traps?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes. But I found the clues that will safely take us through, in the Chronicles of St. Anselm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what are they? Can't you remember?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wrote them down in my Diary so that I wouldn't have to remember
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Half the German Army's on our tail and you want me to go to Berlin? Into the lion's den?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes! The only thing that matters is the Grail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Marcus?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marcus would agree with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two selfless martyrs. Jesus Christl
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY slaps him across the face. INDY is rocked to his foundations, not by any means entirely by the blow itself.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's for blasphemy. The quest for the Grail is not archaeology. It's a race against evil. If it is captured by the Nazis, the armies of darkness will march all over the face of the earth. Do you understand me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is an obsession Dad. I never understood it. Never. Neither did Mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes, she did. Only too well. Unfortunately she kept her illness from me until all I could do was mourn her.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. CROSSROADS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Arrows point in opposite directions to VENICE and BERLIN. The CAMERA MOVES IN on the portion of the sign reading BERLIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY SQUARE - BERLIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Nazi Rally—a book-burning is in process.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mound of burning books is ten feet tall and growing by the minute as College Students and Nazi Brownshirts continually toss more books onto the fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flags, banners and standards displaying the swastika are waved rhythmically from side to side in a motion that echoes the mounting frenzy of the enormous crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY and HENRY walk toward the Square. Indy wears the uniform of a Nazi Soldier. He is now buttoning up the tunic—which happens to be several sizes too big.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My boy, we are Pilgrims in an unholy land.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
Then... Indy sees something that makes him stop in his tracks. WE PAN ALONG HIS LINE OF SIGHT to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PODIUM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where high-ranking Officers of the Third Reich stand flanking ADOLF HITLER as they oversee the rally.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA is walking away in an open area, background of torches, vehicles, Nazi Officers... one of whom is now none other than INDY, coming up to her before she knows he is there. His voice is quiet and tough, his eyes hard.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fraulein Doctor. Where is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
Still startled, her reaction makes it clear that Indy is even now a lover in her thoughts.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you get here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is it? I want it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY pushes ELSA against a column and begins to search her clothing for the Diary. He pulls the book from Elsa's pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You came back for the book? Whv?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father didn't want it incinerated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
She understands him. It's as though he slapped her.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that what you think of me? I believe in the Grail, not the Swastika.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(vicious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yet you stood up to be counted with the enemy of everything the Grail stands for—who gives a damn what you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
(hard and fast)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
Now it's as though she'd slapped him back. His hands fly to her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I have to do is squeeze.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I have to do is scream.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
It's a standoff emotionally. He knows he'd never do it. she knows it too. And the same goes for screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY releases her and backs away. she looks at him with a lover's pain. He moves over to HENRY.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got it. Let's get the hell out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
They move off and almost run headlong into HITLER and his entire entourage coming down from the Podium. 50 kids push their autograph books for Hitler's signature.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HITLER pauses to sign them. Hitler looks Indy's way. They make eye contact. It only lasts a moment but the moment is electric.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HITLER breaks the spell by taking the Grail Diary from him, opens it to the first page and signs his autograph. He hands it back and moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AIRFIELD - BERLIN, GERMANY- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy's motorcycle pulls up to the main terminal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TERMINAL BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Plainclothes Agent distributes leaflets bearing HENRY'S PICTURE to Nazi Soldiers inside the terminal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY leans in a doorway reading a newspaper as INDY enters down the stairs and taps Henry's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They begin to walk toward the boarding gates.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you get?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. The first available flight out of Germany.

</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good.

INDY and HENRY show their papers to the Boarding Guards, then join the line of passengers, which has already begun to move toward a:

The Zeppelin is about to take off. INDY and HENRY make themselves comfortable in one of the compartments.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we made it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY looks over his newspaper at INDY.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When we're airborne, with Germany behind us, then I'll share that sentiment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
But INDY looks out the window and is suddenly concerned when he sees: VOGEL AND A GESTAPO AGENT rushing across the tarmac toward the Zeppelin.
</DIRECTION>
<VOGEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nicht zumachen! Wir steigen ein!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOGEL>
<DIRECTION>
INDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sits back in his chair, looks to HENRY, now reading his newspaper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A STEWARD enters and sets a bowl of nuts on the table in front of INDY and HENRY, then continues down the aisle of passengers. Indy follows after the Steward. He puts his arm around the Steward's shoulder and together they walk up a flight of stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VOGEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
now walks up the aisle. He approaches a MALE PASSENGER hidden behind a newspaper. VOGEL uses his walking stick to lower the newspaper and show the Passenger the leaflet with Henry's photograph.
</DIRECTION>
<VOGEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Haben sie disen Mann gesehen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOGEL>
<DIRECTION>
The Passengers at the table shake their heads in the negative. VOGEL shows the picture to other Passengers.
</DIRECTION>
<FEMALE_PASSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nein.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEMALE_PASSENGER>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fahrscheine, bitte.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<MALE_PASSENGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nein.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALE_PASSENGER>
<DIRECTION>
VOGEL turns to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WEARING THE HAT AND JACKET OF THE CHIEF STEWARD.
</DIRECTION>
<MALE_PASSENGER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ich habe ihn night gesehen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALE_PASSENGER>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tickets please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
The Passengers do not react to the request, made in English.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fahrscheine meine Dame. Bitte.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
VOGEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
approaches HENRY, still hidden behind his newspaper. Again, VOGEL uses his walking stick to lower the paper, revealing Henry's face.
</DIRECTION>
<VOGEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guten Tag, Herr Jones.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOGEL>
<DIRECTION>
Now INDY, still playing the role of Steward, asks VOGEL for his ticket.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fahrscheine meine Herr.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<VOGEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Weg.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOGEL>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tickets please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY looks confused.
</DIRECTION>
<VOGEL>
<DIRECTION>
(in German)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOGEL>
<DIRECTION>
VOGEL glances up and recognizes INDY—who quickly punches Vogel in the face, knocking him toward the window. In another quick move, Indy TOSSES HIM OUT THE WINDOW onto the tarmac below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shocked Passengers blink in bewilderment.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(in German; with a shrug)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No ticket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone else with a ticket quickly produces it and waves it in Indy's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AIRFIELD TARMAC - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VOGEL gets to his knees as the huge Zeppelin rises into the sky above him, revealing an airplane attached to the belly of the airship. Vogel shakes his fist at the rising Zeppelin.
</DIRECTION>
<VOGEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Du wirst nochmal boren von mir!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOGEL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ZEPPELIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY and HENRY together again in their compartment.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(meaning ELSA)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not all we shared. It's disgraceful. You're old enough to be her fa---er, her grandfather!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm as human as the next man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was the next man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ships that pass in the night...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY opens his Diary and begins to thumb through it.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? I had a milk shake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmmm... What did we talk about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We didn't talk. We never talked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And do I detect a rebuke?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A regret. It was just the two of us, Dad. It was a lonely way to grow up. For you, too. If you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, I was a wonderful father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY looks up from his Diary.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I ever tell you to eat up? Go to bed? Wash your ears? Do your homework? No. I respected your privacy and I taught you self- reliance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you taught me was that I was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. And I learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You left just when you were becoming interesting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad, how can you --?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very well. I'm here now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
He closes the Diary and leans back in his seat.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want to talk about? Hmmm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY stutters uncomfortably as HENRY stares at him, waiting for a response.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... I can't think of anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then what are you complaining about?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, we have work to do. When we get to Alexandretta we will face three challenges.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he reads from the Diary)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"First, the breath of God. Only the penitent man will pass. Second, the Word of God, only in the footsteps of God will he proceed. Third, the Path of God, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth. "
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does that mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. We'll find out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
Sunlight falls across the table from the window. INDY reaches for the drink. The bar of sunlight turns like the hand of a clock over the tabletop across the drinks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see INDY puzzled. Only for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're turning around. They're taking us back to Germany.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRAMEWORK OF ZEPPELIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY and his father emerge from the hatchway into the belly of the Zeppelin. The Zeppelin's elaborate metal framework is exposed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY and HENRY hurry down the catwalk until arriving at a PAIR OF DOORWAYS framed into the Zeppelin's outer skin.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I thought it would take them a lot longer to figure out the radio was dead. Come on, Dad. Move!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
Then INDY opens the doors. We see plenty of blue sky and white clouds. We also see a small BIPLANE that is suspended from the Zeppelin by a HOOK & CRANE DEVICE.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Dad. Come on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AIRPLANE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY climbs into the cockpit of the Biplane as HENRY takes the tail gunner's seat.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(with delight)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't know you could fly a plane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fly--yes. Land--no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BIPLANE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY turns in his seat to give HENRY the "thumbs up." Henry smiles valiantly and points down to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then they both become aware of a STRANGE SOUND in the skies behind them. Something between a ROAR and a WAIL. TWO MESSERSCHMIDT FIGHTER BOMBERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
streak out of the clouds and race across the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY AND HENRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shrink in their seats as the MESSERSCHMIDTS (going three times as fast as they are) SCREAM past on either side.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad, you're gonna have to use the machine gun. Get it ready.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY turns and grips the MOUNTED MACHINE GUN with a perplexed expression.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(turning; pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eleven o'clock!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY pulls out his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad—eleven o'clock!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happens at eleven o'clock?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY uses his arm to demonstrate that he's referring to a direction and not a time.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(frustrated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twelve—eleven—ten. Eleven o'clock. Fire!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY does—and the EXPLODING GUN nearly shakes him out of his seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy's slow speed and small size works to his advantage. The speeding Messerschmidts continually overshoot him, WHIZZING past in a blur—making wide turns miles away in the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY has one of the Messerschmidts in his sight. He pulls back on the trigger --RATTA-A-TAT-TAT! RATTA-A-TAT-TAT!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Messerschmidt banks to the left, but HENRY keeps it in his gun sight. Henry swings the gun around, inadvertently CUTTING HIS OWN REAR STABILIZER IN HALF.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad, are we hit?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More or less.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son, I'm sorry. They got us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY looks back at the missing tail section, then at his father.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The plane begins to go down. INDY struggles to control its descent.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang on, Dads We're going in!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY slumps down fearfully in his seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A FIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wheels of the plane touch down. OUT OF CONTROL, the PLANE SKIDS and CRASHES first into a corral of goats and then into the farmhouse beyond sending a cloud of dust into the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As INDY pulls himself from the cockpit:
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(sarcastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice landing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, INDY's attention is directed to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SCREAMING MESSERSCHMIDTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
coming in low. Guns BLAZING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As BULLETS EXPLODE around them, INDY and HENRY jump over a stone barricade. Henry, frightened, grabs at Indy.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those people are trying to kill us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, Dadl
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a new experience for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It happens to me all the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An OLD MAN kneels at his car repairing a rear tire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
turns to the wheel, the hubcap in his hands. Suddenly the wheel moves forward, startling the Old Man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CAR - TRAVELING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY has the throttle down, both hands tightly gripping the steering wheel. HENRY is a very nervous passenger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY sees a LOW-FLYING MESSERSCHMIDT coming up behind him in the SIDE MIRROR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the Messerschmidt ROARS by overhead, BULLETS EXPLODE around them, narrowly missing the car.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is intolerable!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This could be close.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ROAD - LONG SHOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car races toward a TUNNEL that cuts through a steep MOUNTAINSIDE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Messerschmidt bears down on Indy's car, machine guns CHATTERING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car ENTERS the tunnel. The Messerschmidt cannot pull up in time. It SLAMS into the MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL, SHEARING OFF its WINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TUNNEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FLAMING FUSELAGE continues to ROCKET through the tunnel like a bullet down the muzzle of a gun. SPARKS fly as its belly SCRAPES against the pavement and the sides of the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy and Henry look over their shoulders to see this wingless BALL OF FIRE gaining on them; about to overtake them.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faster, boy --faster!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ROAD - OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car exits the tunnel at top speed and veers off the road. The flaming Messerschmidt fuselage shoots past and EXPLODES in the middle of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the car emerges safely from the flames, Henry wipes the sweat from his brow.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, they don't come any closer than that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY looks out the windshield and sees the second Messerschmidt SCREAMING out of the sky toward them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ROAD - LONG SHOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MESSERSCHMIDT drops its single UNDER-FUSELAGE BOMB. It EXPLODES in the road directly ahead of the car, missing it by only several feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FALLS INTO THE HOLE made by the bomb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY climbs out of the car, still in the bomb crater. He turns back to HENRY.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad, he's coming back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY and HENRY run down the mountainside to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DESERTED MEDITERRANEAN BEACH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY and HENRY run to the shoreline. Indy reaches for his gun, tucked in his pants. He opens the chamber—the GUN HAS NO BULLETS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MESSERSCHMIDT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
swings around and is coming in for another pass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY AND HENRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
exchange a wordless glance. They don't even think about running: there is no place to run to. HENRY hands his case to INDY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holding his umbrella, HENRY suddenly spins around and runs screaming and shouting into A FLOCK OF SEA GULLS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SEA GULLS take to the wing in flight. Thousands of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bullets kick up sand leading up to him... then—
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MESSERSCHMIDT AND THE SEA GULLS meet in midair. MASSACRE! Sea gulls are shredded by the Messerschmidt's whirling propeller blades into a FEATHERY WHITE PUREE that SPLATTERS against the cockpit and CLOGS THE ENGINE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ENGINE SPUTTERS... STALLS... Silence. The Messerschmidt falls from the skies and EXPLODES in an OFF CAMERA SOUND EFFECT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY stands as before—stunned—a statue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY walks back to INDY.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suddenly remembered Charlemagne. "Let my armies be the rocks and the trees and the birds in the sky."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he chuckles)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY wears a proud expression as he watches HENRY walk down the beach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOSQUE - DAY

EXT. COURTYARD OF SULTAN'S PALACE - ISKENDERUN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SULTAN is seated in his royal chair, flanked by WALTER DONOVAN and VOGEL and surrounded by his minions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DONOVAN holds the missing Grail Diary pages.
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These pages are taken from Professor Jones' diary, Your Highness. And they include a map that pinpoints the exact location of the Grail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
DONOVAN and the SULTAN walk together through an archway.
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you can see, the Grail is all but in our hands.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	However, Your Highness, we would not think of crossing your soil without your permission, nor of removing the Grail from your borders without suitable compensation.

</DONOVAN>
<SULTAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have you brought?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SULTAN>
<VOGEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bring den Schatzl
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOGEL>
<DIRECTION>
TWO NAZI SOLDIERS bring forward a HUGE STEAMER TRUNK. They open the lid and begin to empty it of its contents:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gold and silver objects of every description.
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Precious valuables, Your Highness, "donated" by some of the finest families in all of Germany.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
The SULTAN gets up from his chair and walks toward the trunk. He goes right past it and begins to inspect the Nazi staff car parked nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<SULTAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rolls-Royce Phantom Two. 4.3 litre, 30 horsepower, six cylinder engine, with Stromberg Downdraft carburetor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SULTAN>
<DIRECTION>
The SULTAN points to the engine under the hood.
</DIRECTION>
<SULTAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can go from zero to 100 kilometres an hour in 12.5 seconds. And I even like the color.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SULTAN>
<DONOVAN>

(after a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The keys are in the ignition, Your Highness.

	You shall have camels, horses, an armed escort, provisions, desert vehicles—and tanksl

</SULTAN>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're welcome.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
Somebody else is also taking note...and we see that it is KAZIM, the spy at the court.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA is revealed coming down the stairs toward DONOVAN and VOGEL.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have no time to lose. Indiana Jones and his father have escaped.

SALLAH drives his car through the crowded streets, INDY beside him and HENRY in the back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<SALLAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We go this way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLAH>
<DIRECTION>
SALLAH waves his arms and shouts to a CAMEL HERDER.

<SALLAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get that camel out of the way!

(overlapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, they set out across the desert this afternoon. I believe they took Mister Brody with them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLAH>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY removes his hat and hits INDY with it.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now they have the map! And in this sort of race, there's no silver medal for finishing second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT VALLEY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elsa and Donovan's party—consisting of a SUPPLY TRUCK, OPEN CAR, TUhKISH SOLDIERS RIDING CAMELS, SPARE HORSES AND A TANK AND VARIOUS OTHER VEHICLES—all moving along through the ramble of this box canyon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA, DONOVAN and VOGEL travel in the open car. The TANK is a vintage World War I model with enormous treads. The Turkish soldiers wear native dress and carry both carbines and sabers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRODY sits alongside ELSA in the rear of the car carrying DONOVAN. Donovan hands a canteen back to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Care to wet your whistle, Marcus?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd rather spit in your face. But as I haven't got any spit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
VOGEL snatches the canteen away from BRODY before he can drink.
</DIRECTION>
<VOGEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We must be within three or four miles. Otherwise we are off the map.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOGEL>
<DIRECTION>
He hands the map to ELSA, drinks from the canteen, and hands that back to DONOVAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Marcus, we are on the brink of the recovery of the greatest artifact in the history of mankind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're meddling with powers you cannot possibly comprehend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY and SALLAH are at INDY's side as he views Donovan's party in the distance. Parked nearby is a CAR containing all of their supplies.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, I see Brody. He seems okay. They've got a tank. Six-pound gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
Then Donovan notices a reflection from the hills.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What he sees is:

DONOVAN shouts orders to the Troops. INDY is followed by various vehicles in the caravan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY notices that the side gun that is now firing at him can only pivot so far. Indy makes a mental note of this and while riding right in front of the tank, turns his horse completely around, 180 degrees. The tank starts to follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV THROUGH THE VIEWING PORT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VOGEL watches the ground turning 180 degrees as he tries to catch up with INDY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cleverly, INDY has turned the tank directly into a head-on collision course with some of the pursuit vehicles and a Kubelwagon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tank and the Kubelwagon smash into each other, the German military sedan becoming lodged between the treads while blocking the front view and any use of the six-pound cannon on the turret.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY, meanwhile, leans down on his horse, scooping up a stone from the wall of a culvert. He reigns his horse, paralleling the tank, as everyone scurries about inside, looking through viewing ports, trying to figure out exactly where Indy is.

INDY and VOGEL EXCHANGE SHOTS as Indy chases the tank on his horse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY pulls the trigger again—his gun is empty! Indy immediately takes the high trail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now INDY is above the tank twelve feet on a paralleling trail. He moves out of the saddle and leaps from the speeding horse onto the trundling tank.

One of the two troop carriers is paralleling the tank and like pirates boarding a galleon, Nazi Soldiers leap over the treads and are swarming all over INDY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY is struggling with a German's Luger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY presses the luger against his assailant and forces the Nazi to squeeze off a shot into himself. The bullet not only passes through the Nazi, but passes through two other Nazis standing directly behind him on the crowded tank top and three bodies fall away, leaving Indy to stare at the gun in disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another Soldier leaps from the truck onto the tank and raises his knife as he grabs INDY. They struggle and fall.

INDY sits up to see VOGEL standing over him. Vogel wraps a chain around Indy's neck.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. SECRET CANYON - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY, HENRY, SALLAH and BRODY ride into the canyon. They hear a WAILING WIND. Feel the biting cold. And sense the danger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we turn a corner and they see the hidden city. Its spectacular Grecian facade is carved directly into the rock. It is a stunning sight. The vehicles, camels and horses belonging to DONOVAN's party have been left at the entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<CUT_TO>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TEMPLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY, SALLAH, HENRY AND BRODY creep forward to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TERRIFIED FACE OF A TURKISH SOLDIER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's walking slowly. Eyes darting. Muttering a prayer under his breath. What's going on here?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - INSIDE THE MOUNTAIN TEMPLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TURK stands alone in the center of the Temple. It is very dark. GIANT COLUMNS define the Temple's perimeter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA AND DONOVAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watch him from a safe distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TURK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is about to approach the spot where a TURKISH SOLDIER LIES DEAD. We don't notice it right away, but the dead soldier has been DECAPITATED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TURK stops—only one step away from the beheaded soldier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TURK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
takes one more step—a fatal step, it turns out. We hear a ROAR—A WHOOSH of air—but we SEE NOTHING—except THE TURK'S HEAD FLY OFF AND BOUNCE across the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY, HENRY, BRODY AND SALLAH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
react to the sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA AND DONOVAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him, horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Helmut, another volunteer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
TWO NAZI SOLDIERS force another Turk forward. Suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SOUND OF RIFLE BOLTS being cocked. Everyone turns to discover INDY and his party surrounded by NAZI SOLDIERS. Indy's group are relieved of their guns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - THE TEMPLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY, HENRY, BRODY and SALLAH are brought forward by the Nazi Soldiers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA's eyes light up: glad Indy's not dead. she controls herself and continues more coldly.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
(to INDY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never expected to see you again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm like a bad penny. I always turn up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Step back now, Doctor Schneider. Give Doctor Jones some room. He's going to recover the Grail for us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
INDY laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Impossible? What do you say, Jones? Ready to go down in history?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As what? A Nazi stooge like you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
(scornfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nazis?!—Is that the limit of your vision?! The Nazis want to write themselves into the Grail legend and take on the world. Well, they're welcome. But I want the Grail itself. The cup that gives everlasting life. Hitler can have the world, but he can't take it with him. I'm going to be drinking my own health when he's gone the way of the Dodo.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he draws his pistol)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Grail is mine, and you're going to get it for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shooting me won't get you anywhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know something, Doctor Jones?... you're absolutely right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
Then DONOVAN shifts his aim, just a bit, and SHOOTS HENRY. The bullet enters his side below the ribs.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Junior. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
( to ELSA)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY collapses. Blood flowing from the wound. BRODY and SALLAH rush to his assistance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY spins toward DONOVAN with murder in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DONOVAN points the gun at him:
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't save him when you're dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
INDY hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The healing power of the Grail is the only thing that can save your father now. It's time to ask yourself what you believe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
INDY takes in the situation. The two decapitated men lie a few yards in front of him. He walks to the entranceway, flanked by two stone lions. We get silent reaction shots—ELSA—SALLAH—BRODY—DONOVAN—registering their different emotions
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY proceeds forward. His hands open the Grail Diary.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"The Breath of God... Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass. . . "
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY takes a few steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"The penitent man will pass. The penitent man..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY stops. He is about to reach the spot where two men have just died.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY looks at INDY. Indy looks at Henry.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(in a raspy voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Only the penitent man will pass. Only the penitent man will pass."
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The penitent man will pass. The penitent... the penitent. The penitent man...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The penitent man. The penitent...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY takes a step forward through the cobwebs.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The penitent man is humble before God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Penitent. Penitent...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The penitent man is humble...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
The cobwebs begin to move....
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He kneels before God.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself; suddenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kneel!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the awful rush of air—WHOOSH! Because INDY is in the act of kneeling, only his hat is knocked off and his hair flies in his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instinctively he ROLLS FORWARD on the ground out of harm's way and looks up. From his new position he is able to see what is causing all the trouble: A RAZOR SHARP TRIPLE PENDULUM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY gets cautiously to his feet. Now he sees the pendulum has been guarding a SMALL CORRIDOR which turns a corner to the left fifty yards ahead. Wooden wheels turn—the mechanism controlling the spinning blades. INDY loops a rope around the wheels, jamming the mechanism and stopping the blades in mid-swipe.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm through!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA AND DONOVAN
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're through!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
BRODY and SALLAH smile, relieved.
</DIRECTION>
<SALLAH>
<DIRECTION>
(to HENRY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLAH>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO INDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
holding the Grail Diary, reading once again, his fedora now covered in cobwebs.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"The second challenge is the Word of God. Only in the footsteps of God will he proceed."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Word of God... The Word of...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY pulls away some cobwebs to reveal a cobblestone path. Each cobble is engraved with a letter.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Proceed in the footsteps of the Word."
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lifts his head painfully.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Word of God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Henry. Try not to talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Name of God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO INDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he studies the cobblestones before him.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Name of God... Jehovahl
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
still lies in SALLAH's arms. BRODY leans over him.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But in the Latin alphabet, "Jehovah" begins with an "I."
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO INDY
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"J."
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY takes a step and immediately a stone breaks away and INDY falls up to his hip -- his leg stuck through the hold where the stone once was.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reacts.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh dear!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO INDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who grunts as he pulls himself from the hole, the v-rail Diary in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In Latin, "Jehovah" starts with an "I." "I"...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
Now we SEE each letter on the stones as INDY carefully walks forward. DONOVAN and ELSA follow in his footsteps.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"E"... "H"... "O"... "V"... "A"...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY sighs with relief and steps forward to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GREAT ABYSS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY stands in a small opening, just small enough for his shoulders to squeeze through and beyond that a 100 foot drop to the rocks below and 100 feet across, nothing but a rough, stony cliff wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO INDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He can see nowhere to cross. He looks again to the v-rail Diary.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"The path of flood. Only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth."
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY looks around and then he notices that inscribed into the rock above his head is the head of a lion.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Impossiblel Nobody can jump this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY looks down into the Diary and tortures over what it is asking him to do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRODY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rushes forward and calls to INDY.
</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indy... Indy, you must hurry!! Come quickly!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO INDY
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(realizing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's... a leap of faith. Oh, God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
calls to his son.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must believe, boy. you must... believe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
We see him do it. We see him leap into space. We see that he is in midair. We see that he is not going to make it. His hands claw for the opposite wall but he is going to fall 100 feet to his death. And then—he doesn't! He appears to be held up by thin air as he lands on his hands and knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY looks around and down and now he figures it out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ingeniously, the First Crusaders have painted a pathway to align with the rocks 100 feet below. It is a perfect forced perspective image of the rocks below with lines from a hundred feet continuing six feet below his sight line where his feet are stepping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's painted to blend in with the rocks below. Highly evolved camouflage... in perfect alignment with everything we see below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When INDY leans out to the left or right... that's when he sees the perfect alignment shift that betrays the trick. Indy throws some dirt on the bridge and he crosses it like the first Crusader from the painting over Henry's desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Indy crawls through a small opening in the side of the cliff and enters a Temple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A vast array of chalices is displayed on the altar of this small Temple. Perhaps a hundred or more. Many sizes, many shapes, some gold, some silver, but they all glitter and shine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY is mesmerized by their number and their beauty. And then he realizes that a man is praying at the altarl
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has his back turned to INDY... but he is dressed as what he is! A GRAIL KNIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE GRAIL KNIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But we can't see the Grail Knight's face. The visor of his helmet is down. Perhaps we see his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the GRAIL KNIGHT sees INDY he gets wearily to his feet and, surprisingly, prepares to give combat...taking up his two-handed broadsword...he comes at Indy, attempting to swing the huge, heavy sword but finding the effort almost too much. Indy dodges two or three clumsy swings of the sword, making no attempt to fight back...until the Knight, exhausted, drops the sword and collapses. Indy approaches him and raises the visor and we see that the Knight is a very ancient man.
</DIRECTION>
<KNIGHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew you'd come, but my strength has left me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KNIGHT>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<KNIGHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The last of three brothers who swore an oath to find the Grail and to guard it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KNIGHT>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was seven hundred years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<KNIGHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A long time to wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KNIGHT>
<DIRECTION>
The GRAIL KNIGHT reaches forward and fingers Indy's clothing.
</DIRECTION>
<KNIGHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're strangely dressed...for a knight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KNIGHT>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not exactly...a knight. What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<KNIGHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was chosen because I was the bravest and the most worthy. The honor was mine until another came to challenge me to single combat. I pass it to you who vanquished me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KNIGHT>
<DIRECTION>
The GRAIL KNIGHT holds his sword out to INDY.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(gulp)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, I don't have time to explain, but—
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment DONOVAN and ELSA appear. Donovan turns to face the display of cups.
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which one is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<KNIGHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must choose.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But choose wisely. For as the True Grail will bring you life— the False Grail will take it from you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KNIGHT>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not a historian. I have no idea what it looks like. Which one is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me choose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA and INDY exchange looks. He thinks he is seeing her in her true colors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA chooses a cup—a solid gold, emerald encrusted goblet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DONOVAN instantly takes it from her.
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes. It's more beautiful than I'd ever imagined. This certainly is the cup of the King of Kings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
DONOVAN rushes to the well and fills the goblet with water.
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eternal life!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
DONOVAN drinks from the goblet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, DONOVAN'S entire body starts to convulse. His face contorts in agony. He grabs his stomach and turns toward ELSA.
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What . . . is . . . happening. . . to . . . me. . .?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to age—fast! His hair grows long and gray and brittle. His face sinks. Fingernails curl back on themselves. Milky cataracts coat his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA gasps and screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What. . . is . . . happening. . . ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
His skin turns brown and leathery and stretches across his bones until it splits. His skeletal hands reach for ELSA's throat, choking her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY rushes forward and pushes DONOVAN away. As he falls he BODY BREAKS INTO FLAMES, then SHATTERS AGAINST THE WALL.
</DIRECTION>
<KNIGHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He chose...poorly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KNIGHT>
<DIRECTION>
INDY studies the array of chalices.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would not be made out of gold.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
INDY picks up another cup—a simple earthenware jug.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the cup of a carpenter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
He and ELSA exchange a look.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's only one way to find out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY goes to the well and fills the earthenware jug with water, then pauses. INDY brings the jug to his lips and takes several large swallows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A strange sensation overcomes him, a feeling of peace and contentment...and we see his wounds begin to heal.
</DIRECTION>
<KNIGHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have chosen wisely. But the Grail cannot pass beyond the Great Seal. That is the boundary and the price of immortality.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KNIGHT>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO BRODY AND SALLAH who attend to Henry awaiting Indy's return.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY and ELSA come forward with the Grail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TWO NAZI SOLDIERS are over-awed by the possessors of the Grail. They put down their guns and kneel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDY kneels by HENRY's side and tilts his head forward and holds the Grail to his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY is too weak to even open his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY swallows some of the water. Much of it runs down the corners of his mouth. Finally INDY pours the water over the wound and everyone watches in astonishment as the wound and the blood stain disappear before their eyes. The color returns to Henry's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HENRY's eyes open. The first thing he sees is the Grail and they light up. Then they shift to INDY's face—and they light up even more...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NAZI SOLDIERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
run forward. SALLAH points a rifle at them.
</DIRECTION>
<SALLAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drop your guns. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALLAH>
<DIRECTION>
The NAZI SOLDIERS drop their weapons at their feet and raise their arms in surrender.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(to HENRY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad, come on. Get to your feet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
steps forward and picks up the Grail. She turns to INDY, her face alight with possession of the Grail.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have got it. Come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA steps onto the edge of the Great Seal.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elsa! Elsa, don't movel
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's ours, Indy. Yours and mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elsa, don't cross the Seal. The Knight warned us not to take the Grail from here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
A RUMBLING SOUND IS HEARD and the ground roars and shifts. Dirt falls from the ceiling of the cavern. ELSA falls on the Great Seal. The Grail bounces away from her grasp. She reaches for it and the ground beneath her begins to SPLIT OPEN. ELSA slips into the crevasse. She screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA is hanging perilously in the abyss, with the Grail almost within her reach. As her hands lose their grip, INDY just manages to one of them, he himself sliding forward across the slanted floor.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Junior! Junior!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
With her free hand, ELSA is trying to get the Grail. INDY can't save her unless she gives him her free hand. She has to choose.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elsa. Elsa don't. Elsa. Elsa. Give me your other hand, honey. I can't hold you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<ELSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can reach it. I can reach it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSA>
<DIRECTION>
Her hand begins to slip from Indy's grasp.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elsa! Give me your hand. Give me your other hand!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
ELSA just manages to touch the Grail. In doing so, she has tipped the balance too far—INDY slides down another yard, Elsa loses her grip and falls screaming to her death.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
<DIRECTION>
(horrified)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elsa!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
Now the ledge INDY lies upon begins to break apart. HENRY grabs one of his hands as Indy struggles to reach the Grail with the other.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Junior, give me your other hand! I can't hold on!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can get it—I can almost reach it, Dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY looks down into the black bottomless pit beneath him from which nothing can ever be retrieved.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indiana. Indiana!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY snaps his look up to his father. His father has never called him this before.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(very calmly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... let it go...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY abandons the Grail and grabs onto HENRY with both hands. HENRY pulls him up to safety.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GRAIL KNIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looks through the falling debris to INDY and HENRY. SALLAH and BRODY rush from the crumbling Temple.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
The GRAIL KNIGHT raises his arm to HENRY.
</DIRECTION>
<INDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Dad...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INDY>
<DIRECTION>
INDY and HENRY down the passageway just as a huge stone column tumbles down upon the spot where they stood. The GRAIL KNIGHT lowers his arm as he watches them leave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ENTRANCE TO MOUNTAIN TEMPLE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
