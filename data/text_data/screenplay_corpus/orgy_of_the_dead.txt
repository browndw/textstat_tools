Two "GIANTS", wearing leopard-skin shorts, iron bicep-bands and headbands, pull the heavy iron doors open revealing the INTERIOR of the MAUSOLEUM. There is an ornate stone sarcophagus in the center of the room, raised up on an altar. The back wall has a mantle with a bust of the Virgin Mary looking downward at the coffin. There is a round red window in the center of the wall. A ray of red light shines through the window, illuminating the misty fog hanging in the air.

The giants walk into the Mausoleum. They lift the heavy stone lid off of the coffin, revealing CRISWELL. He is lying in the coffin on his back, with his arms crossed over his chest and eyes closed. He is wearing black suit pants, a white shirt, a black ribbon-like bow-tie, and a black satin cape.

The Camera zooms back and we see that the Wolf Man and The Mummy are hiding behind Bob and Shirley. The Wolf Man has his hand up to his ear so he can hear what Bob and Shirley are saying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Wolf Man and The Mummy then creep over toward Criswell's throne.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Wolf Man whispers into The Princess of Darkness's ear while The Mummy and Criswell watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Princess of Darkness gets up from the throne and walks over to Shirley. Shirley grimaces. The Princess of Darkness unbuttons Shirley's blouse, then marks Shirley's abdomen with a red (blood?) cross using her long sharp fingernail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shirley screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Princess of Darkness pulls her long dagger out of her belt and raises it, staring into Shirley's eyes. Suddenly, Criswell yells:

The Princess of Darkness pauses and looks back at Criswell.

<CRISWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of symbol?

The Princess of Darkness begins ceremoniously dancing with her long sacrificial dagger, slowly moving toward shirley, gazing back at Criswell seductively. She finally gets to Shirley and cuts the button off of Shirley's shirt, which was so tight it was about to burst open anyway. She unsnaps the front of Shirley's bra.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bob sees his chance and makes his attempt at a "move," merely stepping forward. He is instantly hammer-fisted on the back of the neck by The Wolf Man, and falls down unconscious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Princess of Darkness raises her long dagger high above Shirley's head. But suddenly, the sun rises (it is already high overhead), and the night creatures lose their power. The Princess of Darkness clings to Shirley's arm, as she slowly sinks down to the ground, losing all strength.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Camera pans around, showing Shirley and Bob's faces, then back to the ghouls, all of whom have turned to steaming skeletons. Only their clothing and bones remain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quick Zoom in on Criswell's throne. Criswell's steaming skeleton still sits, surveying the cemetery, wearing his cape.

At the clearing in the woods near the car wreck, Bob and Shirley are lying on their backs on the ground, just as they were after the crash, before they got up to investigate the strange music that led them to the ghouls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are two DOCTORS examining Bob and Shirley.

NURSE crouches down and pulls out a length of medical tape, then hands it to the doctor. She cuts another piece of tape, but the Doctors don't realize this and leave her hanging...
