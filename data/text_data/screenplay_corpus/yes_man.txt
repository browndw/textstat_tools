<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you're taking this too far.

</PETER>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no choice. I'm a yes man. I must say yes. If Seb asks me to join them on their date, I must. If some dude asks me for a loan I have to give it to them even if it's clearly never going to be paid back. If a guy asks me into his bedroom, I must hook up with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hooked up with a dude?

INT. GALLERY

Carl walks around a photography gallery. Renee's photos are up. They are terrible photos, since they were taken while she was jogging. Their subjects are blurry. Some of them are half in the photo and half out. The featured photo is of Carl throwing up on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really are displaying that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>

Renee POINTS to a LARGE, BROWN PLATE that looks like poo.

	You gave me the flier, so I had to go.

</CARL>
<RENEE>

	At first I thought you were a weird stalker and I was scared. But now I think you're just a really shy dude with a crush. And while it's been suspenseful to see when/if you'd ask me out --

	I think you're being hard on yourself --

</CARL>
<RENEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not asking for sympathy. My voice is way too high-pitched, my pottery looks like poo, and my photos are blurry and subjectless. But who gives a shit? Not everything needs a goal. The world is a playground. You know that as a kid but then somewhere along the way everyone forgets.

</CARL>
<RENEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RENEE>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like say you need three hundred bucks to pay for paint so you can start a house painting business. Rather than paying a loan shark who charges you 300%, now you can come to Southwest Bank. Whatever. It's kind of dorky.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Dear Carl. I know this is kind of random, but I thought I should write you. We met at that party at Norman's apartment. I was the INS guy who hated his life and hated you. I just wanted to tell you that I took your advice. I quit my job and have founded a home in Botswana for elderly orangutans. I've never been happier. You told me to say "yes" and it has turned out to be incredible. Thank you. Yours truly, Jason Newmark

	For myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
