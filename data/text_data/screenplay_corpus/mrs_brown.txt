EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Begin on black. The sound of rain driving into trees. Something wipes frame and we are suddenly hurtling through a forest on the shoulders of a wild-eyed, kilted JOHN BROWN. Drenched hair streaming, head swivelling left and right, as he searches the lightening-dark. A crack to his left. He spins round, raises his pistol, smacks past saplings and plunges on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree and heaves for air. A face in its fifties, mad-fierce eyes, handsome, bruised lips, liverish. He goes on searching the dark. Stops. Listens through the rain. A beat. Thinking he hears a faint thump in the distance, he swings round and races on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's length, breath coming harder and harder. But even now there's a ghost grace, a born hunter's grace. He leaps fallen branches, swerves through turns in the path, eyes forward, never stumbling once.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BROWN bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and stops. With his pistol raised, he turns one full slow circle. His eyes take in every swerve and kick of the wildly swaying trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a crack and a branch snaps behind him. He spins round, bellows deep from his heart:
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God save the Queen!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
And fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing happens. The trees go on swaying, the storm goes on screaming and BROWN just stands there, staring into empty space. A pause.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, he starts to frown as the fact begins to dawn on him that he is alone. He stares at the thrashing trees, waving their mocking arms at him. His hand lets the pistol drop to his side. He feels the rain drench down his face. And now, for the first time, we see that his socks have fallen to his ankles and his knees are cut to shreds. He shifts a foot. His dress-shoes are covered in mud. He goes on staring into the dark. Nothing. Just the wind and rain. Gradually, we pull back, higher and higher. As we do, we hear the quiet cultivated voice:

Members of the Royal family and upper household hurry into the icy dining room and take their designated places at the luncheon table. Everybody is dressed in mourning and nobody speaks. Wind whistles through the open windows. Silence.

Among the diners we catch our first glimpse of BERTIE, the Prince of Wales. He is in his mid-twenties, plump, stiff dressed and balding. He stands next to his young wife, PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, who fiddles nervously with her shawl, trying to keep warm.

She flaps open her napkin and, bang on cue, everyone else sits and does the same. The meal is served immediately by waiting SERVANTS, who plonk the food down without ceremony.

It's a very ordinary meal of meat and vegetables. VICTORIA starts eating heartily, straight away. Everyone does the same.

On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock.

	So the day they arrive, she greets the Sultan and his family with barely a word and then retires to her chamber. The Sultan, not used to State Occasions without a head of State, is standing in the lobby waiting for someone to tell him what to do. But the court is under strict instructions not to talk in the corridors so nobody speaks to him, not a living soul, for the whole afternoon. So now it's dinner and everyone's standing round the table -- still not a word -- waiting for Her Majesty to arrive. One hour goes by, two, the Sultan's getting a wee bit peckish to say the least. So finally, his wee laddy breaks for the cold meats and stuffs a slice in his mouth. Well, the uproar when she heard. You'd have thought someone had stolen the crown jewels.

	Prince Leopold? Is he the one who bleeds all day? So what does his valet do? Wash his poultices for him?

Hold on BROWN. He lets it go and moves on. Across the hall, he spots the pretty ASSISTANT DRESSER watching them.

<BROWN>

</BROWN>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Aye? Then she's obviously not got enough to do.

</BROWN>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You work the system right, you could ask her yourself. Just be thankful you're not working for Household. The Queen never lets them out of her sight. But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy.

INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The next day, VICTORIA and her ladies are hurrying down a corridor on her way into the dining room. VICTORIA suddenly stops and stares out of the windows. Her entourage are several steps past her before they realize what's happened and scurry back to take up their positions behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we see what has caught her attention. BROWN is standing in the courtyard below, by his pony. She watches him for a moment, then without reacting, walks on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some hours later. It is now raining.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gaggle of ROYAL GRANDCHILDREN hurry out of a carriage from their afternoon recreational while their NANNIES frantically try to keep them dry under the umbrellas. John BROWN stands tall and erect on the gravel while they rush around him, laughing and giggling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rain on the window. VICTORIA is walking in the opposite direction down the corridor with her entourage. She stops at the same place as before.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTORIA>
<DIRECTION>
(as if she had not seem him earlier)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>

Lady Ely peers through the rain.
</DIRECTION>
<LADY_ELY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Mr Brown, ma'am.

</LADY_ELY>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is he doing there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<LADY_ELY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He appears to be ... standing by his horse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY_ELY>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I made no request to go out riding today.

	<DIALOGUE>
	How long has he been there?

<LADY_ELY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, ma'am.

<DIRECTION>
(nervously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was observed earlier, I believe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY_ELY>
<DIRECTION>
At this moment, PONSONBY comes down the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard. I have no wish to go riding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<PONSONBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm very sorry, ma'am. I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PONSONBY>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please make sure it does not happen again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<PONSONBY>

VICTORIA takes one last look and walks away.

Half an hour later, PONSONBY stands at his desk facing BROWN.
</DIRECTION>
<PONSONBY>

	What on earth did you think you were doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PONSONBY>
<DIRECTION>
BROWN stares straight back.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Awaiting my orders.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<PONSONBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it. You know that very well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PONSONBY>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<PONSONBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will await your orders like everyone else. Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.

</PONSONBY>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

<DIRECTION>
INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The next day. From a high window, we see PONSONBY scuttling madly across the courtyard towards the figure of JOHN BROWN, who is standing exactly as he was the day before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VICTORIA watches impassively.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, COURTYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PONSONBY stands close to BROWN, shouting in his face.
</DIRECTION>
<PONSONBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought I made myself perfectly clear. You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PONSONBY>
<BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
(eyes straight ahead, shouting back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her. What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
From the window above, VICTORIA takes in his words. A beat. PONSONBY collects himself.
</DIRECTION>
<PONSONBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go inside at once.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PONSONBY>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that the Queen's request?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<PONSONBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, it most certainly is!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PONSONBY>
<DIRECTION>
BROWN turns, grabs the lead rein and leads his horse back to the stables.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, STABLES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few minutes later, BROWN is in the process of stabling his horse. Suddenly he turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VICTORIA is standing at the far end of the stable with her entourage.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr Brown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, ma'am.

</BROWN>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, ma'am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why do you persist in doing it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.

</VICTORIA>
<BROWN>

Silence. The two of them stare at each other.

EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY

VICTORIA sits side-saddle on a horse. BROWN leads her in silence.

VICTORIA looks up.

	Prince Albert was going to build a bench here. He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.

	It's a fine spot, ma'am.

She stares ahead.

</VICTORIA>

She stops abruptly, but BROWN cuts in.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.

She stops again, cutting quickly back to small-talk.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTORIA>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?

<VICTORIA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cannot read them like that.

INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER SERVANT'S TABLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The clatter and crush of the Upper Servant's table as UPPER SERVANTS sit themselves down to dinner while UNDER SERVANTS prepare to serve soup.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARCHIE comes in and sits himself somewhere in the middle next to an empty seat. A moment later, BROWN strides in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But instead of sitting at the place beside his brother, he goes straight to the head of the table and plonks himself down. Slowly, the clatter dies away as the whole room stops and stares at him in silence. BROWN fixes them with a look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An elderly butler steps into the room and stares in amazement at BROWN. A smooth young man, BERTIE'S VALET, hurries up to intercede.
</DIRECTION>
<BERTIE_S_VALET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERTIE_S_VALET>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not now he doesn't. This is my place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<BERTIE_S_VALET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By whose authority?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERTIE_S_VALET>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
A little frisson of oh-my-gawdness. BERTIE'S VALET stares icily at him.
</DIRECTION>
<BERTIE_S_VALET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERTIE_S_VALET>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a tautology lad.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(unable to stop himself seriously explaining it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally. That's understood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
But as far as BERTIE'S VALET is concerned, it isn't. He stares down in mute fury, then snaps his fingers at one of the under servants, who rushes over. There is a hurried exchange of whispers before the under servant rushes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unperturbed, BROWN brings out his flask and pours himself a substantial draft of whiskey. He turns to the pretty assistant dresser, sitting to his right.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you dresser to Her Majesty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
She blinks nervously at him.
</DIRECTION>
<ASSISTANT_DRESSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Assistant, sir, yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASSISTANT_DRESSER>
<DIRECTION>
BROWN tucks into his soup. Everyone watches and waits.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<ASSISTANT_DRESSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mary Taylor, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASSISTANT_DRESSER>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<ASSISTANT_DRESSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope to go up next year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASSISTANT_DRESSER>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wouldn't happen to know what the Queen's reading for recreation, would you, Mary?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
The assistant dresser thinks for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<ASSISTANT_DRESSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lord Tennyson, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASSISTANT_DRESSER>
<DIRECTION>
BROWN nods. All conversation stops as the under servant bursts back in. She halts at the door, looking blankly from Bertie's valet to the elderly butler. A beat. The old man stiffens and makes his way to the middle of the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BROWN looks up from his soup.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I the only one eating?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
With a clatter of spoons, everyone obediently eats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, DRAWING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few days later. A morning "drawing room." Standing round the unlit fireplace are DOCTOR JENNER, LADY ELY, LADY CHURCHILL, the two LADIES IN WAITING and PRINCESS ALEXANDRA. All are dressed against the icy wind that whistles through the open window where VICTORIA sits knitting busily while BERTIE stands beside her, coat buttoned up to the collar. PONSONBY has stationed himself opposite, beside a desk piled high with red dispatch boxes. He runs through the daily itinerary.
</DIRECTION>
<PONSONBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two.

<DIRECTION>
(finishes, then coughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend. He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PONSONBY>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<PONSONBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PONSONBY>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I shall be out walking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. BERTIE watches closely now. PONSONBY coughs again, nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<PONSONBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then perhaps Your Majesty might consider it opportune if the Prince of Wales were to meet him on your behalf?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PONSONBY>
<DIRECTION>
VICTORIA stiffens. She speaks without turning.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On no account.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<DIRECTION>
PONSONBY gives up. Politely, but firmly, BERTIE takes up the reins.
</DIRECTION>
<BERTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mama, I really do think it's time we made ourselves a little more ... available.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERTIE>
<DIRECTION>
VICTORIA carries on knitting.
</DIRECTION>
<BERTIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we must accept our position in the country is not entirely unrelated to the continued absence of the Monarchy from public life.

<DIRECTION>
(silence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought perhaps we might consider a small gesture of some kind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERTIE>
<DIRECTION>
VICTORIA looks up sharply.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gesture?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<BERTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No dinners, Bertie.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you dressed for outdoors?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<BERTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's so infernally cold in here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERTIE>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cold is good--

<JENNER>

<VICTORIA>

<JENNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excellent, ma'am, excellent.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(trying his hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNER>
<VICTORIA>
<DIRECTION>
(becoming very agitated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why am I being lectured in this way?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<JENNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive me, Your Majesty. In no way did I wish to suggest--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNER>
<VICTORIA>
<DIRECTION>
(cutting across him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....

</VICTORIA>
<BERTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mother....
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERTIE>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Least of all my son. It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<DIRECTION>
An appalled silence. With great dignity, BERTIE absorbs the shock of the insult and quietly steers the conversation in another direction.
</DIRECTION>
<BERTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it is inconvenient to Her Majesty, then perhaps she might consider allowing the Prince of Wales to host--
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERTIE>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. VICTORIA has crossed to the window and stares out at the view. Having recovered her composure, she turns to address them all.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTORIA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish to take the Princesses for a swim.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment, nobody believes what they have heard. She continues.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTORIA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The turns I have been taking in the grounds have proved most beneficial to me, and Brown thinks that salt water will do me good.

<DIRECTION>
Bertie stares at her in silence while PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER exchange a worried look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRIVATE BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors of the Royal bathing-machine swing open and Queen VICTORIA, in a voluminous swim-dress, sails out like a duck into the freezing sea. As she does so, the doors of the other machines open and Princess Helena and Princess Louise follow her in. Dignity does not allow them to shout out, but their expressions of constipated agony are a picture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VICTORIA begins swimming around in a vigorous little circle.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't potter, children. Swim.

</VICTORIA>
<DIRECTION>
Hold for a moment on the princesses' miserable faces.

EXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Half an hour later, PONSONBY, DOCTOR JENNER, LADY ELY and two FOOTMEN watch as BROWN helps VICTORIA up some steps and onto her horse. He glances at the stiff line of householders and mutters curtly to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could buy that lot for garden ornaments and still see change from ten guineas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
The household do not hear this, but QUEEN VICTORIA has overheard and tries to suppress a smile. As she settles into the saddle, her foot comes loose. BROWN fastens it into the stirrups.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	... but, even though we have amassed great capital and even though we have established an industry with no parallel in the world, yet all these mighty creations are as nothing compared to the invisible customs that shape our lives. To those honorable gentlemen of the opposition who seek to destroy the essential elements of this country, I say let them remember: England cannot begin again.

</DISRAELI>
<DIRECTION>
During this peroration, we see DISRAELI for the first time. He is handsome, obviously Jewish and wire thin, like Dickens on Slimfast. He dresses almost dandyishly but speaks with startling vigor; a combination of brilliance and cheek that is his key. To cheers from his back benchers, he sits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he looks up, he catches the eye of his opposite on the Liberal benches. GLADSTONE is different in almost every respect; dour, dogged, heavy-set and tall. They stare levelly for a second, then DISRAELI flashes a brilliant smile.

Amid this swarm of activity, we glimpse BROWN opening the door to a smiling VICTORIA as she climbs down, followed by PRINCESS HELENA and PRINCESS LOUISE. Emerging from another carriage come BERTIE and PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, staring grim faced at the castle.

	... so Grant here and myself are riding over Lochnagar and the rain's pouring down in sheets and all we're thinking about is getting home for a drink, when through the gloom Grant spots a couple of poachers. He gives me a shout and we chase them down towards the loch until Grant has your men up against the stacks and he's shouting and cursing at them, "Why are you poaching on Royal land?!" And one of the little fellas looks up at him and says, "coz we've come up in the world."

For a split second, both the GRANTS look petrified, then BROWN and VICTORIA explode into laughter and the GRANTS relax. Suddenly the GRANTS are helpless with laughter too. Beginning with VICTORIA's glass, BROWN pours out liberal quantities of whiskey all round.

Foolishly, BERTIE tries to barge his way past. Suddenly BROWN loses it completely. He grabs the Prince of Wales by the shoulders and pins him back, shouting right into his face.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	LEAVE US ALONE, WHY DON'T YOU!!

</BROWN>

For a split-second, BROWN's eyes flicker as he senses he has gone too far. A look of pure venom in BERTIE'S face, then ...

A pair of doors open out onto a torchlit driveway as a mass of SERVANTS rush in and out, ferrying bags an trunks.

BROWN marches in, still charged-up from the strain of the journey's watchfulness. He spots an UNDER-PORTER snatching a break.

The next day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BROWN is on horseback, riding with VICTORIA through the grounds. He is still jumpy, eyes flicking left and right, searching for intruders. They are being followed at a distance by two EQUERRIES on horseback. VICTORIA frowns peevishly.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll decide when it's exaggerated.

BROWN chucks his horse on, bringing a firm halt to the conversation. A beat. He pulls up suddenly, staring at the shadows in the copse.

Reaching his pony, BROWN stops and smiles. The animal lifts its face to him and he softly strokes his muzzle.

	Yeah, there's a good girl.

BARNEY twitches again and BROWN realizes too late. The split-second he turns, he sees THREE MEN.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, aye...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
The MEN pile onto him and he collapses under their weight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he falls, BROWN manages to yank himself round, bang up a fist and fling the others off him. But the FIRST MAN is up again, twisting an arm round his neck and tugging him back. The others grapple his arms down, but BROWN is incredibly strong. Even now, grunting and scrabbling, he makes them fight to force him back. BARNEY stands transfixed in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dumping BROWN against the wall, the men step back and start kicking the shit out of him. BROWN curls into a ball, jaw locked, hands over his head. Not a sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, they back off, panting hard. The FIRST MAN pulls out a bottle of whiskey, yanks back BROWN's head and forces whiskey down his throat. It spills over his face and dribbles down his neck.
</DIRECTION>

BROWN sits on the edge of the bed in only his undergarments. His face, arms, legs and fingers are livid with bruises, but he sits there, stiff-backed and gritting his teeth, while ARCHIE crouches in front of him, tending to his wounds.

INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CHAPEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few minutes later, VICTORIA and DEAN WELLSELLY are seated in a corner of the chapel, talking softly. She cannot bring herself to look at him and so does not notice how carefully he is watching her throughout the interview. This is incredibly hard for her to say, but she struggles to be as honest as possible.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My husband tried always to make me think more subtly. Of course he taught me so much and I can never repay my debt to him, or the love I feel, even now. But, in truth, I think I am someone who can only feel things while they are alive to me. For that reason, I know I do not have a subtle mind. I know that. But I work hard and I try to do my duty.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she hesitates; she is struggling now)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	However, I have noticed of late that my feelings of grief are not so strong and -- that I find myself leaning more upon the comfort of living friends.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Friends close to me now.

</VICTORIA>
<DIRECTION>
She stops herself. She is crying. DEAN WELLSELLY watches her a moment, then speaks close, choosing his words carefully.
</DIRECTION>
<DEAN_WELLSELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Majesty, a settled resignation is more lasting proof of affection than active grief. If the good Lord sees fit to bring one into contact with congenial fellow beings, one should not analyze one's reaction too deeply. To allow oneself to be comforted by someone else need not imply any disloyalty to the memory of the loved one.

Silence. VICTORIA stares into the long, dark chapel. Gradually, as she takes in the tone of his remarks, her disappointment turns to anger.

INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The next day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUEEN VICTORIA is playing the piano like she walks, with great vim and vigor. The tune is some quaint Scottish ballad which she belts out in her clear strong voice, almost drowning out PRINCE ARTHUR, PRINCE LOUISE and PRINCE LEOPOLD who are meant to be accompanying her. They stand in a nervous semi-circle, fumbling their harmonies. Ignoring them completely, VICTORIA bobs up her head with a quizzical smile to make sure she is being appreciated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISRAELI and the rest of the HOUSEHOLD stand a few yards off, smiling rigidly. DISRAELI, the consummate politician to his inch-high insteps, out-smiles the lot of them. This man is in raptures of delight. And the more liquid his smiles, the happier he makes VICTORIA. He beams, she belts, until her children are drowned out completely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then, with characteristic suddenness, VICTORIA stops playing and launches into one of her tirades. The HOUSEHOLD wobbles in shock like children on a switch-back, but DISRAELI glides smoothly from delight to sober concern.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How dare the Irish break with the Anglicans? If Albert were alive today he would never allow the Crown to give up Church patronage. No, the Irish must be told, very firmly, to stay exactly where they are. It is the thin edge of the wedge, Mr Disraeli. Next, you will be telling me that the Crown no longer governs this nation.

A beat. A nervous silence in the Household.

VICTORIA has the measure of him.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli. You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<DISRAELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself. As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DISRAELI>
<DIRECTION>
The Household waits. Has he clawed himself back? VICTORIA acknowledges his apology. Her voice drops and she talks directly to DISRAELI, straight from the heart.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I stay here because I am happy.

At this moment the far door opens and BROWN walks in.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time for your walk.

</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
Without a word, VICTORIA rises from her chair and starts following him out. As they pass DISRAELI, she stops.

<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What brings you here?

</BROWN>
<DISRAELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen. It was remiss of me not to come earlier.

VICTORIA smiles. BROWN stares.

<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dare say you can be taught.

EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Staying close to the ground we develop through a series of shots showing the other highlands -- sheet rain against heather and gorse, rivulets of water slashing through mud, crude pathways sliding in wind and all ball-breakingly cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coming up the hill, we begin to make out a hunting party. The sound first. Like a small army, crashing their way up the winding path. GHILLIES urging on their horses and dogs, guns and equipment jangling off pony-hacks an then the tall figure of JOHN BROWN striding out in front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Making no concession to anyone, he force-marches them up the hill, eyes on the hunt ahead. Behind them trot the men on horseback -- DISRAELI, PONSONBY, BERTIE and other GENTLEMEN, each led by GHILLIES and ATTENDANTS, among them ARCHIE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, BROWN stops and raises a hand. The party halts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He listens for a second. Satisfied that he has found his quarry, he brings his hand down and the party of gentlemen dismount as quietly as they can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he waits, BROWN winces slightly from the pain in his side. He pulls a flask of whiskey from his sporran and drinks. All the time, DISRAELI keeps his eyes on BROWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stalking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone is now fanned out along the hillside, a ghillie to each gentleman, slowly and silently moving up the hill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISRAELI stalks with BROWN, panting hard to keep up, eyes on his man, trying to make no sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, BROWN stops. Very slowly he rises. DISRAELI rides alongside and sees ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge stag staring majestically across the hillside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keeping his movements smooth and slow, BROWN brings up his rifle, cocks it and offers DISRAELI the kill. With a deferential gesture of the hands, DISRAELI declines. BROWN stares at him a split-second, raises the rifle to his shoulder and fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A rapid montage of guns firing, as we cut to ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BROWN sweeps in from the hunt, DISRAELI dripping at his side.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
(demonstrating with his rifle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head. Then imagine it's Gladstone.

</BROWN>
<DISRAELI>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quite.

BROWN pulls out his flask and offers some to DISRAELI, who declines. He watches BROWN take a long swig.
</DIRECTION>

INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, UPPER SERVANT'S TABLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BROWN is standing at his place, drinking steadily. He has a sheet of paper and a pen and is ticking off a list. Lined up in front of him, trying desperately not to laugh, are five or six UPPER SERVANTS including the pretty ASSISTANT DRESSER and BERTIE'S VALET. They each step up, one at a time, to make their report.

<DIRECTION>
Folding up the paper, BROWN downs his glass of whiskey and sits. On his nod, dinner is served by UNDER SERVANTS amid a clatter of cutlery and chat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARCHIE looks across at his brother but BROWN is hunched over his plate, pecking at his food.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Someone titters and ARCHIE looks up. BERTIE'S VALET coughs. BROWN slowly lifts his head. His eyes have the slightly unfocused look of too much drink. It is clear to ARCHIE that he is about to be sent-up.
</DIRECTION>
<BERTIE_S_VALET>
<DIRECTION>
(with a smug smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you see any Irish assassins today, Mr Brown?

<DIRECTION>
Everyone bursts out laughing. Brown slams down his glass.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's not a soul here cares about that wee woman's safety except me! She'd die in a ditch if I wasn't there to look out for her --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
He stops. ARCHIE has come across to his brother's chair and pulls gently on his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BROWN stares at the SERVANTS. Everyone is about to burst out laughing. Keeping his dignity, he pushes back his chair and lets ARCHIE lead him away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As BROWN reaches the double doors, the laughter hits him in the back like a wave. ARCHIE holds him steady.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BROWN is lying on a grubby bed. ARCHIE is looking around the untidy room. For the first time, he notices a thick manuscript on the table. BROWN follows his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ARCHIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this?

<BROWN>

BROWN shuts his eyes and starts to drift. ARCHIE watches over him.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY

BROWN crashes out of a side-door -- just fully dressed -- to be met by the smiling figure of DISRAELI. He is got up in smart walking boots, plus-fours and a tweed jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>

	You sent for me.

	I confess, I sometimes feel as if I am not married myself, I see my wife so little. But I'm forgetting the rewards.

He looks across. BROWN keeps staring ahead.

<DISRAELI>

<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you think I keep her here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DISRAELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, but therein lies the paradox. It is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents. The longer she is away, the stronger they become; and who, honestly, can promise security against that? However many doors you lock, someone will always get in. Even here.

BROWN watches him, eyes alert.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DISRAELI>

	The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public. John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.

Close on a door as it opens. The ROYAL FAMILY are eating lunch with members of the UPPER HOUSEHOLD. VICTORIA walks in with LADY ELY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A great scraping of chairs as everyone drops their forks and stands. Clearly, they were not expecting her. In silence, VICTORIA steps up and takes her place at the head of the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At last, PONSONBY leans forward deferentially.
</DIRECTION>
<PONSONBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I say, how glad I am to see Your Majesty so much recovered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PONSONBY>

VICTORIA nods, then turns and looks about at the others. PRINCESS ALEXANDRA is seated at the far end of the table. VICTORIA frowns.

</PRINCESS_ALEXANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
VICTORIA stares blankly at DOCTOR JENNER.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You are mistaken. Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever. I asked what was wrong with my son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<JENNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The same, your Majesty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNER>
<DIRECTION>
VICTORIA stops. She stares down the length of the table. A long pause.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why was I not informed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<JENNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves.

Suddenly, VICTORIA stands. Chairs bang back as everyone leaps to their feet.

<VICTORIA>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We must leave at once.

Abruptly, VICTORIA turns for the door and the room erupts into activity.

INT. BALMORAL CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY

BROWN stands in the corridor, a little nonplussed by the servants and Householders hurrying about in every direction.

EXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Half an hour later, BROWN races up to the Queen's carriage amid a swarm of servants, ladies' maids and Householders rushing to be ready in time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the huge castle doors open and VICTORIA bustles out with her entourage in tow. BROWN -- only just in time - yanks open the door for VICTORIA to step past him and take her place. She ignores him completely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BROWN slams the doors. As he looks up, he sees his brother ARCHIE staring at him from across the courtyard. For a second the two brothers hold each other's gaze. It's obvious that ARCHIE has noticed the Queen's indifference. BROWN turns away and mounts the box as the carriage races away under him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, PRINCE'S BEDCHAMBER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some days later. A tableau.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUEEN VICTORIA sits at the foot of the bed, a matriarch surrounded by her ROYAL FAMILY. They watch DOCTOR JENNER bend to examine the ghostly figure of BERTIE. He listens for a pulse. Finally, he looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNER>
<DIRECTION>
VICTORIA lets out a deep breath. She takes hold of PRINCESS ALEXANDRA'S hand.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should the good Lord see fit to spare my son, I will order a mass to be celebrated at St. George's. The people must share with their Queen, her prayers and hopes for their future King.

INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CORRIDOR OUTSIDE BEDCHAMBER - DAY
</DIRECTION>

A few minutes later, BROWN stands in the corridor when the door bursts open and VICTORIA marches straight past him with PONSONBY at her side.
</DIRECTION>
<PONSONBY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	The Queen will be riding to St. George's on the fifth.

(cutting in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will ride to St. George's in an open carriage. It is time the Queen was seen by her public.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<DIRECTION>
VICTORIA turns and disappears down the corridor, followed by PONSONBY. We linger on BROWN'S humiliation, closer and closer until ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, ST. GEORGE'S - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some weeks later.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A series of angles on BROWN as he walks amid the mass of onlookers pressing against a cordon of guards surrounding the cathedral. All the time, his eyes flick left and right, searching the faces in front of him for potential assassins. Over his intense watchfulness we hear ...
</DIRECTION>
<DEAN_WELLSELLY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... praise and magnify thy glorious name for that thou has raised thy servant Albert Edward, Prince of Wales from the bed of sickness. We pray thee to perfect the recovery of thy servant and to crown him day by day with more abundant blessings both for body and soul, through Jesus Christ our Lord ...

</CONGREGATION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, ST. GEORGE'S - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VICTORIA and other members of the ROYAL FAMILY walk down the steps towards the cheering crowd. As DEAN WELLSELLY and BROWN follow, BROWN sees ARTHUR O'CONNER break from the onlookers, pulling out a gun. BROWN yells out:
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NO!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
He races toward O'CONNER and hits him flying, bangs him to the ground and twists the gun out of his hand. As they fall we hear laughter and:
</DIRECTION>
<BERTIE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	So there he is, Arthur O'Conner...

</BERTIE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, DINING HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a few days later and BERTIE is entertaining a private dinner party. They include QUEEN VICTORIA, PRINCESS ALEXANDRA, PRINCESS LOUISE and HENRY PONSONBY. BROWN is in attendance. He stands off to one side, near the door.
</DIRECTION>
<BERTIE>
<DIRECTION>
(bristling with confidence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... all seven stone of the man, paddling madly towards us through a sea of Horse Guards, waving something that looks vaguely like a pen. I thought he must be one of the mother's ardent readership in search of the Royal indenture...

</BERTIE>
<DIRECTION>
More chortling. VICTORIA watches her son, smiling proudly. BROWN looks straight ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<BERTIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe I saw him first and then alerted Brown. I'm not convinced that he wasn't taking a snooze on top of the box. Anyway, we had our man pinned down and I must say, Brown acquitted himself admirably. Of course the gun was a fake, but all the same, it was well done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BERTIE>
<DIRECTION>
No-one registers BROWN. But while VICTORIA does not look at him, she is acutely aware of his presence.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTORIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I intend Brown to be rewarded with a special medal cast in gold. It will be called The Devoted Service Medal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTORIA>
<DIRECTION>
The guests applaud politely. BERTIE clinks his glass for attention and raises it high.
</DIRECTION>
<BERTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A toast. Victoria Regina!

</BERTIE>
<DIRECTION>
The others raise their glasses in unison.

VICTORIA smiles. BROWN remains alone by the door.

DISRAELI is delivering his come-back speech at a banquet of Tory delegates.

If the first great object of the Tory Party is to maintain the institutions of the country, the second is, in my opinion, to maintain the Empire of England ... the hereditary, the traditionary policy of the Tory Party.

INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of rain driven hard against a window. We creep slowly down the corridor until we are back with the fifty year-old BROWN. With his whiskey for company, he is sitting at his desk, writing in the diary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The diary-manuscript is now falling apart with wear, but there remain a few blank pages. Slowly, he fills them in.
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We should not live in expectation of contentment. Fifteen years of vigilance will not guarantee peace of mind. Yesterday, intruders were again reported in the South Wing. I believe my prompt arrival may have averted any crisis, but it was a timely reminder. It is a great comfort to me that my efforts in securing the Queen's safety over the years have not been in vain. Certainly Her Majesty sends me no word that she's dissatisfied. And I feel sure that if she were unhappy she would have found the occasion to speak to me in person, as she has so often done in the past.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
A knock at the door.

<BROWN>

BROWN grabs his gun and rushes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUADRANGLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BROWN appears at the door and strides into the storm. He walks quickly across the wide quadrangle, rain soaking his hair and clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two GUARDS watch BROWN as he races out into the storm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A coin flips through the air to be caught by an outstretched hand. The second GUARD grins.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BROWN races across the open ground towards the forest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

And now we are back with the opening sequence. Truncated, severe, and shot from a slightly different angle. The driving rain, BROWN hurtling through the trees, the crack to his left, he spins and plunges on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT

Close-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree, heaving for air. He searches the dark, stops, listens and races on.

EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's length.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pistol raised, he turns a circle, eyes on the wildly swaying trees. A branch snaps behind him. He spins round, bellows deep from his heart:
</DIRECTION>
<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God save the Queen!!

And fires.

INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CORRIDOR - NIGHT

A few days later.

VICTORIA is moving swiftly down a long corridor with LADY ELY. They arrive at a door. VICTORIA stands facing it.

LADY ELY doesn't answer. VICTORIA knows anyway. She nods. LADY ELY knocks. The door is opened by a young UNDER SERVANT who gawps at the sight of Her Majesty standing here in the servant's quarters. VICTORIA walks in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room has been cleared of bottles, but the thinness of the life here shocks her deeply. The cheap furniture, the anonymous prints, the bed and, finally, the sight of BROWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is lying in bed, barely conscious. After a moment, he opens his eyes and stares at her. She steps forward, smiling nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her voice is the old voice, between friends.

She starts to cry.

<BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be silly, woman.

</BROWN>
<DIRECTION>
His old, familiar gruffness makes her smile and she pulls herself together. Seeing a bowl of water on the side table, she steps across. Carefully folding a cloth in four, she rinses it in the water and gently wipes his face. Leaning closer, she is about to touch his face when BROWN gestures protectively.
