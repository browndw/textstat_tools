:SC: PRIMEVAL SWAMP - EARLY DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is very early in the dawn - blue light filters through the jungle and across a foul swamp. A mist clings to the trees. This could be the jungle of a million years ago.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our VIEW MOVES CLOSER, through the mist, TILTING DOWN to the tepid water. A small bubble rises to the surface; then another. Suddenly, but quietly, a form begins to emerge; a helmet. Water and mud pour off revealing a set of beady eyes just above the mud. Printed on a helmet, in a psychedelic hand, are the words: "Gook Killer." The head emerges revealing that the tough-looking soldier beneath has exceptionally long hair and beard; he has no shirt on, only bandoliers of ammunition - his body is painted in an odd camouflage pattern. He looks to the right; he looks to the left; he looks INTO CAMERA, and slowly sinks back into the swamp, disapperaring completely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our VIEW HOLDS, We begin to HEAR natural, though unrecognizable JUNGLE SOUNDS, far off in the distance. We PAN TO REVEAL a clump of logs half submerged in the swamp; and part of what seems to be a Falstaff beer can in the mud. A hand reaches out, and the beer can disappears. As we TILT UP, we NOTICE that the log is hollow and houses the rear of a M-60 machine gun, hand painted in a paisley design.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the VIEW MOVES AWAY, ACROSS the ancient growth, PAST the glimmer of what seems to be another soldier hiding in ambush, wearing an exotic hat made from birds and bushes. ACROSS to a dark trail where the legs of those in black pajamas move silently across our ever TIGHTENING VIEW. Their feet, boots and sandals leave no impression; make no sound. A slight flicker of light reveals a pair of eyes in the foliage across the path, waiting and watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The VIEW PUSHES ALONG WITH the Vietnamese, MOVING FASTER AND FASTER WITH them, until suddenly, directly in front about ten feet away, an enormous AMERICAN clad in rags and bushes and holding a 12 gauge automatic shotgun casually at his side, steps in front of them. He smiles laconically, and BLASTS OUT FIVE SHOTS that rip THROUGH US. By the second shot, the whole jungle blazes out with AUTOMATIC FIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out VIEW TURNS as the men around us are thrown and torn, screaming and scattering into the jungle. More AMERICANS appear; unexplainably, out of the growth. It is now that we fully SEE the bizarre manner in which they are dressed. Some wear helmets, others wear strange hats made from feathers and parts of animals. Some of them have long savage-looking hair; other crew-cut or completely shaved; they wear bandoliers, flak jackets, shorts and little else. They wear Montagnard sandals or no shoes at all, and their bodies and faces are painted in bizarre camouflage patterns. They appear one with the jungle and mist, FIRING INTO US as they move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The soldier we saw earlier emerges from the swamp, dripping mud, his MACHINE GUN BLASTING FIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We begin to move quickly with one Vietnamese, breathlessly running for his life; we MOVE INTO the jungle with him, only to be impaled on a large spear of a smiling AMERICAN painted and wearing feathers like an Indian. OUR VIEW FALLS WITH him to the ground, STARING UPWARDS, as FLAME and EXPLODING MUD scatter above us. Men scream and die around us. The screams amid the GUNFIRE and EXPLOSIONS are piercing and terrible, as though the jungle itself is frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An AMERICAN wearing a jungle hat with a large Peace Sign on it, wearing war paint, bends TOWARD US, reaching down TOWARD US with a large knife, preparing to scalp the dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUR VIEW MOVES AWAY, along with the running sandals of a Vietnamese soldier, MOVING FASTER AND FASTER, only to be stopped by still another of the savage-looking AMERICANS with primitive ornamentation, wearing only a loin-cloth and green beret. He opens his flame-thrower directly ON US and the NVA soldier and we are incinerated in flame, bright psychedelic orange-red flame. Outrageous, loud, electric ROCK MUSIC OVERWHELMS the SOUNDTRACK :

MAIN TITLE : APOCALYPSE NOW

:SC: TITLE SEQUENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CREDIT TITLES proceed as the FLANE CONSUME US, growing more intense, brighter, more vivid, purifying; transforming into an intense white heat that we can barely look at, like the sun itself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then it EXPLODES, breking apart, and shattering once again. It begins to cool, as the TITLES CONTINUE. It is as though WE ARE MOVING through the white center of cooling flame, forming a spinning web, and becoming more distant. The TITLES CONTINUE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are MOVING TOWARD planetary nebulae; MOVING through the stars; MOVING closer to the Earth. We can BARELY HEAR the MUSIC now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We MOVE CLOSER to the earth; beautiful, covered in clouds, as though SEEN from a satellite. The TITLES CONTINUE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are MOVING CLOSER to the earth; through the soft clouds, close enough that we can MAKE OUT the Western Hemisphere; CLOSER to North America; CLOSER, to America, then California; Los Angeles, STILL CLOSER to the odd, finger-like shapes of :

The VIEW finally SETTLES ON a partically luxury cabin cruiser harbored at a particular dock late in the day.

It is large, pleasure boat: The people are relaxing in bathing suits and towels and robes. They are drinking cocktails, and snapping pictures. The boat belongs to the head of a large American Corporation, and this is his party. This man, CHARLIE, is sitting, his shirt off to catch some of the late sun. Others have their faces smeared with white suntan oil that reminds us of war paint. Charlie is going on and on :

Gradually, Charlie's voice softens as we MOVE AWAY, and a NEW VOICE, the voice of someone thinking, COMES IN OVER it :

A Saigon boom street in late 1968. There are bars and shops for servicemen; the rickshaws, the motorbikes. Our VIEW MOVES TOWARD one particular officer; B.L. WILLARD , in uniform, a Captain of the Airborne, followed by four or five Vietnamese kids trying to shine his shoes and sell him things.

Not much in this place -- a bar, linoleum flooring, a few tables and chairs, and a juke box. The lounge is fairly crowded. Willard takes off his cap and walks quietly past the soldiers at the bar. Some of them, catching sight of his ribbons, stop talking as he moves by.

An INFANTRY CAPTAIN enters the bar, buys a couple of drinks and approaches Willard's table.

	You know, I can remember once, getting back below the DMZ -- and the first Americans we ran into were a track squadron. I just couldn't believe how much water they had. We'd been chewing bamboo shoots for almost a week, and before that, for two weeks, we'd been drinking anything -- rain water, river shit, stuff right out of the paddies. And there were these guys standing by their trucks spilling water all over. I could've killed them.

A door swings wide -- Willard steps through and comes to attention, blocking the view of the room. A strange reddish light pervades. The room is covered with plastic maps and filled with smoke.

	About the same time -- large numbers of Montagnards of the M'Nong descent began leaving the area -- this in itself is not unusual since these people have fought with the Rhade Tribe that lived in the area for centuries. But what is unusual is that we began to find Rhade refugees too -- in the same sampans as the M'Nongs. These people aren't afraid of V.C. They've put up with war for twenty years -- but something is driving them out.

To counter their need of course are the moat, punji stakes and barbed wire -- but implementing this are seven "riot control positions" equipped with the lastest in teargas launchers, attack-trained German shep- herds and assorted psychological warfare aides.

Finally the blades are trimmed and a strange silence descends over the men. The door of the copter slides partially open -- two young Green Berets step out with M-16's to varied catcalls. When this abates a young, extremelly well-dressed man emerges. He is the epitome of a Hollywood AGENT.

JETS SCREAM over and the two gunships pull up at 200 feet. Another Huey zooms in low and lands behind the Colonel's.

<WILLARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mostly from the imprints when they put them down to rest. their morale from the way they drag their feet, or the joints that may be lying around. If they're near a base camp, they wouldn't be conserving food; they'll be throwing it away half-eaten. If the branches aren't broken, their weapons are slung. But all this is just technique.. There's a feeling you get after a while, that's what's important. I was going through a village once. I was looking for a certain party. I took off my boots, and walked into each hut. It was midnight. I went into three like that and suddenly I realized I´d gone into each hut the same way -- standing up -- so the next one I went in on my belly. An RPD burst took out the door a bit above my head.

They walk toward a patch of black elephant grass; their guns at the ready. They look at each other. Willard is cold, methodical, doing something he knows well. There is a noise again -- some of the growth rustles. He and Chef move a distance apart, and join in stalking the probable V.C. Willard directs the Chef with hand gestures, and bird and cricket sounds. They move stealthily, closing the apex of their triangle on the hunted. The two men drop low into the elephant grass, and remain motionless. Then Willard makes the cricket noise, and they move closer. Willard's left hand edges out along the M-16's far end, so that he only has to point the finger of that hand and he will hit what he wants. He makes another command and they rush the trapped enemy.

The Spotter moves down to where a tall lanky SOLDIER is leaned up against the trench. He kicks him hard several times. Roach wakes and just looks up. On his helmet are the words: "GOD BLESS DOW."

<ROACH>

	No, it´s cool.

</ROACH>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the breech of his shotgun-like weapon and plunks the big slug into it. He snaps it closed then rests it across his forearm over the trench -- he listens to the SCREAM, calculating.
</DIRECTION>
<ROACH>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's close -- real close.

It is dark. She leads him into her room and closes the door. He stands there. In the center of the room is a large canopied bed with mosquito netting hanging down over it.

POV BOAT - FULL SHOT - JUNGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The canopy of trees grows taller and stretches out across the river filtering the sun. The forest itself has grown darker and more twisted with ferns and creepers. Strange birds fly out of the trees as the boat passes -- a huge snake slips along an overheading limb. The depth of the jungle is dark, ominous -- yet cool and strangely inviting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - BOAT - JUNGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the river widens, the trees give way to marsh and as they emerge into the light a strange shadow falls upon the boat. It is the shadow cast by an enormous vertical tail section of a B-52 bomber thrusting out from the mud. Pieces of aluminum hang loosely from it, oxi- dizing in the sun. Creepers have already started to grow up around its heights -- the jungle is claiming it. But once under its shadow, they have passed a gateway. A gateway to paradise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The river widens and the trees at its edge are soft and seductive. The hills beyond are purple and lush. Strange orange colored water-fowl swim lazily out of their way. The water itself is glass smooth and black as if there were no bottom. The sun is warm and the breeze gentle and laced with wild gardenians. It is indeed the most peaceful valley in all the world and each man looks upon it and has never known such a sense of peace and well- being.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Each man in his heart feels a need to stay -- his soul cries to stop -- stop their madness -- this spiral into hell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Here is all that can be had of earth. But no hand moves. The boat drifts on its own toward a hole at the end of the clearing. A hole into the jungle from which a darkness permeats. The boat follows the river into this hole.

	Toward the night of the fifth day out of Do Lung Bridge, we judged ourselves about eight miles from Kurtz' base.

WHAT THEY SEE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hundreds and hundreds of Montagnard natives -- dressed in the most ornate and primitive manner: feathers, parts of birds and animals; cod-pieces -- all in body and face paint of the most savage nature. But there is a purity about them, men and boys, standing passively watching the small Navy craft flying the strange flag of red, white and blue.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men of the crew are not the same men who began this voyage. Their manner is lifeless as though in a trance. The various decorations and paraphenelia that they have picked up along the way seem oddly relevant to the savages that stand before them. The Chef has made a hat of birdfeathers; Lance's face has been painted with mud under the eyes to block the glare of the sun. He wears certain animal skins; trinkets; some animal teeth. Their uniforms have been torn and patched throughout the difficult journey. They start to move to their gun positions.

MOVING SLOWLY TOWARD the fantastic human wall of feathers and war paint, standing on canoes across the river. The men on the crew stand in a group, their hands visibly without weapons. The natives standing across the river make no hostile gestures as they approach. They accept the small boat moving toward them with a sort of inevi- tability. The boat moves closer, approaches the wall of feathers -- which slowly and automatically gives away, in almost a ritual of birth, undulating, allowing the little boat to penetrate.

A thick greasy smoke hangs from fires that burn near the fort; fresh shell craters indicate a recent battle. Near the dock there is a tangled clump of corpses -- half sub- merged in the water. Other piles of bodies lie about, some of them on fire. Fire literally burns from out of the ground. Chef nods at the bodies.

MOVING VIEW - WILLARD, MOONBY AND THE CREW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they proceed closer to the fortress-temple, men appear where a moment before there was only jungle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are mostly Montagnards, but far more savage looking than any we've seen before. They wear only loinclothes and bandoliers of ammunition. their bodies are painted in strange patterns. They carry Army M-16's, Russian AK-47's and a wide variety of knives and clubs. Women emerge from the brush as well. they are armed and equally primitive looking. Interspersed among them are a few taller men with paler skins, with the remnants of Army insignia on them. The paint on their bodies is, if anything more bizarre. We CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS the entire group up to the stone gates of the fort, where thirty or so more are seen silhouetted against the sky. Willard and his men look up at people more primitive and more savage than any since the time of Captain Cook.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They encounter, in the center of the group, what once appears to have been an American. he is tall, gaunt, wears a flak jacket, but is otherwise naked, save a loincloth. His face is darkened from dirt, battle smoke, strange camouflage patterns. His hair and beard are long, matted with mud and grease. He carries an AK-47 decorated with scalps and human ears. Willard approaches this beast, who seems shy and retiring.

Suddenly, frightened, he stops. Without looking Willard knows that Kurtz is standing behind him. He turns.

Kurtz has stepped out from his headquarters: He is a powerful man, though obviously very ill. He slowly attempts to pull the remnants of his uniform together, though it is ripped and bloodied, and now combined with primitive ornaments designating him a tribal chief, as well as his U.S.A. Colonel's insignia. He is feverish, with long blonde hair and beautiful features. His eyes almost hypnotize. His midsection is bandaged from what seems to be a serious wound.

There is a long pause, as the two men regard each other. Then Willard reaches to his holstered .45 -- withdraws it, and places it on the dirt before Kurtz, as an act assuring Kurtz that he is not an assasin.

FULL SHOT - WALL - WILLARD, CHEF , LANCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willard walks along the top of a thick wall -- sandbagged and dug out every so often for an M-60 or a mortar emplacement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wild looking savages man these guns, and seem to bow to Willard as he passes.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is good -- triple overlapping fields of fire -- walls so thick ordinary artillery just cleans the moss off their surfaces.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLARD>
<DIRECTION>
A woman tentatively moves to Willard, bowing, and then runs off to her bunker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE ARE TRACKING with them as they move past the groups of people, huddled by their fires... men, women and children. Skulls, shrunken and otherwise hang from every hut -- adorn every sandbagged bunker -- dried scalps hang from barbed wire. A child is chewing on a big piece of almost raw meat.

</WILLARD>
<DIRECTION>
They continue past amount where the shattered wreck of half a helicopter is laying. It has been altered and fortified with sandbags and concertina wire. The wreck lays on its side so that a 7.62 mini-gun that was mounted there sticks up above the sandbags. The emplacement is built on amound so the gun commands a clear field of fire into the jungle beyond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some Americans, barely recognizible because of their beards and savage manner, sit near the gun. Several Montagnard children giggle at their feet and play with bayonets.
</DIRECTION>

INT. KURTZ HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

VIEW FROM INSIDE -- Willard approaches the stakes with the shrunken heads. Chef and Lance with him. Willard steps in -- Lance and the Chef crouch outside, waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILLARD'S VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An austere stone savern in the temple: Kurtz's head- quarters. Electric lights hanging in odd contrast to the ancient stone. We SEE what is left of the maps and other military charts -- they had been tacked up on big boards, but have now fallen into decayed disuse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are other indications of the modern headquarters this had been. Now all those things are no longer impor- tant. Kurtz sits alone, slumped back in a wicker chair. There is a large wooden planning table next to him, with maps, lamps and apile of debris that is practically garbage. There are native decorations to ward off evil spirits; and graffiti on the stone walls, things ranging fromm "Viet Nam, love it or leave it" to quotes of Nietzsche "Nothing is true -- everything is permitted."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moonby, who had been crouching in a corner, moves to Willard.
</DIRECTION>
<MOONBY>

	You're gonna get hit tonight, bad -- a whole regiment of NVA regulars.

</WILLARD>
<KURTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, the little gook- pricks. But they are noble little gook-pricks, noble. Because they fight with their guts, like animals. And for an idea ! That's rich. We fight with ingenious machines and fire, like Gods, and for nothing. But I'll call in a major blotto airstrike tonight. We'll have ourselves a helluva airstrike tonight, a lightshow. How do you like The Doors': 'C'mon Baby Light My Fire...'

Suddenly Kurtz is seized with a terrible pain from his stomach wound. He groans horribly, clutching at it. He literally falls from his chair onto the dirt floor.
</DIRECTION>
<KURTZ>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)

Willard moves to the table, opens the medical packet. He takes out a morphine capsule, leans over the writhing Kurtz and injects him with the drug.
</DIRECTION>
<KURTZ>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see how stupid it would have been to blow out my brains? I'm dying from the gut anyway.

Willard quickly prepares another shot. Kurtz, truly frightened, holds up his hand.

Kurtz watches as invaders swarm through his domain. Women and children rush upon him now. Kurtz flicks some switch- es and the whole north wall EXPLODES in overwhelming FIRE. The gates are uprooted. The stone lions tumble, crushing men below. Kurtz cocks an M-16 and walks off the bunker.

MED. SHOT - DIFFERENT ANGLE - KURTZ
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rounds the shadow wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kurtz sees a group of Viets and rushes up and prepares a machine gun mount. They don't see him. He braces the gun at his side and steps out.

</KURTZ>
<DIRECTION>
They stagger and fall, shattered and bleeding, save one who's merely lost his weapon. Kurtz looks at him, his gun empty. He drops it and flips open the flap of his holster. The Viet soldier goes for his pistol. Kurtz beats him to the draw and bloes him into the night. He moves over to pick up the NVA light machine gun. Holding it at his hip, he stands atop one of the ruined walls and FIRES into the masses. His native men see him and rush for the chance to die beside him. They are quickly encircled by onrushing Viets and are being overrun. The machine gun jams and Kurtz grabs a rifle. When it's empty and the bayonet is off he wields it as a club.

FULL VIEW - THE FORTRESS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The air strike hits with all its force. Balls and rain of fire sweeps down on the temple, the enemy, everything. It is the biggest firework show in history.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wall Kurtz was standing on, and he falls with it. Willard sees this and makes his way toward him as the air strike continues. All around us is a spectacle of MUSIC and light and fire and overwhelming color.

Willard slings Kurtz's bleeding body around his neck, holding his hand, dragging hom through the jungle. The spectacle continues in the b.g.

This wreck of a boat is still afloat. Willard crawls out of the jungle, carrying the dying Kurtz and manages to get him onto the boat.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE TEMPLE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entire temple is devastation. Vultures by the hundreds circle overhead. There are a few survivors. Everywhere is smoke and heaps of bodies. Colby, a Sergeant, and some Montagnards sit near them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes are red and glazed, their jaws hang slack and they tumble occasionally. They stagger away from the field of slaughter. Willard looks down and sees something. Moves over to it, kicks several bodies away and in the f.g. below is Lance, dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colby stumbles over. Willard holds Lance up by his hair.

<COLBY>

TIGHTER VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colby is at helm. Kurtz lies feverish, delirious. Willard sits by him. As the boat moves, Montagnards, those left alive, come and pay their respects by the riverbanks. Colby takes an automatic weapon and FIRES it into the air. Some of the natives move in terror, frightened of him. The battle is not over.
</DIRECTION>
<KURTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't. Don't frighten them away.

Willard looks down at him.

<WILLARD>

Kurtz looks up at him, past him with fury, longing in his eyes. There is a slight smile.

</WILLARD>
<DIRECTION>
Kurtz looks up to him, then an expression of overwhelming intense and hopeless terror, hopeless despair. A whisper at some image, at some vision, he cries out twice, a cry that is no more than a breath.
</DIRECTION>
<KURTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The horror, the horror.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURTZ>
<DIRECTION>
We HEAR the distant SOUND of HELICOPTERS approaching. The SOUND of ROTORS in the distance. They look up, craning their eyes at the sky. Colby points.

Pause. Willard is very silent.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never answered questions about Kurtz -- I gave them a few of his unimportant papers -- but for the most part I saved everything. There were other letters, personal ones written earlier to his wife. I brought them to het. I watched the fall of Saigon on television in a bar in Alameda...

EXT. CALIFORNIA NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bright clear day in a scrubbed-clean California neigh- borhood. Some kids are playing in the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willard, years later, dressed as a civilian, proceeds past the lawn to the attractive home, carrying a packet under his arm. He passes a lanky, young teen-aged boy working on a motor-scooter. Willard looks at him. The boy looks back.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLARD>
<DIRECTION>
Then the door opens, and KURTZ'S WIFE is standing at the door. She is still beautiful, blonde, and dressed in mourning even though she doesn't wear black. There is a sense of purity about her, though she is not young.
