EXT. CLEVELAND STREET - NIGHT (1970)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rain. Christmas lights. A rusted out '56 Lincoln rattles down the bleak boulevard. In it: JOE STEVENS, an angry, black man in his late 20's, beside him his 10-year-old son, JOE JR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe Jr. stares out the window at passing: boarded buildings, whores with raincoats over their heads trying to flag down a john, a black Santa, a knot of drinkers. Breaking the silence:
</DIRECTION>
<JOE_STEVENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your mother okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE_STEVENS>
<JOE_JR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE_JR>
<DIRECTION>
They stop at a light. Joe Stevens tries to furtively snort a little something. He spots Joe Jr. watching.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE_STEVENS>
<DIRECTION>
(firm, without irony)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you do this shit, boy. Don't you ever fuckin' touch it, you hear me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE_STEVENS>
<DIRECTION>
Joe Jr. stares, silent; Joe Jr.'s about to hit him.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE_STEVENS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hear me, goddam it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE_STEVENS>
<DIRECTION>
The boy nods. Satisfied, Joe Sr. draws in the stuff. It makes him feel good, strong, worried and determined all at once.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE_STEVENS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; charged up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want for Christmas?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE_STEVENS>
<JOE_JR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE_JR>
<JOE_STEVENS>
<DIRECTION>
(light changes; he accelerates)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know?? You gotta know what you want, boy, if you ever expect to get it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE_STEVENS>
<DIRECTION>
A sudden charm to his bravado. Joe Jr. smiles uncertainly. Joe Sr. grins back, pulls up in front of a liquor store.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE_STEVENS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait here. This won't take a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE_STEVENS>
<DIRECTION>
Joe Jr. doesn't notice or doesn't remark that his father, just before entering the store, draws a handgun from beneath his coat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy gazes dreamily at the street. The lunatic Black Santa marches by, ranting to himself ("Then the white man say..."). The RAIN HAMMERS on the roof and windshield. Joe Jr. breathes on the glass, fogging the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the store: MUFFLED GUNFIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe Jr. looks that way. Another GUNSHOT, then:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His father comes out the door clutching money in one hand. He strides toward the car with a reckless pride. He doesn't notice:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The liquor store door opens behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHOTGUN BLAST. Joe Stevens' guts splatter onto the car windshield. A look of terrible amazement; he sinks to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE_JR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE_JR>
<DIRECTION>
He jumps from the car, kneels by his father.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STORE OWNER (47, Slavic) drags the gun toward them, bleeding profusely.
</DIRECTION>
<STORE_OWNER>
<DIRECTION>
(enraged, almost to tears)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuckin' niggers... fuckin' niggers...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORE_OWNER>
<DIRECTION>
JOE STEVENS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looks at the money in his hand: two 20's, two 5's.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE_STEVENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifty bucks... fifty goddam bucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks up at his son)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE_STEVENS>
<DIRECTION>
He stuffs the blood-soaked bills in the boy's shirt pocket and dies. Joe Jr. looks up at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE STORE OWNER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bloody, nearly unconscious, he aims the shotgun at the boy who is too frightened to move.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE_JR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Mister...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE_JR>
<DIRECTION>
The man dies on his feet. As he falls backward, he pulls the trigger, the BLAST shattering the car windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cop cars SQUEAL up. Uniformed cops leap out, guns drawn, survey the scene. Then one notices Joe Jr., staring motionless at his father and the store owner, dead together. ON HIS EYES:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THOSE SAME EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- but older, harder, colder. They're concentrating on a paper before him.

TITLE: 17 YEARS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - THE MINNESOTA MULTIPHASIC PERSONALITY INVENTORY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hundreds of TRUE/FALSE questions...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1.) I have never indulged in any unusual sexual practices. (T/F)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
2.) I have often felt that strangers were looking at me critically. (T/F)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
3.) When I was young I occasionally stole things. (T/F)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe Stevens marks these TRUE, FALSE, FALSE then comes to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
4.) A person's station in life is at least partially determined by his race. (T/F) We are:

<DIRECTION>
INT. A ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thirty-seven Black Cleveland police officers (many in uniform, including Joe) are taking the MMPI. Some roll their eyes at the questions. Some try to copy answers. Others, like Joe, work with rapid concentration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he gets stuck on #4. Marks it false. Erases it. Marks it true. Erases that. Ponders. Goes on to: #5. At times I hear so well it bothers me. (T/F) He marks that true.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GERALD CARVER, 36, an ambitious government lawyer with a relaxed, vaguely hip manner, looks over the file of the ingratiating BLACK OFFICER sitting across the desk from him.
</DIRECTION>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Officer Leland? You know the difference between a black man and nigger?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
Leland is startled, insulted, but doesn't want to blow the interview. He smiles weakly, shakes his head no.
</DIRECTION>
<CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; pleasant smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, most niggers don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
Stung, Leland tries to laugh. Carver puts his file aside, picks up another.
</DIRECTION>
<CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice to meet you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAME - ANOTHER INTERVIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SECOND BLACK OFFICER is powerfully built, politically conscious, takes no shit. Carver's leafing through his file.
</DIRECTION>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Winston, what's the difference between a black man and a nigger?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
Winston is out of his chair before the question is finished, drags Carver by the shirt front halfway across the desk and hisses into his face:
</DIRECTION>
<WINSTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the fuck do you think you're talking to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINSTON>
<DIRECTION>
Carver smiles cheerfully past Winston's cocked fist.
</DIRECTION>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for coming in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
Nonplussed by this cool dismissal, Winston stalks out. Carver picks up the next file, unfazed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAME - ANOTHER INTERVIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe Stevens watches Carver reading his file and waiting for an answer. When none is forthcoming, Carver glances up, finds Stevens looking right back at him.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The nigger's the one who falls for your bullshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVENS>
<DIRECTION>
He says it pleasantly, without belligerence. Carver smiles: he's found his man. He offers his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gerald Carver, United States District Attorney. Call me Gerry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. A DARKENED ROOM - DAY/NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON A TV SCREEN: a grainy black-and-white tape, date and time stamped at the bottom. A grungy street, palm trees. The light from the monitor dimly illuminates Carver and Stevens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On SCREEN the CAMERA finds: A MAN in jeans, sneakers and sweatshirt on a street corner.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He ought to be wearing a sign.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVENS>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can tell he's a cop?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
Stevens laughs: it's obvious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A real DRUG DEALER joins the cop. UNDERCOVER COP: "You got it?" DEALER: "In the motel, right over here..." The Cop's uneasy, keeps glancing back toward the CAMERA as they go.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He keeps looking for his back-up. Now, the other guy knows it, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVENS>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why's he taking him to the room?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<STEVENS>
<DIRECTION>
(why else?)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To rip him off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVENS>
<DIRECTION>
Carver studies Stevens in the darkness, impressed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SCREEN: The figures disappear into the motel. We hear their voices. DEALER: "Here, try some of it." UNDERCOVER COP: "Uhh... No, I don't..." DEALER: "Why not, you sonofabitch?" Two bursts of SOUND DISTORTION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A plainclothes cop, TAFT, (black, stocky, powerful) bolts from behind the CAMERA, sprints toward the motel. The CAMERA wobbles after him.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVENS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVENS>
<DIRECTION>
ON SCREEN: The CAMERA (jerky, hand-held) nears the open motel door. Taft is bent over the Undercover Cop's body.
</DIRECTION>
<TAFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Bobby... Jesus, Jesus...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the CAMERA)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get an ambulance -- and back up. Now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAFT>
<DIRECTION>
He slams the wall, starts past the CAMERA. Carver pushes the pause button; the tape freezes on a jerky image of Taft's face.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVENS>
<DIRECTION>
(focussed on Taft)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVENS>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charles Taft. LAPD Narcotics.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<STEVENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a good cop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVENS>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a great cop. Two [names citation] and a [another citation]. As tough as they come and twice as honest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
Carver watches Stevens watch Taft, smiles at something.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the cops aren't getting it done here, are they? Gotta try something new...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVENS>
<DIRECTION>
He opens a manila envelope, dumps the contents on the desk: driver's license, social security card, high school transcript, prison records... all in the name of William G. Hull. No photos.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVENS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's John Hull?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVENS>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are. If you want to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Stevens)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most undercover guys don't know what they're doing because it's a day gig.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicates dead cop on TV)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need somebody who goes under and stays there; six months, a year, five years...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<STEVENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does he have to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVENS>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Buy drugs. Sell drugs. Feed me information.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<STEVENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a snitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVENS>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a drug dealer. A criminal. A scumbag. But for the right side.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to come to Los Angeles on loan to the Justice Department as a federal agent. Your experience there will be credited toward your seniority here. And you'll come back to Cleveland a P3 or higher.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<STEVENS>
<DIRECTION>
(uncomfortable)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't do that. I've got a wife and kids.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVENS>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're separated from your wife, she's filled for divorce. You see your kids every other weekend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
Stevens takes a breath: this is awkward to explain.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVENS>
<DIRECTION>
(almost a confession)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All my life I've stayed away from that stuff. I've never touched drugs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVENS>
<CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
(tolerant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, a little grass...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<STEVENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not grass. Not nothing. I never even had a drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(his motto)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never have, never will. You don't understand. I made a choice in my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVENS>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's to understand? You saw your father killed when you were ten, and you decided you wouldn't be like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Stevens' surprise, Carver grins)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm God, I know everything. You wanted to be a good boy, so you became a cop. Hiding out in uniform... That's why you got the hard-on for Taft.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<STEVENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not that simple.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVENS>
<CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
(opening Joe's file; as if reluctantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell the truth, Joe. You're never going to be a Taft.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<STEVENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVENS>
<DIRECTION>
But he does.
</DIRECTION>
<CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at MMPI results)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ever take a look at your psychological profile? You score almost like a criminal.

	<DIALOGUE>
	"Resents authority..."

</CARVER>
<STEVENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVENS>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"...Exaggerated moral standards, but with no underlying value system." Look at the anger, the repressed violence, it's almost off the scale...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<STEVENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me see that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVENS>
<DIRECTION>
Carver hands him the scores which are, of course, just clusters of numbers. Stevens is upset, though oddly unsurprised, as if this only confirmed his secret fears.
</DIRECTION>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why'd you join the force?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<STEVENS>
<DIRECTION>
(awkward, but felt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted to be of use.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVENS>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, now you can be. You won't be Taft, but maybe you'll be something more... interesting.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sits back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a man named Ramon Gallegos who supplies 60% of the cocaine to the West Coast. He's smart, smooth, and sufficiently elusive that we don't even have an adult photograph of him. However, his uncle is Hector Guzman, an important Latin American political figure. Gallegos uses Uncle's connections to get product into the country, and everyone we've sent after him has ended up like that...

	Why would I be different?

<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You already are, that's the point...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicates file, test scores)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got the ability and the personality to go underground and blend in completely. That's what the others couldn't. Some part of them showed. That's why they're dead. See, there's only one rule in this game.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
Stevens raises his eyebrows: what?

	Don't blow your cover.

EXT. WORKING CLASS CLEVELAND NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stevens parks outside a small, well-maintained house. As he gets out, he spots a GROUP OF KIDS (black and Hispanic) playing down the street. He's not pleased about that.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVENS>
<DIRECTION>
(calls to them)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe-J, Carmen...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVENS>
<DIRECTION>
A BOY, 7, and a GIRL, 5, (both light-skinned) run to him shouting, "Daddy," jump into his arms, competing for attention, as if they haven't seen him in ages.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What were you doing with those kids?

	Yes, sir... Yes, sir.

<DIRECTION>
His strictness has already sobered their enthusiasm. Sensing this, he attempts to embrace them which he can do only awkwardly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, his wife, TERRY (Southern white) has come out the screen door. She and Stevens bristle at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought we talked about this. The older brother up there's got a sheet with --

	Lay off it. They're just kids...

Both are ready to fight, but restrain themselves. A big Polynesian, TITO comes out the door.

<TITO>

	Hey, Joe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TITO>
<STEVENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tito...

A moment of surprise, then he gets it. He looks to Terry. She gives a little shrug, refusing to be embarrassed.

INT. KITCHEN - FIVE MINUTES LATER

Stevens is trying to seem interested in Carmen's little drawings.

Over her shoulder he sees Terry sitting with a subdued Joe- J. Her face seems to say, "See, I told you..." Avoiding this accusation, Stevens notices a bruise on Carmen's arm.

INT. TRAIN STATION - UNDERGROUND - DAY OR NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
People getting off, among them the former Joe Stevens, now known as JOHN HULL. He's carrying a suitcase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN STATION/EXT. STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull goes up the stairs onto a downtown street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
South L.A. neighborhood. A 13-year-old BLACK YOUTH selling drugs through a car window. Hull walks by. He's at ease, looking around, his manner subtly announcing that he belongs here, just as in the train station he seemed to belong among the commuters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRANSIENT MOTEL - COURTYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fat BLONDE WOMAN (61, large white glasses, tiny shoes) leads Hull down a corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<BLONDE_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Television mostly. I was on "Sky King" twice, "Ramar of the Jungle." That was a silly show. The jungle was mostly flats...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLONDE_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
They pass an open door where a 6-year-old boy, JAMES, a latchkey, sits on the stoop playing Gameboy; inside, his mother, BELINDA, a broken down whore, is doing her nails and drinking Pepsi. She looks up, bats her lashes at Hull.
</DIRECTION>

(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want my advice, I'd stay away from that bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLONDE_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
She opens the door to the room across the hall. A dump. Hull walks in, drops his duffle: he'll take it. The Blonde lounges in the doorway. He closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull empties his pockets on the dresser. Looks at his money, room key, identification. Looks at himself in the mirror. He touches his clothes, his face, tries on different expressions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(NOTE: Throughout the film, Hull continually checks himself out in mirrors, both to adjust his appearance to the circumstances and as if in an attempt to recall who he "really" is.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. 79TH AND FIGUEROA - TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the seam between South-Central and USC. Lots of people out: children, students, dealers, whores. Hull with a new haircut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANOTHER, SIMILAR CORNER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dealers (most in mid-teens) meeting cars, making transactions. All this casually observed. EDDIE comes up the street, reciting his version of an old street toast.

Hull watches, talking to another street person. His appearance continues to change: clothes, posture, walk, gestures subtly conform to the environment, a bit like Zelig. Throughout the film his appearance shifts, depending on who he's with. We always recognize him, but each time he's different.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks up to a dealer, makes a quick buy and keeps going. But he sees them and is seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AN OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull drops eleven foil balls on a green blotter. Carver counts out money for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HULL'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits at the window, eating a burrito, watching little James play in the courtyard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull approaches another Dealer, the 13-year-old seen earlier (angelic face). Like Hull, he's trying to act tough.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>

	Whatta you got?

</HULL>
<13_YEAR_OLD_DEALER>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nickel rock, dime rock. Excellent shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</13_YEAR_OLD_DEALER>
<DIRECTION>
Hull exchanges a folded twenty for two foil balls. He walks off. He has gone twenty feet when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RED RANGE ROVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SQUEALS to a stop opposite the Dealer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge young black man, IVY (23, all in red with a red headband), leans out the passenger window, shouting at the 13-year-old.
</DIRECTION>
<IVY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck I tell you about being here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IVY>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone turns to look, but Hull's view is blocked.

<IVY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)

	Too fuckin' late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IVY>
<DIRECTION>
POPPING noises. Ivy is waving an automatic weapon. Everyone on the street but Hull has hit the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<IVY>
<DIRECTION>
(enjoying it, shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get down, motherfuckers!
	</DIALOGUE>
</IVY>
<DIRECTION>
Ivy laughs and fondles a girlfriend as the car ROARS off. He sees Hull, pretends to fire, laughs as Hull, too, ducks. When Ivy's gone, he runs to where a CROWD has gathered around...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE 13-YEAR-OLD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lying in the street, a bullet hole in his head, eyes open. He twitches and kicks, blood pulsing from the neat wound. Then he's dead. The faces around him (young, old, many races) watch with a variety of emotions.
</DIRECTION>
<CROWD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is he?... Why'd they shoot him?... Ivy did him, man... He's in the wrong fuckin' place... That poor boy... Get his beeper...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROWD>
<DIRECTION>
Cops push through to the body. As the crowd disperses, Hull can't take his eyes off the boy. When he finally does, he sees Eddie, drink in hand. Their eyes meet, and Eddie, a rapper, raises his eyebrows in brief acknowledgment of sorrow.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	He done done, ain't he?

TITLE: TWO WEEKS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bar with a neon bird for a sign. Hull enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LEWAZZ - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A racial mix. Hull takes a seat at the bar. Stuffed birds line the lintel above the bottles. A female BARTENDER (long red nails) greets him familiarly.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's it going, John?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm in there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
Without being asked, she sets him up a Dry Sack with a long red straw. (NOTE: He never touches the drink.) Hull's appearance has continued to change. His clothes have become flashier, he has an earring, the start of a goatee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie approaches the bar compulsively reciting one of his toasts.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Where's the Queen," said the King. "She's in bed with laryngitis." "Is that bastard still in town?... Fuck the Queen," said the King, and ten thousand knights straaaained at their utmost...

<DIRECTION>
(to the bartender)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pina colada times two and a white wine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
He goes on muttering under his breath, tapping his foot like any crankhead. He notices Hull, greets him as someone he can't place but knows he's seen around.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How you doin', Dudley...

	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Clasp hands. Eddie takes his drinks, carries them to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where he rejoins a white man, DAVID ELIAS (30s, slick, powerful) and a well-dressed BLACK WOMAN (mid-20s, good- looking). She gets the wine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elias rises to let her out. As the woman passes Hull on her way to the restrooms, their eyes meet: an instant of perfect chemistry. He's struck. Her features open, grow sensual for a moment, but then, as if seeing something she doesn't like, her eyes flick away, and she walks by as if he weren't there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CARVER'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(NOTE: Hull invariably meets Carver in this anonymous room, distinguished only by the green blotter and a view of the city. This simple regularity suggest visits to a psychiatrist, Carver probing, testing, teasing, trying to draw Hull out. And they feel like therapy, at once a respite and a torment.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More foil balls on the blotter beside boxes of 3x5 photographs. Photos of Eddie and David Elias are up on a corkboard, the beginning of a pyramid.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddie something... a motormouth... he supplies the street dealers... buys from him...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reads name on back of photo)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David Elias... who apparently buys from a guy named Barbolla or something. But I haven't seen him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
Carver produces a photo of a handsome Latin in his 50s, pins it on the board above Elias.
</DIRECTION>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Barbosa, Felix.

</CARVER>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was also a woman, but she's not here.

(as Carver reaches in a drawer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw a kid killed. Twelve, thirteen at the most. Turf war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
Carver shrugs: these things happen. He hands Hull a lot of cash, much more than expected. Hull does understand.
</DIRECTION>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get to Elias. Then to Barbosa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't rush this stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rush it, please. I want art, John, not reality. Budget hearings start in April, and I need Gallegos by then. They won't give us funding for three ounce buys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not just doing this for the funding, are we?

TITLE: TWO WEEKS LATER

<DIRECTION>
INT. CRACK HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Virtual darkness save splinters of light between the curtains. Pipes burn here and there in the gloom. Ten or fifteen crackheads huddle around a battery-operated TV on which Tom Brokaw is narrating an NBC documentary on drugs. A 12-year- old sits against a wall too stoned even for television.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull approaches Eddie, regally installed on an automobile bench seat-cum-sofa, a lit pipe in one hand. We barely notice the redhead kneeling between his legs, face buried in his crotch. He greets Hull from wrecked bliss. They know each other now.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My man, Dudley, he's so fud-ley...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Hull greets Eddie, some of the others, drops familiarly onto an adjacent auto seat. The patrons are making fun of Brokaw, laughing, exchanging fives.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddie, man, I need...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie holds up a hand telling Hull to wait. His mind is elsewhere. His features contract in brief concentration.
</DIRECTION>
<CHORUS_OF_COMMENTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever happened to that Drug Czar motherfucker?... He gave up 'cause he finally realized he didn't know nothing about any of that shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHORUS_OF_COMMENTS>
<DIRECTION>
More laughter, etc. Eddie's concentration peaks, breaks off into a sigh and a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie sings a satisfied little song...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The redhead rises from Eddie's crotch, and we see it's a boy, seventeen going on death; he might have been pretty a year ago.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie passes him the crack pipe, lets him suck greedily for a few seconds before ripping it out of his scabrous mouth and offering it to Hull, who, with a grimace that gets laughs, declines. The others continue to watch and comment on the speech.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what is it you need so bad, blood? Need, need, need??
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>

<HULL>
<DIRECTION>
(winning grin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All because of my man...
	</DIALOGUE>

Eddie likes that, holds out a hand. Hull hits it.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me a day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Hull nods, rises.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stick around, let the bitch Hoover you, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Indicating redhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In all these scenes, Hull acts indifferent to the horror, but here the effort costs him. He masters his disgust with a joke.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only if you Clorox him first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone laughs, even the boy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie comes out the back door of a building, is immediately collared by Taft (the cop on the videotape). He's in his mid- 40s, stocky, balding.
</DIRECTION>
<TAFT>
<DIRECTION>
(cheerful, gregarious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddie Shitface! Where you been, boy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAFT>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie breaks free, runs three feet before HERNANDEZ (a muscular Mexican) knees him in the groin. Eddie crumples.
</DIRECTION>
<TAFT>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddie, I don't think I introduced you to my new partner, Michael Hernandez...

Eddie folded over his wounded nuts. Hernandez and Taft sit on crates to either side. The drugs they've taken from him are neatly arranged on a garbage can lid.
</DIRECTION>
<HERNANDEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have the right to remain silent... You have the right to an attorney... You have the right to go back to Ontario for eight-to-ten on a second offense...

A pleasant, Santa Monica neighborhood. Spanish style house.

<DIRECTION>
INT. ELIAS'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pleasant, tasteful. Elias's wife, NANCY, (dressed like the attorney she is) sits in an alcove-study reading a real estate contract through half-glasses. Elias himself is helping his daughter, MIRANDA, 7, with her homework. He is 38, with the body and bearing of a powerful man.

Elias is not a sweet Daddy. It should make us uncomfortable to watch him push his daughter.

INT./EXT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three men: FELIX BARBOSA (whose photo we saw in Carver's office). Barbosa is a veteran of the coke business, but he's doing too much of the drug now; he's sweating, paranoid, unstable. With him is GOPHER, early 60s, a wizened high-voiced old con who Barbosa keeps the way Spanish kings kept dwarfs, for amusement and luck; like the court jester, Gopher can say anything he wants without fear. Behind them is an Hispanic kid, CHINO, 17, a thug.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elias knows them all, but is not happy to see them at his door.

	Felix, if he's a problem, we'll kill him. I'll kill him myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't realize until it's too late that Nancy has just then opened the front door to see where he went. They look at each other, a terrible moment: she knows what he does, hates it, can't bring herself to leave him, hates herself for that.

Hull grunts.
</DIRECTION>
<BELINDA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you do. And I was thinkin' if you wanted to take care of him, that might be good for him. Give him a male figure to look up to.

</BELINDA>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Belinda, I can't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Or maybe four thousand. I couldn't give up my boy for less than four thousand...

</BELINDA>
<DIRECTION>
Hull is rescued from this horror by the ringing PAY PHONE. He runs down the hall, grabs it.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's me. I'm here... Where?... five minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
He dashes past Belinda into his room.

<BELINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or you could just give me a part now...

He closes the door, takes the money Carver gave him out from behind the mirror, dashes back outside. As he rushes by:

	Let me do somethin' for you, Mr. Hull. Let me do a little somethin' for you.

EXT. TACO STAND - VENICE AND LA BREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A handful of customers under a mud sky. The THROB of a distant helicopter. Hull pulls into the lot beside Eddie's BMW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He climbs into the BMW, tosses Eddie a brown envelope; money spills onto his lap. Eddie does a quick count, produces the Fed Ex envelope. The usual white stuff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull's about to taste when the chopper swoops in with a sudden blinding overhead light. A BULLHORN booms down like the voice of God.
</DIRECTION>
<AMPLIFIED_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the police. Remain inside the vehicle. Place your open hands against the windshield so that they are clearly visible...

	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie starts the car, and Hull rolls out the passenger door as the BMW races across the lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two black-and-whites and an unmarked converge on the stand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull can't reach his car. He vaults a metal rail and runs off between two buildings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hernandez jumps out of an unmarked and races after him. Taft speeds the car out onto the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HULL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
running. Police and SIRENS pursuing. He hurls the Fed Ex envelope into a dumpster. HELICOPTER light sweeps over him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he cuts around a building, Taft opens a car door right into his face. Hull goes down hard.
</DIRECTION>
<TAFT>
<DIRECTION>
(into car radio)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you kindly...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAFT>

He waves at the helicopter which goes away, kneels over Hull who is twitching spastically on the ground, gasping for air. Hernandez arrives carrying the Fed Ex envelope.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How you doin', child?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAFT>

Hull is astonished to look up and see Taft looming over him, the man he remembers from the videotape. He tries to speak:

Hull tries to curse.

(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, I want to show you something. You have kids?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAFT>

He takes out his wallet, opens it to pictures of his two children, a boy and a girl, seven and eight.
</DIRECTION>
<TAFT>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are mine. Aren't they the most beautiful children you ever saw?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAFT>

Hull groans, twists in pain. Taft sticks the pictures in his face. Hull is affected by the children despite everything.
</DIRECTION>
<TAFT>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I know, they kind of leave you speechless. So let me ask, if someone put a gun to your baby's head, wouldn't you kill him if you could?

Hull just looks up.

He takes the Fed Ex envelope from him.

</TAFT>
<HULL>

INT. COURTROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull is led in with other handcuffed PRISONERS. Carver is here, catches Hull's eye. Hull shakes his head; doesn't want Carver to intercede. A woman PUBLIC DEFENDER (26, attractive, harried) addresses the prisoners.
</DIRECTION>
<PUBLIC_DEFENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, I'm Shelley Weissbrod. This is only an arraignment, a preliminary hearing, but if you don't have money for an attorney, the Public Defender's office can...

</PUBLIC_DEFENDER>

Hull is listening to this when a BAILIFF taps his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<BAILIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got counsel. Over there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAILIFF>
<DIRECTION>
Puzzled, Hull sees the back of a suit conferring with a PROSECUTOR. The suit turns. It's DAVID ELIAS who smiles, offers his hand. Hull is stunned. Elias enjoys that.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a lawyer??
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm your lawyer.

<ELIAS>

Elias addressing the court.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Honor, I believe the preliminary police toxicology report will show that the substance seized from my client was Mannitol, a baby laxative. We move for immediate dismissal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
Hull is surprised at this news. The Judge looks to the Prosecutor who waives objection. Gavel.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; to Hull)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're out of here, Dude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
As they walk toward the back, Taft approaches Hull. There's already a deep pull between these two, and in Taft's presence, Hull can't sustain the tough street act. We almost see the little boy inside him.
</DIRECTION>
<TAFT>
<DIRECTION>
(to Hull, amused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baby laxative, they sold you some bad shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAFT>
<DRUNKEN_PRISONER>

	You have a constipated baby, and you're in jail? What kind of a father are you?

</DRUNKEN_PRISONER>
<TAFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A father who don't know his own children, ain't that right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAFT>
<DIRECTION>
A long look between them, broken when Elias takes Hull's arm, leads him away. Elias cheerfully greets a couple of hookers waiting arraignment. Hull furtively grabs his sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sold me Mannitol, motherfucker.

INT. LEWAZZ - NIGHT

Deserted except for one table where Eddie, Barbosa, Gopher and Chino are eating shrimp. They look up as Hull and Elias approach. Eddie's astonished to see Hull.

<DIRECTION>
EDDIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
grabs the first thing he lays eyes on, a tiny snail fork and plunges it into Barbosa's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As if it were a fly bite, Barbosa flings the table aside and, with a long knife already in his hand, guts Eddie from groin to breast bone. Eddie falls like a suddenly emptied sack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elias can't help gasping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull looks away, hiding his horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barbosa rips the fork out of his neck and hurls it at the body.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBOSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Piece of shit!

Elias stares at Eddie's body, transfixed. Horrified, fascinated, afraid, in awe. Barbosa turns to Hull.

	How'd a guy like you get into this?

</HULL>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The way most drug lawyers do: clients paid me in product, and I had to move it. Soon I was doing more dealing than law. But this was '83, '84, there was so much money we thought it would never end.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. And now...?

</ELIAS>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then what are we doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People are always going to want to get high. Every society has ways to alter consciousness.

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(feels his hatred of Barbosa)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And because I can't get to the big guys.

<ELIAS>

Nancy nods briefly in Hull's direction. Elias kisses Miranda who grabs the back-pack her mother proffers, and they go out. When they're gone:
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>

(continuing; on Nancy's chilliness)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not about you. It's, she's... judgmental about what I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
When they're gone, he opens louvered doors onto a washer/dryer, takes a sports bag off a shelf, gives it to Hull. Hull looks inside. White powder. He tastes. Real. He hefts the bag.

	That's more than I bought.

</HULL>
<CARVER>

	You're a drug dealer, John. Deal drugs.

</CARVER>

Hull just looks at him. Carver doesn't blink.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know how this goes, Gerry. It won't stop here. You know what they're going to ask me to do pretty soon, to prove I'm down. What am I supposed to do then?

</HULL>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't blow your Carver.

Hull: a moment of horror as he realizes what Carver is saying.

MUSIC -- A DRUG DEALING SEQUENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HULL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's filling glass vials with crack. Hundreds of them. It's tedious work. He spills some, curses. He stops. He can't believe he's doing this. He goes on doing it.
</DIRECTION>
<CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're still thinking like a cop, John. Forget that. Cross the line. Be what you are. You're a criminal. You don't give a shit about other people. You're just trying to survive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CRACK HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull doling out vials to DEALERS seen earlier with Eddie.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't do this shit. I just can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEALERS going up to cars as before, only now they're Hull's dealers. A well-dressed Black businessman buys from his BMW.
</DIRECTION>
<CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you want to be of use. You want to get drugs off the street, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<HULL>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why I'm here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAME - ANOTHER TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another sale: Teenagers on foot.
</DIRECTION>
<CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, this is the cost. Pay it or go grow flowers someplace.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HULL'S MOTEL - ANOTHER TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes out of the motel talking to a Dealer we've seen above.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't back down with them. You've got to project strength, from inside, you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
The Dealer nods. Across the street Hull sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A blue sedan. Taft and Hernandez. Taft gives Hull a little nod and grin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - ANOTHER TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull sitting in an aging Trans Am, making entries in a notebook. Across the street he watches:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PREGNANT WOMAN (19), a squawling baby in arms, buying from one of his Dealers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He kicks the dash in frustrated anger. Under the MUSIC:
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cocksucker...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
As soon as the woman's gone. He goes over to the Dealer, slaps his head, slaps it again. Under the MUSIC:
</DIRECTION>
<DEALER>
<DIRECTION>
(hurt, confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd you do that for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEALER>
<HULL>
<DIRECTION>
(walking off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Cause I can, motherfucker, 'cause I can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAME - ANOTHER TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A white housewife making a buy from a new mini-van, a baby in the car seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two USC football players (letter jackets, huge) hassling BIJOUX, a woman dealer, pushing her, she pushes back, curses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Hull comes running up, shoves them apart. He's yelling, pointing a finger in their faces. Elias comes up behind, calmer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull is smaller than either USC kid, but they back down as he curses them. Under MUSIC:
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Touch her again, motherfuckers, I'm gonna mess you up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
A brief scuffle. Hull decks one USC, and Elias pulls him off. The kids leave. Elias doubles over with laughter. Hull yells at Bijoux and walks off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull (looking at written address) knocks on a door. It's opened by a beautiful, dark-skinned black woman in a skimpy robe. She looks at him with disarming frankness. He thinks he must be in the wrong place.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is David Elias here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Momentito...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
Through the door we see him emerge from a bedroom stepping into his loafers, buttoning his shirt. He gives the woman along, dark kiss, caressing her body.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jacqueline, ho-ney...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
She laughs, closes the door. As he and Hull walk to the street, Elias sings happily to himself:
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Who's making love to your old lady... while you're out make love...?"
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(cheerful)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come I like balling black chicks so much?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Cause you're a racist asshole. You feel like you're fucking a slave, and it gets you off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, don't mau mau me with the Malcolm X shit. Tell me you're not chasin' white pussy every chance you get.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't dig white women.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(knowing that's a lie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even if I did, it wouldn't mean the same thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, it'd be the slave fucking the master. Hegel talks about it. Just like me, but the other way around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck Hegel. Who the fuck is Hegel? Some smart-ass kike that talks backwards?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
Elias laughs, gets into Hull's car. Hull's angry, takes a beat before he gets in.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody digs the other, John. They dig their own, and they dig the other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does your wife dig black guys, David? Did she fuck Eddie? Does she want to fuck me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
(mock-terrified)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ooo... you mean with that great big purple dick of yours? I hope not. She'd never be impressed with my little thing again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think what impresses her now is your dick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
(musing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does impress her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
Hull can't help laughing. He starts the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BETTY'S STORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elias and Hull approach. Hull's carrying a satchel and wearing a new leather jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they go in, Elias switches the OPEN sign to CLOSED and turns the latch. The store is filled with Latin American folk art, particularly masks which line the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BETTY STONE, the woman Hull saw with Elias at the bar, comes out from the back. She is 27, a bad girl trying to dress the way she thinks a banker who went to Vassar dresses for success. She's also a little strung out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She and Hull recognize each other at once, (a brief reprise of that moment of perfect chemistry) but she avoids his gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Betty, this is John, my new associate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<MCCUTCHEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your new Eddie. I hear the old one wore out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCUTCHEON>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Factory recall. John's going to be a good customer. He does a lot of wash.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
Hull puts the satchel on a display case. Betty still won't look at him, opens the satchel, begins a quick count. She does this with a speed and sureness that suggests high test scores.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how's this place work?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
Betty doesn't answer, so Elias covers the awkwardness.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Betty wires the money to a store in Aruba in payment for things they never sent her. They deposit the money in a bank there that turns around and loans her money she never has to repay. That way it doesn't turn up as income for the IRS. Welcome to the laundromat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<MCCUTCHEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David, you talk too much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCUTCHEON>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She doesn't trust you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
Hull has taken down a mask, puts it over his face, looks in a mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<MCCUTCHEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More than you can afford.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCUTCHEON>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
She produces a vial of coke, looks questioningly at Elias.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By all means.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
She draws out six lines. Elias does two.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCUTCHEON>
<DIRECTION>
(offering him the straw)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Eddie 2... you're up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCUTCHEON>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
NOTE: Betty is acutely attuned to Hull, and in his refusal she senses -- albeit unconsciously -- two things: first, that he doesn't trust himself on drugs, therefore, he's a dangerous guy and, therefore, exciting; and, second, more important, the refusal bespeaks a repudiation of the violence and danger and, thus, a longing for goodness. Despite the seeming contradiction, she finds this even more attractive. But because she feels herself to be bad, his goodness seems only a judgment against her, and so she thinks she hates him.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCUTCHEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is he, my mother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCUTCHEON>
<HULL>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never have, never will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
Betty ignores him, does her lines.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCUTCHEON>
<DIRECTION>
(taunting Hull)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oooh... Cocaine, I love it and I hate it and I love it. The disease is the cure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCUTCHEON>
<DIRECTION>
She can't help looking at Hull who's looking at her. She and Elias are stoned; he's not.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCUTCHEON>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't look at me. Elias, tell him not to look at me. I don't like the fucker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCUTCHEON>
<DIRECTION>
But Elias is too busy vacuuming up Hull's leftovers.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
(sniffling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John's an ascetic Negro; he wants to make sure you know he's not a jungle bunny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch your mouth, David.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he's got another side. You should seen him on the street the other day with these two USC kids. Do the spade bit for her, John.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(black accent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna mess you up, muthafugga...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
He sticks his finger in Hull's face just like Hull with the boys.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't call me a spade. And don't tell me to play black.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
He says it gently, but Betty hears the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
(hurt, disappointed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, John, you do it so well.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(falling into it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah ain't playin', muthafucka. Ah ain't playin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
Hull glares; Elias refuses to be intimidated.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't fuckin' dis me, muthafucka. Fucka... fucka... fucka a... fucka b... fuck b-hive... fucka, fucka, fucka...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
Elias dances around repeating "fucka" until it's almost musical.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull picks him up and slams into a wall.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say it again, and I'll kill you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
Elias throws Hull back against a display case. He's strong and unafraid. They're ready to fight.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCUTCHEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grow up, assholes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCUTCHEON>
<DIRECTION>
This half snaps them out of it. Still glowering, they slowly relax, release each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull sits in the Trans Am eating a sandwich and watching the street as a DEALER leans in the window telling his sob story. There's an authority to Hull's manner that tells us he may not like this job, but he knows how to do it.
</DIRECTION>
<DEALER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...The guy ripped me off, man, so I don't got the money, I don't got the stuff and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEALER>
<HULL>
<DIRECTION>
(eyes on street)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gotta pay anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DEALER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, but, man...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEALER>
<DIRECTION>
As he raps on, comical pathos, Hull spots in his side mirror...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE RED RANGE ROVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
coming slowly this way. Ivy in the passenger window, the barrel of an automatic weapon glinting in the streetlight.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
Hull glances up: Bijoux is selling on the next corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Range Rover passes the Trans Am. Ivy leans out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull flings open the Trans Am door, throwing the Dealer to the ground. He jumps from the car:
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bijoux!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
She turns. Sees Ivy. She puts out her hands to block the shots. The SOUND of the gun is inaudible. The barrel bounces slightly. Bijoux sprawls backward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bijoux: dead on the sidewalk, limbs askew, bleeding from many wounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull, standing over her, covers her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAME - MUCH LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The body has been taken away, the crowd has cleared. Elias sits on the hood of the Trans Am. Hull stands, staring down.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't your fault.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(no response)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What could you have done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She worked for me. I'm supposed to protect her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
Elias knows that's true, and it leads to another truth.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have to kill him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
Hull looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or we lose all authority with the other dealers. And one of them'll kill you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
Hull looks up, startled.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got to assert now, or you're dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
Hull sees the truth of that and slowly nods.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if we kill Ivy, we control this whole territory.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That guy who works for Barbosa can do it, Chino.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. If we use Chino, it's Barbosa who's asserting. It'll be Barbosa's territory.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(again: his hatred of Barbosa)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's gotta be us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if it's us, it's gotta be you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
Meaning he can't do it. Hull knows that. A long beat on Hull's face as he reaches the inevitable decision.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't blow your cover.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I do this, we're partners. Equal partners on everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
Elias offers his hand. Hull stands up, a sudden resolve.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
(afraid)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
But Hull is already moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET/INT. ELIAS'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull and Elias driving, looking for Ivy. Elias double parks by two prostitutes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We STAY in the car with Hull who's silent, frightened, keeps trying to warm his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside, Elias is talking and laughing with the prostitutes. We see them point. He gives them money, kisses. They laugh. He gets back in the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A DANCE CLUB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Range Rover parked in front. Elias's car stops. MUSIC pounds from inside. Then one CONTINUOUS SHOT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pass the club, other store fronts... Turn at the corner... Turn into an alley... Down the alley past the same buildings... The rear door of the club... To the next street... Turn... Turn... onto the original street, back to the front of the club. They stop again.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go wait around back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
Elias nods. A beat. They look at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to see you in that alley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
Hull's so terrified he seems calm. With an air of submitting himself to fate, he gets out and walks into the club.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLUB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crowded and BOOMING and strobe lit. Hull pays the cover and climbs a staircase to a...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CIRCULAR BALCONY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
that overlooks the dance floor. On stage: a RAP ACT with its throbbing beat and below Hull a sea of dancers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull circles the balcony. It isn't hard to pick out Ivy -- he's all in red, dancing with the woman we saw him with in the Range Rover the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull reaches the steps again and starts down, keeping his eye on Ivy. The number ends. In the pause before the next one, Ivy can be seen excusing himself, heading toward the rear of the club.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The next number begins. People dance. Hull pushes his way through the dancers to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REAR OF CLUB - A SHORT HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
leading toward the rear door they saw from the alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING DOWN THE HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A woman's room. A men's room. Hull goes into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ivy is pissing into a urinal. He's so huge he seems to take up all the space in the tiny room. Hull stares at him, unable to look away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He notices Hull. All dialogue is UNDER the POUNDING MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<IVY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you looking at?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IVY>
<DIRECTION>
Hull stares at Ivy's face. Ivy considers this rude.
</DIRECTION>
<IVY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to suck it, bitch?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(offers his dick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or drink it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IVY>
<DIRECTION>
Laughing, he turns, urinates on Hull's pants. Hull doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<IVY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; recognizing him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I know you. You're the bitch whose whore I wasted tonight, ain't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IVY>
<DIRECTION>
Somebody pushes on the outside of the door. Hull holds it closed with his back.
</DIRECTION>
<IVY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta take care of you, too, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IVY>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches into his pants for the butt of a gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull is frozen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ivy starts to draw it out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull steps forward, grabs Ivy's gun arm. With his other hand he clumsily pulls a silenced .22 from inside his jacket, puts it in the underside of Ivy's jaw and SHOOTS twice. Ivy's brains spray upward onto the wall, and he slides straight to the floor. Hull steps out into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHORT HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An Hispanic busboy coming out of the kitchen sees him and the gun in his hand, freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull walks past him and out the back door. From inside we see Hull go down three steps, stumble in the drive and fall to his knees, the gun CLATTERING away from him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A couple that had been making out, stops, looks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It takes Hull a moment to gather himself. He picks up the gun, gets into Elias's car. It drives away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HULL'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alone, he looks at his face in the mirror. As if he doesn't know the person there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a knife, he draws out something hidden inside the wooden backing of the mirror. A manila envelope. He empties it onto the dresser:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mementos among which we see, carefully preserved, the blood- soaked bills his father gave him. Hull ignores them and picks up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHOTO OF HIS CHILDREN

GRAINY 16MM FILM - A LABORATORY MAZE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lab rat with a metal electrode protruding from its head, is running a maze at high speed. A VOICE explaining things.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(young, nasal, too smart)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The maze leads in two directions. At one end the rat can obtain a food pellet. At the other...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointer indicates each end)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...it receives electrical stimulus to a very specific area of the cerebellum...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The rat reaches this second destination, pushes a bar, is stimulated. A lab worker (white coat, gloves) picks up the animal, replaces it at the start. It runs the same route.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This rat, like 86% of the others in the experiment, chose the electrical stimulus repeatedly and exclusively. It continued to do so until it died of malnutrition.

<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER SHOT -- the rat dead.

INT. A LABORATORY - DAY OR NIGHT

A 21-year-old RENEGADE from the Cal Tech chemistry department (red hair, freckles, glasses held together with electrical tape), a brilliant nerd. He picks up...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MOLECULAR MODEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Colored balls stuck together with wooden dowels.
</DIRECTION>
<CAL_TECH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is an addictive amphetamine with time-space distortion, delusions of grandeur -- or maybe they're real -- tending to be impulsive, sometimes violent behavior. Psychotropic adaptation for late monopoly capitalism. It's illegal, and you can buy it on any street corner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAL_TECH>
<DIRECTION>
He tears off some of the balls, sticks on new ones.
</DIRECTION>
<CAL_TECH>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This increases energy, attention, cognitive powers, yet with a smooth, almost opiate-like emotional surface. Ideal for the post-political, post- rationalist global marketplace and 24 hour lifestyles. It's completely legal and can only get it here, in my lab.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your mistake. This is designed for the top end of the market. For people who want to master reality, not avoid it. Because it's synthetic, you don't grow it, refine it, or -- best of all -- import it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAL_TECH>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would it take to manufacture this stuff in quantity?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<CAL_TECH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With a million dollars, I could produce enough for a limited market at about two bucks a pop.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(makes a face: fair)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But then with five million, or better yet ten, the cost would drop to thirty cents, and we'd have enough for the whole world.
	</DIALOGUE>

	I'm going to put two hundred fifty thousand into your corporate account. You cheat me, Randy, I'll use your bladder for a bagpipe.

INT. CARVER'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the pyramid chart there's a black border around Ivy's photo, as around Eddie's. A photo of Hull is now on the board beside the one of Elias. Hull stares out the window, lost in thought.
</DIRECTION>
<CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
(dismissive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Synthetic shit?? Sounds like a 20/20 segment...

Carver smiles, but he's non-plussed by Hull's new detachment.
</DIRECTION>
<CARVER>

Hull in a new, expensive suit, gives the big Blonde Woman cash.

<DIRECTION>
INT. A RENTED CONDOMINIUM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Views, open space, expensive furnishings. Hull (in another fancy suit) is hanging a couple of Betty's masks. He's meticulous about their placement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elias wanders out from the other rooms, looking around.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
(impressed, envious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice place. Nice suit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
Hull has a moment of self-consciousness about the suit, checks himself out in a mirror -- a private moment.
</DIRECTION>

Elias flops on a couch, puts his feet on an antique coffee table.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>

He hurries over, lifts Elias feet to the floor. Hull brushes the wood, inspects it carefully, fusses, worries... Elias is amused.

</ELIAS>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do. We've got a bigger territory, we need more product. I want to deal directly with Gallegos. It would save us money.

</HULL>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Barbosa'll never let us near him.

Hull closes the briefcase, ushers Elias toward the door. He's going out, too.

EXT. BETTY'S JEWELRY STORE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
(annoyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody's home, go away.
	</DIALOGUE>

He knocks harder. Finally she appears in the doorway, stopping short when she sees it's him. She's immediately aware of white streaks on her grey suit. she tries to brush them off.

Hull holds up the briefcase. She sighs, unlocks the door.

<DIRECTION>
INT. BETTY'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bill counter toting up the cash. She watches it fixedly to avoid looking at him, but she feels the chemistry.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCUTCHEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you look at me like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCUTCHEON>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do I look at you?

</HULL>
<MCCUTCHEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like you know something I don't. Like you're better than me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCUTCHEON>
<DIRECTION>
That catches Hull off-guard, and he responds with a candor she didn't expect.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think I'm better than you. I don't think I'm better than anybody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
She's startled by this remark and instinctively drawn to him.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I do know something... You can't stop thinking about me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
Embarrassed, she looks away. He takes her hand, and at his touch something yields to her. She lets him draw her to him. His kiss is strangely tender, searching. It turns Betty on incredibly. She melts into him.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCUTCHEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go back here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCUTCHEON>
<DIRECTION>
She leads him into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SMALL OFFICE

She's sweet and loving, but her sweetness scares her. He's all over her, but she pulls back for a moment. There is a couch and before it a coffee table with coke scattered on a plate.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCUTCHEON>
<DIRECTION>
(indicates coke)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do this... do it with me.

She offers him a straw. He doesn't take it.

</HULL>

She's angry, hurt, confused, wants to love him, but feels he won't let her, or she won't let herself. It's torment. Finally she's released by a KNOCK on the door. She goes out to...

Lets in Elias. He smells the tension.

	Come on, you can do it, David, you're not a shmuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBOSA>

Elias puts his hands out, palms up. Barbosa covers them with his own. ON THE HANDS: Barbosa's broad, muscular with thick gold rings and a Rolex; Elias's paler, slighter, a wedding band and a slim watch.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBOSA>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Slap my hands. Just slap them.

</BARBOSA>

Elias looks Barbosa in the eye. He's trying to be a snake, but he's more the mouse. He looks away and as he does tries to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slap him with both hands but hits only...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Air. The room breathes. Barbosa turns his rings so the big surfaces point down.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBOSA>

<GOPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God, I can't look.

ON THE HANDS: Barbosa tenses his hands. Elias yanks back. Barbosa's hands haven't moved.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBOSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You remember the rules? If you flinch, I get to hit you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBOSA>

He slaps Elias across the face. Hull starts forward. A knife appears. He stops.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Again, shmuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBOSA>

Elias covers Barbosa's hands. Barbosa tenses. Elias holds firm, and Barbosa quickly slaps both hands, hard. Elias doubles over, holding his hands in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<GOPHER>

He slaps him again, a stinging crack. Elias looks to Hull, but they're across a canyon. Hull lowers his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<GOPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, and it hurts. Mercy, it hurts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOPHER>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE HANDS. Barbosa moves his hands a millimeter, and Elias flinches again. Barbosa smacks him across the face. The sound reverberates through the room. Now even Gopher is silent. Tears run from Elias's eyes, blood from his mouth, but he doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<GOPHER>

</A_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
steps forward out of the shadows. He is young, mid-30's, handsome, European features, beautifully dressed, accompanied by a guard we'll know as MOLTO. Someone murmurs to someone else:
</DIRECTION>
<SOMEONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gallegos...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOMEONE>
<DIRECTION>
Hull reacts. Their eyes meet.
</DIRECTION>
<GOPHER>

<ELIAS>

Barbosa shakes his head, ashamed now in front of Gallegos.

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(people are silent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four was the match.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
He holds out his hands. Barbosa resumes the stance, then waits, waits, waits, and finally brings both hands down, terribly hard, the sound of the slap is awful.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBOSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBOSA>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, that's it. Get away.

Hull leads Elias to the door right past Gallegos. Their gazes meet again. As they go out they hear Gallegos BERATING Barbosa in furious Spanish.

INT. STAIRCASE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trembling, Elias holds his bloody hands against his chest, as Hull leads him in silence down the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at me. Look at me, damn it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
He barely whispers, but it's like a shout. Hull, who'd been avoiding his gaze, forces himself to look. Elias's humiliation is so profound it almost ennobles him. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you do it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I needed it. They taught me what I needed to know. That I'm not part of them, and I never will be. That they don't respect me. That I don't deserve respect. Because I'm a shmuck, John. I'm a shmuck...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs a terrible laugh. The door behind them opens, and Barbosa appears with Gopher. Everyone is ready for death, but:
</DIRECTION>
<BARBOSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David, I'm sorry. It's a crazy time, and... you know... I'm doing a little too much coca... I'll buy your kid a pony... anything you want... Let's forget about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBOSA>
<DIRECTION>
He comes down the stairs, offers his hand. Elias will never forget about it, but he silently takes the hand, holds them in his own bloody paws, looking directly into Barbosa's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barbosa becomes uneasy, manages to extract his hand. Elias and Hull continue down and out the door. Gopher gushes to Barbosa.
</DIRECTION>
<GOPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am so proud of you. You can be cruel, and you can be kind. And just now you were kind. Proud, proud, and more proud. That's me.

Barbosa, Gopher with Hernandez, Taft's partner. Now we know Hernandez is corrupt: that's how they knew Eddie was talking.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great, lawyers are great, Jewish is best. But I need spades, too. The politicians want dark facts to scare the suburbs so they'll vote Republican.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERNANDEZ>
<BARBOSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lawyers and spades; I got the trifecta: two dealers and a girl who does their wash. Two niggers and a kike; all Democrats.

	Don't do this, Felix. It'll go wrong. Kill Elias if you have to, honey, but don't set him up for this. It damages your prestige.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOPHER>
<DIRECTION>
Barbosa faces his cocaine. He tries to resist the pull, then yields. He does another line. It's his friend. He loves it. He picks up a cellular phone, dials.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBOSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David, you're awake, I'm impressed... I'm sorry about what happened... Listen, I'll get you twenty boxes, like you wanted. You were right, you should have what you need... Tomorrow night... Bring your partner and that girl with the store, Betty... I need her advice on something. I want us to have fun, like we used to. We'll go to that shrimp place, okay?... Good... Me, too, David.

	We're going to get the money now, John. Enough for the new drug. We're going to be rich. We're going to be so rich that we're going to leave the world of ordinary people and going to a higher realm. I mean that.

EXT. COMMERCIAL STREET - EAST L.A. - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hernandez comes out of a bodega with groceries, wine and a woman. He nuzzles her as he lets her into his car. As he's getting behind the wheel, Molto (Gallegos' guard) stops the door from closing. The conversation is entirely in SPANISH.
</DIRECTION>
<HERNANDEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't my fault.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERNANDEZ>
<MOLTO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It never is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLTO>
<DIRECTION>
He SHOOTS him in the head. Hernandez slumps against the wheel. The woman screams. Molto walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AN APARTMENT COMPLEX/INT. BETTY'S APARTMENT - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull finds a door, pushes the buzzer. Betty looks through the glass. She's afraid of him.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCUTCHEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't kill me. I'm not going to talk. I swear. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCUTCHEON>
<DIRECTION>
Then she looks closer and sees not murder in his face, but need. She opens the door. Without a word, he gathers her to him. She can't resist him now. Her mouth is everywhere on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HER BEDROOM - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Betty gasping in the wake of pleasure, turning her face away from him, she feels so exposed.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCUTCHEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't look...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCUTCHEON>
<DIRECTION>
She hides her face in his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAME - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They lie in each other's arms, relaxed together for the first time. A wonderful, unprotected openness.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>

(half-kidding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything worth knowing you just found you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCUTCHEON>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs. They begin to make love again. Suddenly: AN EXTRA HAND stroking Betty's hair. She gasps. A gun in Hull's ear. Another in her face. Guns all around.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't hurt her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
Hands pull him out of bed, leave her there alone. We see Molto, two or three others.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A CEMETERY - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAMON GALLEGOS lays a bouquet of white lillies on a grave. He kneels, whispers a prayer, crosses himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rises and walks to where Molto and the other guards hold Hull and Elias. Gallegos is in his thirties, more European than Barbosa. He has a distinctly mild manner.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's grave?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
An impudent question, but Elias seems strangely bright-eyed despite the guns held on him.
</DIRECTION>
<GALLEGOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My wife's. She died of leukemia three years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like to be among the dead. They never interrupt you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to them)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Felix Barbosa started out as a skinny fourteen-year-old fucking Yankee businessman in Bogata hotels. He grew up. He made himself strong and rich, but getting there made him sick, and that killed him. So he lost everything for the same reason he'd gotten it in the first place. Now we'll see if you can do as well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALLEGOS>
<DIRECTION>
A PRIEST going by greets Gallegos who responds warmly. They chat a minute in SPANISH. The Priest leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<GALLEGOS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Felix owed me one million eight hundred thousand dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALLEGOS>
<DIRECTION>
He addresses this to Hull; Elias feels left out.
</DIRECTION>
<GALLEGOS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you killed him, you bought the debt; now you owe it to me; you get to keep thirty percent, like he did. You have three days.

<DIRECTION>
Gallegos turns to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who did Barbosa collect from?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<GALLEGOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you don't know, you shouldn't have killed him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALLEGOS>
<DIRECTION>
He notices Hull's earring: two tiny dice, the spots made of minuscule jewels. Unembarrassed, he fingers it.
</DIRECTION>
<GALLEGOS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cute... Can I have that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALLEGOS>
<DIRECTION>
Without waiting for an answer, he yanks it out of Hull's ear and walks away, leaving Hull bleeding through his fingers before a stone cross.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A GHETTO STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A club on the corner. THROUGH A WINDOW we see a RAP ACT on the stage, their MUSIC pumping out onto the street. Hull pulls up in a Jaguar. He and Elias go through a door adjacent to the club.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUILDING HALL/INT. GOPHER'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MUSIC is still audible here, though muffled. Elias and Hull are pushing at door Gopher is trying to hold closed.
</DIRECTION>
<GOPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want you in here. You killed the man, and I loved him. I don't want to have anything to do with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOPHER>
<DIRECTION>
Elias kicks it open, and they enter Gopher's tiny, miserable domain. He's wearing some sort of negligee and an immense naked woman fills his bed. We still hear the MUFFLED MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<GOPHER>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; apoplectic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a sixty-three-year-old man! I'm a grandfather! Would you hit a sixty- three-year-old white man? Would you hit your own grandfather?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOPHER>
<ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
(slaps him against wall)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, you fucking monkey, you know who owed him money, and we know you know. Tell us or --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
Hull pulls him off. Elias is angry. They struggle.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll tell us. Gopher, just...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
Meaning: deal with me or deal with Elias.
</DIRECTION>
<GOPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't tell anyone it was me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOPHER>
<DIRECTION>
The MUSIC continues OVER the following sequence:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CRACK HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elias arguing with a dealer. He slaps him around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON HANDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Money is exchanged. The money is stuffed in a satchel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. A LAW OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A well-dressed lawyer (30's) talking with clients, a distinguished couple in their 60's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door BANGS open and a secretary is unable to restrain Hull and Elias as they charge into the room. The lawyer is up on his feet, but Hull shoves him around as Elias politely explains to the clients that this will only take a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON SATCHEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull's hands thrust more money in. It's getting full.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. A MOTORCYCLE REPAIR SHOP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A biker in leathers on hands-and-knees spitting blood onto the cement floor. Hull stands over him, fists clenched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. A CAR TRUNK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A satchel stuffed with money is latched, set next to another latched one. A third is opened, money and jewelry dumped in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull looking into the trunk. Elias is beat.

<CARVER>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doing my job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
There's an indifference to Carver's authority we haven't heard before. Hull isn't even aware of it, but Carver is.
</DIRECTION>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You violated a direct order to stay away from that bust. As a result, a police informant is dead, a state senator was critically injured in the tunnel pile up and a city policeman was subsequently murdered.

(NOTE: Carver arrives

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
that we are:)

EXT. SANTA MONICA PARKING STRUCTURE - OVERLOOKING OCEAN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

They get out of the car. Carver takes out a flask, has a drink, offers it to Hull who declines.
</DIRECTION>

	Never have, never will.

Carver snorts: ridiculous.

<HULL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, of course. That's why you wanted to bust Elias and Betty. I was getting close, and you wanted to cut this off then... What is he, the new Noriega? Helps you fight commies, so you let him sell drugs to the niggers. Two birds with one stone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<CARVER>

	You violated orders, so you're through. Don't make a conspiracy theory out of it.

	Now tell me the truth or they're going to decide your troubles got the best of you.

	Drugs is politics. Politics is drugs...

<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you can't do that, John. It's not you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me? There is no me. We took care of that. First I was a cop pretending to be a dealer. Now I'm just a dealer pretending to be a cop. Why not stop pretending...? Quit the force. Be a dealer.

EXT. GOPHER'S BUILDING - 4 A.M.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The neighborhood is reminiscent of the one where Joe Stevens Sr. was killed. The rap club still pumps MUSIC onto the 4 A.M. streets where whores, junkies, children, teenagers with beepers and Nikes, welfare mothers roam as if it were daytime anywhere else. Their eyes, yearning, sullen, vital, hopeless and hoping stare at...

</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you laughing at?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
Elias shakes his head: nothing. He laughs. They pull into the lot beside a movie theater.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THEATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Technicolor Spanish melodrama is winding to its lurid end. A door in back opens, and a burst of daylight reveals Hull and Elias being brought in by a guard and met by Molto.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Molto and the guard frisk them, take their guns and money satchels, make them wait a moment until...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The movie ends.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house lights come on revealing Ramon Gallegos as the only spectator in the theater. He beckons. Molto and the guard bring Hull and Elias down the aisle to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gallegos looking in the satchels. A tense moment.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It isn't one eight.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a million one. That's all Barbosa owed, it's all we're paying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
Gallegos is stern for a moment, then laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<GALLEGOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Big brass balls. Collecting money makes you strong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALLEGOS>
<DIRECTION>
Everybody relaxes. Gallegos scribbles something on a piece of paper, hands it to the guard who feeds it into a fax machine.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<GALLEGOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm telling our suppliers they got paid. They'll be very happy. I'm happy.

</GALLEGOS>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And we're happy. Everybody's happy. It's a happy world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
Elias seems a bit mad, but no one minds. He and Hull are ready to go. He gestures to Molto, wants his gun back.
</DIRECTION>
<GALLEGOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, how can I express my gratitude for a job well done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALLEGOS>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We want Barbosa's business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>

Gallegos gestures to Molto to give them the guns.
</DIRECTION>
<GALLEGOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Done. Of course.

</GALLEGOS>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And, also, your business. All this. Your money, your dope, everything.

Hull looks at Elias; what's going on?
</DIRECTION>
<GALLEGOS>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're tougher than I thought, but not that tough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALLEGOS>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How tough is enough?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
He brings up the gun and SHOOTS Gallegos in the head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull and the guards are frozen. Then everyone goes for a gun. Elias SHOOTS the guard. Hull has his gun to Molto's head and screams at Elias:
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
Meaning don't shoot him. But Elias has no intention of doing so.
</DIRECTION>

Molto is silent. Elias FIRES a bullet right between his feet. Molto jumps. The boys turn. Hull grabs the gun away. We feel the toll Elias's madness is taking on him.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck's the matter with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<ELIAS>

And, indeed, Molto is pointing to a Winnebago parked at the rear of the property.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. REAR OF PROPERTY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Winnebago. With a tire iron, Hull snaps off the padlock that holds the rear door closed. He opens the door. Money gushes out. He slams it closed.
</DIRECTION>

He, Elias and Molto are on hands and knees scooping it up.

	<DIALOGUE>
	...that we have his money, and we're willing to talk as soon as he comes to town. We'll know how to reach him. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>

Molto just glares at him. Elias smiles, takes the shoes and socks and all the contents of Molto's into the Winnebago, and he and Hull drive away, leaving the car behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. A PARKING GARAGE/INT. WINNEBAGO - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Winnebago enters the garage, Elias greeting the attendant, "Hey, Frank." Frank waves him in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The garage is filled with various RVs. Hull pulls the Winnebago into an empty spot beside Elias's car and gets out. Elias remains in the cabin making calculations.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Approximating the cubic capacity and depending on the denominations of the bills, it's somewhere between fifty million and two hundred million dollars. Right back there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
As he does, Hull checks his gun, walks around behind the vehicle and prepares to shoot Elias in the back of the head through the open window. Elias finishes his money report, and sits there as if unaware of Hull, but:
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; not turning around)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Think I'm crazy?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

(blowing up, gun still on him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know they're coming after us. I want them to. We'll give them the money, but we'll make a deal for ourselves. We'll get what we need for the synthetic drugs. I've thought it all out. I've been thinking it out for years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>

Hull uncocks the gun, rubs it against his burning face. Elias turns around, embraces him.

EXT. BETTY'S JEWELRY SHOP - EVENING

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Forty PEOPLE on folding chairs. Hull enters on a dead run. He stops short when he sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BETTY

</DIRECTION>
<MCCUTCHEON>

The room bursts into APPLAUSE. She sees Hull at the back; he signals to her, but she goes on.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCUTCHEON>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been using drugs and selling them, and I've wanted to stop for a long time, and the only way I did was because I met a man I loved and who loved me. I know that's not what I'm supposed to say. I'm supposed to say there was a higher power, and maybe there was, behind it all, but this man is strong and his love made me strong enough that I could start, or at least think about a life that didn't have drugs in it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCUTCHEON>

She's looking right at Hull as she speaks. He's torn between the danger he knows she's in and his emotion at what she's saying.

Hull hurrying Betty toward his car. She's protesting.

Hull and Betty hurry toward his room carrying shopping bags, a newly bought suitcase. They see...

COPS

The fat Blonde Woman is talking to a policewoman. James sits on the bed staring at...

</DIRECTION>

He snatches away the photo, but not before Betty sees it. She reaches out her hand. He reluctantly turns it over to her.
</DIRECTION>
<TAFT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me something, who the fuck are you?

	I do what I can. Do you do what you can?

(Hull says nothing)

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets out Carver's flask and tries to drink, but it's empty.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>

This news startles Hull, yet, strangely, he senses its truth, and the sweetness is more than he can bear.

</GUZMAN>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're after us, not you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
Everybody scatters. The garage is a labyrinth of cement stairwells, ramps, hundreds of RVs to hide between, under and so forth... Lots of NOISE, lights, but mostly we see Hull and Elias dodging here, avoiding the action.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE GARAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Molto caught between the lights. He draws his gun. GUNFIRE. He's cut down.
</DIRECTION>
<TAFT>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are the rest of them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAFT>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cars with rotating dome lights, but not many cops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull and Elias emerge from a shadowy doorway and make their way at a casual pace beyond the perimeter of police cars, quickly mingling with other spectators. They continue down...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A QUIET SIDE STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Strolling now. Elias elated, uncontained joy.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We did it. Twenty million. Twenty fucking million. We're going to have synthetics. We're gonna be rich. We're gonna...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
Hull stops walking and just stands there.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter, John? Be happy. Your whole life has just been solved.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(behind them)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop! Police!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
In one motion, Elias draws his gun, turns and FIRES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure goes down. Elias can't believe he hit him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull starts toward the figure.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
(heading the other way)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John, where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
Taft -- on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Jesus, no...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
He drops to his knees. Blood oozes from Taft's chest.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John, what the hell are you doing? Let's get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
Hull tries to hold closed the wound. The posture duplicates Hull with his dying father. He feels for a pulse. For breath.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
<DIRECTION>
(distraught)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's dying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let him die. Let him die twice. Come one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls at Hull who won't go. Hull does mouth-to-mouth. Taft opens his eyes, looks up at him.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	[Says to Taft whatever a CPR-trained policeman would say in this situation.]
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Elias)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you kidding me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<TAFT>
<DIRECTION>
(to Hull, getting it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, man, you're a cop. You're a cop, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAFT>
<HULL>
<DIRECTION>
(with difficulty, as if against his will)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm a fucking cop...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, really? Where's you badge?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have one. I'm undercover. Get help, David.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John, that's a cop. He tried to kill you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He didn't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, he didn't know. I don't know. Maybe you don't know. Maybe you think you're a cop because... because...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drop the gun, put your hands against the car. Spread your legs... Police!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
Taft grunts once, stiffens.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God! Please...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
The pulse is gone. Hull begins to perform CPR.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, let's say you're a cop. Be a cop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
Hull keeps doing CPR.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've still got the money. We put it into Randy's chemistry set. In five years we're worth five hundred million each, minimum. You'll be one of the richest black men in America. Richer than Cosby. Who gives a shit how you got it? You think the white ones were honest?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
Hull keeps working on Taft.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this asshole all that stands between you and greatness? Let me do you a favor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
He puts a gun to Taft's head and FIRES. In a reflex, Hull draws his own gun, SHOOTS Elias in the stomach. Stunned, he wobbles backward a few steps. Sits on the street.
</DIRECTION>
<ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee, John, that's kind of an extreme reaction.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELIAS>
<DIRECTION>
Hull is stunned he did it. And this finally attracts the police who see a black man with a gun who just shot a white man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull goes to Elias who's dead. A POLICEMAN pulls him off, beating him with a gun.
</DIRECTION>
<POLICEMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fucking nigger...
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hull, bandaged, wearing prison blues, walking with Carver.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Guzman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He vanished, thank God, or we'd both be in deep doo-doo. At least you got Gallegos.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elias did. And everything goes on as before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the drug game. Plus a change... I want you to come back to work for me. You'll beat all charges on a technicality and go back to who you were.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who was I, Ger?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does anyone really know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have other things to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like travel? Tangiers, maybe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
Hull looks at him; how did he know?
</DIRECTION>
<CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm God, remember?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
He beckons him. He walks him over to a cell. Through a one- way window they see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BETTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
alone in the cell, unaware she's being watched.
</DIRECTION>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go back to work, she walks out of here. Otherwise, she's up on multiple counts, and I'll see to it the judge runs them consecutively.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
Hull just looks at him. Carver shrugs apologetically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANOTHER ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Absolutely white. Not a window, not a stick of furniture. The only deviation is Hull in prison blues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens, Betty comes in wearing prison yellows. She sits on a nearly invisible chair. They know they're being watched.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCUTCHEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They want me to testify against you. I said I wouldn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCUTCHEON>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to. It's all set up. That's how you're getting off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head in cynical understanding. How difficult it is to get back to an honorable life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; with difficulty)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father didn't have a heart attack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was shot robbing a liquor store. Trying to rob it. I lied about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<MCCUTCHEON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baby, why are you telling me this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCUTCHEON>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had to start somewhere... There're other things you don't know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
AN IRIS SHOT - HULL AND BETTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silent. Kissing. Beginning to make love. Hull extracts himself, gives the finger to the POV and stuffs a bit of tissue in the iris, blocking our view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carver takes his eye from the now obscured peephole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A CEMETERY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A funeral. Taft's wife and children (from the wallet photo) leave the graveside with the rest of the funeral party.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When everyone is gone, Hull approaches the grave. From his pocket, he removes the four blood-soaked bills his father gave him, and wedges these among the stems of flowers that already cover the plot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's silent a moment, then he gets up. He joins Carver who's standing with Hull's children. The kids each take his hand, they walk together.
</DIRECTION>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Betty walked out of court free this morning. That's my side of the deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<HULL>
<DIRECTION>
(to the children)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You two run on ahead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
They do. Hull watches them go.
</DIRECTION>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her probation gets revoked the minute you fuck up. I want you to stay away from her altogether.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<HULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know the difference between a black man and a nigger?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
Carver smiles, shakes his head. He likes a good joke. Hull punches him so hard in the stomach that he goes to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<HULL>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The nigger's the one who'd even think about doing what you tell him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HULL>
<DIRECTION>
He walks away. Still on his knees, doubled over, Carver whispers after him:
</DIRECTION>
<CARVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't blow your cover.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARVER>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
