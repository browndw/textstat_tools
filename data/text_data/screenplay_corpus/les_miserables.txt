EXT. TOULON PORT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RISE UP out of the iron-grey surface of the ocean, seething in the wind, towards the shore. Winter rain slices the air. Ahead, the port of Toulon, home of the French navy. A forest of tall masted warships.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The great ships heave at anchor, the wind whipping their rigging.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the sea spray we see the great ribs of warships under construction, and warships being refitted.

Toulon, Home port of the French navy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOULON DOCK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm-lashed sea and driving rain. A great wave rises up and hammers down. As it recedes we see the figures of men heaving on great ropes, the sea water streaming down over their faces. The harsh storm light catches glints of metal: these men are CONVICTS, chained by manacles, heads shaved, wearing red shirts with prison numbers crudely stitched onto them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we see that the ropes run up to a ship that is being hauled ashore - a storm-damaged man-of-war, its masts broken, rising and falling on the surge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As yet another great wave rolls over the convicts, we follow the straining ropes down into the base of the slipway, and find the convict JEAN VALJEAN, up to his waist in water, chained by two sets of manacles, as the rain and spray and wind scream round him. A great brute of a man, he seems to feel nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The convicts sing in time with the rhythmic pulls on the rope -

<CONVICTS>

</CONVICTS>
<DIRECTION>
The camera RISES UP to find JAVERT, the officer in charge of the convict workforce, looking on, his face rain-lashed and expressionless. He stands above the men on the top of the dock, as lines of convicts labour beneath him on the steep steps of the dock wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind Javert, through the storm rain we glimpse a forest of half-built ships, their ribbed frames like great skeletons in the mist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOREGROUND convicts are at work on another ship that is almost completed, labouring in the crashing spray.

</CONVICTS>
<DIRECTION>
With a last great heave the lines of convicts haul the damaged ship onto the slipway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRACK! The stern flagpole of the ship snaps in a vicious gust of wind and crashes down into the shallow water near Valjean. Javert sees and points his stick at Valjean in silent command. Valjean stares back for a beat, defying him. Then he drops down into the seething water and re-emerges with the great mast in his hands, held over his head. His head breaks water with his bitter gaze still on Javert, as he throws the mast ashore in a deliberate display of strength.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Javert nods to the guards, and they begin to form the chained men into lines to return to their prison. The storm is passing now, blown by the driving wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Javert approaches Jean Valjean.
</DIRECTION>
<JAVERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now Prisoner 24601. Your time is up And your parole's begun. You know what that means?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. It means I'm free.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALJEAN>
<JAVERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! It means you get Your yellow ticket-of-leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAVERT>
<DIRECTION>
He hands Valjean a folded yellow paper.

<JAVERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This badge of shame You'll show it everywhere. It warns you're a dangerous man.

<JAVERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'm Javert! Do not forget my name. Do not forget me - 24601!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAVERT>
<DIRECTION>
He strides away to command the lines of convicts as they're marched away. Valjean walks away, hardly able to take in that he is free at last.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The convicts sing as he goes.

EXT. ROAD OUT OF TOULON - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean makes his way up a rising track, a worn knapsack on his back. He comes to a stop at the top of the hill, and there before him, lit by the rising sun, spreads a wide vista of fields and towns and villages, stretching into the distance, with the snow capped Alps beyond. Behind and below him lies Toulon at the sea's edge. As we hear the musical theme ('Freedom is Mine'), we see for the first time the darkness in his face give way to a new hope.
</DIRECTION>
<VALJEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Freedom at last - How strange the taste! Never forget the years - the waste, Nor forgive them for what they've done. They are the guilty - Everyone! The day begins. And now lets see What this new world Will do for me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALJEAN>
<DIRECTION>
SCENE OMITTED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean strides down the long rising road, pulling his thin coat close round him against the cold winter wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He passes a long line of labourers working. He approaches the OVERSEER.
</DIRECTION>
<VALJEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Monsieur can I help? A day's work?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALJEAN>
<DIRECTION>
The overseer notices shaved hair showing under his cap.
</DIRECTION>
<OVERSEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take your hat off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OVERSEER>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean takes his hat off, revealing his shaved and scarred head.
</DIRECTION>
<OVERSEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Passport.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OVERSEER>
<DIRECTION>
The overseer scans the yellow paper, and hands it back.

SCENE OMITTED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - END OF DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean slogs on up the rising track into the mountains. Snow on the ground here, and darkness falling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up and sees ahead a village built on a rock cliff, its lights twinkling, the snowy mountains rising behind. The tower of its handsome church rises up like a promise of refuge. This is Digne.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DIGNE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean enters Digne. As he drinks from the fountain, he sees a guard standing outside the Mairie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIRIE, DIGNE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean stands waiting. The officer fastidiously writes down the name of Valjean in his huge ledger and the name of the town in his passport. The officer signs and stamps the passport.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Valjean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
The officer hands back the passport. Valjean leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DIGNE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean walks down the high street, spies the warm glow of an inn and enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COUNTRY INN, DIGNE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean sits in the corner, his hat low over his head. He eyes hungrily a group of cart drivers tucking into a roast meal by a roaring fire place. The innkeeper serves him a beer. As he reaches for it his coat sleeve rides up to reveal his wrist, calloused and scarred by manacles. The innkeeper eyes him warily. He discusses Valjean with two other men, then asks for his paper. Sees the phrase "Extremely Dangerous".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALJEAN'S POV - From the yellow paper in the innkeeper's hands up to the innkeeper's face. A blank stare, a shrug of refusal.
</DIRECTION>
<INNKEEPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My inn is full.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INNKEEPER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DIGNE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean moves off wearily through the village. As he passes down the narrow street, faces peer at him from doorways, but the doors close when he goes by. A shadowy figure follows him. Word has spread that he's a `dangerous man'.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Passing the uncurtained window of a cottage, he comes to a stop. Through the window he sees a scene that breaks his heart: a father at a table by lamplight, his young wife before him, his children on either side. Nothing special, and yet everything he's never had.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRISON, DIGNE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops at the local jail. An iron chain attached to a bell hangs from the prison door. He rings. A grate slides open.
</DIRECTION>
<VALJEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jailer. Would you let me stay here for tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALJEAN>
<JAILER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a prison, not an inn. Get yourself arrested. Then we will open up for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAILER>
<DIRECTION>
The grate slides shut. As Jean Valjean walks away, some children who have been following begin throwing stones at him. He threatens them with his stick and they scatter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DIGNE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees over a garden wall a low doorway in a stone turret. Valjean stoops through the doorway and lies down on some straw. He hears a ferocious growl and sees the head of an enormous mastiff. It is a dog kennel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DIGNE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Snow falling as Valjean makes his way down the road, hungry, weary, moving slowly, his trousers ripped and bloody from where the dog has bitten him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the end of a road, the snow-covered church; beside it, a dark churchyard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHURCH YARD, DIGNE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Snow-covered gravestones in moonlight. Exhausted, Valjean collapses to the ground and huddles himself into the shelter of a doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lantern glows in the dark. The lantern approaches, throwing shadows. Its little circle of light comes to rest on the crumpled figure of Valjean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stirs and opens his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALJEAN'S POV - The glow of the lantern in the darkness. Beyond it, the half-seen features of a kind old man. The BISHOP.
</DIRECTION>
<BISHOP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come in, sir, for you are weary And the night is cold out here. Though our lives are very humble What we have we have to share.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BISHOP>
<DIRECTION>
Bewildered, fearful, suspicious, Valjean gets up and goes with the Bishop into the house by the church.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A simple table on which is laid out bread and wine, with silver cutlery. Two silver candlesticks light the room, illuminating walls painted with religious scenes. The Bishop ushers the bewildered Valjean into the room. The bishop's sister Madame Baptistine stands. Valjean hesitates.
</DIRECTION>
<BISHOP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is wine here to revive you. There is bread to make you strong. There's a bed to rest till morning - Rest from pain, and rest from wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BISHOP>
<BISHOP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit, my brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BISHOP>
<DIRECTION>
The Bishop gestures to the housekeeper Madame Magloire.
</DIRECTION>
<BISHOP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madame, set one more place.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Valjean)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please sit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BISHOP>
<DIRECTION>
The Bishop gently takes his arm and draws him into a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean sits, and the Housekeeper lays food before him. Famished, Valjean eats like an animal. The Bishop says a short grace.
</DIRECTION>
<BISHOP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May the Lord bless the food we eat today. Bless our dear sister and our honoured guest.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(To Valjean)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, eat. Where are you travelling to my brother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BISHOP>
<VALJEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pontarlier.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALJEAN>
<BISHOP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that where your family is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BISHOP>
<VALJEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. The destination is compulsory. That is where the Law sends me. I have no home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALJEAN>
<BISHOP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then let this be your home, for as long as you need it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BISHOP>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM, BISHOP'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bishop leads Valjean to a bedroom where the walls are also painted with religious imagery. Across the passage, Valjean sees the open door to the Bishop's own bedroom. There the Housekeeper is putting the table silver away in a cupboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to see a bed made up with clean white linen waiting for him. He hasn't slept in such a bed ever in his life. But the Bishop is smiling, offering it to him.
</DIRECTION>
<BISHOP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sleep well. Tomorrow morning before you leave you will have a cup of milk from our cows, nice and hot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BISHOP>
<DIRECTION>
The Bishop turns away to go to sleep.
</DIRECTION>
<VALJEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You let me sleep here next to you? How do you know I'm not a murderer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALJEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean laughs a strange laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<BISHOP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God will take care of that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BISHOP>
<DIRECTION>
LATER THAT NIGHT -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean lies on the bed, fully dressed, deeply asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside a dog barks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean's eyes snap open. The first thing he sees by the light of the moon is an image of God the Father gazing down on him from the painted ceiling. In panic, fearing judgement, he sits bolt upright. Then he looks round, and remembers. He gets out of bed, and opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There, across the narrow passage, the door stands open to the Bishop's bedroom. In the moonlight, he sees the Bishop lying asleep. Above his bed, the cupboard where the silver is kept.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean moves silently into the Bishop's room, holding a metal miner's spike which he pulls from his bag. The floor boards creak. He looks down at the old man, holding his breath, but the bishop is peacefully and innocently asleep. He reaches up to the cupboard. It is unlocked. The cupboard door opens with a sharp cracking sound. The Bishop, disturbed in his sleep, moves a little. At once Valjean is over him, like a wild animal, spike raised to strike should he wake. The Bishop sleeps on. The moon comes out and lights up his beautific, smiling face. Valjean is thrown. He turns back and opens the cupboard door fully: there is the silver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carefully he picks it out, fearful of every clink. One last look at the sleeping old man, and he makes a run for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHURCHYARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean rushes out of the back door of the house. He crosses the graveyard, scrambles over a back wall, and he's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BISHOP'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bishop is coming in from morning Mass in his vestments when the door bursts open and two policemen drag Valjean before him. Valjean hangs his head, unable to meet the Bishop's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<CONSTABLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Monsignor, we caught the thief red-handed! He has the nerve to say you gave him all this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONSTABLE>
<DIRECTION>
He upends Valjean's kitbag, and the silver tumbles out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bishop looks from the silver to Valjean.
</DIRECTION>
<BISHOP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BISHOP>
<DIRECTION>
Amazed, Valjean looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<BISHOP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But my friend, you left so early, You forgot I gave these also. Would you leave the best behind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BISHOP>
<DIRECTION>
The old Bishop is holding out the two silver candlesticks.
</DIRECTION>
<BISHOP>
<DIRECTION>
(to policemen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Messieurs, release him. For this man has spoken true. I commend you for your duty Now God's blessing go with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BISHOP>
<DIRECTION>
Silenced by the Bishop's gentle tones, the policemen turn and leave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean, utterly bewildered, takes the silver candlesticks.
</DIRECTION>
<BISHOP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But remember this, my brother - See in this some higher plan. You must use this precious silver To become an honest man. By the witness of the martyrs, By the passion and the blood, God has raised you out of darkness - I have bought your soul for God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BISHOP>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHURCH, DIGNE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean kneels in the church.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes out his yellow passport and stares at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns towards the altar, and the crucifix above it.
</DIRECTION>
<VALJEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have I done? Sweet Jesus, what have I done? Become a thief in the night Become a dog on the run! And have I fallen so far And is the hour so late That nothing remains but the cry of my hate? The cries in the dark that nobody hears Here where I stand at the turning of the years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALJEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If there's another way to go I missed it twenty long years ago. My life was a war that could never be won. They gave me a number and murdered Valjean When they chained me and left me for dead Just for stealing a mouthful of bread! Yet why did I allow this man To touch my soul and teach me love? He treated me like any other He gave me his trust He called me brother. My life he claims for God above... Can such things be? For I had come to hate the world - This world that always hated me!
	</DIALOGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take an eye for an eye! Turn your heart into stone! This is all I have lived for! This is all I have known! One word from him and I'd be back Beneath the lash, upon the rack. Instead he offers me my freedom! I feel my shame inside me like a knife. He told me that I have a soul... How does he know? What spirit comes to move my life? Is there another way to go?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, he examines the yellow passport and raises it high, as if to the altar.
</DIRECTION>
<VALJEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am reaching, but I fall And the night is closing in... As I stare into the void - To the whirlpool of my sin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALJEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean stands and turns, walking fast to the door of the church.
</DIRECTION>
<VALJEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll escape now from that world - From the world of Jean Valjean. Jean Valjean is nothing now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALJEAN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHURCH, DIGNE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean comes out of the church into the graveyard and reaches a bell set on the edge of a promontory. Below lies the steep drop down the mountainside to the dark valley below.
</DIRECTION>
<VALJEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Another story must begin!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALJEAN>
<DIRECTION>
He rips the yellow paper into pieces and throws the pieces out over the valley. The scraps flutter in the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOLLOW the scraps of yellow paper as they dance in the wind then fall away into the void below. One scrap of paper dances upwards in the sunlight. We follow this and accelerate upwards leaving Valjean and the town of Digne far below, towards the sun gloriously breaking through the heavens with the alps beyond. The camera then starts to tumble back down through mist and cloud below - through time and space - down to discover -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD TO MONTREUIL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera hurtling towards three horses riding down a long muddy road on a flat plain towards the walled town of Montreuil-sur-Mer. Montreuil sits on an estuary leading out to the sea. We see ships sitting in low tide on the mud of the estuary along the dockside of the town, and red brick factory buildings.

EXT. GATES TO MONTREUIL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the riders enter the walled town we see the poor clustered around the gates - destitute and sick people clammering to get in.
</DIRECTION>
<BEGGARS_CHORUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At the end of the day you're another day older And that's all you can say for the life of the poor. It's a struggle! It's a war! And there's nothing that anyone's giving. One more day standing about - What is it for? One day less to be living.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEGGARS_CHORUS>
<DIRECTION>
Javert sees the destitution of the people. Expressionless as ever.

The long work space is full of tables at which conservatively dressed women are working, making jewelry out of shellac, a black resin which looks like jet.

Valjean hears the cry, but he has other concerns. He turns round to face Javert.

On the factory floor below, the Foreman hustles Fantine out, as she struggles against him.

Valjean throws him a sharp glance.

</VALJEAN>
<DIRECTION>
A CRASH from outside in the yard - shouts -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRACK LEADING TO FACTORY, MONTREUIL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean and Javert hurry out across the factory yard and down the muddy track beyond to discover -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A heavily laden cart has toppled onto the cart driver - Fauchelevent, the worker seen before taking a rest on a crate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cart driver and the Foreman are trying to lift the cart off the crushed man, but it's too heavy, and the ground is too soft. Fauchelevent screams as the cart slowly sinks in the mud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean, Javert and Javert's assistant all hurry to help, but they can't get a proper purchase in the spongy ground. All the time the cart is sinking further, pushing Fauchelevent deeper into the mud that will soon bury him. Then Valjean sees a way. At one end the wheels of the cart have stopped sinking - the ground is harder here. He throws himself under the cart at this higher end, and braces himself to lift it from beneath.
</DIRECTION>
<VALJEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get back! It may fall!
	</DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CROWD>
<DIRECTION>
Javert stands back and looks on. As he looks, we see a memory stirring in him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAVERT'S POV - Valjean's posture beneath the cart is exactly the same as the convict beneath the fallen mast. The same crouching power. The same almost-suicidal determination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean sees Javert looking at him, and knows exactly what he's thinking. For a moment he hesitates. Then he hears Fauchelevent's choking scream as the mud gags his mouth. Valjean strains every muscle, and slowly one end of the cart begins to rise. As soon as it clears the crushed and gasping man, the others pull him clear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean lets the cart down again, and climbs out. As he brushes himself down he finds Javert staring at him.
</DIRECTION>
<JAVERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can this be true? I don't believe what I see! A man your age To be as strong as you are! A memory stirs... You make me think of a man From years ago A man who broke his parole.. He disappeared.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAVERT>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes his head, realising how absurd his suspicions are.
</DIRECTION>
<JAVERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive me, sir. I would not dare -

<VALJEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

Valjean holds Javert's gaze, challenging him to say more. Javert is not yet confident enough to continue.

Valjean goes to help Fauchelevent.

<VALJEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

<JAVERT>

Fantine makes her way to the harbour wall. Beggars shelter in the tunnels under the red brick buildings.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. RED LIGHT DISTRICT, MONTREUIL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fantine makes her way down wet slimy steps. This leads to an alleyway that runs down to the harbour and three ships lying on the mud at low tide. At the far end, the largest is the rotting hulk of a vast old warship. A single whore sits in a doorway.

The hair crone leads Fantine down to her shop at the base of the stairs.

	There was a time when men were kind, When their voices were soft And their words inviting. There was a time when love was blind And the world was a song And the song was exciting. There was a time... Then it all went wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FANTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dreamed a dream in time gone by, When hope was high And life worth living. I dreamed that love would never die. I dreamed that God would be forgiving. Then I was young and unafraid And dreams were made and used and wasted. There was no ransom to be paid, No song unsung, no wine untasted.

	<DIALOGUE>
	But the tigers come at night With their voices soft as thunder As they tear your hope apart As they turn your dream to shame.

EXT. RED LIGHT DISTRICT, MONTREUIL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fantine is out on the snow and ice-covered quayside, shivering, waiting for trade. She looks pale and sickly, but still attempts an alluring smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She moves past the anchored ships, beneath the bowsprits, trying pathetically to attract custom. Then she comes to a stop, staring. She has seen and recognised Valjean, some way off. He's out in the harbour district. He is talking to a beggar. Before he moves on, he hands over some money.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Fantine watches Valjean on his mission of mercy, a well- dressed young man, BAMATABOIS, comes up to her. He arrives with two friends and a valet.
</DIRECTION>
<BAMATABOIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's something new. I think I'll give it a try. Come closer, you! I like to see what I buy. The usual price For just one slice of your pie.

	</DIALOGUE>
</FANTINE>
<BAMATABOIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got some nerve, you little slut! You've got some gall! It's the same with a tart as it is with a grocer The customer sees what he gets in advance It's not for the whore to say "yes sir" or "no sir" It's not for the harlot to pick and to choose or to lead me a dance!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAMATABOIS>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls her clothing open and laughingly stuffs snow down her cleavage. Fantine reacts with fury. They fall over in the snow and Bamatabois laughs.

<BAMATABOIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Javert, would you believe it? I was walking, it was dark When this prostitute attacked me You can see she's left her mark!

</JAVERT>
<DIRECTION>
Fantine is almost fainting with fear, still racked with occasional spasms of coughing. Unseen by her, Valjean is approaching from behind. Javert's assistants pick Fantine up. Javert covers his mouth with a handkerchief as he approaches Fantine.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a child who sorely needs me, Please, m'sieur, she's but that high. Holy God, is there no mercy? If I go to jail she'll die.

Javert looks on, containing his anger, as Valjean reaches out a hand to Fantine. To Fantine, it's as if he's come to her in a dream -

</FANTINE>
<VALJEAN>

</VALJEAN>
<FANTINE>

Valjean conceals his shock.
</DIRECTION>
<JAVERT>

	</DIALOGUE>
</JAVERT>
<VALJEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

Javert is about to protest again, but Valjean raises one commanding hand, to indicate his decision is made. Javert gives an abrupt bow, and departs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Left alone, Valjean paces his office, deeply disturbed.

The village street is bright with booths set up for a Frost Fair. Families and visitors are out buying baubles, or laughing at the antics of travelling players. Small girls cluster round a stall that displays prettily-dressed dolls. Amongst them is a prettily-dressed girl of 8 or 9 years: EPONINE.
</DIRECTION>

Across the road from this stall stands a shabby inn. A sign lashed to an old cart swinging in the wind reveals the inn to be `The Sergeant of Waterloo'. The inn is still closed despite the small crowd at the fair.

Cosette has filled her buckets at the well in the wood, and is now heading back. Through the dark trees ahead we glimpse the cheerful lights of the Frost Fair and the distant inn.

After a few steps she pauses to rest the weight of the buckets.

Valjean looks round. No way out. Then he sees a nearby lamp bracket. Hanging from it is the rope that is used to lower the oil lamp for lighting. He tears off the rope and ties one end round Cosette, beneath her armpits. Then holding the other end, he scales the wall, using the corner to brace himself as he rises. Once on the top, he hauls Cosette up by the rope. Only then does he turn to look down onto the other side.

Valjean looks to the heavens. The camera soars into the air and heads east as dawn breaks over Paris. We rush low over Paris as the sun comes up, towards the Place de la Bastille.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLACE DE LA BASTILLE, PARIS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nine years later.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dawn light glows on a massive ELEPHANT. The monument, made of wood and plaster, now ruined and crumbling, stands on a plinth on one side of the wide open square. On the far side, the remains of the great fortress that was the Bastille. In the middle, scaffolding surrounds a half-built triumphal column, which is being erected to celebrate the new regime.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paris, 1832.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The streets that run from the square lead in one direction to the Paris of power and wealth; in the other direction into the slums.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera sweeps in and down to meet the elephant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A head pops out of one of the elephant's many holes - GAVROCHE, a street urchin. He gives a shrill whistle. At once a dozen more street urchins show themselves, from every crack in the monument's skin. Agile as a monkey, Gavroche drops to the ground, followed by his band.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARIS BOULEVARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOLLOW GAVROCHE in as he races down a grand boulevard, dodging the crowds of strolling bourgeoisie and beggars, weaving in and out of the lines of carriages attempting to make their way in either direction. These are the conveyances of the rich, fine gilded coaches with matched horses and footmen on the back. Virtually at a standstill, they lend Gavroche a platform as he leaps from coach to coach, a street urchin dancing on the heads of the elite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he goes, the poor on the pavements sing to the stony- faced rich in their golden high-sprung glory -
</DIRECTION>
<BEGGARS_CHORUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look down and see the beggars at your feet! Look down and show some mercy if you can! Look down and see the sweepings of the street! Look down, look down, Upon your fellow man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEGGARS_CHORUS>
<DIRECTION>
The fine ladies and grand gentlemen in the carriages avert their eyes, or raise the blinds of their carriage windows to shut out the sight of the losers of their world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gavroche, bounding over their heads, evading the swipes of liveried footmen, lands on the running board of one particularly grand carriage and begs/taunts the RICH OCCUPANT.
</DIRECTION>
<GAVROCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	`Ow do you do? My name's Gavroche! These are my people, here's my patch. Not much to look at - nothing posh! Nothing that you'd call up to scratch. This is my school, my high society! Here in the slums of St Michel. We live on crumbs of humble piety Tough on the teeth - but what the hell! Think you're poor? Think you're free? Follow me! Follow me!

<DIRECTION>
STILL RUNNING WITH Gavroche as he hops onto the back of another very grand carriage, the traffic now moving at last, hitching a ride on the back - one or two of his gang hop on back of carriage with him, the others run panting after to hear his political lecture.
</DIRECTION>
<GAVROCHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was a time we killed the King We tried to change the world too fast. Now we have got another King, He is no better than the last. This is the land that fought for liberty - Now when we fight we fight for bread! Here is the thing about equality - Everyone's equal when they're dead. Take your place! Take your chance!

The carriage has reached an arch into a courtyard where a crowd of a couple of hundred is gathered outside a house of sickness. The carriage stops as its occupant wants to watch what is going on. The street is padded with straw. Many eyes gaze up at the draped windows. People cross themselves. A priest is seen hurrying into the house, accompanied by two altar boys.
</DIRECTION>

Gavroche jumps off as the carriage stops and joins the crowd. The crowd is made up of citizens of Paris, student revolutionaries, the poor and beggars. The students hand out printed leaflets and try to excite the crowd.

CLOSE ON a signet ring, a family crest.

EXT. RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE - END OF DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marius is stopped as he exits the front door of the Gorbeau Tenement by a passing carriage. Once it passes Marius sees two people in the street outside. One is an old gentleman, Valjean. The other is a beautiful young girl, Cosette. The two are giving alms to beggars as they walk back from evening church service.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marius can't take his eyes off Cosette. He's never seen anyone so lovely in his life. We hear the instrumental foreshadowing of `A Heart Full of Love'.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As if drawn by Marius's gaze, Cosette looks up and meets his eyes. She too is amazed: he's looking at her as if he already knows her. A second carriage breaks their held gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marius continues on down the street and when he looks back, at that precise moment Cosette looks at him again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean instinctively puts his arm round her, guarding her jealously from this distant boy's gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We cut further down the street to an alleyway where the Thenardiers, heavily disguised, are waiting for Valjean's approach with their gang of crooks, Babet, Brujon, Clacquesous, Montparnasse.
</DIRECTION>
<THENARDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone here, you know your place - Brujon, Babet, Clacquesous - You, Montparnasse, watch for the law - With Eponine - take care.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No mistakes, my dears!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THENARDIER>
<DIRECTION>
Thenardier approaches Valjean and lures him into the mouth of the alleyway where Madame Thenardier is sat on the ground holding the crying infant. Cosette is a few steps behind, still entranced by the sight of Marius.
</DIRECTION>
<THENARDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, M'sieur, come this way. Here's a child that ain't eaten today. Save a life, spare a sou! God rewards all the good that you do.

As Valjean bends down to look at Madame Thenardier she recognizes him.

	You know me! I know you! And you'll pay what I'm due.

He signals to his gang. A door opens in the alleyway revealing the huge Brujon. The gang move in on Valjean menacingly.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the police! Disappear! Run for it! It's Javert!

</EPONINE>
<DIRECTION>
The gang spill out into the street to find themselves confronted by Javert now with his men. Marius watches, as does Gavroche, drawn by the rumpus.
</DIRECTION>
<JAVERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Another brawl in the square! Another stink in the air! Was there a witness to this? Well, let him speak to Javert!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAVERT>
<DIRECTION>
He sees man with his arm protectively round a girl but does not recognize Valjean as Valjean has averted his face.
</DIRECTION>
<JAVERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Monsieur, these streets are not safe. But let these vermin beware, We'll see that justice is done!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAVERT>
<DIRECTION>
He turns back on the Thenardier gang in the passage.
</DIRECTION>
<JAVERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look upon this fine collection Crawled from underneath a stone. This swarm of worms and maggots Could have picked you to the bone! I know this man over here, I know his name and his trade. And on your witness, m'sieur, I'll see him suitably paid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAVERT>
<DIRECTION>
He turns back to find Valjean and Cosette gone.
</DIRECTION>
<JAVERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But where's the gentlemen gone? And why on earth did he run?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAVERT>
<THENARDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will have a job to find him! He's not all he seems to be - And that girl he trails behind him She's the child he stole from me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THENARDIER>
<DIRECTION>
Marius, equally baffled, goes off in search of them.
</DIRECTION>
<JAVERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could it be he's that old jailbird That the tide now washes in? Heard my name and started running... All the omens point to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAVERT>
<DIRECTION>
Thenardier, listening, hears this all with great interest. So Valjean is a crook like him.
</DIRECTION>
<JAVERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the girl who stood beside him, When I turned they both had gone. Could he be the man I've hunted? Could it be he's Jean Valjean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAVERT>
<THENARDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the absence of a victim, Dear Inspector, may I go? And remember when you've nicked him It was me what told you so.

He is furious. He sings to Javert's departing back, and to Marius who is close by.

INT. VALJEAN'S HOUSE, RUE PLUMET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cosette is pacing in her bedroom. It's a pretty room, the best room in this small summer house. Her shutters are open, giving a view of a wild unkempt garden. She looks at herself in a mirror, aware of her looks perhaps for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<COSETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How strange - This feeling that my life's begun at last! This change - Can people really fall in love so fast? What's the matter with you, Cosette? Have you been too much on your own? So many things unclear - So many things unknown...

</COSETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In my life There are so many questions and answers That somehow seem wrong. In my life There are times when I catch in the silence The sigh of a faraway song And it sings Of a world that I long to see - Out of reach Just a whisper away Waiting for me!

</VALJEAN>
<COSETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's so little I know That I'm longing to know Of the man that you were In a time long ago... There's so little you say Of the life you have known, Why you keep to yourself, Why we're always alone. So dark! So dark and deep, The secrets that you keep! In my life Please forgive what I say You are loving and gentle and good. But papa, dear papa, In your eyes I am still like that child Who was lost in a wood.

EXT. PARIS STREETS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All is still. Then comes the soft beating of draped drums. The tramp of feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All down the streets, waiting, the silent faces of the poor. Among them we see Enjolras, Marius, and the radical students.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Police and national guardsmen control the growing crowds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now into view come the leaders of a great FUNERAL PROCESSION. An entire battalion of infantry, marching with weapons reversed. A column of black-suited dignitaries carrying branches of laurel. A division of Cavalry rides in front, behind a section of military drummers who drum a military tatoo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTO FRAME comes a team of black horses stepping slowly, black plumes nodding, drawing behind them a gun carriage draped in the tricolour flag. On the carriage stands a COFFIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Softly, in time with the drums, the watching people begin to sing.

Enjolras, the students, and the impassioned crowd have now become the procession. They turn off the main street away from the expected course of the funeral procession. Gavroche's elephant looms over this side street. Gavroche and his gang jump down from the elephant to join in.

</STUDENTS_CROWD>
<DIRECTION>
The students and crowd come face to face with the calvary. On one side, muskets of the infantry poke through the broken down fence surrounding the elephant. Other infantry have taken up position in a cafe opposite, upending tables to provide cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a tense, prolonged silence. Then suddenly one nervous SOLDIER lets off a round. It hits a middle aged kindly looking WOMAN CITIZEN in the crowd around the coffin carriage. The crowd is furious. Students charge the soldier, grab his musket and knock him down with the hilt of the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More shots ring out. The cavalry charges. The funeral explodes into a riot. The people of Paris turn on the dragoons, the National Guards, the police. More squadrons of dragoons charge into the crowd, sabres unsheathed. Women run screaming in terror.

Some students fire weapons into the air, some into the cavalry and at the infantry. Enjolras knocks a calvary officer off his horse and Marius jumps on the horse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The students break away and race off through the cafe into a side street where citizens begin to erect a barricade. A cavalry rider gives chase and is shot by one of the students and falls through the window of an upended carriage. The students, with Marius on horseback, race to the slums.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUE DE LA CHANVRERIE/INT. CAFE MUSAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOLLOW the students as they burst into their home street. They have been joined by a motley collection of citizens including burghers and an old eccentric man FATHER MABEUF who works as hard as anyone. They raid a fencing shop and a gun shop for weapons, they force wives to give up their husbands' muskets and chalk up the debt to the revolution on their front doors, they encourage homeowners to contribute furniture sometimes appearing at high windows to help overcome any reluctance. Soon the street is raining tables, chairs, mattresses, sofas. They smash streetlamps. They set to work to build their barricade. Students commandeer an omnibus which is overturned to form the barricade's heart. Three students arrive in the street hauling an uprooted tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pull up paving stones, rip boards, timbers and front doors from house and shop-fronts, pull down buttresses, and raid the Cafe Musain, systematically stripping it of every item of furniture despite the lamentations and protestations of Madame Hucheloup and her barmaid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the barricade rises they bring down from the first floor of the cafe the rifles and ammunition they've gathered, to prepare to defend their chosen ground. A student stands on a stone post distributing weapons. They line the first and second floor front rooms with paving stones to create protected shooting positions. The inside of the barricade is built neatly with steps up made from paving stones. The outside is a crazy knarled mess.
</DIRECTION>

The barricade is now complete: an impressive wall up to twelve feet high, with one heavily guarded section that can be wheeled open to allow access. Two smaller barricades protect the left and right side of the cafe. Enjolras climbs halfway up the main barricade and turns to his little army. Grantaire prises the final piece of Madame Hucheloup's furniture from her arms - her favourite sewing armchair - and adds it to the barricade. As the men sing she steals it back defiantly.

Javert is led into the cafe. As they pass through the front door only one student is holding Javert. Seizing his opportunity, Javert breaks free and the students have to subdue him by force. Javert is on his knees and is being tied to the staircase.

Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, out of the darkness, the students and citizens at the barricade here an ominous distant sound. The sound of marching feet, hundreds of men, marching in unison. First soft, then building louder and louder, closer and closer. Boots on cobbles. The sound comes right into the end of the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enjolras and all the students man the main barricade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They peer over the barricade. In the pitch blackness, all they can make out is hundreds of gossamer thin slivers. These are bayonets and musket barrels dimly lit by the reflection from the torch.

A voice shouts out from the darkness.

A flash turns all the facades of the street bright crimson as though the door of a furnace has suddenly open and shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dreadful explosion bursts over the barricade. The red flag falls, the pole sliced through. Bullets richochet off the cornices of the houses, bore into the barricade and wound several men.

Enjolras picks up the fallen flag and is about to take it up when the old man Father Mabeuf who has seen many insurrections before this takes the flag and runs up onto the top of the barricade.

A second volley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Father Mabeuf falls down dead. While everyone is reacting to the dead old man and the wounded, the men are distracted from noticing that some French soldiers have used the cover of darkness to creep down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All at once the FIRST FULL ATTACK begins. Shouts and the rattle of gunfire as SOLDIERS throw themselves up and over the barricade. The students run for their guns and return fire. They are taken by surprise. All could be lost in the first instant. Some soldiers make it up to the top of the barricade, where they're driven back by the fierce resistance of the defenders. Eponine sees one soldier aiming his rifle at Marius - she throws herself in front of Marius just as the rifle fires - and Marius is safe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are being overrun. Panic ensues. The gun battle is fierce. Marius in a flash of inspiration realises all is lost unless they do something. He drags a barrel of gunpowder to the top of the barricade, grabs the torch and with a face of deadly resolve he tips the torch towards the barrel.

	`Dearest Cosette, you have entered my soul And soon you will be gone. Can it be only a day since we met And the world was reborn? If I should fall in the battle to come Let this be my goodbye. Now that I know you love me as well It is harder to die. I pray that God will bring me home To be with you. Pray for your Marius. He prays for you.'

He looks up, deeply distressed. He can't bear the thought of losing Cosette.

<VALJEAN>

EXT. PARIS STREETS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean walks the streets, not caring where he goes, struggling with his tormented thoughts. He sees a barricade being dismantled. And bodies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he knows what he's going to do. He sees a dead soldier. He takes his jacket and swiftly pulls it on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He continues on his way in the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking up he sees that he's been walking all the time towards the very barricade where Marius waits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now looking like a soldier, he passes unchallenged through their lines, and into the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he passes, he notices two soldiers climbing up onto the rooftops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BARRICADE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Glimpses through the barricade of a lone figure approaching from the far end of the narrow street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure comes into lamp light. It's Valjean, in the soldier's jacket. The student sentries level their guns. Gavroche jumps up.

</GAVROCHE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Valjean spots a couple of snipers creeping over the roofs to gain an angle of attack on them. They are aiming at Enjolras. Swiftly Valjean grabs a gun and shoots up at them sending them scattering. Quickly other students join in and the snipers are driven back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a burst of gunfire from both ends of the street as a brief fire fight ensues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The snipers have disappeared.

Enjolras turns to Valjean.

<DIRECTION>
Look-outs keep watch at either end of the barricaded street. Many of the rest of the rebels are sleeping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean paces, unable to sleep, inside the cafe. Dead bodies are lined up on the ground floor. He comes to a stop, and gazes on Marius as he sleeps through the window.
</DIRECTION>
<VALJEAN>

	God on high Hear my prayer In my need You have always been there. He is young He's afraid Let him rest Heaven blessed. Bring him home Bring him home Bring him home!

Valjean is now kneeling next to the sleeping Marius.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRANE UP AND UP - Seeing the little world of the barricaded street now surrounded by waiting soldiers - and the streets round them packed with soldiers in their thousands, so many that we know the little band can never win.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRANE UP AND UP until the barricade and the army that entraps it has become a small pool of darkness in the centre of the bright lights of Paris.

The sun still below the rooftops. Every house is tightly shuttered.

Enjolras re-enters the barricade through the secret gate. He has been on a reconnaissance. He looks at the street. No one is stirring, but for a single shutter which opens a crack - a face peeps - and it closes again. Below him the students are up and getting ready.

He runs up the barricade, seizes Gavroche's body in his arms, convulsed with grief, and brings it back through the gate in the barricade.

At the other end of the street Javert has appeared. He sees this gate. And talks to the Army Officer.

As the smoke from the muskets clears horses are revealed drawing field artillery into position. The Army Officer is lining up the big guns carefully.

<DIRECTION>
The sun now appears above the rooftops of the city.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the big guns fire - BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bombardment hits the barricade, rocking it. In its wake a massive barrage of musket fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The big gun has been lined up with the gate and has burst right through in the first hit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bullets fly, and every few moments another cannon ball smashes into the piled debris. Javert is glimpsed among the attackers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enjolras and the students throw themselves onto the barricades, firing at the attackers, handing their rifles down to others to be re-loaded, firing again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean moves among them, tending to the wounded, lifting down the dead, regardless of his own safety.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marius takes a bullet, and crumples and falls. Valjean runs towards him -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRASH! The latest cannonade bursts a hole in the barricade and now the soldiers are storming through. The hard core of student fighters retreat, firing as they go, into the Café Musain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAFÉ MUSAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Students and soldiers fight in the café, on the stairs, up the stairs to the upper room. Students driving back the pursuing soldiers hack away at the staircase, smashing it to fragments - the soldiers below fire up at them - students fall, their bodies caught on the jagged remnants of the stairs. Grantaire is still unconscious from drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BARRICADE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean has Marius in his arms and is hiding him from the onrush of the soldiers -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAFÉ MUSAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The students' ammunition has run out, they're hurling sticks and bottles - but the soldiers have found a way to clamber up, shooting as they come, and one by one the students are falling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE CAFÉ MUSAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean carries Marius away from the carnage. A soldier challenges him. One violent blow from Valjean sends the soldier flying -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAFÉ MUSAIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The soldiers break through at last to the upper room, to find there's only Enjolras still alive. He stands by the window, knowing he will die now, proud and unafraid. Seeing him the soldiers hesitate. The sudden silence wakes Grantaire from his drunken slumber.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANTAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Long live the republic!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANTAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
He sees Enjolras with the muskets raised against him. Grantaire goes and joins him. Enjolras smiles, and raises his now-ragged red flag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rifles blaze. Grantaire drops back to the ground. Enjolras falls back -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BARRICADE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enjolras falling backwards out of the window, until he hangs upside down, the red flag still in his hands, streaming like blood down the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK to see the street littered with corpses, and the remains of the barricade, and soldiers scouring the rubble for any last pockets of resistance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK AND BACK to come to a stop looking at the wide scene. INTO FRAME walks Javert, grimly surveying the victory of law over rebellion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BACK ALLEY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean carries Marius down a long narrow alley that runs between the backs of tall houses. The alley turns a corner - and there ahead is a dead end. Behind him, the stamp of soldiers' boots. Ahead, no way out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then his searching gaze falls on an iron grating in the ground. A storm drain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE SOLDIERS - As they come round the corner into the end of the alley. They look round. It's empty.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<DIRECTION>
The soldiers depart. A moment of silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then into the alley's end steps Javert. Not so easily fooled. He walks all the way to the end, and looks round. He sees the drain at his feet. He sees the signs that the grating has been lifted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stoops, and tries to lift it. It's far too heavy for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He straightens up and looks round, calculating. Where does the drain lead?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARIS SEWERS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean is pulling Marius after him down a tight sloping pipe, where dark water races. Suddenly they start to slide, then drop through a vent into a wide sewage tunnel. Faint light reflecting off the slime of curving tunnel walls. The skitter of rats. Sodden forms floating by: dead bodies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean carries Marius down the tunnel, moving as fast as he can, losing strength all the time. He reaches an intersection where four sewers meet. Light falls through distant gratings. One of the four sewers is dry. Here he lets his burden down, and himself sinks to the slimy ground to rest. He lets his eyes close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A voice echoes in the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<THENARDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's a hint of gold Stuck into a tooth - Pardon me, m'sieur, You won't be needing it no more. Shouldn't be too hard to sell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THENARDIER>
<DIRECTION>
A figure coming closer. A sewer thief, robbing corpses. No sign of life in either Valjean or Marius.
</DIRECTION>
<THENARDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, someone's got to clean'em up, my friends, Before the little harvest Disappears into the mud. Someone's got to collect their odds and ends When the gutters run with blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THENARDIER>
<DIRECTION>
Now we see the thief is Thenardier. He finds a ring on Marius's finger and pulls it off.
</DIRECTION>
<THENARDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's a tasty ring Pretty little thing Heart's no longer going And he's lived his little time, But his watch is ticking yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THENARDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a world where the dog eats the dog. Where they kill for the bones in the street. And God in his heaven, He don't interfere Cos he's dead as the stiff at my feet! I raise my eyes to see the heavens And only the moon looks down. The harvest moon shines down!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean wakes, rears up, seizes Thenardier by the arm, slams him against the sewer wall.
</DIRECTION>
<VALJEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do I get out of here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALJEAN>
<THENARDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There! That way!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THENARDIER>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean drops him, picks Marius up once more, and sets off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thenardier stares after them, grinning. He's sent then the wrong way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER - Valjean in the sewers, Marius on his back, and they're sinking ever deeper into the slimy water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he feels himself sink, Valjean holds Marius up in his arms and forges on, chest deep, lifting the younger man above his head. Still he sinks, until his face is half- submerged and he's gagging in the filth. He stumbles, and suddenly he's sunk beneath the surface, and Marius is dropping -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then up he bursts again, face black with slime, eyes burning with his refusal to be beaten.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER - Valjean staggers down the endless sewers, Marius on his back. But all the time he can hear, closer now, the rushing sound of the river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Round a bend and at last - moonlight ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drags himself on through the shallow running water towards the moonlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches the exit at last. Before him the river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIVER EMBANKMENT, PARIS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean, crusted with slime, heaves Marius out of the sewer onto the embankment that runs beside the river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up. There, staring at him, is Javert.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean rises slowly. Heaves Marius up onto his back once more. The strain of the night is showing. He's a man near the end of his strength.
</DIRECTION>
<VALJEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's you, Javert! I knew you wouldn't wait too long. The faithful servant at his post once more. This man's done no wrong. And he needs his family's care.

Javert draws his pistol and holds it to Valjean's head.

</VALJEAN>
<DIRECTION>
He starts walking past Javert. Javert's hand trembles as it holds the pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valjean keeps walking. Javert wills himself to shoot, but he just can't do it. Frustrated, enraged with himself, he lowers the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<JAVERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take him, Valjean, Before I change my mind! I will be waiting... 24601!

	Who is this man? What sort of devil is he? To have caught me in a trap And choose to let me go free? It was his hour at last To put a seal on my fate Wipe out the past And wash me clean off the slate! All it would take Was a flick of his knife Vengeance was his And he gave me back my life!

He begins to move away along the embankment, up steps, towards a bridge. He's unaware of everything except the turmoil in his brain.

<JAVERT>

	Damned if I live in the debt of a thief! Damned if I yield at the end of the chase! I am the law and the law is not mocked! I'll spit his pity right back in his face!

</VALJEAN_FANTINE_EPONINE_BISHOP>
<DIRECTION>
Led by Fantine, Valjean walks out of the Chapel towards the cloister.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What remains is Cosette, her head cradled in the lap of the man who has just died.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The walls of the cloisters are covered in votive candles. The Bishop of Digne waits in front of the candles. Now Valjean's strong and young again. Before they reach the wall of candles, all three are gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they disappear we CRANE UP, high over the cloister, high over the walls of the Convent and we see the Paris streets outside. Fires are burning and debris is scattered in the streets. Dawn is breaking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From far away, the sound of an approaching crowd -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLACE DE LA BASTILLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA MOVES over the cobbles as the light of the rising sun reveals the devastation left by a bitter street battle. Past the remains of a barricade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The distant sound of an approaching march.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERIMPOSE CAPTION:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sixteen years later. Paris, 1848.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From far off, the swelling sounds of the approaching march become the words of a song.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCHERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you hear the people sing Lost in the valley of the night? It is the music of a people Who are climbing to the light For the wretched of the earth There is a flame that never dies Even the darkest night will end And the sun will rise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCHERS>
<DIRECTION>
As THE CAMERA RISES we see we're in the Place de la Bastille. The triumphal column has long been completed, but the great elephant is sadly dilapidated and has become incorporated into an immense barricade - three stories high, seven hundred feet long. Down all the streets that converge on the square we now see the multiple victory marches approaching. They cheer and beat drums as they climb up to the top of the barricade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERIMPOSE CAPTIONS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The people of Paris have risen in their tens of thousands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The King has fled. A new Republic is born.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There in the forefront of one column march Marius and Cosette.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCHERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They will live again in freedom In the garden of the Lord They will walk behind the plough- share They will put away the sword The chain will be broken And all men will have their reward!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCHERS>
<DIRECTION>
As the marchers come nearer we begin to realise how many there are: thousand upon thousand. And there marching among them we see ghosts from the past - Enjolras and the students who died - and Fantine - and Eponine -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And out of the crumbling elephant peers another ghost: the grinning face of Gavroche. He climbs out to dance on the elephant, as the crowd fill the square.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCHERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you join in our crusade? Who will be strong and stand with me? Somewhere beyond the barricade Is there a world you long to see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCHERS>
<DIRECTION>
As the marchers converge, there watching them are Thenardier and his wife. Thenardier gives the marchers a wave of greeting. Survivors to the last.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCHERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you hear the people sing? Say, do you hear the distant drums? It is the future that they bring When tomorrow comes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCHERS>
<DIRECTION>
Now among the marchers we see the ghost of Valjean, singing with the rest atop the barricade, amongst the waving red flags.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCHERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you join in our crusade? Who will be strong and stand with me? Somewhere beyond the barricade Is there a world you long to see? Do you hear the people sing? Say, do you hear the distant drums? It is the future that they bring When tomorrow comes... Tomorrow comes!
