CLOSE ON a pair of hands from VARIOUS ANGLES... The SOUNDS of the fighting grow LOUDER. Punches, kicks, elbows... The hands tense into fists. They're strong hands. Fighter's hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZOOM OUT TO REVEAL Julian (mid-thirties) staring at his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Even though he's kept in shape, he hasn't fought for a long time. The SOUND of the boxing match gets LOUDER STILL as Julian continues staring at his hands - it's almost as if he's meditating. Suddenly he breaths in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him sits a young kid dressed in Thai boxing clothes - this is Liang, barely sixteen. He looks nervous, occasionally glancing at Julian's reflection through the huge mirror that hangs on the far wall.

Julian continues to stare at his hands and closes them into a tight fist.

Two Young Thai Boxers beat the crap out of each other. The crowd is wild with excitement, people placing bets on which way the fight will turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the Thai Boxers goes down and money immediately starts changing hands...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ring is cleared and Liang jumps in as Julian pushes his way though the crowd, nodding at people as he passes. They know him here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again bets are placed....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PICK OUT a face in the crowd. Billy. Julian's older brother (late thirties).

Julian sits down next to Billy who's delighted to see him, throwing his arm around him, pulling him in close.
</DIRECTION>
<BILLY>

Billy offers Julian a hit from his bottle of Mehkong whiskey. Julian refuses. He's more interested in the fight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO THE RING where the fight has just started. Liang is immediately on the ropes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julian watches, concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Billy takes a phone call but he can't hear. He nods to Julian and takes it outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO THE FIGHT where Liang pulls an amazing move. Turns the tables. Takes the bigger man down with a series of jabs, swings and backfists.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Julian applauds Liang's success, Billy slinks off out of the auditorium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liang wins the fight with a knock out... The crowd go wild with adulation...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julian watches, transfixed...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Liang is lit up by a beatific white light... As he stands triumphant in the middle of the ring, the crowd start to gather round him... Julian continues to stare at what's taking place before him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Which is almost like a religious ceremony... The audience bow down before Liang as he stares out into the light... A look of calm washing over his face... A sense of stillness and peace... Enlightenment through victory and violence...

He spots Billy and follows him with his eyes as he continues to gamble. Billy moves across to a small private corner... ... where he meets various men and women, all smoking Methamphetamine. Billy joins in but an argument quickly starts up between him and another Thai Man. The music's too loud to hear what they're arguing about but it suddenly gets out of control... Billy starts viciously hitting the Thai Man and quickly the room EXPLODES in a frenzy of violence.

As Chang sleeps the heavy curtains are drawn to keep out the light of the day - but they cannot deaden the sound of the city outside as it goes about its frenetic everyday business. The CAMERA MOVES through the apartment, briefly settling on the sleeping Chang, then roaming through the various rooms, PICKING OUT different objects... We see that Chang is obsessed with cowboy films and a keen collector - the sitting room is stuffed with movie posters, photographs and other bits of movie memorabilia... Amongst the many family photos we also PICK OUT several pictures of Chang when he was in the army and shots of what looks like a very successful career as a Thai boxer. At the end of the tour we're back with Chang. We ZOOM IN to a tight CLOSE SHOT.

As he turns round we reveal... he's a particularly murderous looking member of Julian's crew - Ko Sam. We pick out Charlie Ling a little further down the road, who's looking at a tray of battery powered robots that some Street Kid's selling. They're all counting down the minutes. Biding their time. Waiting for Choi Yan Lee to turn up. Finally the sound of the Tuck-tuck approaching... Ko Sam drinks his coconut down in one - slurping as he hits the bottom. Letting the empty shell fall to the floor. Charlie Ling stands up. Feels the gun under his jacket.

Julian stumbles out of the kiosk and breaths in lungfulls of air. Disoriented, he careers into a stall selling various religious artefacts, sending candles, incense and statues of Buddha flying... He falls to the ground. When he gets to his feet everything around him seems intense and incredibly vibrant... The dogs fighting on the street, the Buddha that lies in pieces on the ground, the children that stand watching him, his crew as they come out of the kiosk, hiding their guns... Julian takes a long moment to get his bearings... Finally he stands up, but as he does he feels different... As if the axis of his world has shifted...

	You're right. We're family. We stick together. But Billy was family too.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNA>
<JULIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah we were brothers, but we were never close... And he was only in Bangkok cause you couldn't control him. So you sent him to me--

	I did what I could. And that's more than you ever did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIAN>

</JENNA>
<JULIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what did that get him? I'll tell you what, a one way ticket to this fucking place, just like me.

<JULIAN>

Jenna silently seethes, waiting for Julian to shut the fuck up. He quietens down...

Julian turns to her - he has been waiting all his life to say this.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right Mum. That's what's more important to you. But what about me? Sometimes I think you only got me out of there so the cops couldn't trace it back to you...

Jenna stares at him. Her face a mask.

<JULIAN>

Silence between them. Jenna lights another cigarette - her hands now shaking.

A pause. Julian's touched a nerve. Jenna recovers.

A mixed clientele. High class. Asian and European. But there's an edge to the atmosphere. The music's that bit too loud, that bit too aggressive.

As the camera TRACKS CLOSER to them we start to hear what they're saying...

Chang has just finished a meal with the Cops including Kim, Daeng and Phaiban. Chang is just settling the bill when the Three Gunmen walk in. He looks up just as they OPEN FIRE. An insane storm of led rains down on the room, shattering all the mirrors on the back wall, taking out Two Waitresses and covering the room with broken glass. Chang hits the floor and starts to drag himself towards some cover. Chang's men are completely pinned down. Phaiban's been hit and his white shirt has turned dark red with blood. Chang keeps edging towards where his jacket's hanging on a chair. In it, his pistol. The Gunmen keep firing. As soon as a clip is finished, they pull it out and put a fresh one in and keep shooting. A stray bullet hits the waiter who knocks over the chair Chang's jacket's on. It falls to the ground. With it, his pistol. He grabs it and returns fire, letting off four rounds. He takes Gunman One. Head shot, right between the eyes. Gunman Two sees this and sprays at Chang - - but Chang manages to dive to cover. He rolls and fires again, shooting Gunman Two in the chest three times. Chang's out of ammo and needs to reload. Gunman Three's weapon jams. He drops his weapon and runs. Before he's finished reloading his pistol, Chang's after him. He sees Phaiban. Dead. Daeng trying to stem the flow of blood from his chest. Chang keeps running, determined not to lose his man.

The Driver slows. Gunman Three struggles to jump into the open doors. Chang bursts out of the restaurant. Stops dead. Aims and fires off two rounds. Blood spatters across the inside of the windscreen. The Driver falls forward, dead. The back door of the van slams shut. Gunman Three thinks he's made it. He's wrong. The van isn't going anywhere. Chang approaches the back door of the van, ready to fire.

As the dance develops, so their positions become more combative; now crouching, now standing, hinting at the kicks and punches that they're about to perform... but all carried out with an almost beatific precision that is at odds with the violence that is about to follow...

The Music Ends. A moment of stillness, and then slowly we bring up the SOUND of the baying crowd. Chanting. Screaming. Wild excitement. Ready for the fight they've all been waiting for...

INT. THAI BOXING RING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd is packed. In one corner: Julian. Charlie Ling beside him along with Ko Sam. He looks focussed. Confident. In the other corner: Chang. Kim next to him along with a couple of his crew. He looks incredibly calm. The first bell sounds. Five second warning... Chang looks over into the crowd. Kanita with Nadee. Kanita offers him a 'thumbs up'. Chang smiles. Returns it. Julian looks over. Sees Mai take a seat. She holds his gaze. The second bell sounds. The first of five rounds. Julian and Chang walk up to the centre of the ring. The Referee stands between them. Brings them together. A quick look down to the Three Judges. Then a look between the two fighters. Julian eyes Chang. Steely determination in his eyes. Chang looks back at him without emotion.

<DIRECTION>
Julian and Chang circle each other. Julian moves in to attack first. He throws a straight left first to Chang's face and steps his left foot forward at the same time. Chang bends his right leg, dodging the attack. He then pounces on the upper part of Julian's arm with his right hand and catches his wrist with his left hand. He tries to turn Julian's front wrist up, but Julian's too strong. This is a surprise for Chang. He breaks and steps back. Julian moves in to attack again, raising both elbows to make an attack on Chang's head. Chang steps forward and pulls an uppercut, connecting hard with Julian's chin. Julian moves back, dazed. Takes a moment to get his bearings back. That hurt. Chang doesn't take the opportunity to attack. He hangs back. Waiting for Julian to come at him again. This pisses Julian off. He moves forward and throws an offensive kick with his right foot. Chang moves back to dodge the attack and swivels to try and strike with a counter attack. He moves too slow. The right footed attack was a feint. Julian slams his right foot down on the floor and uses it to swivel, unleashing a kick with his left which connects with Chang's jaw and sends him flying back. Julian uses his forward motion to propel him onwards. He bounds over to the disoriented Chang and hits him with a series of jabs and punches to his upper body and face. Chang's almost on the ropes. Julian comes in hard with kicks to the shins with his right foot. Chang bends his body to pass under Julian's right foot. Julian misses the target. Chang manages to place his right foot on Julian's left knee-joint which makes him fall down. Julian's in a vulnerable position, but Chang doesn't move to make the killer blow. He steps back to let him recover. Again this enrages Julian. He gets up and moves forward towards Chang. He comes in with a high right kick. Again Chang manages to dodge the attack and returns with a right foot to the back of Julian's left knee. Julian swivels, punches air, and gets a trio of punches in his gut. His guard's down. But again no killer punch.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

Chang retreats. Shrugs at Julian. You come on. Julian moves towards him, but before he gets a chance to take out his frustrations, the bell goes. End of round one. Julian stalks back to his corner. He turns to look at Chang, a look of intense anger and frustration.

INT. THAI BOXING RING - NIGHT

Julian moves towards the middle where Chang is already waiting. Julian waits for Chang this time. Chang is reluctant to attack. A waiting game... Who will strike first... Chang wins. Julian moves to kick Chang in the ribs, keeping both his hands down as he moves in. Chang predicts this and prepares to throw his own kick as it comes in. Chang steps back, but again Julian swivels, using his right foot instead to pivot and unleashes a killer strike with his left foot. Chang goes flying backwards. PICK OUT the look of concern etched on the faces of Nadee and Kanita. Chang recovers but Julian moves in fast with a series of punches and elbows. Chang's on the ropes now and getting badly beaten. He clings on to Julian to limit the damage.

The two fighters step back from each other. Chang's face is damaged. Juilan's about to get stuck into him again when the bell sounds. End of the second round. Round three: Julian slamming punches into Chang. Nadee comforting Kanita. Telling her it'll be okay. Chang responding with kicks and elbows. Defensive blocks and counter attacks. Mai willing Julian on. Jenna watching with Gordon... End of round: Julian feeling more confident. Again his eyes scan the crowd. This time he sees what he's looking for: Jenna. Chang eyeballs Julian from the other corner. Sees him staring into the crowd. Looks over. Tries to see what he's looking at but can't make it out. POV from Chang as he sees Jenna make her way toward Julian. When she gets to him we see her saying something to Julian about the fight - urging him to hit harder... Jenna then walks back to Gordon... On Chang. Deep in thought. He gets up early. Walks around the ring. Looking into the crowd. Jenna sees him. Stares at him. Suddenly nervous. Everything slows down as Chang clocks her again. The colours of the room change from blue to yellow to red. He's seen her and she knows she's been seen. And he knows. And she knows that he knows... The bell goes off. Back to reality. Chang turns round. Too late. He gets a massive blow to his head. He goes down hard. The Referee starts counting. Nadee and Kanita watch on, fearful. Jenna holds her breath. Hopeful that he might be down and out. Kim watches on, concerned.

Back on his feet, Chang suddenly drops his guard. Julian hesitates, confused. Chang leans in close to him. Winks.

Chang raises his arms again. Ready to fight. Julian gets ready to attack but something's changed. The fire's gone out of him. He looks over to his mother, to Mai, Chang's words echoing in his mind. It's not his fault. Then Chang comes in with a flurry of punches. Left, right, left, right. Julian just takes them... Chang pauses in the onslaught. Julian stays motionless in the middle of the ring. Chang runs at him, flings his right foot, swivels, pulling out a roundhouse left kick - - which makes contact with Julian's draw. SLOW MOTION as Julian's head takes the impact. He's out cold before he hits the floor.
