INT. ALICE'S ROOM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
NIGHT IN ALICE'S ROOM. A little bit of moonlight coming in through the tiny window might make a highlight here and there but that's about all. Words begin to crawl across the screen:

(crawl)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of good family, albeit one of modest means, she was a comely young woman and not without prospects. Therefore it was at once heartbreaking and astonishing to her mother that she would enter into marriage with William Munny, a known thief and murderer, a man of notoriously vicious and intemperate disposition.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WRITTEN_WORDS>
<DIRECTION>
We can HEAR STRAWBERRY ALICE and DAVEY BUNTING breathing heavily and the bed creaking.

	<DIALOGUE>
	They were married in St. Louis in 1870 and they traveled North to Kansas where he engaged in farming and swine husbandry.

</WRITTEN_WORDS>
<DIRECTION>
Davey and Alice are picking up speed now, breathing faster and even snorting a little, and it's cold as Jesus in Nebraska in the winter so when the blanket slips, Alice snarls and gasps.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The blanket, for chrissake, cowboy, the blanket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
There are six of these little rooms... one for each whore... behind Greely's Beer Garden and Billiards and the walls are just boards so you can hear what's happening in the other rooms and right now, from DELILAH'S room, you can hear a high-pitched, merry little giggle and that's important.
</DIRECTION>
<WRITTEN_WORDS>
<DIRECTION>
(crawl contd.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She bore him two children in the eight years of their marriage and when she died, it was not at his hands as her mother might have expected, but of smallpox. That was in 1878.

	It wasn't until 1881... three yeats later... that a cowboy named Mike cut up a whore in Big Whiskey, Nebraska in the Niobrara River country.

A blur of action as Davey leaps from the bed and dashes out of the room naked...

<MIKE_S_VOICE_o_s>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...brand you like a damn steer, bitch...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE_S_VOICE_o_s>

and Alice is right behind him, wrapping herself in a blanket as she goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DELILAH'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DELILAH is backed up against the wall, her face bleeding, and she is throwing the contents of her chamber pot on MIKE who is advancing on her with an open barlow knife and Davey busts into the room naked and Alice follows him and people are shouting in other rooms.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
(wiping shit off himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold the bitch, Davey, hold her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
The one coal oil lamp in the room gives off just enough light that you can make all this out. Certainly you can see that Mike, who is wearing leggings and no shirt, is a big tough man, unshaven, eyes inflamed with whiskey...
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HOLD HER, DAMMIT, DAVEY! If you don't hold her I'll cut her tits off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
LITTLE SUE, a fifteen year old whore, is in the doorway, eyes wide with terror and Alice screams at her.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get Skinny, for God's sake! SKINNY!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Davey is reluctant about the whole thing but he is afraid of Mike and he gets behind Delilah and grabs her.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wh-what you gonna do, Mike?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mike is doing it now and Delilah is screaming while he carves her face with the barlow knife and blood is all over, splashing on Davey and Davey, who is just a kid, after all, nineteen with a big shock of unruly red hair and innocent blue eyes, is horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thieving cunt, I'll...

	Mike, don't, Jesus, don't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVEY>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SKINNY! Bring your gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Alice can't wait for Skinny and she jumps on Mike's back and brings the big man down and she fights him though she's not a big woman. Alice is twenty-five but she's been around some, whored some tough cow-towns, and she has too much bone and character in her face to be outright pretty but she attracts men like flies. Sure she has some smallpox scars on her face, but they're common and there are only a few of them, not like on Skinny whose mean little face is eaten right up with them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIEW ON SKINNY DUBOIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STANDING THERE IN THE DOORWAY, his nasty face eaten with smallpox scars and he is looking at Delilah who is a fountain of blood, looking at her coldly, and looking down at the melee on the floor and, pointing the big Navy Colt in his hand, he says,
</DIRECTION>
<SKINNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get offa her, asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKINNY>
<DIRECTION>
And he says it so cold and with such authority that everything goes quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SNOW/MOONLIGHT/THE SHADOWY BUILDINGS and the silence of the Nebraska winter except for the sound of the snowshoes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The snow has obliterated the Main Street of Big Whiskey giving the impression that the dark, low buildings are scattered at random. The only structure with any sign of life is Greely's Beer Garden and Billiards which shows a glowing window and two horses out front and that is a hundred yards away from the struggling silhouettes of the two men on snowshoes. The big one is LITTLE BILL DAGGETT and he is very big, wrapped in a huge bearskin robe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The smaller one is CLYDE LEDBETTER who isn't small though he has only one arm.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...wouldn't let you settle it, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BILL>
<CLYDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell, you know how Skinny is. Says he's gonna shoot 'em... ...an I says, "Skinny, you can't do that," an' he says, "Well, then get Little Bill down here an' let's settle this" an' I says, "Bill's sleepin', Skinny," an'...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLYDE>
<DIRECTION>
They make their way in silence through the snow, getting close now, close to Greely's and the lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DELILAH'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DELILAH ON HER BED, her face covered with blood-soaked rags except for her eyes. Alice has hot water and is ministering to her and Little Bill is looking down at her from his enormous height, still in his bearskin. He looks disgusted.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She ain't gonna die, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
You can now see fear in Delilah's eyes, and the other whores ...CROW CREEK KATE with crazy pop-eyes and frizzy hair, and LITTLE SUE who is fifteen and meek even when she isn't terrified, and FAITH who is the oldest of them and not very attractive and SILKY who is blonde and the prettiest... are watching from vantage points in the doorway or in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
(determined)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's gonna live.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Little Bill turns to go)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She didn't steal nothin', She didn't touch his poke.

(stopping and turning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BILL>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All she done was... when she seen he had a teensy little pecker... she gave a giggle. That's all. She didn't know no better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
Little Bill turns away, disgusted, and starts out of the room and Alice gets up and follows him.
</DIRECTION>
<ALICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gonna hang 'em, Little Bill?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALICE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BAR ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Davey sitting naked on the floor of the bar room and Mike is sitting near him, still in his leggings and both men are shivering because they are fifteen feet from the potbellied stove where Clyde is standing watching them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a big room, with a crude bar and four tables and some moose and elk heads on the wall. The door near the rear where it says "Billiard Room" leads not to a Billiard Room but to the six little "rooms" that are the whorehouse and and now you can hear Delilah groaning from there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Little Bill enters from the back of the bar room, stooping to pass through the doorway under the sign that says "Billiard Room."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Little Bill is huge and ominous. Some say he acquired the bearskin by staring the bear to death and others say he drowned the animal in spit. Anyhow, he's big with a drooping moustache and he is sucking on his church warden's clay pipe and you know he isn't scared of anything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the two cowboys are scared to death, not just shivering from the cold, and Bill just looks down at them and sucks on his pipe and Alice comes in from the back way too and then Skinny and a couple of the whores gather in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clyde, step across to the German's an' fetch up one of his bullwhips.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
Stark terror on the faces of Davey and Mike as Clyde exits.

	This here's a lawful contract... betwixt me an' Delilah Fitzgerald, the cut-whore. Now I brung her clear from Boston, paid her expenses an' all, an' I got a contract which represents an investment of capital.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKINNY>
<LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
(sympathetic to the argument)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Property.

</LITTLE_BILL>
<SKINNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damaged property. Like if I was to hamstring one of their cow ponies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKINNY>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You figure nobody'll want to fuck her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BILL>
<SKINNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell no. Leastways, they won't pay to do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKINNY>

Alice is listening to this and her eyes are like coals and you can hear Delilah moaning in the other room.
</DIRECTION>
<SKINNY>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	She could maybe clean up around the place or somethin', but nobody's gonna pay good money for a cut-up whore.

	Guess you boys just as soon not have no trial an' fuss, huh?

Davey and Mike nod, willing to say anything Little Bill wants.

INT. DELILAH'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAYLIGHT AND A BASIN OF BLOODY WATER and Little Sue is just dipping another towel in the hot water next to Delilah's bed, changing the bandages. All the whores are there in various states of dress, lounging on the floor, leaning against the wall.

EXT. HOG PEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hog in the mud, snorting and squealing, ugly as hell and BILL MUNNY in the mud with him, pushing and shoving, trying to move the stubborn animal and Munny goes down face first and comes up more covered with mud than he already was and the words on the screen say,
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some months later, Hodgeman County, Kansas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WRITTEN_WORDS>
<DIRECTION>
Munny is thirty-five or forty years old, his hair is thinning and his moustache droops glumly over his stubbled jaw. If it were not for his eyes he would look like any pig farmer with his canvas overalls tucked in his boots pushing on a hog. He is pushing on the hog again, grunting with the effort, when he hears the voice.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?

</MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
THE KID is only six feet away, the sun behind him, sitting on a very big and very ancient Morgan horse. He's wearing a wide-brimmed Texas hat, a vest, a holstered pistol, and he is a wiry kid, maybe twenty years old, with scraggly blonde hair, four of his upper front teeth missing, and a funny, squinty way of looking out of his watery blue eyes. Most of all, he doesn't look very prosperous.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I seen how you got only three fingers on your left hand, though, so I guess you're calling yourself Mister Bill Munny.

The voice belongs to WILL, a skinny ten-year-old who dashes up with his seven-year-old sister, PENNY, right on his heels. The kids are ragged and dirty, they don't look well fed or even very healthy. Even as Will speaks to his father, Munny, his eyes, and Penny's too, go to The Kid. They don't see many strangers.

<MUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ain't like that no more, Kid. Whiskey done it as much as anythin' I guess.

Will and Penny in front of the house, looking up at The Kid who is mounted again and Munny is standing there taking leave of The Kid.

	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_KID>
<DIRECTION>
Munny waves at The Kid and for a long moment watches him trot across the flat, grassy fields. Then he turns back to his shabby farm and the squealing pigs and the two children who are looking up at him.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's he?

Munny in the mud and the pig squealing and Will is there pushing too and Munny goes in face first again and when he comes up he slowly wipes mud from his face and, turning, he looks across the fields.

EXT. BIG WHISKEY HILL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTREME CLOSE UP ON DELILAH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Delilah's face! The cut-whore. Skeins of criss-crossing raised flesh, a vicious web of scars dominated by her eyes that are deep and beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's hanging clothes on a clothes line on Big Whiskey Hill, the gentle slope above the town. Alice, Little Sue, Silky, Kate, and Faith are close by, hanging clothes or washing them in the gurgling stream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faith is the first to glance down the hill toward the town and to notice. She draws in her breath and turns to Alice and catches her eye and Alice looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MUDDY NORTH ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The muddy North Road and the two riders, and they are Quick Mike and Davey Bunting leading their ponies in, passing a crudely painted sign that says:

<DIRECTION>
EXT. BIG WHISKEY HILL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The whores on the hill. One by one, with no words exchanged, they feel the silence and turn and exchange glances and they glance at Delilah. She winces and turns back to hanging clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIEW ON A HORSE'S OPEN MOUTH AND SKINNY

Inspecting.
</DIRECTION>
<SKINNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You boys took a while. Couple more days I was gonna call on the Sheriff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKINNY>
<DIRECTION>
The horses are gathered in front of Greely's and Skinny moves among them inspecting them while the two cowboys remain mounted.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	River was swole so we couldn't cross her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Davey is holding the halter of a little paint and when SKINNY starts to inspect the pain, Davey pulls the pony away.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got two of mine. This here one ain't yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVEY>
<DIRECTION>
Skinny and Davey lock eyes and Skinny is wondering how far to push it when SPLAT!... Davey gets a face full of mud. The three men turn to see the whores coming around the side of Greely's, all except Delilah, and they are throwing mud, scooping it from the sloppy street and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE gets a hit on the chest and then on the face and he gives an ugly look and wheels his horse and digs in his spurs and heads North at a trot and mud continues to rain on him as the whores jeer.
</DIRECTION>
<SKINNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
(SPLAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quit that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKINNY>
<DIRECTION>
Surprisingly, Davey turns his horse right into the barrage of mud and taking it in the face and on the chest he dismounts. His paint takes a big gob of mud on one eye and Davey wipes the mud off tenderly.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This here pony... I brung it for the lady... the one my partner cut.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVEY>
<DIRECTION>
The whores stop throwing mud abruptly. There is a pause... and they can see that he is just a kid, and that he is sorry as hell and that he is about to cry and they are touched, especially Little Sue.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the best of the lot... better than the ones I give him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVEY>
<DIRECTION>
SLOP. Davey gets it in the face with a big gob of mud as Alice resumes fire and SPLAT, the paint gets it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Faith and Silky and Kate hesitate just a moment... and then they dig in and start jeering and throwing again and Little Sue bends down slowly and picks up some mud and then she just stands there with it, almost crying, and watches the cowboy turn away under a barrage of mud and mount his pony and ride out, mud hitting him all over and the women jeering and running after him in the muddy street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIEW ON DELILAH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hanging clothes up on the hill and she canhear the shouting in the distance and she turns and looks down with the beautiful eyes and sees the cowboy riding out of town slowly, chased by the jeering women.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SOD HUT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on a photograph of CLAUDIA in Munny's hands. He is inside, kneeling on the floor beside an open truck and he is studying reverently the old photo of Claudia, smiling radiantly in her best dress. Finally Munny puts the picture down and digs in the trunk among folded dresses that belonged to her until he feels something metal and he sees the blue steel among the white cloth and then he pulls it out... an old Starr .44 Pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SOD HUT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on a Mojav coffee tin as Munny places it on the fence behind his sod hut. Munny has the Starr in his right hand and he turns and walks back toward the house 15 yards away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will and Penny are watching. They know something is going on, but they don't know how to ask what it is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Munny faces the coffee tin and solemnly extends his pistol arm straight out and carefuly sights along the barrel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAM! A burst of flame and a puff of black smoke from the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mojav tin hasn't moved.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, carefully, Munny raises the gun again and aims with great deliberation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAM! The coffee tin doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Munny shakes his head slowly in disgust and aims again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAM! Missed again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Munny gives a quick sheepish glance in the direction of the children. There is a lot of smoke. He aims again and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAM! He misses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Munny is irritated and he aims and fires hastily and flame bursts from the gun and smoke and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tin is unmoved.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will looks at his feet, embarrassed, not wanting to meet his father's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Munny stuffs the pistol in his waistband and disappears into the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Will and Penny look at one another nervously, wondering what's happening.
</DIRECTION>
<PENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did Paw used to kill folks?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Will doesn't answer and then he looks up because Munny steps out of the house again, a sawed off Remington 10 gauge shotgun in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Munny raises the double barreled weapon to his shoulder and aims carefully and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BARRRROOOOOM! The can flies away in pieces and some of the fence, too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHADE TREES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HEADSTONE. It says:
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"CLAUDIA FEATHERS MUNNY Born, March 11, 1849 Died, August 6, 1878, aged 29 years, in the full enjoyment of that love which constrained her to leave all for Christ and heathen souls
	</DIALOGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lo, we have left all and followed thee: What shall we leave therefore. 19:25"
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The headstone is under a couple of shade trees fifty yards from the sod hut. MUNNY is sitting on a rock under the trees looking at the headstone and he has on a cheap black suit now. He twists the hat, tormented... and he starts to say something out loud but he can't because men don't talk to stones. So finally he gets up, slumped in defeat, and he puts a little bouquet of flowers on the grave and he turns away unhappily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SOD HUT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ALBINO MARE snorting and shying, anxious to lose the saddle. Will has her by the halter, holding her with effort, in front of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She ain't hardly a saddle horse no more, Paw. She ain't used to the feel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILL>
<DIRECTION>
Munny walks up and puts his hand on Penny's head fondly.
</DIRECTION>
<MUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Them flowers, Penny, I could tell your Maw liked them, hear?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to Will)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take care of your sister, son. You can kill three chickens if you need, not no more. Keep the hogs that got fever separate if you can. An' if you need help, go see Sally Two- Trees over to Ned Logan's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Then he turns to the mare and shoves a foot in the stirrup to mount but the horse shies and Munny goes down in the dust looking very undignified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Penny is horrified and humiliated for her father whom she worships and Will's eyes are big because Munny's coat came open and he caught a quick glimpse of the Starr pistol stuck in the waist band.
</DIRECTION>
<MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(brushing himself off, embarrassed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ain't felt a saddle in a while myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Then Munny has one foot in the stirrup and the horse starts to shy and Munny has to hop around with one foot stirruped and the other not... and when he tries to swing aboard he falls back...
</DIRECTION>
<MUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy old gal, easy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
And he still can't make it, so to cover his embarrassment he talks to the kids while he hops around desperately trying to mount.
</DIRECTION>
<MUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now this here horse is gettin' even on me... hold on gal... for the sins of my youth... In my youth... before I met... your dear departed mother... I was weak an' givin' to mistreatin' horses an' such. An' this here horse... an' that ole pig, too, I guess... is my comeuppance for my cruelty...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
At last he is in the saddle and takes a deep breath.
</DIRECTION>
<MUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Used to be I could cuss an' hurt an animal... til your departed mother, God rest her, showed me the error of my ways.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Munny turns the Albino mare and starts out the gate going Weat toward the fields.
</DIRECTION>
<MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(over his shoulder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't be no longer than a couple of weeks. Remember how the spirit of your departed maw watches over you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Will and Penny are watching him go and Will is fighting back the tears but Penny has lost the battle and she is crying and the horse whinnies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIEW ON MUNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Twenty yards away getting up off the ground and trying to catch the shying, prancing horse on foot, his dignity a shambles.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Little Bill is hopping around in his hat and boots and nothing else in front of his brand new one story, four room, frame house that hasn't been painted it's so new and doesn't have a porch yet, though that is being begun... sort of. In fact... the house doesn't look quite right... looks a little lopsided.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Skinny Dubois is standing there, in the clearing wiping his brow and catching his breath and watching Little Bill.

Little Bill drops the board he's holding up and turns sharply to Skinny. Down in the valley the train whistle screams and after a long, tense moment, Little Bill turns and looks out over the valley, frowning.

EXT. LOGAN HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SALLY TWO TREES, weeding under a hot sun. She is an Indian woman about forty years old, heavy, and she is pulling weeds from a neat garden near the Logan House and she looks up and she sees something and frowns and keeps looking and doesn't like what she sees,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER POV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN IN THE DISTANCE RIDING AN ALBINO MARE, making his way slowly through the prosperous fields of young corn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIEW ON SALLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks over at her husband, NED LOGAN, who is working not far away and he seems to "hear" her look because he turns to her and, seeing her troubled expression, he follows her look and he too sees the rider on the Albino mare.
</DIRECTION>
<NED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be damned. It's Billy Munny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NED>
<DIRECTION>
Ned is about forty, balding, a farmer, but not as seedy looking as his old friend, Bill Munny.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIEW ON MUNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trying to dismount and the Albino prancing and Munny staggering and Sally looking at the scene grimly.
</DIRECTION>
<MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hullo Sally... I... uh, I ain't seen you in near as long as this, uh... as this horse ain't felt the saddle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Munny gets up out of the dust looking uncomfortable and Sally just stares at him coldly.
</DIRECTION>
<NED>
<DIRECTION>
(warmly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on in outta the sun, Bill. Sally, you see to Bill's horse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NED>
<DIRECTION>
Munny nods an uncomfortable thank-you to Sally as Ned leads him toward a house that is very different from Munny's. It is a two story frame house freshly painted and surrounded by a well-tended garden, a tool shed, a barn and lush fields.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the men disappear into the house Sally leads the Albino toward the barn. Her sharp eyes don't miss the stock of the shotgun where it protrudes slightly from the bedroll. Her eyes seem to see even into the future... and all they see is trouble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

INT. RAILROAD COACH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The headline on the newspaper says "President Garfield Wounded." FUZZY, a cowboy, is sitting in the rocking coach reading the paper with great effort, partly because of the motion of the train and partly because Fuzzy can't read very well... but CROCKER, the rough looking cowboy on the seat next to him can't read at all.
</DIRECTION>
<CROCKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I want to know is what sonof- abitch shot him, that's all. Was it one of them John Bull assholes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROCKER>
<DIRECTION>
Across the aisle two well dressed gentlemen are sitting. The one by the window, the lean one in the frock coat and slouch hat, is WW BEAUCHAMP and the one on the aisle, pudgy, pinkcheeked, with neat muttonchop whiskers, wearing a frock coat and waistcoat and a silk slouch hat in spite of the heat, is ENGLISH BOB. English Bob has beady blue eyes, is about thirty-five and pulls constantly on a good cigar.
</DIRECTION>
<ENGLISH_BOB>
<DIRECTION>
(in a rich English accent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sir, I believe the would-be murderer is a gentleman of French ancestry... or so it would seem. I hope I won't give offense if I observe that the French are known to be a race of assassins, though they can't shoot worth a damn...any Frenchman among the present company excluded of course.

THIRSTY, a cowboy sitting behind Crocker, turns in his seat, sensing the tension in the air and WW feels it too and shifts uneasily... but English Bob is unperturbed and he puffs cheerfully on his cigar.
</DIRECTION>
<ENGLISH_BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sirs... again not wishing to give offense... it might be a good idea if the country were to choose a Queen... or even a King ...rather than a president. One isn't as quick to take a shot at a King or a Queen. The majesty of royalty, you see...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENGLISH_BOB>
<CROCKER>

Deputy ANDY RUSSELL stepping out of the County Office as the mud wagon clatters to a stop in front of the Big Whisky Inn.

<DIRECTION>
Andy is just twenty, a good looking kid with a badge on his vest and a holstered pistol. He watches the passengers climb out of the mud wagon and, as English Bob alights, his frock coat parts and gives ANDY just the quickest glimpse of a holstered pistol under the coat.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon me, gentlemen, but local ordinance obliges you to surrender your sidearms to proper authority for the duration of your visit.

</ENGLISH_BOB>
<DIRECTION>
And English Bob gives a smart bow, turns with a swirl of coat-tails that allows a brief glimpse of not one, but two holstered pistols, and marches off. As WW follows English Bob, he glances nervously back to see what young Andy will do but Andy just stares nonplussed. In that quick glimpse, Andy saw how the weapons were tied down with thongs, meaning the owner wanted a quick pull... and this shit is out of his league.

INT. COUNTY OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON A BOOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lurid cover, "The Duke of Death" by W. W. Beauchamp. Little Bill is looking at the cover, his feet propped on his desk in the county office. It is night and the office is lit with an oil lamp.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
(referring to the book)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Them boys look like real hard cases. Did you kill all seven of 'em dead, Bob... or did you just wing some of 'em?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
English Bob is lying on his back on a cot in the little cell a few feet away. He turns his head toward Little Bill and his swollen face is horrible to behold. Of course, he doesn't answer except with the nasty eye.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is you there, ain't it, Bob? The Duck of Death?

</WW>
<DIRECTION>
WW is in the little cell next to English Bob's.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah... Duke. Well, Bob, you always was hell an' Jesus with a pistol... but seven of 'em, an' you protectin' the lady too... How'd you do it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
English Bob just turns his malignant stare away but WW screws up his courage and asserts himself... sort of.
</DIRECTION>
<WW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh... It's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WW>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Mister Beauchamp... from what I read of this here book, I'd have to say the writin' ain't a whole lot different from the pitcher.

<DIRECTION>
(reading badly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"You have insulted the honor of this beautiful woman, Corcoran," said the duck. "You must apologize." But Two Gun Corcoran would have none of it and, cursing, he reached for his pistols and would have killed them but The Duck was faster and hot lead blazed from his smoking sixguns."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he tosses the book on the desk, disgusted)
</DIRECTION>
<WW>
<DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</WW>
<LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
(standing up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Mister Beauchamp, I was at the Blue Bottle Saloon in Wichita the night English Bob killed Corky Corcoran... an' I didn't see you there... nor no woman, nor no two-gun shooters nor nothin' like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BILL>
<WW>
<DIRECTION>
(amazed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WW>
<DIRECTION>
WW looks to English Bob for confirmation but Bob's stare just gets nastier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Little Bill is warming to the subject though, standing in front of the cell.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First off... Corky didn't carry two pistols, though he should of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BILL>
<WW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he was called...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WW>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some folks did call Old Corky "Two Gun" but not because he was sportin' two pistols but because he had a dick so big it was longer than the barrel on that Walker Colt he carried. An' the only insultin' he done was stickin' that big dick of his in some French Lady that Old Bob was sweet on... Well, one day Corky walked into the Blue Bottle and before he knows what's happening Bob takes a shot at him... and misses on account of he's drunker than hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
WW is fascinated and he looks to Bob and BOB'S eye is blazing and he looks back at Little Bill who is beginning to act out the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that bullet whizzin' by panicked Corky, an' he done the wrong thing! Pulled his gun in such a damn hurry he shot off his own toe. Meantime, Bob aims good and squeezes off another... but he's so drunk he misses again an' hits the thousand dollar mirror behind the bar. Well, now the Duck of Death is good as dead 'cause this time Corky does right an' aims real good, no hurry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BILL>
<WW>
<DIRECTION>
(beside himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WW>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bam! That Walker Colt blew up in his hand... which was a failing common to that model. Now if Corky would have really had two guns instead of just a big dick he could have defended himself to the end.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BILL>
<WW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You... you mean...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at Bob)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	English Bob killed him while...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WW>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well he wasn't gonna wait for Corky to grow no new hand. He walked over real close, bein' drunk, an' shot him through the liver.

WW stares first at English Bob and then at Little Bill, appalled.

EXT. CAMP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Munny and Ned lying near the campfire and The Kid walks up and starts to fix his blankets.

He looks at Munny thoughtfully. Something's bothering him, and finally he blurts it out as he climbs into his own blankets.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say, Bill. That business in Jackson County... did that really happen? I mean how they say it happened?
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What business?

</MUNNY>
<THE_KID>

(a frown, a pause, then...)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't recollect!

The Kid doesn't know whether he's been rebuffed or what, but seeing after a moment that his conversation with Munny is not getting anywhere he decides to have a try at Ned.

WW is sitting at Little Bill's desk writing furiously with a quill pen. It is still night and Little Bill is lounging in a chair and English Bob is moaning and snoring in the cell.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faster? Fast was his mistake. If he hadn't of been in such a goddamn hurry he would not have shot off his toe with his first shot and he would have killed old Bob.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, son, bein' a good shot an' bein' quick with a pistol... that don't do no harm... but it ain't much next to bein' cool.

Little Bill pulls out his pistol very deliberately... not slowly, but not like a Hollywood fast draw.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	A man who will keep his head an' not get rattled under fire... he will kill you like as not.

Little Bill is pointing his pistol, aiming.

</WW>
<LITTLE_BILL>

<WW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But... if he doesn't miss?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WW>
<LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing and holstering his pistol)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then he will kill you. That is why there are so few dangerous men like old Bob there... an' like me. It ain't so easy to shoot a man anyhow... an' if the sonofabitch is shootin' back at you... well, it'll unnerve most fellas.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See this here pistol?

WW looks at the pistol uneasily and over in the cell English Bob's one eye opens and he moves his head slightly because he senses something is happening.

Little Bill holds the pistols out to WW.

<DIRECTION>
Nervously WW accepts the gun as though it were hot. Little Bill pulls some keys out of a drawer and tosses them on the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Them's the keys. All you gotta do is shoot me an' you an' English Bob can ride out free as birds.

	Wouldn't be no good if it wasn't. You got to cock it though.

</LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
WW looks nervously over at English Bob and Bob's eye says "Do it, do it, do it."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WW gulps and he pulls back the hammer and stands up and looks at Bob again and Bob is nodding "Yes, yes, do it."
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An' you got to point it.

<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on, point it.

Slowly, with trembling hand WW raises the gun and points it at Little Bill who looks calmly back at him.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All you gotta do is pull on the trigger, mister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
WW gulps and sweat comes off his forehead and he points the shaking gun and Bob nods "Yes" and WW bites his lip and then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WW lowers the gun slowly. He can't do it. He wipes his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hot, ain't it?

<DIRECTION>
(reaching for the gun)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never even put your finger on the trigger.

<DIRECTION>
Little Bill is reaching for the pistol but WW has a frightening idea and instead of giving up the pistol he steps backward toward the cell.
</DIRECTION>
<WW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if... what if I gave it to... him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(and he indicates Bob)
</DIRECTION>

Little Bill's eyes narrow like slits and tension fills the air.

<DIRECTION>
English Bob is sitting up and reaching for the gun and his eye is on Little Bill and WW reaches out with a shaking hand and ENGLISH BOB'S hand just touches the gun and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Little Bill drops his right hand to his own gun and grips the butt and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ENGLISH BOB hesitates, his gaze locked with LITTLE BILL'S and the two men eye each other. Then, furious, ENGLISH BOB withdraws his hand... empty.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
(grinning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess he don't want it, Mister Beauchamp.

Little Bill accepts the pistol from the trembling WW and, looking straight into ENGLISH BOB'S angry eye, LITTLE BILL ejects five cartridges from the chambers of the pistol.

<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You was right not to take it, Bob. I would of killed you.

</DIRECTION>
<NED>

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A blazing hot day and English Bob's battered face staring out of the mud wagon which is being loaded up by Chandler. In the distance the train whistle toots eagerly.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
(to Chandler)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give them keys to the conductor and tell him he can loose the cuffs off of Bob soon as he's out of the county.

</ENGLISH_BOB>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
Little Bill unwraps a cloth and produces the ivory-handled peacemakers... smashed and hopelessly bent. And he gives them to Bob and looks him in his one furious eye.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess you know, Bob, how if I see you again I'll just start shootin' right off an' figure it's self-defense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
That's fine with English Bob. He glares back and the two men understand each other perfectly and then Chandler whips the horses and the wagon starts to roll.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ain't stealin' your biographer, Bob. Stayin' on was his idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
And WW stands there beside Little Bill and gives Bob a shit- eating look and English Bob just glares and rolls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAIN STREET - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the mud wagon rattles down the dusty street English Bob sticks his horrid swollen face out the window and screams insanely:

	</DIALOGUE>
</ENGLISH_BOB>
<DIRECTION>
The whores, fanning themselves on Greeley's porch, stare dumbfounded as the madman rolls by raving. Then he's gone. All that remains is the sound of his ranting, diminishing in the distance and a cloud of dust settling on the hot street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting next to Faith on the porch, Alice fans herself grimly.

EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUNDER AND LIGHTNING and the train chugging through the storm. A second flash of lightning reveals three drenched riders near the tracks and one of them is having trouble controlling his white horse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Of course it is Munny and as he tries to hold the shying mare a flash of lightning lights up a passing railroad coach and Munny gets just a glimpse of a strange battered face in the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Kid is handing the whiskey bottle back to Ned and Ned offers it to Munny again.
</DIRECTION>
<NED>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SOUTH ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NIGHT AND RAIN and The Kid is chuckling drunkenly and handing the bottle back to Ned who looks at it and tilts it way back. They are riding along the South road in the dark.

<THE_KID>
<DIRECTION>
(cheerfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I left you some... about a drop.
	</DIALOGUE>

Munny is hunched in his saddle, shivering, his teeth chattering.
</DIRECTION>
<NED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You alright, Bill?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NED>
<DIRECTION>
Munny doesn't look alright. He looks like shit... looks sick. He doesn't answer and Ned looks worried and takes the last drops from the bottle and tosses it in the road near the ordinance sign which is too dark to read.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALICE'S ROOM - NIGHT

WW is trying to write and trying to slide away from the leak without interrupting Little Bill who is delighting in his own narration, oblivious to the new leak.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
(in his own voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Well, Jim," I says, "it makes me sick to see a man struttin' around and packin' two pistols an' a Henry rifle and cryin' like a baby."

</LITTLE_BILL>
<WW>
	<DIALOGUE>

CLOSE on the whiskey bottle and Ned is pouring the bright liquid into his glass and Munny is mesmerized by the dazzling highlights. The two of them are sitting at a table in Greely's smokey, dimly lit bar room and the rain is beating on the roof and there is a checker game at a table fifteen feet away attended by Germany Joe Schultz, Tom Luckinbill, a farmer, Eggs Anderson, the local restauranteur and Paddy McGee the cooper. All of them are sneaking occasional, furtive glances at the strangers, as is Fatty who is talking to Skinny at the bar.

Little Sue looks timidly in from the Billiard Room, bites her lip, and retreats quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Mister Hendershot, if I was to call you a no good sonofabitch an' a liar, an' if I was to say you shit in your pants on account of a cowardly soul... well, I guess then, you would show me your pistol right quick an' shoot me dead, ain't that so?

<DIRECTION>
Little Bill steps close to him and reaches out with his left hand and opens Munny's coat revealing the Starr tucked in his belt.

Munny is struggling to his feet and staggering weak-kneed to the table where he grabs the whiskey bottle and breaks it off and turns groggily to face Little Bill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Little Bill, unperturbed, advances on him and when Munny strikes desperately with the bottle, Little Bill blocks his blow easily and slams him hard with the muzzle of the pistol and Munny goes down again.

INT. SHED - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAYLIGHT in the shed and Munny's face, waxy yellow, crude stitching, hideous swelling eyes vacant, breathing heavy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is lying in the straw and The Kid is looking down at him with distaste. The Kid is only partly dressed.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He don't look so good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_KID>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of the rain is different: it's still coming but it isn't a storm any more. The shed is an irregular shelter because one wall and various parts of the roof have collapsed and the woods outside are clearly visible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silky is sitting on some straw straightening her clothes and Ned and Alice are climbing out of a corner where they have obviously been at it and are in various states of dress.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_KID>

	He didn't even pull his pistol, huh?

	He ain't as tough as you, Kid.

	Well, I guess I woulda at least pulled my pistol an...

	Shit, Kid, you pulled your pistol... right outta the lady an' out the back window.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't need him. The two of us could do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_KID>
<DIRECTION>
The horses are partly under the roof and Alice and Silky are leading theirs out and nobody is paying attention to The Kid.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_KID>
<DIRECTION>
(petulantly)

	<DIALOGUE>
	He ain't nothin' but a broken down pig farmer.

</ALICE>
<NED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An' medicine if you got it...

The Kid walks over to the edge of the broken wall and from the other corner Munny moans loudly and then screams.
</DIRECTION>
<MUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ohhhhh, ooohhhh no. No, I didn't do nothin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Ned hurries over to Munny and The Kid is left there with the two Whores who are both mounted now and The Kid is embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_KID>

	Don't it make you sick, hearin' him like that?
	</DIALOGUE>

(The Whores turn their horses)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you ladies worry none... Me an' Ned, we'll kill those two fuckers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_KID>
<DIRECTION>
And The Kid has picked up two pieces of paper that the whores gave them earlier and they are charcoal sketches, one of Davey Bunting and the other of Quick Mike and they are pretty fair likenesses.

INT. SHED - NIGHT

CLOSE on a lantern hanging from a beam in the shed and it is night again and the rain has stopped though you can still hear water dripping from the eaves.

<THE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a lot of shit what my uncle told me, huh?

They are playing cards on the straw floor, Ned and The Kid and Ned doesn't look up from his cards.

	Well I guess Bill Munny wasn't no fearless killer an' bank robber like he said.

<DIRECTION>
In the other corner of the room Munny gives a loud moan and both men look at him and then back to their cards.
</DIRECTION>
<NED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kid, it ain't gonna mean nothin' to you, but the roof I built on my house, it don't have a leak in it... not one.

Well, that amazes The Kid, being stuck here with these train robber-bad men and now this shit about roofs and he just stares.

Ned gets up and takes the lantern over to where Munny is lying and kneels beside him. Munny looks ghastly, at death's door.

The Kid has walked over and is watching and it fascinates and scares him and he watches and swallows hard.

The Kid can't takes any more and he turns and walks away and Ned tries to comfort Munny and Munny grabs him and pulls him close.
</DIRECTION>
<MUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ned... don't tell nobody... don't tell the kids... don't tell 'em none of... none of the things I done.

And Ned has tears in his eyes and Munny's eyes are staring and he is seeing something horrible and we

<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHED - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A VISION, DAYLIGHT and the horse horribly bloody, screaming silently in agony while the sound is the sound of night and the shed and the rain dripping but that doesn't diminish the agony of the bloody animal as the whip falls on the head and the eyes and we see the YOUNG MAN cruelly wielding the whip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is Munny fifteen years earlier and it is a picture of unbelievable cruelty and viciousness... because that is what he was like and what he remembers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHED - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NIGHT in the shed, a little moonlight coming in through the open wall. The lantern is out and the sound is the sound of Munny's labored breathing and Ned and The Kid are in their blankets.

INT. SHED - DAY

DAYLIGHT and the cut-whore's face. Delilah is leaning over Munny wiping his brow. He is lying in the straw looking up at her and he looks like shit... his face ghastly pale and stubbled and covered with horrible cuts and bad stitching... but his eyes are clear.

EXT. WOODS NEAR SHED - DAY

CLOSE on robins, four of them in the woods near the shed and Munny is watching them where he sits wolfing chicken hungrily, his back against the shed. Delilah is watching him eat.

	I thought I was gone. See them birds? Most times I wouldn't even notice them birds much. But I'm noticin' 'em real good 'cause I thought I was dead.

Munny can't help it and his eye flicks back to the ankle.

	Are you really going to kill them?

	There's still a payment, ain't there?

She nods and she moves so that more ankle is showing, but Munny's eye is drawn to her breasts as she moves, then he looks away quickly, guiltily and they sit there silently until...

VIEW on the BAWLING CALF and the red hot iron coming out of the fire. It is midday in the box canyon and the four cowboys, Texas Slim, Johnny Foley, Lippy Macgregor and Davey Bunting are branding strays and Johnny has the calf down ready for the pigging string but the calf kicks loose and knocks Johnny into the fire and the other three cowboys are guffawing, their sweaty faces full of the camaraderie of hardworking men who might get irritable by the end of the day but not yet. And then like a flash, still laughing, young Davey is on his paint and riding like hell after the stray and it is beautiful to watch because he and the paint are like one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRACK! A rifle shot and the pony does a violent somersault and Davey goes over in a spray of dirt and fifty yards away Texas Slim, Lippy and Johnny stare in frozen horror.

The downed pony spurts blood from his nostrils, and Davey's right leg is pinned under the dying paint's flank and they are maybe fifteen yards from the edge of the canyon and Davey's first thought is the pony.

	Stay clear of folks you might see. There's plenty out lookin' to hang you. Go on now, skedaddle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Munny slaps The Kid's horse and The Kid sets out at a trot and Munny watches him disappear into the night. When he is alone and he can't hear The Kid's horse any more, Munny uncorks the bottle and takes a long deep drink.

EXT. GREELY'S PORCH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIEW on Ned's body in the upright coffin in the flickering light of a torch standing next to it and, of course, Ned looks bad and the crudely scrawled sign over the coffin says, "This is what happens to assassins around here."

<DIRECTION>
INT. BAR ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIEW on Little Bill in the crowded bar and he is shouting to make himself heard over the din.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, I'm gonna say just one more time so it's all clear an' then don't ask me no more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
The place is packed with tired, dusty men and they are not really jubilant so much as they are excited by the hysteria of events.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
There is a general whoop and hubbub as Little Bill turns back to his conversation at the bar with Charley, Fatty, Clyde, Andy and WW Beauchamp.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now if we divide up into four parties an' hit all the farms an' trails in a circle, we're bound to find some one who seen them skunks an'...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
Little Bill is suddenly conscious of his own loud voice in a sudden silence that has swept the bar like a brushfire and turning he sees what everybody is staring at.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Munny, with his ten-gauge shotgun leveled from the shoulder, is standing thirty feet away in the doorway. Taking a couple of sideways steps to get the door from behind his back and sweeping the twin barrels in an ominous arc, he surveys the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(a little drunk)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which fucker owns this shithole?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Nobosy says a thing. Skinny stares pop-eyed from behind the bar and the sweat starts on his forehead and Little Bill is thinking coolly and everybody else is swallowing hard and looking at the shotgun.
</DIRECTION>
<MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Fatty)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You there, fat man, speak up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Fatty gulps and then Skinny screws up his courage and steps from behind the bar and gives it every bit of dignity his fear will permit.
</DIRECTION>
<SKINNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... I own this establishment. I bought it from Greely for a thous...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKINNY>
<MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(to the men round Skinny)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better step clear, boys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
And Skinny looks from side to side as people step away from him and he wants to say something desperately, he wants to live, he wants...
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on, mist...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
BAH-WHOOM! Munny fires and smoke belches and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Skinny is blown back against the wall and falls to the floor a bloody mess and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Little Bill is reaching for the Spencer which is leaning against the bar near his leg but he freezes because...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Munny has turned the shotgun on him and Munny sees Ned's Spencer there and his eyes show how he feels about it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment while the smoke clears the bar is silent and there are nervous glances cast at the bloody body of Skinny but Little Bill keeps his eyes on Munny.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well sir... You are a cowardly sonofabitch because you have just shot down an unarmed man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
It has become a very formal moment and there are, figuratively speaking, only two people in the room, Munny and Little Bill... and WW Beauchamp is watching them, scared to death, but this is it, what all those Easterners dreamed about, the showdown in the saloon.
</DIRECTION>
<MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(the shotgun pointed right at Little Bill)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He should have armed himself if he was gonna decorate his saloon with the body of my friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess you are Three-Fingered Jack out of Missouri, killer of women and children.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BILL>
<MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(a little drunkenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have done that... killed women and children... I have killed most everything that walks or crawls an' now I have come to kill you, Little Bill, for what you done to Ned.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the others)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now step aside. boys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
And as the deputies nervously move aside Little Bill helps to isolate himself by stepping forward boldly.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's got one barrel left, gentlemen. After he has used it, pull your pistols and shoot him down like the cowardly, drunken scoundrel he is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
Little Bill looks back at Munny bravely and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Munny looks down the barrel at Little Bill and after a tense moment he pulls the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK. The hammer falls but it is a misfire and what happens next happens in maybe five seconds as all hell breaks loose.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
(drawing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Misfire! Kill the sonofabitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
And Little Bill aims carefully and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Munny hurls the shotgun at him and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM!... Little Bill fires wildly as the shotgun hits him and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde has his pistol out and is pointing it at Munny and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Munny is pulling the pistol from his own belt and he drops to one knee and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM!... Clyde fires and misses and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Little Bill is about to squeeze the trigger when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM!... Munny shoots him and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM!... Little Bill shoots just as he is hit in the chest and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM! BLAM!... Fatty fires wildly and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Munny is aiming too and BLAM!...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clyde gets it in the face and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM!... BLAM!... Fatty isn't even aiming while...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy aims carefully, he can kill Munny but...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Munny turns and points his weapon at Andy and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instead of firing Andy panics and tries to turn his body sideways to ward off the blow and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM!... Munny fires and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy gets it high in the rib cage and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charley turns and runs for the back and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM! BLAM!... Fatty is backing up and firing from the hip and then he turns to run and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Munny aims deliberately from one knee and BLAM!...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fatty goes down, shot in the back...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And suddenly... there is a terrible silence that is broken only by the awful, dying groans of Clyde and the coughing of the bystanders hiding behind tables and chairs in the thick black smoke and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Munny is still down on one knee pointing his pistol and looking through the thick smoke for someone to shoot but it seems there are no threats left.
</DIRECTION>
<MUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Every asshole that doesn't want to get shot best clear out the back quick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
And they scramble over each other dashing toward the Billiard Room and Munny stands up and looks around and he looks at Clyde who is groaning, his face covered with blood and everyone else, Little Bill, Andy and Fatty are still, and then Fatty seems to move and Munny levels his pistol and what happens is WW crawls out from half-under Fatty and WW is covered with blood and he is shaking like a leaf.
</DIRECTION>
<WW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... I... think I'm... shot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WW>
<MUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ain't shot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<WW>
<DIRECTION>
(seeing the pistol)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	P-p-p-please, I'm not armed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Munny lowers the pistol, WW looks around)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WW>
<MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(suspicious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure you ain't armed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<WW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WW>
<MUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A writer? What do you write... letters an' such?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<WW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	B-b-books.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(amazed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WW>
<MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(wearily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Munny walks over to the bar, keeping his eye suspiciously on WW, and reaches for a bottle with his left hand. The hand is shaking like palsy and he tilts the bottle and drinks sloppily with effort, the pistol still in his right hand.
</DIRECTION>
<WW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WW>
<MUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<WW>
<DIRECTION>
(reciting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WW>
<MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(drinking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Unnoticed on the floor, Little Bill is conscious though blood is coming out of his mouth and he has been written off. One hand is shifting on his pistol and he can hear Clyde moaning sporadically.
</DIRECTION>
<WW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Little Bill told me that. You killed him first, didn't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WW>
<DIRECTION>
On the floor, Little Bill is fighting for consciousness, fingering his pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<MUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was lucky in the order.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(bitterly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I always been lucky killin' folks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<WW>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WW>
<MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(suddely ominous, pistol pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could tell you who was last, mister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
WW's eyes pop as he gets the idea and he backs up fast, and then he turns and bolts out the back, and watching him go, Munny turns his back on the fallen body of Little Bill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Little Bill, on the floor, raises up his pistol in his shaking hand and aims at Munny's back maybe six feet away and he is shaking bad as he draws the hammer back and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Munny hears the click and he turns and sees Little Bill aiming but it is too late and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM! Smoke and fire from Little Bill's pistol and Little Bill's arm collapses from the effort and the pistol falls with a bang.
</DIRECTION>
<MUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Missed again, asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
And Munny steps over to him and kicks the pistol away from Little Bill's outstretched hand. Little Bill is bleeding from the mouth having taken a shot in the lung and he is very weak and all he can do is look up at Munny and speak weakly.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't... deserve this... to die this way. I was... building a house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BILL>
<MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(aiming his pistol point blank)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Deserve" don't mean shit, Little Bill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
(the pistol in his face)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see you... in hell, you three-fingered asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BILL>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM! Munny shoots Little Bill and then he looks around and Clyde is still groaning and that is the only sound. Then, suddenly, he is all business. He walks quickly over to Clyde and shoots him once with the Spencer and the groaning stops. Then he goes to Little Bill's body and pokes around in the pockets and pulls out some shells for the Spencer. He shoves those in his pocket and he goes to the bar and picks up the bottle of whiskey and walks over to the door. Standing to one side, he kicks it open. Then he sets down the rifle and the bottle and starts to reload the Schofield and while he loads it he shouts out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<MUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm comin' outta here... an' any fucker I see out there, I'm gonna kill him... an' any fucker takes a shot at me, I ain't just gonna kill him, but I'm gonna kill his wife an' all his friends an' burn his fucking house, hear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
The pistol is loaded and Munny sticks it in his belt and he takes a long pull on the whiskey bottle and wipes the dribble from his chin. Then he picks up the rifle in the other hand and looks out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAIN STREET/GREELY'S - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The street and it is dark and quiet, shadowy buildings, the knot of tethered horses, a couple of torches stuck in the ground sputtering.
</DIRECTION>
<MUNNY_S_VOICE_o_s>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody better shoot on account of I'm as mean as I say... maybe meaner. I am a damn badman an' you will not find a worse one in hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY_S_VOICE_o_s>
<DIRECTION>
And Munny steps out the door warily, and looks around and all he sees are the shadowy buildings and all he hears are his own boots on the wooden porch. Glancing nervously at the dark buildings' blank stares he walks past the upright coffin where the waxy face of Ned stares gruesomely in the light of the flickering torch and he gives it a glance, wanting to say he's sorry, but the idea is ludicrous and he steps off the porch and walks toward the white mare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WW Beauchamp and Charley Hecker and Germany Joe crouched in the alleyway between two buildings across the street and Charley has a rifle and they can see Munny mounting his horse.
</DIRECTION>
<GERMANY_JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead, shoot him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERMANY_JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Charley just shakes his head and offers the rifle to Germany Joe. And Germany Joe doesn't want it.
</DIRECTION>
<GERMANY_JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I endt no dehpoody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERMANY_JOE>
<DIRECTION>
WW is watching Munny's unbelievably awkward and prolonged mounting procedure and he can't believe it, he can't believe what the Old West is like and it shows on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Munny riding down the dark, lonely street at a trot and he starts to shout at the top of his lungs.
</DIRECTION>
<MUNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You boys better bury old Ned right... and you better not carve up nor otherwise harm no whores... or I will come back an' kill more sonsabitches, hear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
And there are tears running down Munny's cheeks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SOD HUT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAYLIGHT and Penny sweeping in the doorway of Munny's sod hut in Kansas. She is intent on her work until she hears the snort of a horse and looks up and her jaw drops, and her face lights up like the sun itself and, dropping the broom, she dashes toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIEW ON MUNNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Munny walking across the field, leading the mare. He is covered with dust and heavily stubbled from the trip. Penny dashes up to him and throws her arms around him and he is overjoyed but he doesn't have any way to express it except through awkwardness and embarrassment.
</DIRECTION>
<MUNNY>
<DIRECTION>
(fondly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ain't you a lady!

And Will whirls around and sees Munny standing there beside the house and his first instinct is to run to him and then he remembers his dignity and stands there like a man, but the grin is liable to break his face.
</DIRECTION>
<WILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hullo, paw.

EXT. GRAVE - DAY

The grave of Claudia under the trees and Munny walks up to it and maybe we hear music or maybe just the wind, but the words begin to crawl across the screen, supered.
