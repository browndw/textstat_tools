EXT. MANILA AIRPORT - FULL SHOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Philippine Airlines passenger plane is arriving and touching down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - THE PLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A 13-year old boy starts down the ramp, a suitcase in one hand, an old photo-strip in the other. He studies the strip closely as he searches the faces of the people greeting the passengers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - THE PHOTO STRIP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A handsome sailor is necking with his girl in each of the three shots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE - THE BOY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looking around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS EYES FALL ON A SAILOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's the same sailor from the photo strip, only about fifteen years older. If he was in his early twenties then, now he's in his mid-thirties. He's in the uniform of a 1st class Petty Officer. He searches the faces of the descending passengers, very uncertain and uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BOY AND THE SAILOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
come together very, very tentatively. The sailor, BYRON MAYO, extends a hand to young ZACK.
</DIRECTION>
<BYRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You, Zack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYRON>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BYRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Byron. Nice to meet you.

<DIRECTION>
(awkwardly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon. Let's go get your luggage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYRON>
<DIRECTION>
They head off together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE AIRPORT PARKING LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Byron and Zack step aboard one of the colorful jeepneys that Manila is famous for. We MOVE WITH the jeepney as it leaves the airport and starts down the highway toward Olongapo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy is frightened but he's also excited by the strange, super-chrome and ornately-decorated vehicle he's riding in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're not alone in the small bus. Ten or more Filipinos ride with them, some in suits and ties, others in the rougher attire of farmers. One old woman carries a big cage on her lap with a squawking fluttering chicken in it.
</DIRECTION>
<BYRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take that coat off. This is the Philippines.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYRON>
<DIRECTION>
He helps Zack out of his coat.
</DIRECTION>
<BYRON>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYRON>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BYRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYRON>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I been calling for four months.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Well, that's how long I've been out at sea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYRON>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ROAD TO OLONGAPO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The jeepney has only two passengers now, Byron and Zack. A roadside sign reads: "U.S. NAVAL FACILITY, SUBIC BAY ... 12 miles."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE HONKY-TONK SAILOR TOWN OF OLONGAPO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Known throughout the Seventh Fleet as the armpit of the Orient, Olongapo is one, long rain-rutted street of gaudy bars and rattan-walled whorehouses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Countless jeepneys careen past with their silly fringe awnings and chrome accoutrements, many filled with U.S. sailor boys and officers on liberty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zack and Byron's jeepney ENTERS SHOT and stops in front of the noisiest and raunchiest bar on the strip.
</DIRECTION>
<BYRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is it. This is where I live.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYRON>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING WITH ZACK AND BYRON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA FAVORS the boy as they head for the entrance of the bar, Zack taking in the kinky street activity: "Beenie boys," small boned Filipino boys dressed up as exquisite young girls, hustling tricks on the sidewalk while their sisters lounge in the doorway of places like "California Dreamin'" and "The Manhattan Club," in nipple-showing tank-tops, licking their lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE RAUCOUS BAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA CONTINUES MOVING with Zack and Byron as they cross through the NOISY bar toward a stairwell at the back. Navy enlisted men are making out openly with bar girls and Zack even sees one little girl stick her hand right down the front 40 of a sailor boy's pants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Byron glances at the boy, a little embarrassed by his digs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zack is staring at every girl he passes, nervous but a little excited by it all, too.
</DIRECTION>
<BYRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I were in port more, I'd rent a better place, but this works out okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYRON>
<DIRECTION>
They start up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BYRON'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They walk in and find two semi-naked prostitutes lying on the bed. Zack's eyes are as big as silver dollars.
</DIRECTION>
<BYRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you girls were gonna do some shopping.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(gives them money)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tiki, Maria... I want you to meet my son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYRON>
<DIRECTION>
The girls giggle as they hurry into their clothes and leave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Byron closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<BYRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYRON>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BYRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYRON>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BYRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYRON>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the door and walks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING WITH ZACK DOWN THE STAIRWELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Byron appears on the landing above.
</DIRECTION>
<BYRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, come back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYRON>
<DIRECTION>
Zack keeps moving.
</DIRECTION>
<BYRON>

<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BAR - SEVERAL WEEKS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zack sits on the stairs watching a crazy scene taking place on the long bar. A bunch of jet pilots off one of the carriers are in town and they're playing a game of "chicken". Each pilot must take a turn being pushed down the bar in a chair on rollers. The winner is the guy who flies the farthest without bailing out of his chair. The whores are rooting them on and gambling money is being waved in the air. As Tiki, one of Byron's girls, climbs the stairs, he catches her hand and gestures questioningly in the direction of the hotshot fliers.
</DIRECTION>
<TIKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hot shot jet jockeys. Maybe you grow up like that, fly mach five, no jive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIKI>
<DIRECTION>
The boy laughs. Then Byron comes out of his room, his sea bag over his shoulder. He passes the kids some folding money.
</DIRECTION>
<BYRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, kid. Put this in your shoe in case you need it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYRON>
<DIRECTION>
Zack hides the money.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK SHOT - TWO FILIPINO BOYS ABOUT ZACK'S AGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They see him hide the money in his shoe.

Byron kisses his two mama-sans goodbye, shakes Zack's hand and strides out of the bar.

EXT. THE STREETS OF OLONGAPO - DAY

Zack is walking along the main drag, looking in the curio stores, when the two Filipino boys approach him, smiling innocently.
</DIRECTION>
<1ST_FILIPINO_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, palequero. You new in the P.I.?

	Yeah. I've been here a couple of weeks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<2ND_FILIPINO_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wanna see some nice things, guy? We could show you around. Nobody knows this shithole like us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</2ND_FILIPINO_BOY>
<DIRECTION>
The two boys laugh and Zack laughs, too, trusting them.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. I guess it's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
They start off together but as they reach a narrow alleyway, the two boys shove Zack into it.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<1ST_FILIPINO_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, big spender. Give us some money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</1ST_FILIPINO_BOY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have any money.

<DIRECTION>
(furious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bullshit! Get it out!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</1ST_FILIPINO_BOY>
<DIRECTION>
The first Filipino kicks Zack in the balls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE FIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zack isn't a bad fighter but he's no match for either of the Filipinos, especially the leader, who has a way of fighting that is something to watch. He uses his feet. Waving the other Filipino aside, he destroys the American with spinning roundhouse kicks to his stomach and his face. Zack goes down from a kick to the groin. Another kick to the head and he loses consciousness. His two attackers bend over him to rifle his pockets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finding the five dollar bill he's hidden in his shoe, they run off down a dark alley, one of them nearly tripping over a dead dog.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHTEN ON ZACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stirs. His eyes open. He sits up, wincing from busted ribs. Reality sits heavy on his youthful features.

<DIRECTION>
A rough-looking young man rides his Triumph 750 Bonneville through a Navy honky-tonk area in Seattle, Washington: NOISY bars, a Seven Seas Locker Club, a credit jeweler, a pawn shop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy who took his licks in the Filipino back alley is now a man in his mid-twenties. A long mane of jet-black hair. A scuzzy beard. The same cold blue eyes. He wears jeans and big, muddy boots. There's a tattoo of an eagle half-revealed under the sleeve of his T-shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A FLEA-BAG HOTEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zack Mayo drives up and climbs an outside stairway to a second- story entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE FLEA-BAG HOTEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA MOVES WITH Zack down a dark corridor, past a succession of rooms. A door is open, affording him a quick glimpse of a woman and child, a sailor's uniform hanging on a chair nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sailor appears and closes the door in Zack's face. Zack consults an old postcard he takes from his pocket and pauses in front of a doorway. He knocks authoritatively and shouts:
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shore Patrol! Shore Patrol! Open up!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later the door opens and Byron stands there, fumbling to cover his nudity with a little kimono. A naked prostitute in her late teens watches from a rumpled bed.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Byron.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BYRON>
	<DIALOGUE>

	I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYRON>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.

</ZACK>
<BYRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why the fuck didn't you invite me? I would've come.

Zack's expression sheds some doubt on that subject but Byron chooses to ignore it. He turns to the prostitute.

It's an orgy, all right. Father and son style. Zack and his girl on the left half of the bed, Byron and his girl on the right. Pumping away. Drinking and passing a wine bottle around.

Candles burning in dishes flickering against the seedy walls where the only decorations are monkeywood carvings Byron brought back from the Philippines.

INT. BYRON'S APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zack awakens and finds himself entangled in arms and legs and soiled sheets. He carefully slips free and rises to his feet on unsteady legs, his head pounding, his eyes blood- red.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he's pulling on his shorts, his eyes suddenly take in the apartment and the lifestyle it represents: half-smoked joints and cigarettes cascading out of makeshift ashtrays; empty wine bottles; and three naked people, snoring, their bodies draped over one another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A look of profound disgust comes over Zack's face and he turns away from the scene and heads into the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BYRON'S BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zack finds some aspirins and downs them with a glass of water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Byron comes in, shoves him out of the way, and pukes in the toilet. Zack stares at him in an intense way, seeing more than the moment, seeing all the other times he's played out this scene with this man.
</DIRECTION>
<BYRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you looking at? Hand me that towel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYRON>
<DIRECTION>
Zack hands him the towel. Byron swigs some mouthwash, then turns to his son.
</DIRECTION>
<BYRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, that was pretty great wasn't it? Not as great as that night with the three stewardesses in Manila... but pretty fucking nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYRON>

Zack says nothing but there's something on his mind.

<BYRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what're you doing in Seattle?

Byron's face drops and Zack laughs.

<BYRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You... in the Navy?
	</DIALOGUE>

<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.

</ZACK>
<BYRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

Byron starts to laugh and Zack reddens slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<BYRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe this! You... in the Navy... an officer... that's like me saying I'm running for fucking president. Hey, man, look at you! Hey, officers don't have tattoos!

He laughs until he practically chokes.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I Ill be seeing you, Pard. Take care.

</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
Zack leaves the bathroom and starts putting his clothes on.
</DIRECTION>
<BYRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.

NEW ANGLE - THE ADMIN. BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A girl named CASEY SEEGER steps out of a rented car, kisses her parents goodbye and, carrying a small suitcase, approaches the same officer.

He flirts with Casey as she joins them under the tree, and she flirts back, taking a place near the five other girls.

Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand?

There's a huge, three-story gun emplacement bunker built in 1895, that now serves as a torture chamber for aviation officer candidates.

<DIRECTION>
The other D.I.'s from the program stand at different places on the time-weathered stairs, waiting to assist Foley, their canes propped behind them, truly cruel expressions on their faces.

On cue from Foley, they begin to P.T. Zack's class into the ground, running them up and down the stairs, shouting in their tender ears until some members of the class actually start passing out.

An ambulance is there with two enlisted attendants to carry away the casualties.

Zack, Sid, Casey, Perryman and Topper are starting to show the wear of the arduous "C" course, like the rest of their class.

An advanced class of officer candidates comes running past the exhausted Poopies in smart-looking blue warm-up suits with an insignia and the name "THRAXTON'S COBRAS" on the front and nicknames on the back like: "HOOSIER FACE," "THE BARBER," "ANIMAL HOUSE," "CHOW HOG," "BABY HUEY," AND "THE PROFESSOR."

Zack comes out of the head, Candidates Della-Serra and Marcus on his heels. Zack wears a white T-shirt and the khaki pants of the uniform they've been issued after "Poopie Week". His shoes are spit-shined to perfection, his belt brassoed to a lustrous shine, and his hair is now about an inch long. He pats it back with his hands, primping.

Paula's two sisters, ages 14 and 10, are awake in their bunks and listening to the confrontation in the next room. The empty lower bunk in the over-crammed room belongs to Paula.

Joe Pokrifki parks his big, old Olds Cutlass and the four Pokrifki women follow him toward the church in their prim Sunday dresses.
</DIRECTION>

Lynette and her three brothers climb down from the back of a dented and primered pickup truck. Lynette's pained skeleton of a mother gets out from behind the wheel and ushers her brood toward the church. There's a shocking difference between the debs who go over to the base on weekends and these primly- dressed, almost tomboyishly unmade-up young girls.

Zack and his classmates look around apprehensively as they enter the cavernous old hangar and take seats, along with several other classes from the program, around a raised mat.

Suddenly, shockingly, a bank of lights directly over the mat go on to illuminate Foley, dressed in a worn and faded pair of black silk pajamas, legs akimbo and arms crossed at the chest.

</TOPPER>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me see if I can improve your comprehension.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
He leaps on Topper like a cat, grabbing the boy's throat between his thumb and forefinger, seemingly intent upon killing him but, in reality, scaring him more than actually hurting him that much.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want to survive bad enough to stop me, pussy? Or are you relying on my generosity, my love of humanity, to stop me from killing you?!

jump to their feet to protest, but events are moving too fast for them. Zack just sits there, almost amused.

<DIRECTION>
TOPPER

finally starts fighting back. Convinced this maniac means to kill him to make his point, he finally summons enough survival instinct to wrestle Foley's hand from his throat. He sinks to the floor of the ring and struggles to catch his breath.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You... had... no right! You can't... touch... us! It's the... law!

Topper hurries to comply, while Foley swaggers to the edge of the mat, sits down and starts putting foam safety-kick pads on his feet, really getting off on this.

Zack and Sid sit in their white liberty uniforms at the long bar, nursing beers, Sid anxiously watching the door for Lynette, Zack busy flirting with an attractive WAITRESS.

<TROY>

	Hey, make way for the warmongers.

Zack and Sid spin around, surprised. Troy's a big, kid, a dockworker probably, and he seems to tower over Zack.

He charges after Zack, and knocks his cap off.

VARIOUS SHOTS OF THE FIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
If you can call it a fight. Zack turns around and hits Troy in the face with two very fast punches, a left and a right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before his assailant can recover, Zack delivers a strange, roundhouse kind of kick that seems to come out of him in slow motion, then gathers incredible speed, until it's slamming with the force of a mule-kick into Troy's face. Troy goes down gushing blood from flattened nostrils.
</DIRECTION>

ZACK

He jumps out of bed, pulls on some boxer shorts and sits down at a small rickety table she has beautified with wildflowers stuffed in a glass. Paula puts his steaming breakfast before him and stands back to watch him attack it. He looks up at her and finds her staring at him almost wistfully.

INT. THE LARGE INDOOR POOL ON THE BASE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our CAMERA is the first to ride the Dilbert Dunker, and we are suddenly shooting at high speed down a steep incline inside a cage-like contraption, painted red. Wham! We hit water at neck-wrenching speed and go under in a swirl of bubbles!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wait! What's happening? The goddamn cage is turning somersaults! Which way is up? Which is way up?? A strange looking alien in a wet suit and mask knifes TOWARD US. His hands work to extricate us. We rush toward the promise of light and air at the surface. We can hear our own tortured breathing. Will we make it?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CANDIDATE DELLA-SERRA REACHES THE SURFACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
gasping for air. The DILBERT DUNKER INSTRUCTOR stands off to the side, giving him a thumb's down.
</DIRECTION>
<INSTRUCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back in line. That was totally unsat, Della-Serra!

<DIRECTION>
Della-Serra clings to the side of the pool and vomits. He's grateful to be alive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZACK WATCHES THEM RAISE THE DILBERT DUNKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It finally comes to a rest high in the rafters of the building, where he is to be the next to take the ride. Sid and Seeger are right behind him, followed by Topper. He steps into the cage and the Instructor makes sure he's buckled snugly into the harness. Then Zack's eyes fall on:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOLEY, STANDING POOL SIDE ZACK LOOKS AWAY FROM HIM AND GIVES HIS THUMBS UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and the Dunker takes him on its crazy ride, plummeting down the tracks, blasting into the water, somersaulting...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER - ZACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
waits until the turning has stopped, studies the direction his air bubbles are taking as he unfastens his harness, and pulls himself down and out of the Dunker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK ON THE SURFACE - ZACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
gets a thumbs up from the Instructor and grins. As he's climbing out, he watches Sid take the big ride.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER - SID

<DIRECTION>
almost loses his composure when the harness at first defies his efforts to get it open. Then, he's free and surface-bound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AS ZACK HELPS HIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
out of the pool, Sid's efforts at a cocky grin fails to hide from his friend the fear he felt under there.

TOPPER CLIMBS INTO THE DILBERT DUNKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down at the pool far below. His three friends, standing pool side, give him a thumbs up for encouragement, but Topper is too frightened to acknowledge them. He turns to the Instructor helping to fasten him inside the contraption.
</DIRECTION>
<TOPPER>
<DIRECTION>
(scared shitless)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does this thing hit with the same impact as an actual plane?

Topper nods and gives a thumbs up.

<DIRECTION>
IN A PERCH ABOVE THE RAISED DUNKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a young seaman apprentice flicks a switch and the Dunker lurches down the tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOPPER SUCKS IN HIS BREATH, TERRIFIED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The impact of hitting the water is so jolting, it knocks his wind out in a rush and he goes under already screaming that silent little scream of the mind that drowning people hear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Underwater, the Dunker turns him over and over, leaving him upside-down. The silent scream is louder. Panic rides its frequency as Topper tears at the lever that would release him from the harness. He gets it open and pushes out of the opening in the Dunker with all his might. He has forgotten to watch for his air bubbles. Top is bottom and bottom is top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He smashes violently into the tiled floor of the pool, freaks out, and swims straight up and into the jaws of the Dunker again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZACK, SID, CASEY AND FOLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watch from pool side, concerned, as the diver goes down for Topper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The instant the diver is within grasp of the totally unstrung boy, Topper grabs him in a dying man's grip that even the brawny frogman is unable to break.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The diver hits him once, twice, but Topper clings to him even tighter and, as they wrestle, the harness further snares them both. The scream now becomes the scream of two drowning men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT THE FACES OF THE ONLOOKERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seconds are ticking by, and it reflects on all the faces in the huge room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY FOLEY DIVES, FULLY CLOTHED, INTO THE POOL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His Smokey the Bear hat and cane stay at the surface as he knifes down through the water toward the churning humanity below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER - FOLEY REACHES TOPPER AND THE DIVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both men are so hopelessly entangled in the parachute harness and so close to losing consciousness that Foley has to move very fast. His presence of mind is so total it's frightening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With no wasted moves, he frees both men and pulls them toward the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE SURFACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Instructor helps Foley get them laid out by the side of the pool and while Foley works mouth-to-mouth on Topper, he works on the diver. The diver is easily revived but Topper required everything Foley has to offer. He might have died in less expert hands but Foley is slowly pulling him through.

CAMERA MOVES DOWN the row of lockers. Sid's is a study in neatness, every pair of skivvies folded identically and measured with a ruler, which is exactly what he's doing at the moment. Perryman's problem is his belt buckle, which he is frantically trying to shine before Foley gets there. Zack stands casually by his locker, buffing his fingernails, his shoes and buckle shined to perfection, as always.

CAMERA HOLDS on the fourth locker, the one that belonged to Topper Daniels. The door to the locker is open and it's empty.

Sid gives him a dirty look but Zack ignores it. The SOUND OF HARSH FOOTSTEPS approaching and the three candidates snap to rigid attention by their lockers.

Foley walks in and starts inspecting Perryman. Sweat runs down the black's face in rivers. Foley moves on to Sid, checks out his locker, then turns to Zack.

He brings his cane up suddenly, like a majorette's baton, and with one poke knocks the piece of fiberboard out of it's place in the ceiling, allowing two pairs of shined boonies, a half-dozen freshly-brassoed belt buckles, and a little black book recording the monies owed him, to rain down.

<DIRECTION>
Zack says nothing but Foley's getting to him in ways nobody has in years, if ever.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want to know why I'm not an officer, Mayo? Because I have a servile mentality from growing up poor... from always being the kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's your problem, Mayo. That's why you don't mesh. Because deep down in that bitter little heart of yours, you know these other boys and girls are better than you.

There are three people in the boat, two girls and a boy wearing a sack over his head. All three wave in their direction.

</PERRYMAN>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? He's been telling me I'm not officer material because I'm not inner-directed. He thinks I'm here for my folks... and for my brother.

INT. ZACK AND PAULA'S ROOM AT THE TIDES INN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are making love. When it's over, they lie there for a long time in one another's arms, flagrantly satisfied, and still joined.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<PAULA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It sure was.

They share a little smile of satisfaction. They chuckle. The longer they stay together, like that, the more painfully intimate the moment becomes.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want me to get a towel?

Zack laughs and the connection is nearly broken. Suddenly, Zack just takes her face in his hands and kisses her in a most loving way.

Paula seems to consider it for a moment, then she shakes her head. It's a fantasy, that's all, far removed from the realities of her life.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.

</PAULA>
<ZACK>

	That's no excuse for not going after what you want.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BYRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nothing to talk about. Two goddamn times I made it with your old lady. We barely even talked.

</BYRON>
<DIRECTION>
The JETS ROAR close overhead and Zack has to raise his voice to be heard.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BYRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wrote. Not every week...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYRON>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...

<BYRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never said any of that!

Both men rise angrily to their feet, but a split second later the Angels are making another pass over the stands and everyone is standing and applauding, making their argument less public.

Paula stops, hurt. Zack keeps on walking toward his bike.

<PAULA>

(angrily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'll leave you alone! How about forever? That long enough for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULA>
<DIRECTION>
She stomps off in the opposite direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING WITH PAULA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She fights her tears but they well up in her eyes anyway. The SOUND of Zack STARTING HIS MOTORCYCLE, then he comes rumbling up beside her, smiling apologetically. Paula won't even look at him. She just keeps walking. So he motors around in front of her again, blocking her path. She tries to go around him but again he cuts her off.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, isn't it about time you had me over for Sunday dinner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
Paula looks at him like he's crazy.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...

	No way... Would you?

</PAULA>
<LYNETTE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNETTE>
<PAULA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.

As mother and daughter prepare the Sunday meal, Ester finds herself studying her daughter almost as if she were seeing herself as a girl, in Paula.

	Honey, you can only be yourself. If that isn't enough for Zack...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTHER>
<DIRECTION>
Both women move to the window as they hear his MOTORCYCLE APPROACH. Zack motors up, and starts for the door, a bouquet of flowers in his hand, his white liberty uniform almost sparkling in the bright sunshine. Esther's eyes become soft, almost limpid.

<ESTHER>

Paula looks at her for a moment, then leaves the kitchen.

INT. THE POKRIFKI LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe Pokrifki is watching Zack from the living room window, threatened to his core. The DOORBELL RINGS and Paula moves past him to answer it. Seeing the expression on her father's face, she stops.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULA>

	Daddy, please be nice to him.

INT. POKRIFKI DINING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flowers he brought are in a vase on the table. Esther is serving out helpings of stew. As she serves Zack, she meets his eyes and smiles an almost flirtatious smile.
</DIRECTION>
<ESTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks again for the flowers, Zack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ESTHER>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My pleasure, Mrs. Pokrifki.

Across the table from Zack, Joe is staring their way in a most hostile manner.

</ESTHER>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just three, ma'am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
Again, a flirtatious look. Joe sees it. And so does Paula.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To compound matters, Paula's little sisters are also flirting with Zack, and Joe Pokrifki is taking it all as a threat to his castle, an outright attack on his manhood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Zack can handle his stares no longer. He smiles his most disarming smile and meets the man's gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, excuse me, but why're you looking at me like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looking at you?

</JOE>
<ESTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He doesn't mean anything by it, Zack. Do you, Joe?

</ESTHER>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't mean anything by it.

<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great dinner! Mrs. Pokrifki. Absolutely the best meal I've had in a long, long time.

As they leave the house and start down the street, Paula starts to cry and Zack puts his arm around her shoulders.

	I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULA>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<PAULA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's okay. I'm used to it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULA>

They walk in silence for awhile.

<PAULA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?

</PAULA>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas.

Zack, Sid, Casey, Perryman and Della-Serra are struggling to erect a shelter in the driving downpour, using a parachute and logs they've cut.

captures the humor of the next three days of survival training. The candidates are a sorry spectacle the first day and a half, trying to catch snakes with forked sticks, trying to rub wood together to start a fire, throwing up from eating the wrong berries, but generally clowning around, not taking it too seriously. Then, as hunger sets in, a change comes over them. They set up a big tent for shelter, get a nice fire going, and prepare a serviceable meal from carefully selected roots, berries and tree bark, and strips of fried water moccasins. On the third day they plot a path through the wilderness and finally emerge onto a highway where Foley waits with the truck. The candidates send up a weary cheer and embrace each other as if they'd just pulled off an escape from a POW camp.

Zack takes off across the course with a gleam in his eye. He wants that record. Zack dances through the innertubes, hand over hands the parallel bars, and churns his way through a stretch of knee-deep sand, his classmates cheering him on, wanting the record, too, wanting to leave their mark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They all wear warmups similar to the ones worn by the crack squad they saw in the early days of training, except that their shirts are gold and their pants are blue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the front of their shirts is an insignia and the words:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"FOLEY'S FIRE EATERS." Their nicknames have been printed boldly on the back: "MAYONNAISE," "B. SANDWICH," "THE MARRIED MAN," "THE WILD WOP," (DELLA-SERRA), "GODZILLA." "WHAT ME WORRY?," ETC. Across the back of Foley's all red warmup suit are these words: "YOU'RE PISSING ME OFF, BOY!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Zack passes his slower classmates, they add their shouts of encouragement to the cheering from the sidelines. "Do it, Mayo!" "Put our name up there, Mayonnaise!" "You can do it!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zack shimmies up a rope, yanks his body over the low hurdles, crawls on his back under the low horizontal bars, scampers up the angled beam, leaps the moat... and is approaching the wall full tilt when he sees Seeger up ahead, struggling as usual to get over it.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
(calling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Seeger! Let's go over it together!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
He makes it in one leap but she falls back to the ground, beaten. Zack pauses at the top of the wall and looks down at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Foley watches from the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zack drops back down beside Seeger. She has tears of frustration in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's not going to make it and the realization that she's come this far only to fail is crushing her.
</DIRECTION>
<CASEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on, Zack! Go for the record!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he draws a line with his foot)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(the total officer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
Seeger nods, almost mesmerized by his decisive tone of voice, his sudden emergence as a leader. She starts running, takes off exactly on the mark, and struggles to the top of the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She drops down on the other side and Zack joins her, smiling
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOLEY STOPS HIS WATCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and shakes his head. He can live without that record.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZACK AND CASEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they finish the course, they stop and hug each other. Then something catches Zack's eye that chases the good feelings away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZACK'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Big Sid is trudging slowly toward the 101 Course in his warmup, his nickname: "LOVERBOY" somehow ironic, especially in this moment. Sid sees Zack looking his way and signals the news to him by putting his arms into a baby-cradling position and rocking the imaginary off-spring from side to side.

INT. THE ALTITUDE CHAMBER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wearing full oxygen masks, Zack and Sid are part of a group of six candidates playing pat-a-cake at simulated altitudes inside the claustrophobic-small decompression chamber. An INSTRUCTOR is explaining the test over an intercom, from outside the windowed chamber.
</DIRECTION>
<INSTRUCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now everybody take off your masks but continue the same exercise. The purpose is to show you the effects of altitude on the motor skills when you've been cut off from your oxygen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INSTRUCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly their reactions begin to deteriorate. At first Sid seems amused by his and Zack's fumbling to slap hands. Then as a SHINING SOUND mounts into a crazy place, he begins to panic.
</DIRECTION>
<SID>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly, calling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop this thing! I said stop it!
	</DIALOGUE>

Everyone looks at him strangely. Sid lurches like a drunk to his feet and tries to move toward the door. He trips over himself and falls, then stays there with his hands on his ears and his body curled into a fetal position.
</DIRECTION>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want out! Let me out! Please! Let me out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<DIRECTION>
Zack extricates himself from his harness like a man with eight thumbs condemned on top of it to move in slow motion. He weaves, drops to his knees by Sid, and awkwardly tries to enclose him in his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sid, it's okay. Don't be afraid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
The WHINING STOPS as they start to back off on the pressure inside the chamber, but they can't do it too fast. Slowly Sid comes to his senses, and his eyes focus on Zack.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sid, what happened?
	</DIALOGUE>

	Hey, man, don't cry... not in front of the instructors.

Zack looks around at the faces, all staring back in judgement, not just the instructors. By now, the candidates know the symptoms of a DOR as well as anybody.

Zack is on morning "colors" duty. He and one of the lesser- known candidates are raising the flag, a bugler standing nearby, blowing "morning colors". Zack suddenly sees something that chills him.

Sid and Foley stand in front of the Admin. Building, Foley saluting the flag, Sid just standing there arms at his sides, shoulders slumped.

The big Okie hangs by his necktie from a cluster of exposed drainage pipes in a corner of the ceiling.

ZACK'S FACE IS STRETCHED WITH PAIN

Tears flood his eyes. He shakes his head in disbelief.

	Oh, God... why? Why, Sid?

Zack cuts him down and cradles his friend's body in his arms.

<PAULA>

<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!

<FOLEY>

	Meyers.

Zack suddenly drives up on his motorcycle and walks toward the group, unshaven, tie askew, uniform totally wrinkled, eyes as red as sores.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.

Foley is up in the ring in his VC pajamas, watching them take do their seats. Zack is the last to walk in.

<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir!

</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
He climbs up into the ring with Foley.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put these on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
He hands Zack a set of safety-punch gloves and safety-kick foot pads. Zack sits on the canvas and puts them on. Foley already wears his.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll start with some basic kicks. You try to copy me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Zack gets to his feet and squares off opposite Foley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOST OF ZACK'S CLASSMATES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
know about the incident in town with the locals, and the word spreads quickly to the others in excited whispers. They share a common dream, these twenty-one survivors, to see Foley broken and humbled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MARTIAL ARTS DEMONSTRATION - A SERIES OF SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Foley demonstrates a simple side kick, the heel of his foot slamming hard against Zack's jaw. As in the previous demonstration, Foley isn't afraid of inflecting a little punishment along with his instruction. He's unprepared, however, for the skill and and speed with which Zack returns a version of that kick, the heel of his foot hitting Foley so solidly it rocks him back a couple of steps before he can catch his balance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Foley grins, a rivulet of blood running down his chin.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looky-looky what we got. That's pretty cute, Mayo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Foley executes a crescent kick, his specialty, and bloodies Zack's mouth. Zack returns a crescent kick that knocks the Marine right on his ass.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get on your feet and find out how good, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
Before Zack can get set, Foley seizes the offensive and starts backing him across the ring with a series of fast kicks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Momentarily trapped in the corner, Zack ducks a punch, slips under a crescent kick, and hits his man three times in the face with his foam-padded knuckles, then follows with a kick to the mid-section that makes the Marine sink to his knees with a silly expression on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly unafraid of Foley, the class rises to its feet and cheers Zack on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ad-LIBS of "Get him, Zack!" "No mercy!" "Remember what he did to us!" Quieter mumblings of "Kill the motherfucker."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Foley gets to his feet. Zack drops him instantly with a jumpspinning back kick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Foley gets up again and manages to stay up for a short time but it's a pathetic mismatch and Zack can land solidly at will with hands and feet. Finally, with a spinning outside crescent kick that awes his classmates, Zack flattens him again. Foley just lies there, obviously spent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zack offers him a hand. Foley looks up at him helplessly, shakes his head in defeat, and reaches out to accept his help.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, with shocking suddenness, Foley coils his knees to his chest, yanks Zack toward him, and -- at the same time -- unleashes a kick straight to Zack's chin. Zack crumples to the canvas and lies there, barely conscious. Foley rises to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oldest trick in the book. Now, is there anything you want to tell me, Mayo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Zack shakes his head, no. Foley bows to him formally, then to the rest of the class, and marches like God's Warrior Son from the old hangar.

<DIRECTION>
Zack watches his classmates file out, leaving him alone in the cavernous hanger.

Perryman looks up from his Navigation book as his only surviving roommate enters. Zack looks at the two stripped bunks, the empty lockers... then he stares at his own locker for a long time, trying to make up his mind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Perryman gets up, puts a reassuring hand on his shoulder, just for an instant, and goes back to his studies. Finding some coins in his locker, Zack leaves the room.

INT. PAULA'S BEDROOM - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Paula gets up to the SOUND of her alarm. She hurries to turn it off so as not to awaken her sisters. The time is 6:30 in the morning. Time to go to work. Grudgingly, she relinquishes the warmth of the bed, and trudges toward the bathroom in her pajamas.

Paula gets into Bunny's Toyota and the carpool drives on.

</LYNETTE>

Paula glances off at the two boys Lynette is flirting with, father back in the line. Both could be her father's sons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Candidates for apehood.

Paula has a faraway look on her face as she pulls her card from the clock.

Zack and his classmates are passing in review before the Commanding Officer and his staff (including Foley), seated on the risers, and the large gathering of family and friends seated on the folding chairs. The base marching band, a phalanx to the left of the rises, is in fine and rousing form.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Zack and Casey and Perryman and the others pass CAMERA, they do a precise EYES-RIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BYRON IS APPLAUDING LOUDER THAN ANYBODY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a proud moment for the reluctant father and he's not above letting the stiffer-looking parents around him know how he feels about having a son made it into the officer ranks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ZACK SEE HIS FATHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and smiles.

SECONDS LATER, THE CAMERA IS PANNING THE FACE OF THE GRADUATES.

standing at attention on their risers, reciting their commissioning oath.

MINUTES LATER, THE NEWLY-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS HAVE BROKEN RANKS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and are embracing their families and friends on the lawn.

Byron finds Zack and the two men stare at one another warily, before warmth floods their faces and they come together in an embrace. Zack pulls a folded document from his breast pocket.

He looks over at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOLEY, IN DRESS BLUES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He cane propped characteristically behind him, the newer notches clearly recognizable from the ones that predate this class, he watches them approach... one after the other, each of his worms, his scuzzes, his college pukes... and he renders to them, as is the tradition, their first salute. In return, they hand him a silver dollar.

Perryman pays up, then Casey approaches him.

He still wears his dress whites and his gear is packed in a Navy seabag strapped to the back, as he drives away from the barracks, waving farewell to some of his classmates. As he rumbles past the parade ground, he sees Foley addressing a spanking new class of candidates, still in civvies, still sporting hair.
</DIRECTION>
<FOLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe what I'm seeing! Look at all that hair! All those lard bellies from junk food and pot! Where you been all your lives, at an orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger and bad mouthing your country, I bet.

The new class cracks up, laughing, as Zack motors past, headed for the gates. It's hard to believe only thirteen weeks have elapsed since he heard those words for the first time. Seems more like a lifetime.

So clean. So handsome. So perfect. Every deb's fantasy.

HE WEARS THE DRESS WHITE UNIFORM WITH ENSIGN GOLD

<DIRECTION>
PAULA CAN'T BELIEVE IT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almost as she might have dreamed it long ago as a little girl, she watches him take her face in his hands and kiss her in such a romantic way that it's unlikely the women at National Paper, or any of us, will ever forget that kiss.

LYNETTE AND BUNNY WATCH THAT KISS

She adds her applause and half the factory is clapping and cheering by the time the officer and his girl reach the doorway.

Zack carries Paula out into the sunshine and kisses her again.
