:SC: CASTLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now comes the moon riding over the horizon. Upon a hill at the edge of the wood squats a castle, its crude stonework bathed in cold silvery light. Queer carvings and runes decorate the ponderous gate. Heavy vines are climbing up the walls. The castle is old, its unfamiliar form testament to an ancient mind and an ancient craft. Flickering candle light dances on a leaded windowpane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside, the corridors are dark and silent. Under low arched ceilings the uneven floors are paved with stone blocks. Perched over lintels and crouched in niches are icons with strange animal heads.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HODGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sleep on a straw palette in a room strewn with vegetables and crockery is Hodge, a wrinkled old retainer. A flickering candle and empty jug are beside the bed. He is snoring gently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CONJURING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This circular chamber at the heart of the castle is stuffed with parchments, scrolls, dusty books, bronze braziers, glass retorts, chemical salts, birds both stuffed and caged. An iron candelabra stands on a work table, tapers burning. In the soft glow it seems that the room is unoccupied, but no, moving in the background is a shadowy figure, preparing for a magical deed. Feet are positioned carefully within a pentagram chiseled into the floor. A scroll is consulted; up comes an arm and a voice blurts out:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Omnia in duos: Duo in Unum: Unus in Nihil: Haec nec Quattuor nec Omnia nec Duo nec Unus nec Nihil Sunt.

Nothing happens.

But the little flames stand at attention without so much as a tremble.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In Volunta Divina et Verbum Magi: Lux! Exstinguat!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
It's no use. There is a sigh and the figure moves forward into the light. Revealed in the glow is the discouraged face of Galen Bradwardyn, sorcerer's apprentice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOWER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrying the candelabra, the youth trudges up a circular staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TURRET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The highest point of the castle is a turret, open to the stars and the night air. Here, more magic is afoot. An old enchanter, Ulrich, Magister Ipsissimus, pours water from a silver ewer into a stone bowl. As the surface ripples disappear he leans forward and gazes into the pool. All at once his face hardens as the distant sounds of screams and thunder reach his ears. Lights and shadows, reflected from within the basin, play across his face. His frown deepens as the sound of his own voice comes to him from the vision in the water -- Draco draconis -- suddenly squelched by the roar of flame and an ugly snarl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment Galen reaches the top of the steps and holds up the candelabra.
</DIRECTION>
<GALEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vide, Magister. There's something wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALEN>
<DIRECTION>
Ulrich, startled from his trance, slaps the water out of the basin and turns to confront his student. Galen is taken aback by the old man's grim countenance.

Outside the castle wall Hodge is feeding the chickens and ducks. He straightens up and squints through the early morning mists. On a distant hillock two figures are moving toward the woods.

ULRICH AND GALEN

Hobbling slowly with the aid of a pair of canes, Ulrich guides his pupil across a wooden bridge and along a stream into the forest.

	To tell the truth, I haven't dared try it. What's the point, anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALEN>
<ULRICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The point? The point is you don't know it, and you're no magician without it. It was my hope to school you, to mold your faculties and wits... I still believe you have some talent. Somewhere.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate books. I hate drill. I want a real task.

</GALEN>
<ULRICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no time now. When I'm gone, half the powers in the universe will vanish with me. And what's the use of a few lingering skills if they're left in the hands of a child?

Ulrich gauges the young man standing before him and makes a decision. Reaching under his cloak he lifts off a fine silver chain with an amulet dangling from it. He drapes it around Galen's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<ULRICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, wear this.
	</DIALOGUE>

Galen instinctively wraps his hand around the jewel. He cocks an ear.
</DIRECTION>
<GALEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Voices, singing on the road.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALEN>
<DIRECTION>
He hastens forward to a promontory, eager to have a look. Ulrich does not follow. Instead, doffing his cloak, he whirls it before him, where it magically floats a few feet off the ground. Awkwardly, the old man clambers aboard.
</DIRECTION>
<GALEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't see anything.
	</DIALOGUE>

He turns back, but the wizard is gone. A shadow falls over him. He looks up. There, two hundred feet above the tree tops his master is soaring on the wind.

The old conjurer squints into the distance. Miles away and far below a company of drab walkers winds along the margins of the forest. They are singing a mournful round.

He gawks skyward. Suddenly, the old man leans down and addresses him.

Clustering together in the center of a wide reception hall is a contingent of weary peasants, awkward amidst the dusty rugs, drapes and heavy furniture. Their leader is a fineboned youth, not yet twenty. Like the others, he is uneasy; his name is Valerian. Hodge enters and sets a tray of mead before them. He leaves without a word. The visitors stare glumly at the refreshment, but are too timorous to go near it.

<DIRECTION>
CONJURING ROOM
</DIRECTION>

Galen helps Ulrich prepare for the audience. The sorcerer peers at himself in a full-length mirror, adjusting the hem of a black robe.
</DIRECTION>
<ULRICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks forbidding enough, don't you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ULRICH>
<GALEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here are your sticks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALEN>
<ULRICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- they'll think me infirm. You know, Balisarius wore this whenever he changed lead into gold. He could really do that, you know. I never could. Too bad -- you'd stand to inherit some real wealth.

He backs away from the mirror and fits a silver coronet onto his head.

The sorcerer starts down a circular stone staircase.

THE ROTUNDA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The visitors watch warily as a door swings open and Galen makes his entrance, his face expressionless and hands pressed together. He looks rather young to be the famous Ulrich.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Galen allows a moment to go by, then throws his arms wide. Ka-whump! and Ulrich appears in the doorway in a smoky fireball. Alarmed, the visitors retreat.
</DIRECTION>

In the fireplace, the birch logs are suddenly ablaze. Ulrich totters to the hearth and extends long bony fingers toward the warmth.

<ULRICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome to Cragganmore. I am Ulrich. Which one of you calls himself Valerian?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ULRICH>
<DIRECTION>
The travelers are suitably dazzled by the magician's performance. The young leader of the party screws up his courage and speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<VALERIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That would be me. We are here on behalf...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERIAN>
<ULRICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know why you're here. You're a delegation from Urland, from beyond Dalvatia. Let's see the artifacts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ULRICH>
<DIRECTION>
The travelers exchange nervous glances. Valerian motions to one of his companions. The man steps forward and hands over a leather pouch. One by one, Valerian places the contents on the table for Ulrich's inspection.
</DIRECTION>
<VALERIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A bone. Scorched. A rock, fire- blackened.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Scales.

At this, Ulrich advances and closely examines three shimmering irridescent disks as big as saucers.

	All right. How did you come by these?

Valerian reaches under his jerkin and withdraws what appears to be a curved sword. He jabs it into the table.

<VALERIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A claw.

CONJURING ROOM

Galen comes puffing up the steps, locates the iron box, and flings it open. Amidst the tawdry paraphernalia of a professional magician is an ivory-handled dagger covered with runic inscriptions. Galen eagerly examines it to see how the blade might twist aside or collapse into the handle, but it is all too genuine. A murder weapon.

Galen hesitates, then tosses it. Tumbling end over end, it arcs downward. The old conjurer calmly stretches out a hand and plucks it neatly out of the air. Galen watches as Ulrich passes the weapon to Tyrian and strips back his robe exposing a bony chest. Galen knows what's coming. He rushes for the door. He's only a step away when it bangs shut of its own accord. He sprints for a second exit. Whack! This door slams shut too. Locked in. Quick, back to the window and climb down the vine... Smack! the heavy shutters seal him in.

Galen stops hammering and presses his face to a crack in the shutter. Below he can see the participants in this grisly drama. He holds his breath. Tyrian makes a sudden movement and buries the blade in Ulrich's chest. But the sorcerer stands unbent, seemingly unhurt. Then, after a long moment, he slowly sags forward over the dagger and the hand that holds it. Tyrian shrinks back and allows the body to fall in a heap. Very quickly he remounts. In another moment he and his companions are gone. The others are riveted in horror. Hodge sinks to his knees and wails his grief.

:SC: FUNERAL PYRE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ulrich, principal magician and sorcerer of the western world, reposes on a hardwood pyre. His hands are folded on his chest. His face is peaceful. While the visitors wordlessly look on, Galen touches a burning brand to the kindling. At first the fire catches normally enough, but when the flames start to envelop the body they suddenly turn pale green, producing an unearthly roar. The onlookers back away from the intense heat.

:SC: CONJURING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Galen sits alone amidst the museum-like collection of magical apparatus. He stares at the amulet, considering its significance. His reverie is interrupted by the murmur of voices below. At the window he looks down to see Hodge bidding farewell to the delegation from Urland. Valerian is the last to leave. He pauses at the gate and glances up at Galen. Then he moves on. The young student of magic sets his jaw, suddenly filled with resolve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving through the room, he busies himself with the old man's effects. He scoops up the loose books and parchments and locks them into trunks. He drapes muslin cloths over the alchemical devices. He sows a handful of salt over the pentagram inscribed in the floor. Finally, he opens the cages and releases the crow, the falcon, and the great horned owl.
</DIRECTION>

COURTYARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hodge is up on the burned out funeral pyre, anxiously scraping ashes and small bones into a leather pouch -- the remains of Ulrich. Up behind him comes Galen, now clad in a traveler's cloak, with a pack on his back and a staff in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<GALEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hodge -- what are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>

Hodge quickly conceals the pouch.

<HODGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just making my farewell, thank you very much.

He quickly climbs down, picks up his pack and follows Galen out through the gate. As the door is pushed shut a huge oaken timber falls into place, barring the castle against the uninvited.

:SC: HILLTOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Galen and Hodge labor to the crest of a grassy hill and turn to look back across a wide valley. There on another hilltop on the far side sits Cragganmore, lit by the red rays of the setting sun. Galen removes the amulet from his neck and clutches it in his fist. Hodge is bug-eyed to see it.

The vines on the castle walls begin to twitch and stretch, magically brought to animate life. They flow upward over the masonry, branching out and covering every surface, then up onto the roof. Finally only the tops of the chimneys and the highest turrets stand above the green carpet. A century's growth in a matter of seconds.

There is a noise from the darkness beyond the campfire. Two of the men get to their feet and listen. At first silence, then more rustling. Without a word the two men dart into the bushes and haul two interlopers before the company: Galen and Hodge.

<HODGE>

	Good morrow, good morrow. Peace be with you.

	My lord Ulrich is no longer. All that you asked of him, you may now expect of me. The dangers he would face, I will now conquer. The task he would undertake I will now fulfill. I am Galen Bradwardyn, inheritor of Ulrich's craft and knowledge, and I am the Sorcerer you seek.

There is a moment of depressed silence. Hodge rolls his eyes. Greil starts to chuckle, then to laugh. Soon the others are laughing too.
</DIRECTION>
<GREIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's a handsome thought, O wizard of wizards. But if there's one thing our friend Tyrian has shown us, it's to beware the pig in the poke. Who's got a dagger?

But Greil persists, waving the knife at the group.

He lashes out with the knife. Galen jumps back, but Valerian steps in, delivering a quick kick to Greil's gut, followed by a right to the jaw that sends the bigger man sprawling. He takes the knife.

	What's come over you, anyway? Have you lost your wits?

He propels Galen out of harm's way and sits him down on the other side of the fire. Greil nurses his jaw.

	I don't like it. Young snot-nose comes in here for sport at our expense. We're on a fool's errand, but we don't have to listen to this. I don't want to hear any more about sorcery. I don't want to hear any more about spells.

:SC: DRAGON COUNTRY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The moon shines down on the far reaches of the Kingdom of Urland, coldly lighting a barren landscape filled with the skeletons of dead trees, blackened rock and bare ground. Advancing across this mournful terrain is a troop of armed men leading a blindfolded horse and tumbril. The horse is skittish. Finally, in spite of shouts and lashings, it refuses to go further. The leader, Horsrik, barks out an order:
</DIRECTION>
<HORSRIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Close enough! Bring her out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORSRIK>
<DIRECTION>
A young woman, no more than seventeen, is brought forth from the cart. Long black hair falls down over a white tunic. Her dark eyes dart fearfully around in her pale face. She is half-carried, half dragged to the edge of a steaming crack in the ground where she is manacled to a wooden post. By lantern-light, Horsrik reads from a parchment scroll.
</DIRECTION>
<HORSRIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now be it known throughout the kingdom, that this maiden, having lawfully been chosen by a deed of fortune and destiny, shall hereby give up her life for the greater good of Urland.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORSRIK>
<DIRECTION>
There is a low rumble; the earth shakes. Horsrik glances nervously around. He carries on by rote.
</DIRECTION>
<HORSRIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By this act shall be satisfied the powers that dwell underground and the spirits that attend thereto. In gratitude for this sacrifice His Majesty has declared the family -- what's the name? --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORSRIK>
<DIRECTION>
He prods the girl, but she is too terrified to speak. Beneath them, the earth seems to groan. Smoke issues from the mouth of the pit. One of the nervous witnesses leans forward.
</DIRECTION>

	Plowman! The family Plowman!

	</DIALOGUE>
</HORSRIK>
<DIRECTION>
The horse suddenly rears, and blindfold notwithstanding, gallops off, dragging the tumbril over the rocks. The men behind Horsrik break ranks and scatter.
</DIRECTION>
<HORSRIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- ordained and signed this day, etc., Casiodorus, in his glory the reigning king of this our realm... his seal, his mark, duly read by Chancellor Horsrik in his holy name.

Now Horsrik joins the flight, chasing his men back over the murky horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GIRL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She strains against her manacles, cocking her head to listen as the rumblings below subside. Presently the steam and smoke blow away and she can see the horse pawing and stamping a hundred yards distant, the wheel of the cart jammed between rocks. Summoning up a wild will to live, she squeezes her hands against the cold iron rings. No use. She spits on her wrists and twists desperately. Blood starts. One hand slips free. She looks at the horse. The animal tosses off its blindfold and looks back at her. Now she strains again and pulls her other hand free. She wipes the blood on her frock and sprints toward the horse. But she doesn't get there. The earth abruptly shifts from under her feet, tumbling her among cracked and steaming rocks. When she raises her head a huge shadow has fallen over the horse. There is a piteous whinny, then a roar. The girl's face is suddenly lit by flames. She scrambles to her feet and rushes back the other way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CHASE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girl hasn't taken a dozen steps when something huge hurtles forward and blocks her way. Something scaly and glittering. She whirls and stumbles off in a new direction. This time she's cut off by a monstrous claw tipped with rapier- like talons. She screams and crawls away. Another claw prevents her escape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CREATURE

Membranous wings fold down against the night sky. Up comes the silhouette of a reptilian head swaying on a serpentine neck. There's an angry hiss. A sheet of flame envelops everything.

Under the oaks and hickory, a forest stream has widened into a quiet pool. A pile of clothes lies on a rock at the edge. Out in the middle, Valerian is treading water.

Galen works his way through the murky green underwater world. Suddenly, he stops short and stares. He's only a few feet from Valerian's dangling legs. He gasps in surprise. Valerian is no boy.

He studies her. She jams a hat down over her head and, once more the young man, stalks off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE VISION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Galen walks down to the edge of the pool to retrieve his pack. As he leans over he catches sight of what appears to be a reflection in the water: Tyrian on horseback. He whips around, but no one is behind him. Riveted by the vision, he hurries along the bank to follow it. After a few paces the blurry figure dismounts, unslings a longbow, nocks an arrow and draws the string taut.

TRAVELERS

Galen races up the trail rounds a bend and sees the Urlanders coming toward him. Hodge precedes the group with an unsteady gait. He sees Galen, raises up his arms and flops face down on the trail. A long arrow protrudes from his back. Galen kneels beside him. The uneasy company keeps its distance. Hodge struggles to speak.

Hodge's hand comes out from under his coat gripping the leather pouch. Galen tugs at it, but Hodge can't let go.

	Take it. Sorry, you'll have to peel it loose.

Galen pries the sack out of Hodge's clenched fingers. Suddenly the hand comes up, grabs Galen by the hair, and pulls him near.

But Hodge has passed on, and Galen's magic has no way to reach him. Suddenly the youth cries out in pain. He drops the amulet and looks at his palm. The device has burned his flesh. Now he becomes aware of troubled Urlanders looking over his shoulder, witness to his failure.

Wind whips the leaden wave tops on a vast rainy lake. The travelers are rowing across in an open longboat, aided by a tattered lateen sail. Valerian mans the steering oar at the stern while Galen broods in the bow. He feels like an imposter in their eyes.

The travelers turn to see what's the matter.

THE LAIR

Galen approaches the lair, pausing beside a wooden post with iron manacles dangling from it. He fingers them thoughtfully. Malkin, Greil and Valerian rush up behind him, their faces drawn with worry.
</DIRECTION>
<GREIL>

	Look, you don't have to do this. We know you're a fine young magician. None better. There's no need to prove it to us.

Instead, Galen starts into the crack. Greil and Malkin hasten away, but Valerian lingers, watching in mounting frustration as Galen probes further and further into the lair. She picks up a fistful of stones and throws them at him.
</DIRECTION>
<VALERIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead! You're going to die! What a fine trick that will be!

But Galen is lost in the gloom. She flees.

UNDERGROUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Galen puts his hand on the rugged wall: the rocks are hot to the touch. Something glinting on the floor catches Galen's eye: an irridescent disk, a dragon scale. It flashes the colors of the rainbow as Galen examines it. All at once the ground shudders; chunks of rock fall from the ceiling. A pall of smoke billows up from the depths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Galen staggers out of the fissure coughing and gagging in a swirl of smoke. There is no sign of the Urlanders. He throws down his pack, climbs onto a huge boulder and surveys the massive cliffs rising behind the lair. He grasps the amulet and closes his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<GALEN>

<DIRECTION>
LANDSLIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a thunderous splitting sound, the entire top of the cliff pitches forward and topples onto the lower half of the mountain, sweeping tons of debris into the air. Boulders the size of houses bound down the mountain toward the magician. Eyes wide with awe, he turns and runs for his life. Even as he careens down the slope, chunks of rock rumble past. One catches him at the knee and sends him flying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He covers his head and joins the landslide. Finally the dust lifts and he finds himself in a gully face to face with the cowering Urlanders. They look with real fear at the man who just conjured up the Apocalypse. Tattered and torn, covered with dirt, Galen climbs up out of the shelter for a look at his handiwork.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LANDSCAPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The territory has been drastically transformed: the dragon's lair is now buried beneath hundreds of tons of broken granite. The Urlanders look upon the new landscape with stupefaction. Galen grins a triumphant split-lip grin that fails to win them over. Presently they back away and run off down the trail, Valerian in their midst. Galen's grin fades.

The Village of Swanscombe is little more than a rough and ready collection of thatched huts and mud-daubed outbuildings surrounded by cultivated fields. Dogs sleep in open door- ways; chickens peck around the communal well -- but there are no people in evidence as Valerian and her company troop into town.

She goes over to the forge. Hot coals are burning. She becomes aware of a sound -- voices -- chanting.

SQUARE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks across the square toward the voices. She is joined by Greil, Malkin and the other travelers, all of them puzzled by the desolation. As they approach the grange hall the voices grow louder. They seem to be singing. The main doors open briefly and three villagers scamper out, dripping wet and wrapped in white muslin. Valerian and her companions look at each other in astonishment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE GRANGE HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a wooden cistern in the middle of the hall a woman is being held under water. After a few moments she is pulled to the surface by a tall red-haired man with long bony fingers: Brother Jacopus Januensis, a Carthusian monk. There's a wooden cross on his chest and a mad look in his eye. Gathered around him are the missing villagers, every man woman and child, here to be baptised and sing a few newly-learned hymns in praise of Our Lord Jesus Christ.

Galen is surrounded by a crowd of wide-eyed kids and not a few adults, entertaining them by pulling duck's eggs out of their ears and causing coins to disappear. Presently he feels the attention of his audience shift away to someone standing behind him. He turns to find a shy but determined Valerian sweetly decked out in her blue frock. A buzz goes through the crowd. Valerian blushes and wavers: she seems ready to bolt for home. But Galen takes her by the hand, and with conspicuous politesse leads her to the dance.

While the proud Simon dances in the background with his daughter, a group of tipsy villagers clusters around Galen, belching forth a drinking song. The young magician raises his own mug and joins in on the chorus. Abruptly the music stops. The singing dies away. The ensuing silence is broken by the sound of galloping hooves. Presently three horsemen appear at the end of town: Tyrian and his henchmen. They guide their horses forward into the midst of the merry-makers. Tyrian dismounts and looks around in his usual friendly way.

:SC: THRONE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Within the castle is a great hall with shafts of daylight poking in through narrow windows set high in the walls. In the middle of the room stands a carved oak throne. There is Casiodorus Rex, King of Urland, a bearded man in his fifties, as spare and somber as the room in which he sits. He is flanked by a few servants, assorted courtiers and Tyrian. Standing before them all is Galen, looking unhappy. He pours a pitcher full of water into a small glazed goblet.

<GALEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One of the best things about the water here in Urland is that there's so much of it -- look at that!

Water continues to pour into the goblet without overflowing. Galen takes a sip.

<GALEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmm. Good. But not cold enough. Perhaps I could borrow a scarf from his Majesty.

	I cover the goblet, so... remove, so... and behold: winter in a mug!

And he's done it: he turns the goblet over and a small chunk of ice hits the floor. The royal reaction is equally frosty. Galen is bombing, and he knows it.

	All right. How many of you have ever seen a table fly?

He mutters an incantation. In the audience, Tyrian notes that Galen has his hand wrapped around the amulet. There is a loud clatter as the heavy oak table before the throne begins to jitter and buck. As the wine spills and plates go flying, the King wearily raises a hand.

No one knew where it might strike next. So he brought forth his broadsword and his spear, assembled a company of his best fighters and went out to do battle.

Two guards thrust Galen into a narrow cell and slam the barred door shut. The young sorcerer waits until they're safely out of sight, then takes out his amulet. He ponders it for a doubtful moment. Suddenly a gloved hand darts in and whips it off his neck and out through the bars.

Outside the barred window, a steady rain is falling. Inside, Galen uses a chunk of limestone to inscribe a pentagram on the floor of his cell. He marks runic signs on the window sill and lintel.

Galen rides like mad for the exit, but he's a half-second late: the doors boom shut in his face. He wheels the horse around. The King's men are coming toward him with pikes. Digging his heels into the horse's sides, he urges the animal back across the courtyard, up the steps and right into the building!

Galen is trapped. Just as Tyrian reaches for the horse's reins, the animal rears up, rolling its eyes. At that moment the floor heaves and cracks in a new series of shocks. The men at arms go down like ten pins. Tyrian reels back, dodging stone blocks loosened from the ceiling. As the shaking continues, a weakened section of wall gives way. Galen sees daylight! Without even waiting for the quake to cease, he prods the horse across the room and through the wall to freedom.

There, miles away, is the village of Swanscombe. Many buildings are ablaze. As he watches in horror, fires spring up in the fields and trees. Intermittently he can see the silhouette of the dragon as it spreads destruction. Finally the creature swoops up and away. Galen stares skyward, losing sight of it in the clouds. For a moment, silence. Then, with a thunderous rush of air that almost blows him from the saddle, the dragon reappears and hurtles a few feet over his head! It is gone in an instant.

Simon is going through a cabinet, tossing out hoes, rakes, sickles, scythes, plow blades, and a knife or two. Galen examines them doubtfully. Now Simon produces an armload of swords. Galen is impressed; he looks them over carefully, testing and rejecting them in turn.

Simon gnaws his lip. Reluctantly, he brings a long box from the bottom of the cabinet. He opens it. Lying on a bed of silk is an exquisite two-handed broadsword. The flat blade gleams like a mirror. Galen reaches in and lifts it out.

KING'S CASTLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrying torches to light their way, families -- some with maiden daughters -- gather from all over the country in the courtyard of the King's castle. Simon is there with Valerian, and so is Galen, disguised in rough farm clothes and a wide- brimmed hat. Like many others, he carries a stick topped with a bleached skull -- to all appearances, just another participant in this weird pagan ritual. A barrel decorated with flames and dragon's wings sits on a raised dais in front of the main entrance. Horsrik, the King's herald, supervises preparations for the lottery. Armed guards appear carrying a sealed chest. Horsrik breaks the seal and the guards pour the contents -- hundreds of wooden tiles, each bearing the name of a potential sacrifice -- into the barrel. Trumpets blare and drums roll and the royal party strolls onstage: the King, his daughter, courtiers and Tyrian. Valerian nudges Galen.

Valerian gives Galen a sharp look. Horsrik unrolls a parchment.

	People of Urland: whereas the peace of the kingdom has been disrupted by the mischief of an interloper; and whereas this interloper being fled; now therefore, his majesty the King hereby proclaims the sum of thirty ducats to be paid to anyone producing the miscreant Galen Bradwardyn, fraud enchanter, to our satisfaction.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORSRIK>
<DIRECTION>
Galen pulls his hat low over his eyes. As the moment for the drawing approaches, Valerian becomes more and more uneasy. She pushes forward through the crowd until she's just below the barrel. She eyes the people around her. Some of them seem equally worried, others -- the better dressed and better fed -- are smug and complacent. The King and his retinue are serene. A chant goes up from the crowd:
</DIRECTION>
<CROWD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stir the tiles! Stir the tiles!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROWD>
<DIRECTION>
Horsrik picks up a wooden staff surmounted by a carved dragon's head and stirs up the names. This done, a new chant goes up:
</DIRECTION>
<CROWD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bare the arm! Bare the arm!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROWD>
<DIRECTION>
At a signal, a guard comes forward and cuts the sleeve from Horsrik's right arm. He holds it high. The crowd surges forward. The atmosphere is full of dread and excitement. Valerian looking pale and determined, is jostled and pushed to the edge of the platform.
</DIRECTION>
<CROWD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Draw the name! Draw the name!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROWD>
<DIRECTION>
The moment has come. Down goes Horsrik's arm and up it comes, holding one little wooden square, one young woman's fate. An expectant hush falls over the mob. The virgins of Urland tremble and wait.
</DIRECTION>
<HORSRIK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, my countrymen, hear me: behold, for I am chosen. I shall die that many may live. I shall lay down my life for family and fellows. I shall go to my grave for the love of our King and his wise policy. And my name is --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORSRIK>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down at the tile to read the name, but no sound comes to his lips. He looks back at the crowd, a cold sweat breaking over his face. He swallows, but still can't bring himself to speak. At his feet, Valerian is holding her breath. A new chant goes up.
</DIRECTION>
<CROWD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The name! The name!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CROWD>
<DIRECTION>
By now Horsrik is trembling. He stares down at the tile, his mouth set in a grim line. The King is getting annoyed. He gestures and the crowd falls silent.

There is a moment of profound shock. Then a low murmur of wonder moves through the crowd. Galen looks at Valerian; she sags with relief. The King turns to his daughter. She shows nothing. He rises from his chair, comes forward and snatches the tile from Horsrik.
</DIRECTION>

He quickly tosses the wood chip into a brazier at his elbow. Led by Valerian, the crowd cries out in protest.

He reaches into the barrel and extracts another tile. He looks at it and his eyes widen. Betrayed, he swivels to face his daughter. The din of the crowd reaches a crescendo.

<KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The lottery is invalid. Another and another. What treachery is this?

</KING>
<DIRECTION>
Valerian, chanting with the rest, falls silent. She looks at Elspeth with sudden interest and respect, then awe.
</DIRECTION>
<ELSPETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hear me, good people! It is true, that my name appears on many of the lots. This does not falsify the drawing, it certifies it! I have learned that my name has been kept from jeopardy in all the drawings in the past. So I have put my name among the rest many times -- once for each risk that, over the years, you took and I did not.
	</DIALOGUE>

The crowd is dumbfounded. Gradually voices erupt in a cacophony of shouts, whistles and excited conversation. Galen sees his chance: there's an unguarded door near the stable. He drifts toward it and slips inside.

THRONE ROOM

Galen pokes his head in: the room is empty. He scurries over to a chest, flings it open and starts rummaging. Finding nothing he moves on to a cabinet. He breaks the lock and pries it open. Again, nothing.

CASTLE CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Galen can hear the voices in the courtyard as he rushes down a hall. Suddenly he stops short. There in front of him is a guard leaning out a window to watch the proceedings. Galen hovers on the verge of panic as the guard abruptly moves. But the man is only headed for another window and a better view. Galen manages to fall into step an arm's length behind him and slip by without a sound.

LIBRARY

<DIRECTION>
Galen enters the library, his enormous shadow dancing crazily on the torchlit walls. Hurrying through, his attention is drawn to some open books on a table. Closer inspection reveals magical writings and symbols. Galen paws over everything, suddenly aware that he must be close to the amulet. But where is it?

Galen whirls around to find the King standing in the doorway. The monarch looks shattered. Galen edges toward the split in the wall and finds that it has been shored up with timbers. At that moment Tyrian comes through the door, sizes up the situation and draws his sword.

Clouds scud low over the lifeless region. The dragon's lair now has a newer, bigger entrance. Vapors drift upward from it. Down the slope a lonely figure works its way from rock to rock: it's Valerian with a wicker basket on her arm, searching for dragon scales. The basket is already more than half full when she finds herself ominously near the mouth of the cavern. She's about to turn back when she spies a particularly large and beautiful scale just a few yards further on. As she reaches for it, there is a sudden hiss! She jerks her hand back and freezes. There in the shadows is a baby dragon, a basilisk, all coppery bronze with stubby winglets. As she backs away, she sees two more come up to join the first. They watch her retreat through wicked little green eyes.

On the mossy bank Galen and Simon unwrap the reforged sword. Now the blade carries a faint blue halation. Galen walks to the middle of the current and once again stabs the tip down into the sand. Then he rejoins Simon onshore to await results. This time, as the oak leaves approach the sharp edge, they gently but definitely veer sideways to avoid contact. Such is the power of the sword that even after many leaves, not a single one has come close enough to be sliced. Simon is agog and even Galen seems satisfied. They clasp hands.

Elspeth rides in the tumbril behind a blindfolded horse. Bringing up the rear is Tyrian. At last the cart can go no further. Elspeth alights and leads the rest of the troop to the post.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ELSPETH>
<DIRECTION>
Galen starts to reply, but as soon as his attention wavers, Tyrian is lunging toward him, sword point directed at his neck. Galen barely manages to parry the thrust before Tyrian is at him again, blade swinging toward his knees. Galen drops the tip of his sword to catch the blow. When the two steel edges connect, sparks fly. In a series of thrusts and counter- thrusts, each accompanied by a shower of sparks, Tyrian backs Galen up the mountain.

	In a trice! This is no swords-man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
He might be right, for Galen turns and bolts across the slope. When he reaches the post with Tyrian two steps behind, he whirls and brings his blade down on Princess Elspeth's chains. The chains part in an explosion of sparks.
</DIRECTION>
<GALEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run! Get out of here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALEN>
<DIRECTION>
The Princess darts from the piling as Tyrian swoops down to continue the attack. Galen dodges and the stake catches Tyrian's blow. The earth shakes again. Galen glances at the Princess.
</DIRECTION>
<GALEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Stop! What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALEN>
<DIRECTION>
Elspeth is not running away down the mountain. Instead she is walking, slowly and deliberately, right into the smoking cave. Swoosh! Tyrian's sword comes down again. The dismayed sorcerer ducks back and Tyrian's blade again bites deep into the wood.
</DIRECTION>
<TYRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've failed, my friend, and I thank the gods for it. Come out from behind that post.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TYRIAN>
<DIRECTION>
It's now or never. Elspeth is no longer in sight. Galen grits his teeth, grasps the sword with two hands and swings it as hard as he can in a wide arc. The blade never even slows down as it sails right through the post, lopping it clean off. The glowing sword flashes above Galen's head and eagerly buries itself in Tyrian's chest. The King's man is as startled by the amputated piling as he is by his own death. His eyes roll up in his head, his knees buckle and he topples backward -- the blade sliding free.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DRAGON'S LAIR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smoke swirls at the mouth of the cave as Galen enters, holding his sword before him, lighting his way with its faint blue glow.
</DIRECTION>
<GALEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elspeth!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALEN>
<DIRECTION>
The floor of the cave as it winds down into the mountain is paved first with rock, then with dragon scales, then with bones. With each footfall, clusters of mysterious insects scuttle away. Galen pauses to mop his brow; it's getting hot. A sound echoes up from the depths, a grinding sound like the gnashing of teeth, followed by hissing and squealing. Galen grips his sword tighter and pushes on. Suddenly he stoops and picks up an embroidered slipper: Elspeth's. The grinding sounds are louder. He hurries forward and rounds a corner. He stops and gags.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BASILISKS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two disgusting little reptiles -- like scaly raccoons -- are perched on the corpse of Princess Elspeth Ulfilas, feeding contentiously on choice bits of the royal flesh. Galen groans: he lashes out and his sword beheads one of the tiny monsters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other one buzzes its half-formed winglets and hisses a hot stream of air. Galen brings down the sword and slices it in half. Eyes riveted on Elspeth's remains, he edges around the carnage and backs away. Hissss! -- there's a third one, lurking in the shadows, munching on something; it might be a hand. Galen shrieks and jumps away. The little creature comes at him and clamps its jaws on his leg. Galen stabs at it repeatedly. Finally it lets go, and flails and flops across the bloody floor, ululating its death agony. As the creature's last mewlings echo down through the cavern, the ground quivers. Bits of stone fall from the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LAKE OF FIRE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Galen works his way down a narrow passage whose walls are alive with insects and beads of sulphurous water. As before, he holds the sword in front of him; he marvels at its increasing brightness. The heat is increasing too; sweat mats his hair and runs down his face. A few yards further on the sword starts pulsating. Now the walls take on a flickering rosy sheen and the passage widens into an underground vista of staggering immensity: an underground lake, its surface bubbling and torn with sheets of flame. Arching over it is a vault of stone, penetrated here and there by natural chimneys. The dimensions of this internal world are unknown -- the fiery lake disappears into half a dozen side chambers. The one clear path is accessible only by a series of flat stones leading across the hot liquid. Galen grips his sword and resolutely hops from rock to rock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERMITHRAX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's halfway across when the earth rumbles and the stepping stones teeter beneath his feet. A fiery wave washes over his legs, leaving his boots smoking. Another tremor knocks Galen to his knees. As he scrabbles to pick up his sword and shield, the great head of Vermithrax rises up out of the depths on its long neck. It gazes at him through huge pale eyes under armored lids. A tongue flicks out and runs around its lipless mouth. The head sways from side to side. The mouth hinges open, the nostril-like igniters come on and touch off the jet of gas squeezed up out of its innards. A roaring tube of flame engulfs Galen. He crouches behind his dragon scale shield which deflects the fire just enough to save his life. The dragon pauses to take a breath. Galen springs to his feet, and bounds back the way he came, his skin and clothing singed. Flames lick at his back as the dragon lets fly with a second burst.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coughing and weeping, Galen staggers up through the tunnel, nearly tripping over the body of one of the baby dragons. A few seconds later, Vermithrax follows, squirming and clawing its way upward. When it reaches its dead offspring it surveys the scene with expressionless eyes. Bringing its head low, it sniffs and nudges at the lifeless little ones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AMBUSH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment Galen leaps out from behind a niche in the tunnel wall and lunges forward. Striking sparks, the point of his sword slides across the dragon's plated cheek and stabs deep between the scales of its heavy neck. There is an unearthly shriek and the creature flicks its head back and upward. Galen goes sprawling and finds himself holding half a sword. The rest is buried in the beast's neck, and Vermithrax doesn't like it. It flings its head this way and that, knocking rocks loose from the ceiling. Its movements cause the ground to quake. As boulders tumble around him, Galen drops to the floor under his shield. Dragon flame reaches through the cascading debris and washes over him.

Valerian roams the rock-strewn slope not far from the dragon's lair. Presently she comes upon a once-familiar object -- the fire shield. Half the scales are gone, the rest are charred and curling. Grimly, she moves on. A few paces away she picks up the blunted sword. She scans the rocks and finally sees what she's looking for.

</GREIL>
<DIRECTION>
In the background, half the congregation is staring through the burned-out walls, fervently praying and crossing themselves, wondering if they'll ever see the sun again. A cry goes up: a shape crosses the solar corona, wheels over the village and streaks away toward the mountains -- the dragon.
</DIRECTION>

CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
MOUNTAIN TOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Galen and Valerian peer out from behind a boulder and watch Ulrich hobble perilously close to the edge of the cliff. The old man spreads wide his arms and tilts his head back.
</DIRECTION>
<ULRICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nimbus! Tempestas! Fulmen!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ULRICH>
<DIRECTION>
From over the horizon roiling inky-black clouds churn down upon them. Thunder booms and echoes. A bitter wind whips their clothing. As the storm gathers fury, the dragon reappears, circling in the distance. Finally it homes in on the mountain crag and dives at Ulrich. The conjurer makes a gesture and strokes of lightning explode against the beast's scaly flanks. It emits a high thin scream and rockets past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GALEN & VALERIAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valerian crawls away and comes back with a hefty chunk of granite.
</DIRECTION>
<VALERIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here. Do as he said. Smash it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERIAN>
<GALEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not if it means killing him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALEN>
<DIRECTION>
ULRICH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He resolutely waits as the dragon banks against the clouds and starts another pass. Again, the sorcerer summons lightning bolts. But the dragon keeps coming; this time a talon splits the old man's cape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GALEN & VALERIAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valerian wrestles the amulet away from Galen. It falls to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<VALERIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You heard what he said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERIAN>
<DIRECTION>
She lifts the chunk of stone. Galen grabs for it.
</DIRECTION>
<GALEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! You can't!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALEN>
<DIRECTION>
THE LAST ATTACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vermithrax spirals up into the storm, then drops earthward. Ulrich watches as the beast comes straight at him. He folds his arms and bows his head. Leathery wings humming, the creature levels out, swoops up past the crag and lifts the master magician away in its huge hind claw.
</DIRECTION>
<ULRICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Galen!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ULRICH>
<DIRECTION>
Galen and Valerian are horrified to see the dragon circling upward with the sorcerer writhing in agony in its grip. As the monstrous thing flies high over them, they can hear Ulrich's faint screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEATH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Galen understands. He seizes the granite block from Valerian and raises it with both hands over his head. He takes a final look at the amulet, glowing at his feet, then brings the rock down with all his might. There is a blinding flash as it shatters into a million fragments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Far above there is another blinding flash as Ulrich's earthly body explodes against the belly of the beast. The darkened sky lights up as huge gouts of flame spew forth from the dragon's gut. Wings fluttering uselessly, this reptilian torch plummets to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LAKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below, a stock pond nestled in the foothill pastures. Trailing a wake of flame, Vermithrax plunges like a comet into the water. There is a stupendous splash and eruption of steam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GALEN & VALERIAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stare down from their lofty perch, watching as further explosions boil the water from the pond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ECLIPSE

<DIRECTION>
Behind a tattered wrack of cloud, the moon slowly uncovers a pale sun.

:SC: THE CARCASS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grey misty light reveals the beast's mangled remains. Galen and Valerian emerge from the fog, walk under a blackened wing and make their way through the mud and loose scales to the huge charred head. The death agony has twisted it upside down. The mouth is frozen in a grotesque look of surprise. The eyes are glazed. Now the sound of voices floats toward them, chanting an ancient hymn. A moment later a mob of Christians, led by Greil, crests a hill and moves toward the hulk. The song ends.
</DIRECTION>
<GREIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let us pray.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREIL>
<DIRECTION>
The members of the congregation fall to their knees.
</DIRECTION>
<GREIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We thank thee, Lord, for this divine deliverance. Verily is thy presence amongst us, fully manifest in this, thy great work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREIL>
<DIRECTION>
Galen and Valerian look at each other. She takes his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<GREIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arise, children of the Lord and forsake evermore the pagan mysteries. Rejoice in the true power of the Christian God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREIL>
<DIRECTION>
Galen turns and leads Valerian away. They disappear into the mist.

:SC: FLENSING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the clear light of a new day, ladders have been tipped up against the creature's back. Teams of men swarm over the crusted flesh, slicing off long strips for piecemeal burial. Below, yoked oxen drag the heavy carrion away on sledges. In the background other workmen dump the remains into an open pit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE KING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the crack of a whip and the clatter of hooves, the royal coach pulls up to the shore of the lake. A door creaks open and King Casiodorus totters out. His face is puffy, his eyes are red. He slogs through the mud to the head of the dragon and commences hacking at it with a ceremonial sword. Horsrik steps out of the coach and draws himself up.
</DIRECTION>
<HORSRIK>
<DIRECTION>
(loud)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All hail Casiodorus Rex -- Dragon slayer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HORSRIK>
<DIRECTION>
The workers pause long enough to listen to this pronouncement and cast a glance at the sorry spectacle. Wordlessly they resume their labors.
</DIRECTION>
<HORSRIK>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hail and praise be!

:SC: ON THE ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trail leads through copses and open meadows. Side by side, Galen and Valerian march up a long slope under a hot sun. He limps a bit; she finds a staff and hands it to him.
</DIRECTION>
<VALERIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to rest?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERIAN>
<GALEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I'm fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALEN>
<VALERIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You miss Ulricn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERIAN>
<GALEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALEN>
<VALERIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the amulet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERIAN>
<GALEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALEN>
<VALERIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not me. I'm glad it's gone. I'm glad you did what you did.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he doesn't reply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may not be a sorcerer, Galen, but I love you anyway. I don't regret anything that happened. I just wish --
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERIAN>
<GALEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALEN>
<VALERIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- that we had a horse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Galen falls a step behind. He briefly closes his eyes and mutters something. They walk on a few paces. Then there is a whinny from the nearby woods and a white stallion canters forth. It crosses a meadow, comes right up to Valerian and nuzzles her.
</DIRECTION>
<VALERIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERIAN>
<GALEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A horse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALEN>
<VALERIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you...!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERIAN>
<GALEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It must have been wandering loose. Or wild.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALEN>
<DIRECTION>
Galen climbs aboard. He reaches out to help her up.
</DIRECTION>
<VALERIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute. I just wished for a horse and here it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VALERIAN>
<GALEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't want to wish it gone, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALEN>
<DIRECTION>
She thinks for a moment, then lets him help her up. Galen touches the horse's flanks with his heels and they ride off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:

<DIRECTION>
THE END
