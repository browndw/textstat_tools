An enormous Japanese BATHYSCAPHE free-falls through the water. An autonomous fifteen-man submersible. Almost futuristic in its design. The nose cone is an amazing ultra high-pressure plexi-dome. LETTERING along the side tells us this is the "SHINKAI 90000."

The JAPANESE CAPTAIN watches a DLD laser tracking system and barks one-word questions to his JAPANESE CREW. The Sailors work the consoles and give clipped monosyllabic answers. The JAPANESE SCIENCE OFFICERS go over charts on the electronic position board, a contiuously-shifting graphic representation of the ocean contours below. Behind them is an elaborate DEPTH GAUGE with computerized graphics. READ: 34,000 feet and dropping. The Crew works at a fevered pitch. An ALARM SOUNDS as the depth gauge sounds 35,000 feet. All eyes on the depth gauge. Several Science Officers share excited looks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE DEPTH GAUGE: 35,100 -- 35,200 -- 35,300 -- 35,400...
</DIRECTION>

The excitement builds. Even the Captain's weathered eyes widen. And then, as the depth gauge hits 35,801 feet below sea level, the entire Crew breaks into CHEERS, WHOOPS, HANDSHAKES AND HIGH-FIVES.

As it continues its descent, it passes corroding metal drums leaking toxic waste, radioactive waste, dumped in the depths, away from prying eyes, and populated areas. The vessel drops into the SULU BASIN. Imagine the Grand Canyon under forty thousand feet of water.

But the Sulu Basin is ten times the size of the Grand Canyon.

Down here, ten thousand fathoms below the storm, all is calm.

THE SHINKAI hovers near a gigantic tectonic plate. A ROBOTIC ARM extends out from under the plexi-dome. Its "hand" is a high-tech LASER CUTTER. It approaches the plate, steadies, then fires a direct BLUE BEAM at the bedrock, burns the rock into magma and cuts a perfect round pattern.

Another ROBOTIC ARM reaches forward, its CLAW rips out the cut rock from inside the pattern, then takes the sample and sets it inside a hydro-basket on the submersible's port side.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MUSIC builds.

The Shinkai approaches the embankment. Slowly starts to glide up the side. The Captain and Science Officers seem mesmerized by all the lonely creepiness. They crest the embankment. And the plexi-domed VIEW FILLS with an unimaginable horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As far as the eye can see, the entire murky landscape is filled with WHALE BONES. A valley of death. Cluttered here and there, carelessly flung about, are the rusting hulks of several ships. Seemingly ripped apart. Clusters of shark cartilage float through the water like white ghosts.

The SHINKAI starts to ROCK and SHAKE. Something has a hold on it. More EQUIPMENT SHATTERS. Men are thrown about. Then it stops rocking. The Sailors stop yelling. Everything goes dead quiet. Frightened eyes share terror-filled looks. A SOUND is HEARD coming from the exterior of the ship, like feet runing across the outside of the hull. Very creepy.

The HULL starts to MOAN and CREAK from an UNSEEN PRESSURE. And then the sub begins to be crushed like it's a beer can. The metal HULL TORQUES on all sides. RIVETS POP and SNAP.

KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK-KA-CHUNK.

Suddenly, LEILA'S whole body SPASMS. She SCREECHES wildly, in great pain. The she's RIPPED backward out through the gaping hole. Gone. WATER SLOSHES back in.

Knee deep in water, an edgy Mulligan watches Finnegan as he disassembles pieces of a thermal carburetor from an auxiliary generator. His eyes keep shifting around. Over in the far corner Vivo is watching Pantucci working over a metal lathe, repairing the cylinder head. Metal-on-metal. Vivo sits up on a barrel, trying to keep his feet out of the water.

Hidden within the girders, and sticking to them, a large translucent INTESTINE-like thing CROSSES the ceiling. Inside it are strange, disgusting biological workings. The GURGLING suddenly gets dramatically LOUDER. And then we SEE BILLY and LEILA, being sucked down the entire length of the fatty intestine. Still alive. And squirming wildly.

Finnegan falls onto the catwalk, drops his rifle, unarmed. Trillian, freaked, stumbles back and lands on her butt. Finnegan sits up against the walls, turns and looks --

The TENTACLE slowly SQUIRMS across the wall like a big leach. Trying to find its prey. Finnegan is frozen in place. Watching. Trillian sits up, eyes widening in fear as she sees -- Hideous little worm-like FEELERS and SUCKERS protrude up and down the Tentacle. WRIGGLING and WRITHING and feeling their way across the wall. Getting closer and closer to Finnegan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finnegan's eyes go to his pulse-rifle close to Trillian's feet. He motions for her to push it toward him. But, frozen in fear, she can only watch the slithering horror before her. Tongue-like, the Feelers lick their way across the oily wall. FINNEGAN DUCKS as they squirm over his head. Then he BRUSHES against some dirt, making a SCRAPING SOUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Feeler quickly drops down and touches Finnegan's arm. He leaps to his feet. So does Trillian. She grabs the rifle, turns and bolts off down the dark alley. Finnegan tries to run, but the Feelers hold him tight. Two more Feelers slap onto his arm. HE YELLS.

Finnegan drops to his knees. Grabbing his arm, in pain. The tentacle recovers and starts coming toward him again. Trillian grabs him, and with all her strength, jerks him to his feet, and starts to drag him backward. The tentacle coils, ready to strike. Just before it does so, Finnegan grabs the rifle with his one good arm, flips the safety, and fires, blasting the tentacle to pieces.

He struggles WILDLY. Then starts to freeze up as the tentacles wrap around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finnegan and Trillian race across the floor as the Captain is slowly sucked deeper into the spider web; his face and body bady constricting, paralyzed. His VOICE is CHOKED OFF.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hanover, Chin, Mamooli and Pantucci burst out of another alleyway. Finnegan and Trillian reach the Captain just as his FACE is SUCKED into the gelatinous web. They skid to a stop. Everybody piles up. Eyes wide. Watching as the Captain's body is pulled deeper into the dark web. Tentacles enveloping him.

:SC: BALLAST PASSAGEWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In SLOW-MO, Finnegan and the others creep down a darkened, pipe-lined passageway. Guns out front. Sight beams sweeping the path ahead. Eyes wide open. Sweat sliding down their faces. Breath coming in short nervous bursts. Hearts pounding out of chests.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ominous MUSICAL SCORE adds to the tension.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the EMERGENCY LIGHTING KICKS ON. A creepy-looking reddish-blue glow is cast throughout the ship. Finnegan continues on. Followed by the others. All sweating hard. Eyes nervously shifting. Fear thick in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOOKING DOWN THROUGH A METAL GATE, we SEE Finnegan, Trillian and the others passing below. Then suddenly, in the dark foreground -- SOMETHING WET WRIGGLES across the gate. They come to a door. Finnegan tries the handle. No go. Finnegan turns to Canton, and mimes for keys. Canton shakes his head. He has none.

Trillian moves up to Finnegan. She reaches into her hair, and pulls out her trusty lockpick. As he watches, somewhat mystified, she inserts the pin, tickles the lock a few times, and depresses the handle. Click! The door opens. Finnegan looks at her curiously, but with respect.

They ENTER the rear ballast section, where the walls are indeed far apart, half of which is now a small POND. Obviously flooded. The only way out of this room is down some STEPS which VANISH beneath the seawater, or through a single violently twisted HATCH DOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finnegan tries to push the hatch. It will not give.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mamooli and Chin join him, adding their considerable muscle to the task. The hatch holds tight. Finnegan turns to Canton, who stands slumped against a railing. He does not look well at all.

Finnegan SWIMS down to the floor of the ballast. Then into a passageway lined with black pipes. Pantucci right behind him. STRANGE NOISES REVERBERATE through the MURKY waters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREAKS and MOANS. Spooky shit. Both men are wide-eyed as they swim. Weaving their way through a maze of pipes and ducts. The THINGS could come out of almost anywhere. Bubbles drift up from the darkness below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MUSIC IS TENSE...VERY VERY TENSE. Pantucci falls behind. He swims around a curve and right into a SEVERED HUMAN ARM! AIR BUBBLES BLAST out of his mouth as he SCREAMS. The fingers on the dead hand seem to reach out for him. He fights his way past and swims off in a panic.

The three men open up with their pulse rifles. The CREATURE gets RIPPED TO SHREDS. Red and blue INK-BLOOD SPLATTERS everywhere. But onward it comes. Down the gangway.

The creature keeps coming. The mercs keep firing. Then without warning Hanover drops his rifle and dives into the water, disappearing beneath the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trillian is astounded. She throws down her pistol, picks up the pulse rifle, and slams on the trigger. The recoil of the rifle throws her into the water. When she surfaces, she sees Chin and Mamooli, firing as they retreat to the water's edge. Still holding her rifle, she dives.

Trillian swims down a violently SHAKING PASSAGEWAY. Eyes wide. Filled with fear. All around, DEBRIS DROPS through the water. Primordial SOUNDS REVERBERATE off the walls. Lots of BUBBLING and GURGLING -- THEN SOMETHING LUNGES OUT!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRILLIAN OPENS UP. FIRING wildly. The water fills with FIRE and BUBBLES. Trillian looks around. Scared shitless. The bubbles clear just in time for her to see -- Chin, mouth open, eyes wide, screaming in agony, being ripped past her. She tries to fire her rifle. Too late. Trillian watches as Chin VANISHES down the shaft in a CLOUD OF BUBBLES.

Trillian can only nod, and gasp for breath. Canton and Hanover catch their breath, PANTING AWAY, waterlogged. Hanover reaches over to retrieve the rifle in Trillian's hand. Trillian points the barrel at him, and hits the safety.

Finnegan moves on. The others follow. Guns out front. TENSE. They round a huge metal pillar and come face-to-face with a soul-wrenching nightmare. The CREATURES' NEST -- OR STOMACH.

Across a small portion of the ship's midsection, is a huge GELATINOUS WOMB. Imagine a massive thick wall of clear-yellow JELL-O, with hundreds of BLUE VEINS running through it. If it weren't all so horrific, it would be considered beautiful. Inside the womb, A DOZEN HUMANS, passengers, float around in some kind of twisted embryonic state, the living dead. They all seem to be breathing the gelatin. Several TENTACLES WRIGGLE through the stuff; which divides and re forms in some sort of strange mitosis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finnegan and the others look at the passengers, horrified. But even more horrifying is that the people can look back at them. Many start to reach out, seemingly in slow motion as their hands ooze through the thick gelatin. Trillian looks sick, trembles in fear.

In the womb, a Tentacle suddenly approaches a sexy young LADY. The Lady tries to back-pedal away, but because of the gelatin, it's like one of those nightmares where you can only move in slow motion.

A giant mutated protoplasm. Jutting up from a breach in the floor. The trunk of the Creature, the part where all the Tentacles come from, is below the next deck.

JERKS him into the air. His pulse-rifle goes flying. Finnegan is being dragged toward the hole into the floor, and the death that awaits him. He struggles to free himself as the hole looms closer, closer. He is about to disappear down the hole of no return, when his hand comes up with his knife. He slashes the tentacle in two, scrambles up and heads for an open door. As he reaches the door, a tentacle rises up in front of him. Huge. Blocking his way. It's maw opens wide. A terrifying sight of jaws and teeth and death. About to devour him. As it strikes forward, Finnegan draws his shotgun, and blasts the vile thing to smithereens. He bolts through the door, several Tentacles already after him.

Finnegan bears down on the handlebars of the jet ski. Pedal to the metal. Looking straight ahead. Trillian holds on for dead life. Suddenly, a WAVE EXPLODES in front of the jet ski. Finnegan cranks the handlebars. The JET SKI SLEWS SIDEWAYS. The Saipan starts to arc around. The WARHEAD gleams in the MOONLIGHT. Dripping water. Finnegan HAULS ASS away from the Fuji Maru. ENGINE ROARING. Throwing water. Another WAVE EXPLODES. A tentacle rears up. Right in front of the jet ski. Finnegan and Trillian lean hard. The JET SKI SKIDS sideways across the water.

Trillian can't hold on. Flips off the back. Skips across the water. Finnegan ROARS away. A tentacle hard on his ass. Trillian pops to the surface. Treads water. Panicked. Watches Finnegan and the jet ski leaving her behind. Finnegan looks back at Trillian. Bobbing in the water. The he looks at the Saipan. Continuing its arc. Its deadly payload racing for the Fuji Maru. Finnegan CRANKS the HANDLEBARS. SMASHES through a wave and heads for Trillian. Trillian sees him and swims hard. The SAIPAN ROARS straight at the Fuji Maru. The warhead perfectly positioned to strike its hull. Only fifty meters away. Now forty. Now thirty-five.

Finnegan cuts the motor of the jet ski. Slides up next to Trillian. Grabs her by her arm. Rips her out of the water. Throws her onto the back of the jet ski.

Twenty-five meters away from hitting the Fuji Maru. No twenty meters away. Now fifteen.

Finnegan pops to the surface. Looks around. Can't find Trillian. He DIVES under the water. His POV: Tentacles converging on him from the murky depths. The "retrieve" feature that's on all jet skis forces it back around towards where Finnegan and Trillian fell off. Finnegan BURST to the surface. Holding Trillian. She looks nearly lifeless. The jet ski heads right at them. Finnegan swims for it. Dragging Trillian. As tentacles converge from all sides.

The JET SKI is suddenly SUCKED under the water! Swallowed whole. Finnegan quickly reverses. Backstrokes like mad. The WARHEAD SLICES through the water. Now only ten meters away from hitting the Fuji Maru.

FIRE FILLS the night sky. The TOP DECK of the Fuji Maru CARTWHEELS across the waves. The Tentacle above Finnegan drops like lead. And just lies there. Quivering. Another EXPLOSION. LIFTS the remains of the FUJI MARU out of the sea. Sends shock waves across the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blows Finnegan's hair back. He swims on. Towards the island. Pulling Trillian. The remains of the SAIPAN and the FUJI MARU SMOLDER and SINK. BUBBLES EXPLODE to the surface. A couple dozen small FIRES dot the waves. WATER SIZZLES and STEAMS. SMOKE drifts into the night sky. Debris coats the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOW DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: BEACH - SUNRISE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finnegan and Trillian crawl out of the water and up onto the beach of the island.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They collapse next to each other. Finnegan is exhausted. Trillian coughs up seawater. They both turn and look out to sea, and the rising sun. Trillian reaches into her bra, and pulls out the egg sized diamond. She holds it up. The sun refracts off it brilliantly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trillian looks at the diamond, looks around at the picture perfect island, the picture perfect sunset...and then she heaves it as far as she can into the sea. For the first time since they know each other there is nobody around. No people. No tentacles. And when they look at each other, something else comes to mind besides survival.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finnegan moves towards Trillian. Trillian moves towards Finnegan. Their lips move closer, closer...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then, down by their feet -- SOMETHING EXPLODES OUT OF THE WATER! Scares the shit out of them. The audience too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But it's just Pantucci. Looking waterlogged and shell- shocked. Coughing up half the sea. Finnegan and Trillian help him to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<PANTUCCI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was it the water in my eyes or were you guys about to...

</PANTUCCI>
<FINNEGAN>

	Joey...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINNEGAN>
<PANTUCCI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because it's cool, you know, I can always take a walk or something down the beach...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANTUCCI>
<FINNEGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joey...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINNEGAN>
<PANTUCCI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or I could go for a swim...although, I gotta tell you...if I never get in the water again...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANTUCCI>
<BOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joey!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOTH>
<PANTUCCI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK...OK...you don't have to beg me ...I'll stick around...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANTUCCI>
<DIRECTION>
And then they head the most gut-wrenching, spine-tingling, teeth- shattering ROAR ever. Pure primeval. Like no sound or animal or thing we've ever hear beofre. Coming from DEEP WITHIN THE ISLAND.
</DIRECTION>
<PANTUCCI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or maybe not...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PANTUCCI>
<DIRECTION>
Finnegan, Trillian, and Pantucci slowly turn and look INLAND. We BEGIN TO PULL BACK as they all stand up. MORE STRANGE NOISES ARE HEARD. FROM MULTIPLE UNKNOWN SPECIES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE KEEP PULLING BACK. REVEALING more of this creepy-looking island. And leaving our three heroes stranded on the beach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE KEEP PULLING BACK. REVEALING pieces of the smoldering ship. Nearly the whole island is VISIBLE now. Dark jungles. Craggy mountains. Maybe the scariest-looking place on earth.
</DIRECTION>
<FINNEGAN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What now...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FINNEGAN>
<DIRECTION>
The "THING" ROARS again. It's hellacious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND WE CUT TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
