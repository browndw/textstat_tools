:SC: THE BOOK OF ELI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A civilization is destroyed only when its gods are destroyed. Emil Cioran
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. FOREST - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bare as all hell. The trees stripped of their bark and white like ghosts. Some torn violently from their roots and felled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STARK GRAY SUNLIGHT shafts between the trees, clouded by a creeping fog that obscures the true color of everything. A LIGHT SNOW flutters. The world monochrome, lifeless and cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CAT prowls across the dead earth. Barely recognizable as the domestic breed it might once have been. Its fur mangy and rank, body rib-thin from starvation. Entirely feral.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It moves slowly, cautiously. Sniffing the air, scanning the forest, alert. Trusting nothing of its surroundings. It paces across a leaf-strewn clearing, closing stealthily on:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DEAD MAN, splayed face-down in the earth. His feet bare. Face frozen in a grim death mask. A GAPING GUNSHOT WOUND in his head, the dried blood caked around it matting his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the cat moves closer, approaching warily:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. FROM ACROSS THE CLEARING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
About thirty yards away. Someone is watching. Waiting. SLOW, DEEP BREATHS, heard through a GASMASK RESPIRATOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON A PAIR OF INDUSTRIAL GOGGLES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MIRRORED LENSES reflecting the forest clearing, locked onto the cat. The slow, metered breathing continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAT slows, but continues pacing toward the corpse. More cautious than ever. It inches forward, sniffing at the body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE WATCHER. Crouched behind the mangled stump of a felled tree. Concealed beneath a camouflaging mesh of leaves, twigs and bracken. A "ghillie suit" of the kind used by snipers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAT sniffs at the dead man's hand, frozen by death in a grotesquely contorted claw. The animal still unsure. Looks around again, checking its surroundings for predators.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WATCHER moves almost imperceptibly. The leaves covering him rustle ever so slightly as we hear - just barely - the familiar creaking sound of a BOW STRING BEING DRAWN TAUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAT hears it. Looks up, alert. Staring right at the watcher, but he is too well camouflaged to be seen. An interminable, tense BEAT - is the prey going to flee?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, the cat turns its attention back to the carcass, nibbling gingerly at the flesh of the man's fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WATCHER looses the arrow. It sails across the clearing and SKEWERS THE CAT clean through. It drops to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WATCHER STANDS, shaking off the ghillie suit, revealing him to us for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wears a weather-beaten knee-length duster. Hooded sweater with more layers beneath that. Torn pants and scuffed work boots. Everything filthy and battered from years of wear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Along with the goggles, his face remains obscured by a DISPOSABLE PAPER DUST MASK and a CRUDELY-FASHIONED FUR HAT with dangling ear flaps that may once itself have been a cat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Around his neck he wears a silver SAINT CHRISTOPHER PENDANT hanging from a frayed twine cord.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His name is ELI.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shoulders the bow and walks across the clearing. Crouches beside the dead cat and pulls out the arrow. Wipes the blood from the shaft, then reaches down to collect the body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the cat SCREECHES AND FLAILS WILDLY! Eli recoils, falling backward, stunned, as the cat - MORTALLY WOUNDED BUT FIGHTING TO THE DEATH - bites and claws desperately at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli struggles violently with the cat, wrestling it to the ground and grabbing up a HUNK OF FALLEN BRANCH. He holds the writhing animal down and CLUBS IT until it lays still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits back, breathing harder than the dustmask will allow. He yanks it down, revealing the dirty, unshaven face beneath. Impossible to tell his age, but certainly not a young man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment he just sits there. Then bundles up the dead cat and returns to the mangled tree stump. Folds away his ghillie suit into a nearby RUCKSACK which he hauls up onto his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A canteen dangles from the backpack, a SHOTGUN strapped to its side. Eli reaches down for his final possession - an old SAMURAI SWORD in a scabbard which he slings across his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gazes up at the sky. A snowflake drifts down and lands on his cheek. He reaches up and brushes it away, leaving a BLACK SMEAR on his face. Not snow after all, but some kind of ASH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli emerges from the treeline onto the cracked and ruptured asphalt. Lined by more of those ghostly, stripped-bare trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sniffs the air, breathing it in. Checks the road in both directions. Deserted. A few yards away is the rusted, burned- out chassis of a CAR. He heads toward it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car rests half on the road, half in the adjacent ditch. Stripped of its tires and engine. In the driver's seat is a MUMMIFIED BODY. A BULLET HOLE piercing its forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli regards the body dispassionately. Tries the door handle but it's jammed. He yanks on it harder and eventually wrenches it open. He leans in and checks the man's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're bare. No shoes or socks. Eli curses under his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leaves the car behind and heads on down the road. As he walks away, we see that the sole of one of his boots has worn loose, held in place now only by a rubber band.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli continues down the road. He ambles along slowly, a man in no hurry. A man who has been walking a long time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The road has since emerged from the forest. Passing now through a wasteland of dead scrub brush and urban junk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun beats down from directly overhead. The sky has no color to it, paper-white. The unfiltered sun's stark light leaves everything seeming bleached-out, over-exposed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRANE UP as Eli walks on. On the horizon is the silhouette of a CITY. Or what was once a city. Columns of BLACK SMOKE rise from within, casting a deathly pall over the skyline. BURNED AND BROKEN SKYSCRAPERS jut out like tombstones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli reaches a fork in the road and stops. The road he's on appears to wind off in the direction of the ruined city on the horizon. The other fork continues on into the wasteland.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a brief pause, Eli changes direction and heads off down the other fork, away from the city.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ABANDONED TOWN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Little more than a main street lined with storefronts. Eli walks steadily along, side-stepping rubble and debris. Ignoring the petrified corpses lying in the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He passes by abandoned stores, every one picked clean. Empty shelves, smashed windows. Looted and burned. He doesn't even look inside, knowing already that he will find nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Until he comes to a store that does cause him to stop. An old- fashioned sign squeaks on rusted hinges in the breeze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ED'S SHOES - GENTLEMEN'S AND LADIES' FOOTWEAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He steps into the doorway and pushes open the door. It swings open on its one remaining hinge before splintering away from the frame and crashing to the floor in a cloud of dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SHOE STORE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli steps inside. Like all the others, the store has been cleaned out. Shoe racks and empty boxes strewn over the floor. The whole place reeking of dead, musty air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli looks around, just to be sure. Drags his sheathed sword idly along the empty racks as he checks them. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he turns back for the door, his foot nudges against a shoe box. It's not empty. He crouches down, flips the lid off hopefully... and pulls out a LADY'S HIGH-HEELED SHOE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He strokes the shoe leather with his hand. Shakes his head grimly, then tosses the shoe back into the box and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the outskirts of town. In disrepair - peeling paint, broken windows, damp-stained walls - but habitable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli stands in the front yard, surrounded by brownish, overgrown weeds. Thinking it over. Turns to face the setting sun. It will be dark soon. He turns back toward the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front door is sent CRASHING OPEN with a hard kick, revealing Eli silhouetted in the fading sunlight. The shotgun unhitched from his pack and held ready. He moves inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another dead place. Flies buzzing in the still, dank air. Everything covered in a thick layer of dust but otherwise largely preserved. An eerie snapshot of a world long gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Every cupboard empty. Eli checks each one, poking around in the dark corners with his sword, but finds nothing but dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the freezer, checks inside. Empty save for a small ICEBOX. The lid stuck fast with mildew and gunk. Eli digs at it with his grimy fingernails and manages to pry it open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside are the wizened, petrified remains of a HUMAN HAND. Floating in slimy, discolored water. The smell vile and thick enough to make Eli retch. He quickly jams the lid back on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wooden bedframe stripped clean. The dresser drawers have been emptied and lie strewn across the floor. Eli moves toward a large walk-in closet and opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No clothes inside - just the near-fossilized corpse of a MAN HANGING BY A NOOSE. Twisting gently back and forth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unfazed, Eli crouches down and checks the man's feet. An old pair of Converse All-Stars hang limp from the man's skeletal ankles. Eli calmly sets about unlacing them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He checks the size; they're a fit. He upturns each shoe and shakes the old flakes of mummified flesh from them. Discards his ruined boots and puts on the sneakers, laces them up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks around, pacing up and down, getting a feel for the new shoes. They feel good. For the first time, he smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli sits in the corner, roasting the carcass of the dead cat over a small CAMPFIRE. He cleans the animal's pelts as he watches it cook. Pokes at the meat with a pen-knife, checking it for done-ness. It appears ready to eat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He clasps his hands together in prayer.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dear Lord, thank you for your generosity in providing us today with this bountiful feast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
He speaks QUIETLY, his voice barely above a whisper. Even so, we catch the accent - a RASPY, OLD-WORLD MIDWEST DRAWL, like John Wayne or some other long-forgotten western icon.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you for the many gifts that you have given me. Thank you for your protection and your guidance. Thank you for bringing me this far. I know my long journey's end is near. I ask now only for the strength and the courage to complete the task that you in your infinite wisdom saw fit to bestow upon me over all men. I won't let you down. Amen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
He signs a cross over himself, then uses the knife to saw off a chunk of meat. Takes a bite, savoring the taste with great relish. To him, it's grade-A filet mignon.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. You hungry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
It appears as though he is talking to himself... until a RAT emerges from his coat pocket, whiskers twitching keenly. Eli offers it some meat. The rat gnaws enthusiastically at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUNDOWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The last of the waning sunlight shafts through the bedroom's broken window. Eli rummages through his backpack, pulls out a SMALL PACKAGE wrapped in cloth and tied fast with string.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits back in his corner and carefully unwraps it. It's an OLD LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. The binding cracked and pages dog- eared, thumbed through a thousand times and more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli gazes lovingly at it. Lets his fingers play across the beat-up old leather cover. A cherished thing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He begins to read, half-hidden in the shadows of the fading sunlight. Silently mouthing the words as he reads them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MANY PAGES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli closes the book and parcels it back up as before. Replaces it in his pack, then reaches in for something else.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CAR BATTERY. Old and streaked with acid stains. Attached to a tangled bunch of ELECTRICAL WIRING and JUMPER CABLES. Eli reaches into his pocket and produces:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN IPOD. Badly beat-up, the case pretty much held together with duct tape. But functional. Eli attaches the battery cable to the iPod and places the headphones in his ears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music plays. Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20 in D Minor. Eli rests back against the wall and pushes the volume way up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MUSIC SWELLS. Eli's fingers dance and swoop in the air, as though conducting an orchestra, as he is transported by the music to another world, a world far from this one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sunlight shafts through the window. Eli sits slumped in the exact same position, headphones still in his ears. Asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rat scurries up Eli's chest and licks his face. Slowly, he wakes, realizing he fell asleep with his music still on. Checks the battery. It's dead, drained overnight. He frowns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets to his feet, moves to the window and checks outside. All seems quiet. He loads up his backpack and weapons.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
The rat scurries up his leg, onto his duster and disappears into the breast pocket. Eli turns and moves out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gate squeaks shut behind Eli as he exits the front yard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He breathes in the air, turns to feel the warm morning sun on his face. Then turns away from it and walks on down the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The landscape barren and featureless, road lined with dead trees. Eli walks along the warped and broken asphalt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The road is strewn with burned-out cars and debris from a world long dead. A warped metal sign by the side of the road reads: LITTER REMOVAL NEXT TWO MILES BY: "CIRCUIT CITY".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead is a HUNCHED FIGURE by the side of the road. Eli arrives to see that it's a YOUNG WOMAN. Bone-thin, dressed in filthy rags. Skin plagued by an unpleasant rash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SHOPPING CART she was pushing has overturned into a roadside ditch, spilling its contents. Blankets, tins of food, old clothes. She's on her knees trying to gather it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up as she sees Eli approaching. Instantly cowers from him, raising her hands to protect herself. Terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Please don't hurt me. Here, take anything you want. You want some food? Take it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
She offers him a can of pet food with a trembling hand. Eli stands there looking at her. His expression impossible to read behind the mirrored goggles.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going to hurt you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what the last guys said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Eli bends down and picks up a couple of the cart's spilled contents. Steps forward and offers them to her.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
She blinks. Unsure. Cautiously she reaches out and takes it.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you help me? The wheel came off. I can't fix it. Maybe if I could get it out of the ditch. But I can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Eli looks at the cart. It has come to rest in the ditch just inches from a THICK BRACKEN HEDGEROW that lines the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks again at the girl. Her faded blouse is unbuttoned, revealing a little cleavage. Her skirt torn along the leg, showing more than a little thigh. Almost deliberate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sniffs the air. Watches the hedgerow warily. Just like the cat he hunted, his senses heightened and on alert.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the hedge, THREE ROADSIDE BANDITS are crouched, waiting to pounce. Each armed with a crude blunt weapon. They exchange anxious looks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELI sniffs the air again - then backs away from the girl.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One good thing about no soap any more. You can smell the road agents a mile off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
The girl's face falls as Eli backs up. The three bandits EMERGE FROM THE HEDGEROW, brandishing their weapons. A couple of them wear old sunglasses and goggles similar to Eli's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BANDIT LEADER grabs the girl by a fistful of hair as he passes, yanking her painfully to her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<BANDIT_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dumb bitch. What did we tell you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes her away, she crumples to the road in a heap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli backs away, but TWO MORE ARMED BANDITS drop from hiding in the trees behind, cutting off his escape, surrounding him.
</DIRECTION>
<BANDIT_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you got there in the pack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT_LEADER>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<BANDIT_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that's what they all say. How about you take it off real slow and tip it out so's we can take a look?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
BANDIT #2 notices the shotgun strapped to the pack.
</DIRECTION>
<BANDIT_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's got a gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT_2>
<BANDIT_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, it ain't loaded. They never are. Ain't that right, old man?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open the fucking pack or die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT_LEADER>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
The bandit leader steps forward aggressively. Now within striking distance of Eli. He grins, teeth filthy and rotten.
</DIRECTION>
<BANDIT_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want us to do it for you? We can get it off real easy after we've hacked your fucking arms off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
Eli remains perfectly calm. And though he speaks with a soft, even tone, there is something formidable about his voice.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's real important you boys listen to me and understand. The man I work for, you do not want to cross him. See, I'm under his protection. You stand in my way, you stand in his. And he will cut you down with a righteous fury - through me. For I am his faithful instrument.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
BEAT. The bandit leader looks at Eli incredulously... and then LAUGHS. The other bandits laugh along nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<BANDIT_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are you, some kinda preacher?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT_LEADER>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<BANDIT_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I got news for you, preacher man. Whatever kinda God you reckon yourself to be working for, he left these parts a long time ago. He ain't here to protect your ass. Now take off the pack and set it on the ground.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
Eli doesn't move, doesn't say a word. The bandit leader takes another step forward and shoves him in the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<BANDIT_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fucking listening to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT_LEADER>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hear you. You lay that hand on me again and you will not get it back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
The other bandits exchange nervous looks. This is not how it's supposed to go.
</DIRECTION>
<BANDIT_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, I had just about enough of this shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
He lunges forward, grabs the shoulder strap of Eli's pack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
If you blinked, you missed it. But somehow Eli has now drawn his sword. A RIVULET OF BLOOD snakes down along the blade and drips onto the asphalt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bandit leader's hand is still gripped firmly around Eli's shoulder strap. But it's no longer connected to his arm. The SEVERED HAND hangs there from the strap, dripping blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bandit leader staggers backward and raises the bloody stump where his hand once was. Looks at it in shock and horror.
</DIRECTION>
<BANDIT_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What... you just... he just cut my fucking hand off! My fucking hand!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
Eli pries the hand loose from the strap and tosses it onto the road as bandit leader's legs give out and he slumps to the asphalt. His eyes dart around, as though confused.
</DIRECTION>
<BANDIT_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you standin' around for? Kiss him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT_LEADER>
<BANDIT_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's he talkin' about, kiss him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT_3>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's in shock. He means "kill him".
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
A tense BEAT. And then the four remaining bandits ATTACK ELI ALL AT ONCE, weapons flailing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli flourishes the sword. A BLUR, TOO FAST TO FOLLOW. But it's clear he is possessed of an inhuman level of skill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is over in moments. The four bandits LAY SLAIN IN THE ROAD, blood pooling out onto the asphalt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bandit leader crawls toward his severed hand, a few yards away. Eli steps in and kicks it out of his reach.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you you wouldn't be getting that back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
Bandit leader looks up to see the figure of Eli bearing down on him, silhouetted ominously against the sun. He looks for a moment like an avenging angel, something not of this world.
</DIRECTION>
<BANDIT_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT_LEADER>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Eli.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
And with that, Eli runs him through with his sword.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to see the young woman slumped in the road, sobbing. She cowers again as he approaches, certain that she is next.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He WALKS PAST HER. Sheathes his sword, then pulls out the shopping cart from the ditch and rights it. The woman watches incredulously as he gathers up her supplies into the cart.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it and go on your way. And don't fall in with men like these again. No good can come.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him, puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you doing this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Eli says nothing. Walks back to the slain bandits, crouches beside them and begins searching their bodies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a scarf from around the neck of one. Finds a Zippo lighter on another, checks that it works and pockets it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The five bodies are lined neatly in the ditch, half-covered with dirt. The best burial they are going to get.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli stands before them, head bowed in prayer. He speaks quietly and quickly, a speech he has given many times.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, the father of mercies, through the death and resurrection of his son has reconciled the world to himself and sent the holy spirit among us for the forgiveness of sins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
The young woman stands a few yards away, watching him, transfixed. She has never seen anyone like him.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Through the ministry of the church may he give you pardon and peace, and I absolve you from your sins in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy spirit. Amen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and walks away down the road, passing the woman.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. You're... a good man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are no good men on the road.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	West.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can... can I come with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't even turn back to look at her.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
He walks on, into the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Straddling the desert like a giant, crumbling monument to a long-dead civilization. Eli steadily climbs his way up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes to an abrupt stop as we realize suddenly that the overpass has COLLAPSED at mid-point. RUSTED IRON RODS jut out from where the roadway has been severed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli just stands there at the edge for a moment, feeling the wind whip around him, his coat fluttering in the breeze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The overpass's collapsed section is now just a MOUNTAINOUS PILE OF RUBBLE that leads down to the road below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli steps onto the rubble. About to make his way down when he FREEZES. He hears something. The faintest of sounds. He takes cover, peering down at the road beneath the overpass to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO PEOPLE walking together on the road. We see everything from ELI'S P.O.V. - too far to make out much detail, but apparently it is a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man pushes along an OLD WHEELBARROW covered by a tarp as the woman, seemingly his wife, walks alongside. The barrow's rusted wheel gives out a plaintive, rhythmic SQUEAK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli ducks down again as he hears something else. This time much louder. The menacing growl of MOTORCYCLE ENGINES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOUR BIKES IN TOTAL. Riding out of the horizon, closing in on the couple. They see the bikes coming and panic. Try desperately to steer the barrow off the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bikes screech to a halt and the FOUR RIDERS dismount. Brandishing a variety of weapons. The couple make a run for it but they're quickly chased down and tackled to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman SCREAMS and struggles helplessly as the bikers swarm over the man like a pack of predatory animals.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman is pulled to the ground and the clothes stripped from her. Eli turns away. He knows what comes next.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli listens as the woman screams and screams. He reaches for his shotgun... hesitates... then withdraws his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It ain't your concern. Stay on the path. It ain't your concern. Stay on the path.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
Eli repeats it like a mantra. He clearly wants to intervene, but will not permit himself to. Instead, he simply sits and waits grimly as the woman continues to scream for help. And then finally, suddenly, is silenced.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Down below, the bodies of the man and woman lay dead and bloodied in the dirt. The bikers tear the tarp from the wheelbarrow, spilling its contents onto the asphalt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They ferret through the items, scavenging a few items - we don't see what - and stuffing them into an old cloth satchel. They leave the rest strewn in the road and ride off in the direction they came, dust pluming in their wake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli waits until the sound of the motorcycles has receded into the far distance before emerging from his hiding place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ROAD BENEATH OVERPASS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli crouches on one knee before the murdered couple. He signs a cross over their ravaged bodies as he mutters a prayer under his breath. Then stands and continues on down the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ROAD FORK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More desolate wasteland as far as the eye can see. The road forks again here. Eli arrives at the junction and stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The road Eli is on leads further into the west. The other fork heads toward a SMALL TOWN just visible on the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HAND-PAINTED SIGN has been driven into the dirt nearby. No words, just a series of CRUDE PICTOGRAMS. A BED. A PLATE OF FOOD. A WATER FAUCET. AN ARROW points toward the town.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli pauses, thinking it over. Retrieves the iPod from his pocket. Clicks the button, but no response. He sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and heads down the other fork, toward town.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DESERT TOWN - OUTSKIRTS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A primitive, sprawling village of tents and barn-like structures. Built from corrugated iron, rotted wood, molded plastic, tarpaulin - materials scavenged from the old world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HUDDLED RESIDENTS are dressed in little more than rags, many wearing goggles like Eli's to shield their eyes from the sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli stands at the edge of town. Reluctant to enter, but he braces himself and walks on in. And as he rounds a corner, entering the center of town, an astonishing sight:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The broad thoroughfare now all that remains of whatever town once stood here. Many of the old storefronts still largely intact but patched up with salvaged materials. The asphalt street warped and cracked, parking meters bent and smashed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a lot like the abandoned town Eli passed through earlier, except VERY MUCH ALIVE - BUSTLING WITH TOWNSFOLK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's at once a familiar and also a disturbing sight - like an old Norman Rockwell painting of classic small-town America, but filtered through the devastating eye of an apocalypse. An unsettling juxtaposition of the old world and the new.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The centerpiece of the town is a GRAND THEATER at the head of the main street. THE PALLADIUM. Like the rest of the town, badly damaged and shoddily fixed-up. But still standing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli walks down the street and approaches a BLACKSMITH, hammering out a metal plate over an anvil outside his store.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got an engineer or a fuelman around here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
The blacksmith doesn't look up from his work but motions toward a storefront at the far end of the street.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
Eli heads down the street. Stopping when he comes across a STATUE erected in the center of the road. A TALL MAN crudely fashioned in clay. One hand placed paternally on the head of a SMALL CHILD, the other outstretched toward the sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he observes the statue, Eli notices that passing residents take a moment to PAUSE AND GENUFLECT before it. Worshipping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Curious, Eli reaches up and runs his hand over the statue's face. Then hears SHUFFLING FEET behind him and turns as a PARADE OF EMACIATED MEN AND WOMEN trudges past. Roped together at the waist, each man leading the one behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heads shaved, thin from malnutrition. And each one BLIND. They gaze at the ground with pale, dead eyes. They carry picks, shovels and other tools - a sightless CHAIN GANG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli watches as the pathetic parade shuffles past, herded like cattle by a brutish CHAIN GANG BOSS who swats at them with a stick to keep them moving and indicate direction.
</DIRECTION>
<CHAIN_GANG_BOSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, move it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAIN_GANG_BOSS>
<DIRECTION>
The gang boss glares at Eli as he passes by. Eli doesn't return the look, just continues crossing the street as the blind are herded away. Headed toward a wooden building with a pictogram of a LIGHTNING BOLT suspended above the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whatever this place once was, it's now a kind of POST- APOCALYPTIC RADIO SHACK. Shelves display a variety of goods. Engine parts. Old electrical wiring. Small appliances.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An old ELECTRIC GENERATOR rumbles noisily, powering strings of multi-colored CHRISTMAS LIGHTS that hang all around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the main counter a convoluted Rube Goldberg-esque STILL is running. An ENGINEER in a leather apron pours the remnants of a can of motor oil into the still's funnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Attached to the still is an old MOTORCYCLE MIRROR. In its reflection the engineer sees Eli checking out the store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without turning around, he reaches surreptitiously behind the counter for something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli turns toward the counter - to find the engineer training a PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUN right at him.
</DIRECTION>

He nods toward the shotgun visible on Eli's backpack.
</DIRECTION>
<ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You come in here to rip me off?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENGINEER>
<DIRECTION>
The engineer's hands tremble, his finger tight on the trigger. This man needs to be talked down carefully.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I'll set it down. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>

Eli nods. Unhitches the pack and sets it down, steps away.
</DIRECTION>
<ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You carry a gun in the outland, you don't bring one into town less you live there. Don't you know that?

<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, I forgot. I've been on the road a long time.

This seems to make the engineer more suspicious of Eli.

The engineer jerks the shotgun at Eli nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said show me your fucking hand!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENGINEER>
<DIRECTION>
Eli raises his hand and holds it outstretched, palm faced downward. The engineer watches it closely for any sign of ticks or tremors, but Eli's hand stays steady as a rock.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not one of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
The sight of the steady hand seems to reassure the engineer a little. Finally, he lowers the shotgun.
</DIRECTION>
<ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENGINEER>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just passing through. I need some help. I can pay.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ENGINEER>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to get something out of my pack. Okay?

<DIRECTION>
The engineer raises the shotgun nervously again.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, I know. Slowly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
The engineer watches him like a hawk as Eli opens up his pack and pulls out the car battery. When he sees it, he gasps.
</DIRECTION>
<ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENGINEER>
<DIRECTION>
Eli places it on the counter. The engineer looks it over with awe, like it's a priceless historical artifact.
</DIRECTION>
<ENGINEER>

Eli pulls the Zippo lighter from his pocket. The engineer picks it up, sparks the flint, watches the flame flicker.

:SC: INT. PALLADIUM - AUDITORIUM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This once grand theater have been largely gutted - seats torn out, fixtures and fittings stripped, curtains ripped from the stage. But still, there's a sense of grandeur to this place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking out over the stage, a ROYAL BOX - once the most prestigious seat in the house - has been converted into an OFFICE of sorts. Seats removed and replaced by an ORNATE MAHOGANY DESK facing inward, a CHANDELIER suspended above it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The whole set-up is gaudy and ostentatious - the work of someone who wants to project an aura of power and wealth, but has no taste whatsoever.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TALL MAN is seated in a battered leather armchair behind the desk, deeply involved in an OLD PAPERBACK BOOK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The book's cover is faded and partially torn away, the title still just visible: 7 HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man is OLDER than most we've seen. His skin weathered by the elements and by a long life's experience. One of the very few people we've seen in this world close to Eli's age - and unlike everyone else we've seen, he appears healthy and well- groomed. A rich mane of hair, full set of teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wears a tattered SUIT AND TIE. None of it matches, everything scavenged from different outfits and eras. But he looks almost civilized. Respectable. His name is CARNEGIE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up from his book at the sound of a POLITE COUGH O.S.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REDRIDGE stands before him. Tall, powerfully built.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
His accent is like caramel. A RICH, DEEP-SOUTH DRAWL.
</DIRECTION>
<REDRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Survey team just finished up their inspection. It ain't good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
Carnegie lowers his book. Concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How bad is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<REDRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pressure is down again, and going by the new rod they sank levels're lower than they've ever been.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
Carnegie stands. Thinking. This is bad news.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<REDRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hard to say. Six months, maybe. A little longer if we're careful. But we're already-
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDRIDGE>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Halve the rations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<REDRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We just halved `em last-
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDRIDGE>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So halve them again!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
BEAT. Carnegie stares Redridge down. Nobody but nobody questions his orders.
</DIRECTION>
<REDRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to have to say something. Folks were none too happy last time. Gonna be worse now, you can count on it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
Carnegie sighs, rubs his brow. He knows Redridge is right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LARGE CROWD OF TOWNSFOLK - several hundred strong - has assembled outside the Palladium theater. AN ARMED CREW OF CARNEGIE'S GOONS keeps watch over the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnegie stands on a BALCONY above the theater marquee. He treats the balcony like a pulpit, speaking through a MICROPHONE connected to an old PA SYSTEM that carries his words to the far reaches of the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you all to remember how far we've come together. And how far we still can go, if only we believe. When I brought us here to this oasis - this promised land - we knew there would be hardships. Knew there would be sacrifices. But we also knew that we were creating for ourselves a world where we could be safe from the horrors of the forsaken lands beyond our borders.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd listens intently, hanging on Carnegie's every word. He is an incredibly charismatic and persuasive speaker - his cultivated image and inspiring, confident delivery remind us of a TELEVISION EVANGELIST.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I want you all to remember above all that it is not the water with which we have been blessed that is the true lifeblood of this town... but faith.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
This sends a MURMUR OF DISCONTENT through the crowd. Many don't like where they suspect this may be going. Carnegie senses this and dials up his rhetoric - delivering it now with the fire-brand passion of an old-time baptist preacher.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is our faith that sustains us, brothers and sisters! Hallelujah!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd is divided. Many return the "Hallelujah" with varying levels of conviction. Others are not convinced. But Carnegie continues unabated, selling it harder than ever.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And mark me, the ultimate validation of that faith is coming! The sacred Word of Our Lord that formed the world before and will reform it once again is coming to this town to bring it succor, bring it nourishment, bring it new life! For the Almighty Himself has spoken unto me and promised it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Carnegie is such an impassioned and inspiring speaker it's almost impossible not to get caught up and swept away by his words. His apparently unshakable belief is infectious.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the meantime, He has asked us all to be patient. To walk the hard road of the faithful just a little longer. And to do that, we must give just a little more.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Water rations will be halved until further notice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
This sends a much broader ripple of discontent through the crowd - this news has not been received well at all. Some still "keep the faith" but many more are perturbed by this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnegie motions for the crowd to settle down.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand your frustration. The road to salvation is a difficult one - but what lies at the end of that road is a greater glory, beyond anything you can imagine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
A DISCONTENTED VILLAGER steps forward, pushing through the crowd and jabbing his finger angrily up at Carnegie.
</DIRECTION>
<DISCONTENTED_VILLAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've heard this all before! When are you going to-
	</DIALOGUE>
</DISCONTENTED_VILLAGER>
<DIRECTION>
Carnegie's goons quickly move in and efficiently SILENCE THE MAN, removing him from the crowd. Dissent is not tolerated here. Carnegie goes on speaking as if nothing had happened.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know each and every one of you will understand the necessity of this action. It was faith that built this town - and faith that will sustain it even through the dark times that may lie ahead. But it is always darkest before dawn - and the new dawn is coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May God go with you all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Carnegie steps back inside, leaving the crowd to talk among themselves, clearly mixed about what they have heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the assembled townsfolk disperse, FOUR MOTORCYCLES roar into town and pull up outside the Palladium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the riders dismount, one detaches a CLOTH SATCHEL from his bike's cargo rack. The four riders head inside. They each have long, straggly hair and brutish expressions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We recognize them now as the BIKER BANDITS who killed the couple on the road under the freeway overpass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PALLADIUM - SECOND FLOOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnegie emerges into the second-floor hallway from the balcony, mopping his brow. Exhausted and stressed from his grand theatrical display, and from its mixed reception.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Redridge climbs the stairs to meet him.
</DIRECTION>
<REDRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One of the road crews just rolled into town.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Get them up here now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What was once a grand, gilded entrance foyer has, like the rest of the theater, been largely gutted. But it's still impressive - a spacious bar area with a grand staircase leading up to a second floor, entrance to balcony seats, etc. FADED OLD THEATER POSTERS still hang from the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place has been shabbily converted into a kind of SALOON. Old ripped-out theater seats arranged around tables. A FIREPLACE sputters dimly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MANGY TABBY CAT walks across the straw-laden floor. A dozen or so CUSTOMERS in the place, a mixed, rough-looking bunch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Redridge emerges from an upstairs room and nods to a group of his MEN who are holding the bikers at the foot of the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnegie checks his reflection in a CRACKED HAND MIRROR, licks his palm and slicks his hair back. He adjusts his tie as Redridge's men usher the bikers into his "office".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnegie wheels around and flashes a smile at them. Just as when he gave his balcony address, Carnegie is in performance mode - charismatic and slick like a campaigning politician.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen! It's truly a delight to see you again! I understand your latest excursion into the outland has been a profitable one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
The bikers exchange looks. They understood maybe half the words in that sentence. The lead biker - named HOG - speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<HOG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We did good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOG>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, let's see, shall we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Hog tips the satchel's contents out onto Carnegie's desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOKS. About a dozen different volumes of all shapes and sizes. Carnegie rifles excitedly through the collection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see various titles as he sorts through them. Treasure Island. The Da Vinci Code. A volume of encyclopedia. The Diary of Anne Frank. Tuesdays with Morrie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In amongst the books are a few MAGAZINES. An old issue of OPRAH magazine. A torn copy of SPORTS ILLUSTRATED...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...And a NEWSWEEK. The cover graphic illustrates OPPOSING NUCLEAR ARSENALS over a world globe. On one side the STARS AND STRIPES, on the other flags indicating a SINO-ISLAMIC ALLIANCE. The headline reads: "IS THERE NO TURNING BACK?"
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No. No. No. No.

As Carnegie rejects each book with growing disappointment and frustration, it's clear he's looking for a specific volume.

Carnegie's guards bristle, ready for a confrontation. Carnegie just smiles, always ready to smooth things over.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen, gentlemen. I urge you once again to take the long view here. When we find this book - and believe me, we will find it - we are going to build a new world. A world far greater, far more righteous than this one. And you and I are going to be perched right on top of it, looking down upon it, masters of all creation!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
As always, his carefully stage-managed rhetoric is delivered with the utmost conviction, every word dripping with passion and persuasion. He's a master salesman, a true huckster.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you know, I think you're absolutely right. That is worth more than a few glasses of liquor. A whole lot more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>

He steps forward and looks Hog right in the eye. His gaze like a laser beam, utterly disarming.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The book I want is out there somewhere, just waiting to be found. Once there were millions of copies - you only need to find one! Find it and bring it here. And I promise you, you will be rewarded beyond anything you can imagine.

</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
It's impossible not to be swayed by this guy. He's just so full of fiery passion and infectious belief, you almost want to reach into your pocket and hand over your wallet.

Carnegie ignores him. Stands, walks toward the door. Redridge sighs, gestures toward the books piled on Carnegie's desk.
</DIRECTION>
<REDRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Redridge stands by the marble fireplace, tossing the books into the fire. The flames flicker and leap around the books as their pages blacken and are consumed by the fire.

:SC: INT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli watches as the engineer charges the battery with the gas generator, which chugs noisily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He licks his lips, dry as sand. Unscrews his canteen to take a drink, but it's down to its last few drips.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this place across the street? They got any water?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got our own underground spring here. Only fresh water in a hundred miles - if's you can pay for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ENGINEER>
<DIRECTION>
Eli thinks a while longer. Then stands and stuffs his shotgun inside his pack, shoulders his gear and makes for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
Eli stops in the doorway and turns back to the engineer.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If that battery ain't here when I get back, I will use this gun on your kneecaps and I will put this building to the torch and I will watch it burn to the ground with you alive inside it. So help me God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
And with that he turns and leaves. The engineer gulps. Not a hint in Eli's voice that he didn't mean every word.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PALLADIUM - CARNEGIE'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This old second-floor DRESSING ROOM has been converted into a bedroom, simply furnished.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WOMAN stands in front of an old DRESSING ROOM MIRROR, the bulbs around the frame burned-out and broken. She washes her face in murky water in an old PORCELAIN BOWL on the dresser.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her name is CLAUDIA. Early 30s, pretty. She gazes into the mirror as she dries her hands, but it's so cracked and warped it's near impossible to see a reflection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and Carnegie enters. He still looks steamed. Claudia doesn't turn to look at him, keeps facing the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that you, honey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Carnegie says nothing. Just paces angrily up and down. Finally Claudia turns to face him.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More books came in from the road today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh? It's been a while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it'll be a while longer. Just another pile of useless junk. If we don't find the right one soon - if I can't give these people what they want to hear...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Carnegie trails off, the thought too awful to contemplate. Claudia adopts a sympathetic expression, supportive.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll find what you're looking for. It's out there somewhere. You just have to have faith.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
This seems to anger Carnegie. He wheels on her.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith? Is that what you think we're missing around here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
She detects the aggressive tone in his voice and goes quiet, head bowed. Carnegie moves toward her angrily.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My old man used to have faith. He had it in spades. My mother, too. You know where it got them? You know where it got me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
He's in her face now. Claudia avoids eye contact, submissive.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faith is for the weak. It's for them out there, the sheep. This world is what you can see and touch and taste. It's what you make it. All these years with me, you still don't have any grasp of that? What's wrong with you, woman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
He's shouting now, and she's trembling, afraid to speak.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Carnegie realizes he's frightened her. He softens.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Hey. You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
He lifts her chin up, wipes away a tear.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just get me all riled up with that kind of talk. It's not what I need from you right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(SMILES)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I need right now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his hands on her lustfully. It's clear she's not in the mood, but she halfheartedly responds anyway. More out of a sense of wifely duty than reciprocated passion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they kiss, Carnegie pushes her excitedly against the wall and feverishly begins unbuckling his pants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The original customers have now been joined by the four bikers, who sit at their own table drinking a clear and pungent moonshine-type liquor from a shared jar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli enters. All eyes are on him immediately, regarding him with guarded interest as he pulls up a stool at the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BARTENDER approaches, looks him up and down. Suspicious.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Outlander? Let me see-
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
Eli raises his hand as before. Holds it outstretched, steady.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'll it be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
Eli places the canteen on the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the good stuff. Gotta eat into my own ration to sell it - so I don't sell it cheap.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
Eli takes off his scarf and puts it on the bar. The bartender takes it and looks it over. Not particularly impressed.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That'll get you maybe half-way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
The bartender spies Eli's silver Saint Christopher pendant.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
Eli stuffs the pendant inside his shirt. No way that's for sale. Instead, he reaches into his coat and produces the fur pelts he skinned from the dead cat, lays them out on the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the best I got.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
The bartender takes a pelt and examines it. The mangy cat leaps up onto the bar and approaches. Sniffs at the pelts with suspicion and HISSES at Eli.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli shoos the cat off the bar with a wave of his hand. At the biker's table Hog watches this, not happy about this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Satisfied with the pelts, the bartender gathers them up along with the scarf, then turns away toward the back room.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Solara!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
A TEENAGE GIRL emerges from the back. No older than 16 or 17. Dressed in unflattering work clothes, face grimy, blonde hair tied back in a ponytail. But even through all this, it's clear she is a strikingly beautiful young woman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bartender takes Eli's canteen and hands it to Solara along with a RATION CARD he keeps around his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take this out back and get it filled.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
Solara takes the canteen, pausing for a moment to look Eli up and down. Unsure quite what to make of him, but intrigued. There's something about him she can't put her finger on...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't look back at her. She turns and exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Solara exits via the Palladium's STAGE DOOR and walks across the busy street to where TWO OF CARNEGIE'S ARMED MEN stand guard around an ENCLOSURE OF CHAIN-LINK FENCE TOPPED WITH RAZOR WIRE. TOWNSFOLK wait in line with bowls and buckets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the guards recognizes Solara and lets her cut to the front of the line. He punches two holes in her ration card and lets her inside the chain-link enclosure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside is an OLD RUSTED SPIGOT attached to a pipe emerging from the earth. Solara cranks hard on the handle - it takes a few pulls before the water comes, and then only at a weak trickle; it will take a while to fill the canteen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

<DIRECTION>
As Eli sits at the bar, a SHADOW comes into view and looms large over him. Hog is standing behind him, glaring, cutting a menacing figure in his armored cycle leathers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Solara senses trouble brewing and moves off, taking Eli's canteen away into the back room.
</DIRECTION>
<HOG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was my cat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOG>
<DIRECTION>
Eli doesn't turn. Just looks straight ahead. Impossible to read him behind those mirrored goggles. Utterly inscrutable.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine specimen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<HOG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw you push him off the bar.

</HOG>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't push him.

</ELI>
<HOG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You raised your hand at him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOG>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. It won't happen again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
The bartender looks at Hog nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, how about another drink, Hog?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<HOG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That cat's been comin' in here for nigh on two years. It got more right to be here than you. Who the fuck do you think you are?

<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>

Hog grabs him by the arm.
</DIRECTION>
<HOG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's too bad, `cause-
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOG>
<DIRECTION>
Blink. Suddenly Hog's head is pinned to the bar by nothing more than Eli's thumb. Pressed deep into a nerve cluster in his neck. Eli leans in close as Hog whimpers, paralyzed.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you. Murderer of innocent travelers on the road. You're going to spend eternity drowning in a lake of fire for the things that you've done. Did you know that?

The other bikers stand and approach, the OTHER CUSTOMERS following suit. Eli senses the trouble gathering behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You go on back to your table and I'll be on my way. All right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
It's all Hog can do to just barely nod his head. Eli releases his thumb. Hog staggers backward, gasping for breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli stands and makes toward the door, but the bikers and other patrons have moved to block his exit.

:SC: INT. PALLADIUM - CARNEGIE'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnegie has Claudia pinned against the wall, his pants bunched around his ankles, ass bared as he pounds away at her. Not making love. This is mechanical, loveless sex.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claudia stares vacantly over his shoulder into space as Carnegie thrusts into her again and again. Deeply uninterested, just waiting for it to be over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, we hear a CRASH O.S. Carnegie stops and listens.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you hear that? What was that?

Claudia sees an opening to get out of this.

<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What in the hell is going on?

</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls up his pants, grabbing a RIFLE propped by the door as he rushes out. Claudia just stands there for a moment, then reaches down and pulls up her panties.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She moves from the wall and makes her way across the room, feeling her way with her hands, gazing off into nothingness. Only now do we finally realize that she is BLIND.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Carnegie emerges from the bedroom onto the balcony. Looks down over the railing - and is stunned by what he sees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHAOS in the bar below. Eli cutting a one-man swath of mayhem through the dozen brawlers. Most already lie dead. TWO MORE MEN ATTACK Eli and are effortlessly felled by his sword.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnegie rushes hurriedly along the landing, banging loudly on the doors of the upstairs rooms.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get your asses out here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
ON ELI. Surrounded by the dead, only one man left standing. Hog. He backs away as Eli circles him like a predator. Sword held ready, the blade glistening with dark red blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOLARA re-emerges from the back room with Eli's refilled canteen. She stops and emits a horrified GASP when she sees the bloody carnage laid out in the bar before her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She watches, mortified, as Eli moves toward the helpless, terrified Hog, going in for the kill. Raising his sword...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Solara steps forward and CRIES OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLARA>
<DIRECTION>
Eli FREEZES. Sword hanging in the air, poised to strike. He turns his head to where Solara stands behind the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLARA>
<DIRECTION>
BEAT as Eli considers. He looks back at Hog, still completely at his mercy... and then LOWERS THE SWORD.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	It ain't for me to judge you. Your time for that's gonna come. Believe me. Now go on. Get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
Hog stumbles backward through the door, into the sunlight. Eli moves toward Solara, who stands petrified behind the bar. Reaches out and gently pries the canteen from her loose grip.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
In the exitway, Hog turns back inside, grabbing up a BROKEN BOTTLE from the bloody floor as he goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hog rushes Eli from behind. Solara sees him coming and goes to SCREAM - but before any sound can come, Eli flips his sword backward and Hog runs right onto it, SKEWERING HIMSELF.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAT. Hog just stands there for a moment, eyes wide, frozen in shock. His fingers go limp, dropping the bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slides off the sword and collapses to the floor, dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli wipes the sword clean and sheathes it. Looks around at the bloodied, fallen bodies. Then back at Solara.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry for all the mess.

Carnegie is on the landing, training his rifle down at Eli. Alongside him, FIVE GUNMEN do the same. They've got him cold.

<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. This is a civilized town. Under God. Do you know what that means?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Eli can't help but react at the mention of that word.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It means we have laws here. Laws set down long before any of us ever walked this earth. And one of them is, you don't eat the flesh of your brother. Else you're no better than an animal. And not welcome here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Eli doesn't respond. Just stands there in Carnegie's gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's your business here, friend? Walkers don't usually come into town less they want something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had a battery needed charging and a canteen needed filling. I didn't come here looking for trouble.

Barely noticeable, Carnegie gestures to one of the gunmen, who nods in acknowledgement and leaves.

The mention of that word rankles Carnegie. He walks around the desk toward Eli, waves an admonishing finger at him.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't call them slaves. That's an old word. I'm not a slaver. I'm trying to help these people.

Carnegie can't help himself - once again he is in his natural element, spinning the argument his way, pitching. Selling.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the outland the sightless are preyed upon like sick animals. Here at least they're protected. They do the essential work others don't want. And in return they eat, they drink, they survive. Last year, a couple of them even got married - performed the ceremony myself.

The engineer stands behind the counter, looking worried. His heart sinks when he sees Eli enter.

</ENGINEER>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much longer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<ENGINEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's gotta charge overnight. You, uh, you can always stay here in town, pick it up in the morning.

Eli leans in a little closer. He smells a rat.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You remember what I said would happen if I came back here and you didn't have my battery?

	It's right here! It's just gonna take a while longer. I swear.

Eli looks at the engineer. Hard to be certain, but he's pretty sure he's lying. Somebody got to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A VIOLENT COMMOTION is heard from down the hall. Suddenly one of Carnegie's henchmen comes flying into view as he is THROWN HARD INTO A WALL and slumps to the floor, unconscious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli storms into the box, pissed. MORE GUARDS rush in behind him. Carnegie, seated behind his desk, waves the guards off as he stands to greet Eli, smiling ingratiatingly as ever.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew you'd reconsider.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? How'd you know that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	None of the walkers I've seen come here from the outland were ever what you'd call smart. I mean all those years out there alone on the road, some with their brains half- fried from eating each other - it's understandable why you people aren't the brightest bulbs in the box. But I never met one so dumb that he'd turn down a meal and a bed if it was offered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you didn't send someone across the street to the engineer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Engineer? I don't know what you're talking about. If there's something wrong, maybe I can help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Carnegie is a practiced liar. Much more difficult to read.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Redridge. He's kind of my right-hand man around here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Redridge - one of the two men who chased Eli into the room - steps forward. He regards Eli with a distrustful eye.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll show you to your room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PALLADIUM - GUEST BEDROOM - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Redridge opens the door and ushers Eli inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's another of the dressing rooms converted into a bedroom, less well-appointed than Carnegie's own. A threadbare rug. Bed with relatively clean sheets. A sink for washing.
</DIRECTION>
<REDRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enjoy your stay. There'll be someone outside your room all night. If you need anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
Redridge smirks and closes the door, leaving Eli alone. Eli paces across the room. Finally sits down on the creaky old bed. Trying to figure out how he managed to get stuck here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He unshoulders his pack, sets it down. Lies down on the bed. It's been a while since he felt a real bed on his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A KNOCK at the door. Eli gets quickly to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and CLAUDIA enters. Carrying a metal tub of water in both hands and, atop that, a dinner tray.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have this for you. Water for washing and some food.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Eli just stands there. Totally unfamiliar with this kind of situation, it's been too long. She smiles, embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... are you going to take it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>

He takes the stuff from her, sets it on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're very welcome.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
We get the impression that Claudia is as unfamiliar with this kind of polite interaction as Eli. But she likes it.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll be dark soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
She strikes a match and lights the oil lamp on the table. The room is lit by its flickering glow.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I get you anything else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, thank you.

<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. Have a good night.

As she turns for the door:

	You're Carnegie's woman?
	</DIALOGUE>

<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you ask?

Claudia smiles. Neither has she.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He found me in the outland. I was sixteen, my family had been... well, they were gone. There was just me and my baby.

<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had a baby?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd met some men on the road. Bad men. They...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
BEAT. She trails off, struggling with this unhappy memory. Eli gets it, raises a hand reassuringly.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was on the road for a year after that. I couldn't feed myself, let alone my little girl. And then Bill found us and he promised he'd take care of us. He told me he was going to make a place where we could be safe. And he did. He did all that. He built this whole town. He kept us safe. And he raised that child like she was his own. He's been so good to both of us. He saved us, really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
There's a bittersweet quality to Claudia's words. As though there is more to the story than she is telling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli pulls out a chair at the table, offers it to her.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to eat some?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles and sits. Eli sits across from her.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When did you go blind? In the war? You get caught in a flash?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I was born this way. I think I'm lucky like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lucky?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not like I ever knew what I'm missing. I was already used to being like this by the time... by the time it all happened. So I got around pretty good even when I was on my own. And now it's easy. I know every creaky old floorboard in here, and it's not like I ever go any place else. Bill would never allow it. He worries about me so much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Again, bittersweet. The sense that Claudia feels trapped. Thinking about it begins to upset her. She gets up.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should go. He'll be wondering where I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Eli stands, escorts her to the door and opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. I enjoyed our conversation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So did I.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
Eli closes the door, then sits back at the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PALLADIUM - CARNEGIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnegie washes, looking at himself in the old dressing-room mirror. He sees Claudia enter the room in its dim reflection.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You took your time in there. How long does it take to deliver a plate of food and some water?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
A subtly accusing tone. It makes Claudia nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wanted to talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh? What about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing really. He asked me what it was like to be blind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He tell you anything about him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I don't think he likes to talk about himself much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I got that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Claudia moves to the bedside, begins to undress.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think he's going to change his mind by morning. I don't think he's going to stay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What makes you say that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just strikes me as the kind of man who's of a mind, is all. Doesn't seem like the type to go changing it once it's set.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we'll just see about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You saw him. He's not like the others. You won't be able to smooth- talk him and wrap him around your finger like you usually do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who said anything about me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sending Solara.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Claudia reacts suddenly to this. Shocked and angry.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're doing what?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know how often these walkers get laid? Never. Least not by anything living or willing. Girl like her can be very persuasive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't send her in there with him. He's dangerous, he's a killer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You went in there readily enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's different. Solara's just a child, she can't-
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Carnegie sighs, tiring of this.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's a grown woman now, Claudia. Sooner or later you're going to have to accept that. She has to earn her keep around here, same as the rest of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By working as a whore? That's all you think she's fit for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've each been given a talent to help us make our way in this world. Some people's gift is more evident than others. Solara's sure as hell is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Claudia looks at Carnegie in disgust.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of a man are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Now it's Carnegie's turn to get angry. He rounds on her menacingly. She backs off as he approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm the kind of man who'd pull a helpless blind girl off the road, a girl who'd been beaten and raped, and give her a place where she can live without fear! Without me you'd be just another no-eye, lying dead in the outland, picked clean by the buzzards, or shoveling dirt down there with the others. That's the kind of man I am!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
He has her against the wall, his face just inches from hers.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't live without fear. I haven't for a long time now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Carnegie calms himself, backs off. Claudia goes to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going to let you do this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
Carnegie surges forward and pins Claudia to the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not going to let me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody tells me what I can and can't do in my own town. Nobody. I built this world, and I am God here! So don't go thinking about screwing with my plans. You know how this works. Solara goes against me, you get hurt. You go against me, she gets hurt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
He releases his grip on her.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So let's not see anybody get hurt. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
He speaks more softly now. As he strokes his hand tenderly through Claudia's hair, a tear runs down her cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PALLADIUM - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark outside, but the room is brightly lit by the glow of the oil lamp. Eli sits up on his bed, quietly reading the old leather-bound book from his backpack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another KNOCK at the door. Eli jumps up and hurriedly hides the book inside his shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens to reveal Solara. Looking very different than she did before. Cleaned up and wearing a flowery summer dress, blonde hair let down over her shoulders. Stunning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unlike everyone else we have met, she seems - physically, at least - totally unscarred by the horrors of the times. Far too beautiful a thing to belong in a world like this.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. Can I come in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLARA>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>

<SOLARA>

</SOLARA>
<DIRECTION>
She glides into the room, closing the door. She's good. Very seductive. Eli is totally disarmed in her presence.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's too bright in here. Mind if I turn it down a little?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLARA>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't wait for an answer. Moves to the table and turns down the oil lamp. A darker, more seductive lighting scheme.
</DIRECTION>

She sits on the bed, kicks her legs playfully. Her light cotton dress revealing in all the right places. The silhouette of her body bathed in the seductive glow of the oil lamp. No red-blooded man on earth could resist her.

	Look, I don't mean to be rude. But I'm really not interested.

She leans over on the bed, resting on her elbow. Her hair cascades down. God damn, she looks good.

She slides off the bed, approaches him. Begins to work the buttons of his shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're all that kind of man.

<DIRECTION>
He moves her hand away. Gently pushes her back a step.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
She is stunned. No man has ever turned her down before. And then she seems a little insulted.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They told me you were crazy. Maybe they were right.

Eli opens the door for her.

Suddenly all her other emotions give way to fear. She moves to the door and slams it shut again. Looks Eli in the eye.

</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, if you want to help me, just let me stay here tonight. We don't have to do anything. I'll sleep on the floor. Tomorrow you can tell my dad that we had a good time. I'll be no trouble, I swear.

She looks up at Eli imploringly. Transformed. No longer the teenage sex kitten. Now she's just a frightened little girl.

She smiles, wiping the tear from her cheek.

Eli and Solara sit together on the bed. A silent BEAT. At first, it appears as though they have nothing to say.

</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>

</SOLARA>
<DIRECTION>
Eli smiles, amused by the bluntness of the question.

Eli nods.

For the first time we see that it's a KING JAMES BIBLE. An embossed GOLD CROSS on its old leather cover.

	For a long while after it happened, I just wandered on the road like most everybody else. There were still a lot of people around back then, in the beginning. I didn't really know what I should do or where I was going. I was just moving from place to place, trying to stay alive. And then one day I heard this voice. I don't know how to explain it, it's like it was coming from inside me. But I could hear it, clear as day. Clear as I can hear you talking to me now.

	What did it say?

</SOLARA>
<ELI>

<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you knew because the voice told you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLARA>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. And that voice told me to carry the book west. It told me that a path would be laid out before me, that I'd be led to a place where this book would be safe. It told me I'd be protected against anyone or anything that tried to stand in my way. If only I would have faith.

She walks over to where the dinner tray is covered by a small cloth. She whips it away - to reveal ELI'S RAT nibbling on a piece of cheese. Solara SHRIEKS and backs away.

The rat scurries down the table leg and leaps up onto Eli's shoulder, just as afraid of her as she is of it.

Solara approaches warily. Reaches out and strokes him. The rat scurries up her arm. She almost shrieks again.

Eli breaks the cheese in two and gives half to Solara. She's about to eat but stops as Eli clasp his hands in prayer.

Solara lowers her head, scorned. Carnegie continues eating.

He barks the question at her. Solara is rattled.

Solara makes the SIGN OF A CRUCIFIX with her index fingers. Carnegie's eyes widen; he can barely believe it.

They turn to face the engineer's storefront - just as ELI EMERGES ONTO THE STREET, shotgun still in his hand.

EVERYBODY FREEZES. Like a wild west stand-off. Redridge's fingers play over the butt of the pistol on his hip.

Redridge draws and FIRES, SHATTERING A PARKING METER just inches from Eli and showering quarters all over the sidewalk.

Eli rushes along the sidewalk, RETURNING FIRE. The shot wings Redridge in the shoulder. He goes down, wounded.

Carnegie dives for cover as FOUR MORE GUNMEN rush from the theater. Carnegie waves frantically in Eli's direction.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOCAL RESIDENTS scream and rush to and fro in panic as Eli darts along the boardwalk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARNEGIE'S GUNMEN pursue, firing their rifles wildly on the run. The bullets splinter wood, pierce barrels and crates, narrowly missing Eli as he dashes, keeping his head down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli aims the shotgun and FIRES without even looking. The shot HITS A GUNMAN SQUARE IN THE CHEST, dropping him to the dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli hits the deck, diving for cover behind a JUNKPILE as more gunfire ricochets all around him. He takes a moment to collect himself, reloads the shotgun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three remaining gunmen close in on the junkpile warily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli signs a cross over himself with the shotgun, looks to the sky and offers up a silent prayer. Then emerges from around the junkpile back into the street. All three gunmen OPEN FIRE, their bullets whipping past on either side of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In one swift motion Eli raises the shotgun and FIRES. Three shots in quick succession. And then there is silence. Smoke wisps from the shotgun's sawn-off barrel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three gunmen LIE DEAD IN THE STREET. One hit square in the chest. The other two each have maybe one half of their heads remaining.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli looks around. He's right at the end of the main road, the perimeter where the town meets the open desert. He's free.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then, A GIRL'S SCREAM. Distant but unmistakable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli whips around. In the upstairs window of the theater, Carnegie shoves Solara roughly against the wall. Barking angrily at her, shaking her.
</DIRECTION>

Eli looks at the road. Then up at the theater. Then back to the road again.

Redridge finally manages to clamber back up to his feet, wincing as he clutches his painful shoulder wound.

He looks up just in time to see Eli coming right at him. Without breaking stride, he COLD-COCKS Redridge in the jaw with the shotgun, sending him back to the deck, out cold.

<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I've been searching for a book like that one for years. All I've ever wanted was to bring the word of God to these poor unfortunates here. To shine its light upon them and give them something in this wretched world that they could believe in. Something to live for! It's why I built this town, did you know that? All we've been missing is the word to show us the way. And now, praise the Lord, you've brought it to us.

Carnegie takes a step closer. He appears entirely sincere - but then he is very good at doing so.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not right to keep that book hidden away, all to yourself. The word is meant to be shared with others. It's meant to be spread! Isn't that what you want? I could help you do that. You and me, we could do it together.

</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
BEAT. Eli seems to be considering what he's heard carefully.

BEAT. And then the STATUE TOPPLES from the neat cut just below the knees, CRASHING DOWN to the ground and SHATTERING. The assembled residents GASP at this defiant display.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli sheathes his sword and takes Solara by the hand again.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now we can go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
CRANE UP over the main street as they both head out of town.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The town barely visible on the distant horizon behind Eli and Solara. Eli walks as he always has, his pace steady and slow. Still, Solara lags along behind. She's already tired.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are we going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLARA>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you where I'm going. You're free to go wherever you want.

She stops in the road.

<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait... I'm not coming with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLARA>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're only going to slow me down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
Eli doesn't stop walking. Solara is forced to catch up.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what the hell was all that about back there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLARA>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The man was hurting you. I don't like that, so I put a stop to it. Now you're free. He can't hurt you any more.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off her stare)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No need to thank me.

<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you? For what? What am I supposed to do now?

</SOLARA>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever you want. That's what being free is.

</ELI>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever I want. Except go with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLARA>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to get where I'm going. I can't be worrying about someone else along the way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
Solara is incredibly hurt by this. Blinks back a tear.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you were my friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLARA>
<DIRECTION>
BEAT. Eli stops and turns back to face her.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's dangerous in the outland. I wouldn't want you to get hurt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be safe so long as I'm with you. I know it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLARA>
<DIRECTION>
Eli sighs. He's not getting through to her. So now comes the harsh truth of it:
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't want this life. I gotta do what I gotta do. Don't have no choice in it. But you do. And I can't let you choose this. You don't want to be like me. You don't want to spend your life alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
Solara steps closer, her eyes pleading.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I came with you, I wouldn't be alone. And neither would you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLARA>
<DIRECTION>
A long BEAT as Eli considers this. For a moment it appears as though Solara might have won him over. But then:
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. Look, maybe it's best you just go on back to town.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and walks off, leaving her in the road. She stands there, furious, screaming at his back as he walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine! I'll do just that! I had a life there! A family! I didn't ask you to save me! I didn't ask you for anything!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLARA>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't turn or acknowledge her at all. Just keeps walking off into the horizon. Getting smaller all the time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Solara stands there in the road, weeping. All alone.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
<DIRECTION>
(SOFTLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLARA>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and walks back in the direction she came.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DESERT TOWN - BARNYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small, penned-in area to the rear of the Palladium containing an eclectic bunch of farmyard animals. Goats, sheep, geese, pigs. Mostly mangy, sad-looking specimens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnegie stands in the yard, tossing handfuls of animal feed from a nearby sack onto the ground. He watches with satisfaction as the animals gather at his feet to feed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claudia emerges from the theater with an ice-pack.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, darling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Carnegie applies it to his jaw, red and swollen from Eli's pistol-whip. Redridge appears nearby, his arm in a sling.
</DIRECTION>
<REDRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He killed four of my men and walked out of town without a scratch. They shot off a hundred rounds at him and he didn't get hit once. I never even heard of anything like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
Carnegie doesn't appear to be listening. He is lost in a world of his own as he tends to the farm animals.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I always thought of myself as a shepherd. Bringing together the wayward and the lost. Tending to my flock. But all the things I want to do, I can't do them on my own. The one thing I've needed is the one thing that's always been missing. Then one day it walks right into town - so close I can almost touch it - and then walks right on out again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Carnegie finally looks up from his animals, at Redridge.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want you to put a crew together and go out after him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<REDRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not going to work for you. I think he's made that plain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDRIDGE>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not interested in him any more. I only want the book he's carrying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<REDRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I'm gonna risk my ass hunting down this maniac in the outland, I need to know it's gonna be worth it. I need to know what's so special about this goddamn book.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
BEAT as Carnegie considers this.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have no idea. You're too young, you don't remember the world before. But I do. I remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns back to his animals, summoning up old memories.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I was a kid my parents used to read that book every goddamn day. My mother, she'd read it along with this smooth-talking preacher on the TV screen. They used to be able to beam these guys right into your house, into every house in the world, through the air. Like magic.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She worked two jobs and she sent every spare penny she had to that fucking guy on the TV. My old man, he'd read that book, then he'd get liquored up and kick my ass, tell me all about the power and the glory and how I was going to burn forever in hell for the sins I was born with. He made sure he beat it into me good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
He snaps out of his reverie and looks at Redridge.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you see? It's not just any book. It has the power to motivate people. It can give them hope, it can terrify them. It can shape them. Control them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you remember how I built this town? It wasn't done with force, and it wasn't done just with water. It was done with the power of words. I created this place out of nothing, because people believed in a promise that I sold to them. Those guys on the TV, they were richer than you could ever dream, and it was all built the same way. With words. With promises. And with that book.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That book is a weapon. Aimed right at the hearts and minds of the weak and the desperate. Just imagine what I could do with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<REDRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boss... we're running out of water and the people are running out of patience. You're trying to tell me that a book is going to keep them in line?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDRIDGE>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, it'll do much more than that. The water in this town may run dry, but faith - that springs eternal! And that faith will help turn this town into a city. And this city into a nation. It will help me build a new world. In my image. People will come from far and wide to hear what's inside of it. They'll follow me anywhere just to get a taste of it. And they'll do whatever I tell them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
As usual, Carnegie's slick rhetoric has worked - Redridge has totally bought into it. Claudia, however, looks appalled.
</DIRECTION>
<REDRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what if this book don't work? What if it don't say what you want it to say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDRIDGE>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, it'll say what I want, I can promise you that. Because I'm going to rewrite it. I'll keep the parts that work for me and make the rest whatever I need it to be.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A new bible, for a new world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches out and takes Claudia by the hand.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think, darling? A whole new world, to do with as we will. Won't that be grand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles halfheartedly, but it's clear she is mortified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carnegie turns back to Redridge.
</DIRECTION>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Find that book.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<REDRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has half a day on us already.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDRIDGE>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So use the motor pool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<REDRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There ain't much gas in reserve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDRIDGE>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever there is, use it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<DIRECTION>
Redridge nods and goes to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Solara?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<DIRECTION>
BEAT. In all this excitement about the book, she had been completely forgotten about.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's still out there. With him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDIA>
<CARNEGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Right. Of course. Bring her back, too, if you can. But-
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE>
<REDRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The book. I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
Redridge turns and leaves. Claudia scowls at Carnegie, but he doesn't even notice, just goes back to feeding his animals.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DESOLATE ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Solara wanders the road. She's tired. The sun beats down mercilessly. Nothing but desolation and wasteland all around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She comes to a FORK IN THE ROAD. Stops at the junction, unsure. Was this here before? She doesn't remember.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are no signs. Both paths look the same. Which one is which? She turns and looks back, looks around. She's lost.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit. Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLARA>
<DIRECTION>
She alternates her finger between the two paths. Eeny-meeny- miney-moe. Picks a path and follows it, headed down the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli walks on. Slow and steady. His gaze, as ever, fixed firmly on the horizon. Takes a swig from his canteen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, he STOPS and stands stock still in the center of the road. Impossible to know what he's thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands there for a long time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. WASTELAND GAS STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Solara comes upon an abandoned CHEVRON STATION. She doesn't remember passing this. Looks back up and down the road.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where the hell am I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLARA>
<DIRECTION>
There's a RUSTED CAR parked at one of the pumps. Like every other car we've seen, stripped of its tires and engine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks around to the driver's side. A PETRIFIED FEMALE BODY lies on the ground, half-in, half-out of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Solara claps her hand to her mouth and recoils, horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the dead woman's hand is a dusty bottle of MINERAL WATER. Solara hesitates. Not wanting to get closer. But so thirsty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She braces herself, grimacing, and tries to take the bottle, but the dead woman's hand is closed tight around it. She pulls harder and wrenches it free. In the process she falls on her butt and flips the corpse over onto its back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the other woman's arm, she has a SKELETAL BABY cradled to her bosom. It seems to be staring right at Solara.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Solara SCREAMS and frantically shuffles backward away from it. Gets to her feet and runs across the forecourt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stops by the station shop and rests against the wall, hyperventilating, heart pounding. Trying to get it together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She inspects the water in the bottle. It looks clean. Unscrews the cap with shaking hands and takes a sip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She SPITS IT BACK OUT, coughing. It's rank. Undrinkable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. WASTELAND GAS STATION - FOOD COURT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Solara enters. Gloomy inside. Comprehensively looted. Empty shelves coated in thick sheets of dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She moves further in, searching for something, anything. But the place has been gutted. There's nothing. She checks the wall of dead refrigerators. Shattered glass, all empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's never known desolation and emptiness like this. It's beginning to scare her. She wheels around in a panic.
</DIRECTION>
<FEMALE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEMALE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Distant, calling from outside. Solara hears it and freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<FEMALE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Can anyone help me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEMALE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. WASTELAND GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs out across the forecourt, onto the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FEMALE FIGURE is hunched by the side of the road about fifty yards up ahead. Hard to see what she's doing from here.
</DIRECTION>
<SLUMPED_FEMALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Is anybody there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SLUMPED_FEMALE>
<DIRECTION>
Solara starts walking toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman has her back to Solara. She's on her knees, muttering to herself. Gathering objects up from the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Solara moves closer, we see that the woman is struggling with an UPTURNED SHOPPING CART. Stuck in a roadside ditch, its contents spilled out next to a few BRACKEN BUSHES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see her face now. It's the SAME YOUNG WOMAN from before. The same shopping cart. The same trap.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLARA>
<DIRECTION>
The woman looks around, sees Solara standing nearby. She's shocked to see that it's a girl.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Yes, I'm fine. Thank you. You go along, I'll be okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look like you need some help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLARA>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, really! I'm fine. Really... I need a man to help. Not you. You just keep along. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The woman seems anxious to get rid of her. Tries to indicate the threat silently with her eyes, but Solara doesn't get it.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll just take a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLARA>
<DIRECTION>
She steps into the ditch and starts to haul the cart out.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really, it's fine! Please!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Too late. THREE ROAD BRIGANDS POUNCE FROM THE BUSHES. Every bit as brutish and horrifying as the group that Eli killed on the road in our opening. They grab Solara and drag her from the road into the desert, screaming and kicking all the way.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let her go! She ain't got nothing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The BRIGAND LEADER looks Solara up and down lustfully.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIGAND_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ain't too sure about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIGAND_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
Solara is reviled by the man. He's filthy, his stench overpowering. One eye missing, just a dark, empty socket. He licks his lips, revealing a mouth almost devoid of teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This wasn't the deal!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The brigand leader lashes out and grabs her by the throat.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIGAND_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut your mouth, bitch. You oughta be grateful you're getting a break.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIGAND_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
He releases her. She slumps to the dirt, whimpering.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIGAND_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never did care much for that dried- up old snatch anyhow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIGAND_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
He looks back to the struggling Solara.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIGAND_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This one, though... this one looks fresh. You a virgin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIGAND_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
She says nothing, just sobs helplessly.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIGAND_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, let's find out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIGAND_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
He unbuckles his pants, lets them drop to his ankles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a sound. It's hard to place. Something like a THHUP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The brigand leader is frozen in shock. His face goes pale, the blood draining from it. The two bandits holding Solara look at their leader in dismay. Staring down at his crotch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A quiet whimper escapes from his lips as he looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is an ARROW IMBEDDED IN HIS CROTCH. What was once down there is now just a bloody mess of mangled meat. More blood streams down his thighs. A real horror show.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He staggers backward, shrieking. Hands shaking. Staring down at the awful wound from which the long arrow shaft extends.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two other brigands release Solara and whip around, scanning the horizon. They see nothing. One of them has a RIFLE. He unslings it and aims it frantically around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then they both see it. Coming right at them. The most terrifying thing either has ever seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELI, WALKING TOWARD THEM FROM THE ROAD, OUT OF THE SUN. His silhouette distorted in the rippling heat. An avenging angel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls another arrow and draws it back as the rifle bandit trains his weapon on him, finger tightening on the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli SHOOTS. The arrow sails through the air and RIGHT INTO THE RIFLE BARREL. The feathers at the end of the shaft plugging the muzzle tight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rifle bandit pulls the trigger. The gun EXPLODES, BLOWING HIS HANDS CLEAN OFF. He falls to the ground, screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli only had two arrows. He shoulders the bow and draws his sword. All the remaining brigand has is a small knife. The two now square off at arm's length. A hopeless mismatch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAT. The knife brigand hesitates, trembling. And then RUSHES ELI WITH THE KNIFE. Eli deftly sidesteps, flourishes the sword. So quick it almost seems like he didn't move at all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The knife bandit staggers forward a couple more steps. His hand goes limp and drops the knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then his HEAD FALLS BACKWARD like a Pez dispenser. Almost completely decapitated, but not quite. Blood fountains from the neck stump as his body falls to the dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli moves to the other two bandits who lay horribly wounded on the ground, but still breathing. He stands over their fallen bodies. They stare back up at him, helpless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crouches down between them in the dust.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I offer you both one final chance in this life to seek forgiveness for your sins so that your souls may find salvation. Will you say with me the act of contrition?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
The brigand leader defiantly spits blood at him.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIGAND_LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIGAND_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
Eli sighs. Stands and looks down on him without pity.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some might think it'd be most fitting to leave you here like this. Let you die slow in the sun. But I know better. I know where you're going. And the sooner you get there, the sooner you'll get what's coming to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
He plunges his sword into the bandit leader, finishing him off. Pulls the arrow from his crotch and wipes it clean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to the other man, raising his sword.
</DIRECTION>
<RIFLE_BANDIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait!

Eli pauses, sword hovering over him, poised to strike.

<RIFLE_BANDIT>

	I want to say it. I want to be forgiven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIFLE_BANDIT>
<DIRECTION>
Eli crouches once more by his side.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Repeat after me. Oh God, I am heartily sorry for having offended thee, and I detest all my sins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
The bandit follows along with Eli, mouthing the words quietly. The life ebbing from him with each moment.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>

His eyes roll back as his final breath leaves him. Dead. Eli signs a cross over his body, then stands and walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Solara sits on the ground nearby, a wreck. Eli approaches and gathers her up in his arms. She clings on to him tightly.

He helps her up and escorts her back to the road.

<DIRECTION>
METAL GARAGE DOORS roll back to reveal darkness within.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PAIR OF HEADLIGHTS fires up. Full beam right at us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A VEHICLE roars out of the darkness onto the street. Heavily modified with plate armor and turret-mounted weapons. But its original form still recognizable underneath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a HONDA ODYSSEY minivan. Once the #1 choice of soccer moms, transformed now into an armored personnel carrier.
</DIRECTION>

Another minivan roars from the garage behind it. A DODGE GRAND CARAVAN, similarly customized and armed to the teeth.

THREE MORE CARS follow. As eclectic an assortment as you could imagine. A MINI COOPER. FORD EXPLORER. A PRIUS. Each adorned with plate armor and weapons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the lead Minivan is REDRIDGE, heavily armed. He nods to the DRIVER, who guns the engine.
</DIRECTION>

The fleet of armored vehicles moves out, kicking up a great funnel of dust in their wake as they roar out of town.

:SC: EXT. DESERT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Late afternoon. The sun hangs low on the horizon. We're far from the road. Nothing but scrub brush and a few PRAIRIE DOG BURROWS dotted around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PRAIRIE DOG pops its head up, scans the horizon. Sniffing the air, whiskers twitching... and is SKEWERED BY AN ARROW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thirty yards away, one of the pieces of scrub brush appears to COME ALIVE. And then we realize it is Eli's GHILLIE SUIT, camouflaging both he and Solara beneath it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli casts off the camouflage net and walks toward the dead prairie dog. Solara just stands there, appalled.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You killed it! That cute little thing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLARA>

Eli picks up the dead animal by the scruff.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's good eating, is what it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
He yanks out the bloody arrow. Solara looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she turns back, Eli is standing right there, holding the dead animal in front of her face. She YELPS in surprise and staggers backward, falling on her butt.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not funny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLARA>
<ELI>

:SC: EXT. WASTELAND CAVE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli and Solara sit in the mouth of a desert cave, around a flickering campfire. The prairie dog roasts on a spit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli digs his knife into the carcass, the blade comes out clean. It's done. He clasps his hands together and gazes down penitently at the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Father, we thank you for your generosity in providing us with this meal. Bless this food to our use and us to thy service, and keep us ever mindful of the needs of others. Amen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
Eli carves off a piece of meat. Juicy and succulent. He bites into it, teasing Solara by making a show of how good it tastes. He feeds a piece to the rat perched on his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Solara tries to appear uninterested, but she's starved.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does that taste like?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLARA>
<DIRECTION>
He takes another bite, thinks on this as he chews.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tastes like chicken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to fight the temptation to try it... but she can't. She reaches out and tears off a piece. Sniffs at it, takes a small bite... then quickly wolfs down the rest. Eli smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she eats, she gestures toward Eli's Saint Christopher.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLARA>
<DIRECTION>
Eli reaches up and touches his hand to it.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a Saint Christopher medal.

	Who's Saint Christopher? Is he a character from your book?

</SOLARA>
<DIRECTION>
Eli smiles and shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christopher was a man who lived a long time ago. He wanted to be a good man, he wanted to help people. So he would stand by a river that had no bridge and carry people across. He was a big strong man and there was no one he couldn't carry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
Solara listens, rapt. Eli is a good storyteller.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then one day a young child came to the river and asked to be carried across. Christopher tried to carry him but he was too heavy. He was just a small boy but he was heavier than any man he had ever carried. The boy explained that he was the son of God, and that he was so heavy because he bore all the sins of the world. After that, Christopher was able to carry him across and when they got to the other side the boy baptized him in the river. And that's how he became a saint. Later on, he was known as the patron saint of travelers.

<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is a saint, anyway?

Eli looks away, down at the ground. He appears sad.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>

LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fire down to its last embers. Eli sleeps next to his pack, half-hidden in the looming shadows of the cave. His hat and goggles hung up for the night on the hilt of his sword.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Solara sleeps nearby... then opens her eyes. Not asleep after all. She looks over at Eli - his face hidden in shadow and so impossible to tell if he's asleep or awake.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eli?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLARA>
<DIRECTION>
No response. Quietly, she moves forward, kneeling by his side. She opens his coat and checks the pockets. Empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She goes deeper, peeling back the layers of clothing, stealthily frisking him. She finds something on his lapel, hidden under several layers, that causes her to stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a RECTANGULAR PLASTIC BADGE. The red, white and blue colors faded and worn. It reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WELCOME TO WAL-MART MY NAME IS "ELI" HOW MAY I HELP YOU?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at it for a moment, not knowing what to make of it. Then moves on, continuing to pat him down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whatever she's looking for is not here. She turns her attention to the backpack. Slowly, carefully, opens it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There it is. THE BIBLE, wrapped carefully in its neat little package of cloth and twine. She reaches in for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, ELI'S HAND SHOOTS OUT AND GRABS HER BY THE WRIST. She cries out, startled. Eli sits up, his face just a dark shape in the shadows. For the first time he appears a little scary to Solara.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>

He grips her wrist tighter.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Eli releases her wrist. Takes the pack from her and closes it up. Pulls it closer to him and lies back down.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's no use to you anyway. You don't know how to read it.

She lies back down beside him, but doesn't close her eyes. She just lies there, watching him.

:SC: EXT. WASTELAND - DAWN
</DIRECTION>

The sun rises out of the east. And out of the sun comes the FLEET OF ARMORED VEHICLES. Racing side-by-side down the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lead vehicle comes to a halt. A door opens and Redridge gets out. MORE ARMED MEN emerge from the other vehicles and follow him as he marches into the wasteland by the roadside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DEAD BRIGANDS are splayed out in the dirt where Eli slew them. A FLOCK OF BUZZARDS is picking their bones clean.

<REDRIDGE>

He moves back to the cars.

The other men hold for a moment, still looking at the half- eaten bodies in the dirt. Redridge turns back.

Hesitantly, they make their way back to the vehicles. The cars gun their engines and move on down the road, past the abandoned Chevron station. Dust pluming in their wake.

Eli and Solara walk together, passing by a few burned-out buildings. It appears we might be headed toward a town.

Solara looks up at the sweltering sun. Then around at her surroundings. Nothing but devastation and decay.

:SC: EXT. HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the outskirts of a small town that lies in ruins. Almost every building burned or reduced to rubble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Except for one SMALL HOUSE. The building is damaged and worn but in mostly decent condition. It stands out among its surroundings for being the only structure still intact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The windows are BARRED. The outer structure fortified with SHEET METAL and other custom patch-ups. The whole plot surrounded by a CHAIN-LINK FENCE TOPPED WITH RAZOR WIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli and Solara crouch behind a pile of rubble nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't get it. It looks almost... normal. Like nothing ever happened. How can it still be out here?

</DIRECTION>
<ELI>

	Stay behind me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
They approach the house cautiously. Arrive at the perimeter fence. There's a gate held in place by a PADLOCK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli pulls a pair of BOLT-CUTTERS from his belt and snips the padlock free. Swings open the gate with a metallic SQUEAK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They move inside, up the garden path. Though the soil in the yard is dead, it's been carefully raked and tended. WEEDS arranged in thoughtful patterns, like real flowers.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is weird.

<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.

Eli steps forward, his foot planting on a CRACKED PAVING STONE that shifts almost imperceptibly under his feet. Accompanied by a barely audible SOUND. He looks down.

	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

</SOLARA>
<DIRECTION>
A ROPE NOOSE suddenly whips around their feet, tightening at their ankles and YANKING THEM UPSIDE-DOWN INTO THE AIR. Eli drops his shotgun to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They hang there for a moment, twisting in the breeze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front door to the house SWINGS OPEN to reveal...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN ELDERLY COUPLE. The woman's gray hair tied into a neat bun. The man bald, squinting through wire-frame glasses. They look like the couple from Grant Wood's "American Gothic."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instead of a pitchfork the man holds a 12-GAUGE RIOT SHOTGUN which he keeps trained from the hip on Eli and Solara.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They step outside, regarding their new visitors carefully. The man seems more suspicious than his wife. He drags Eli's shotgun toward him with his foot, hands it to his wife.

The old woman helps them to their feet. They shake off the noose from their ankles.

:SC: INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

It's like something out of the world before. The interior is almost perfectly preserved. Chintzy couches. A mahogany table. A TV set in the corner. Lace curtains. Unreal.

<DIRECTION>
Eli and Solara sit on the couch, feeling self-conscious and looking entirely out of place in this cozy environment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George sits across from them on the couch, scowling at them inhospitably. The shotgun resting across his lap.
</DIRECTION>

Martha emerges from the kitchen, carrying a tray laden with a tea pot and old china cups. Cracked and faded, but intact. She places the tray on the coffee table and sits.

<DIRECTION>
An unnerving glint in his eye. Eli moves toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I'm afraid so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
As he gets to the door, George moves to intercept. Hard to tell if he's blocking his path or moving to open the door for him. A tense BEAT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Martha emerges from the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure you won't stay?

</MARTHA>
<ELI>

	Yes. Thank you again for the tea.

Eli stares George down. Reluctantly, George steps aside. Eli opens the door and escorts Solara outside.

:SC: EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

<DIRECTION>
Eli and Solara emerge into the sunlight. Walk down the garden path. And FREEZE IN THEIR TRACKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ARMED VEHICLES ARE COMING. Driving toward them out of the horizon in a hazy cloud of dust.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no... it's my dad. It's his men.

Eli bundles Solara back into the house. George stands in the doorway, squinting at the approaching convoy.

George follows them back in, furious.

</GEORGE>
<MARTHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	George? What's wrong?

</MARTHA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A whole convoy of armed degenerates, that's what's wrong! Coming here for them! And they led them right to us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Martha rushes to the window, pulls aside the lace curtain. Outside she sees the armored vehicles SCREECHING TO A HALT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men spill out from the vehicles and take cover behind them, locking and loading weapons.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no they don't...

</MARTHA>
<DIRECTION>
She rushes across the room, teeth gritted with determination.

	Martha, what are you doing?

<MARTHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I finally got this house just the way I want it. I'm not going to let anybody tear it apart!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTHA>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to the couch and yanks off the seat cushions. Underneath is a WOODEN LID which she throws open to reveal:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HUGE CACHE OF WEAPONS. Automatic rifles. Shotguns. Pistols. Grenades. And enough ammunition for everything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls out an M-60 MACHINE-GUN, slings the strap over her shoulder and locks in a CHAIN OF BULLETS. She looks like a post-apocalyptic Martha Stewart.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did you get all this stuff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLARA>
<DIRECTION>
George pulls out an AK-47, slots in a magazine.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Took `em off them who came looking to take the place from us. Built up quite the stash over the years.

He offers a .44 MAGNUM to Solara.

<GEORGE>

<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>

George sighs, turns instead to Eli.

<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about you, you know how to-

Eli is already reloading his shotgun, checking the barrel. Readying the weapon in the practiced manner of an expert.

Redridge steps forward, raises a BULLHORN.

	We know you're in there! Come on out with your hands up and your weapons on the deck and nobody needs to get hurt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
SILENCE. No sign of activity inside the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Redridge turns back to his men. Their hands trembling. They didn't sign up for this, and they're not ready for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Redridge turns back to the house. Into the bullhorn:
</DIRECTION>
<REDRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, look. I'm gonna make it easy on y'all. Bring out the girl with the book.

Eli is crouched beneath the window. George and Martha have taken up positions at other windows, peering out.

<REDRIDGE>

	That's all we want. The girl and the book. The rest of you's can go your way.

Redridge waits. Still no sign of a response. His nervous gunmen exchange worried looks.

	</DIALOGUE>
</CARNEGIE_GUNMAN_2>
<DIRECTION>
Redridge raises his hand to silence him. Looks up as an UPSTAIRS WINDOW slides open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CLOTH PACKAGE is tossed from the window. It lands in the dirt outside the perimeter fence a few yards from Redridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cautiously, he approaches. The package is wrapped in cloth and tied up with twine. It looks like Eli's bible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He picks it up and tugs at the twine, untying it. Folds away the cloth wrapping. Looks for a moment in puzzlement at the object, at the words written on the front of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THIS SIDE TO FACE ENEMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a MINIATURE CLAYMORE MINE. The small red light on top of the unit ILLUMINATES WITH A BEEP. Armed.
</DIRECTION>
<REDRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shi...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
He drops the package in the dirt and races for his life back toward the vehicles.
</DIRECTION>
<REDRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get down! Everybody get down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
He dives across the trunk of the Explorer into cover as THE MINE EXPLODES, SHATTERING EVERY WINDOW OF EVERY VEHICLE. The lightweight Mini Cooper takes the main brunt and EXPLODES, cartwheeling through the air, a burning wreck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Redridge looks around. Three men lie dead already. Flaming wreckage all around him. Suddenly, it's a war zone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MACHINE-GUN FIRE ERUPTS FROM THE HOUSE, peppering the vehicles' armor. The gunmen cower behind cover.
</DIRECTION>
<REDRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn you, return fire!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
Redridge aims at the house and OPENS FIRE. Inspired by his example, the others follow. A HAIL OF BULLETS CRISS-CROSS BACK AND FORTH. The house's faded paint facade is shredded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Martha continues firing wildly with the M-60. Screaming at the top of her lungs, loving every minute of it.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come and get it, you god-damn sons of mother-fucking bitches!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTHA>
<DIRECTION>
George and Eli also open fire from their windows, periodically ducking to take cover from incoming fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Solara sits across the room, in the corner, sobbing.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right. We're going to be all right. Trust me.

MORE GUNFIRE splinters the window frame above his head.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You remember what I told you about faith?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
She nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli peeks out and FIRES OUT THE WINDOW, dropping one of the enemy gunmen with a crack shot. Ducks back down as the return fire impacts around him.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going to get out of this alive. Both of us. I know.

<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Redridge's men continue the hail of gunfire. Six of them dead now, six more still standing. No lessening of fire from inside the house. They're losing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Redridge races between the vehicles, ducking from gunfire until he makes it to the back of the Dodge Caravan. Pops the trunk and pulls out a ROCKET-PROPELLED GRENADE LAUNCHER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sets it on his shoulder, rests on the trunk to steady his aim. And FIRES. The rocket screams toward its target, tearing through the chain fence and TEARING AN ENTIRE CORNER FROM THE HOUSE in a fiery explosion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Filled with smoke. The sounds of COUGHING.

Dazed, George pushes his way through the smoke, waving his arms to clear it. A BLOODY GASH on his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Martha? Martha!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
He finds her lying on the tile floor in what remains of the kitchen. Or at least her top half. The rest of her is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George slumps to his knees with tear-filled eyes. Takes his wife tenderly by the hand for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the anger returns. He gets up and turns, consumed now by a wild fury. Firing with rage over the torn brick wall. He CLIPS ANOTHER GUNMAN IN THE HEAD, killing him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George moves back toward the LIVING ROOM, firing as he goes.

Redridge moves between the cars again, staying behind cover. George's hail of gunfire has them pinned down.

Redridge jumps into the driver's seat of the minivan, turns the key in the ignition. Jams the accelerator down with the butt of his rifle, then shifts the transmission into DRIVE.

Eli looks up from cover and see the van coming RIGHT AT HIM. He dives clear as the van CRASHES THROUGH THE WALL INTO THE LIVING ROOM. It SMASHES INTO THE FAR WALL, finally coming to a stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More dust and debris, more coughing. Eli tries to get up, but winces in pain. Puts his hand to his side, it comes back WET WITH BLOOD. A bad wound. He covers it with his coat, stands and moves through the smoke.

As he helps her to her feet, we hear the sound of MOVEMENT THROUGH THE RUBBLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They turn around. The gunmen are ENTERING THE HOUSE, passing through the smoking hole left by the minivan.

Eli reaches for his sword. Met by the sound of MULTIPLE GUNS COCKING. Redridge steps out from among the gunmen. Smiles.

Eli and Solara are shoved out of the house at gunpoint and marched past the torn perimeter fence to the vehicles.

Redridge stares him down. Eli just stares right back. Totally unflappable. Redridge motions to his men.
</DIRECTION>
<REDRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Check the pack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
The gunman carrying Eli's pack opens it up and tips its contents out onto the ground. The ghillie suit, battery, some old canned goods, other odds and ends. No sign of the book.

Redridge holsters his gun and frisks Eli, going through his pockets. Finds nothing. He opens Eli's coat and checks the inside pockets. Digs around deep inside.
</DIRECTION>
<REDRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, what have we here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
And then suddenly he SHRIEKS IN PAIN. Yanks his hand out to reveal ELI'S RAT, TEETH SUNK DEEP INTO HIS FLESH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Redridge flails around violently, trying to get the rat off him, but it won't let go. His hand is bleeding badly.
</DIRECTION>
<REDRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck! Get it off! Get it off me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REDRIDGE>
<DIRECTION>
He finally manages to shake it free. It hits the floor dazed. Redridge STOMPS ON IT with his boot, reducing it to a bloody smear in the dirt. Eli lowers his head in sadness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Redridge clutches his bloody hand, glares at Eli furiously. Pulls his gun again and marches right up to him, pressing the muzzle tight against his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<REDRIDGE>

</DIRECTION>
<REDRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take your shit and get out of here.

Eli gathers up his stuff into his pack. Shoulders it and goes to pick up his sword, but Redridge puts his boot on it.

<REDRIDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No weapons.

Eli still has a half-dozen guns trained on him. He turns and walks away, toward the road. As he passes Solara:

<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you we'd both live. Now do you have faith?

</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
A tear runs down Solara's cheek as she watches him walk away.

<DIRECTION>
Redridge grabs her by the arm and pulls her toward the vehicles as his men load up and prepare to move out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE REARMOST VEHICLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Solara sits in the back seat, staring out the rear window as it drives down the road at the tail end of the convoy.

She watches as Eli moves away down the road, getting smaller and smaller until he is just a speck on the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She bursts into floods of uncontrollable tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Solara in the back seat, calmer now. The tears dried on her cheeks. She sits staring blankly at the DRIVER in front.
</DIRECTION>

And then she LUNGES VIOLENTLY FORWARD. Clawing and biting at the driver, who struggles to fight her off. His hands come off the wheel and the car FISHTAILS WILDLY.

The DRIVER sees something odd in the rear-view mirror.

The car screeches to a halt. Redridge watches through the rear window as the driver's side door opens and the driver is KICKED OUT ONTO THE ASPHALT.
</DIRECTION>

The door closes again, the engine revs and the car TURNS AROUND, racing back down the road in the direction it came.

Eventually, she sees him. At first just a dot on the horizon. But unmistakably Eli. By now, she'd know him anywhere.

Suddenly the engine SPLUTTERS. She checks the fuel gauge; the needle deep in the red. She pounds the wheel in frustration.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... No!

</SOLARA>
<DIRECTION>
The car grinds to a halt, dead. She flings open the door and leaps out of the vehicle, rushing after Eli on foot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ELI. As always, his pace steady and slow. The sun directly ahead of him as it sets on the horizon. Headed always west.

Solara is running up behind him, a hundred yards back.

She holds out the sword, offering it to Eli by way of atonement.

<SOLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>

Eli and Solara follow the road through burned-out towns and retail neighborhoods. Gutted and dead, like every place else.

But something is different here. Things are greener. Tufts of grass here and there. They attract Solara's attention.

They keep on along the road. A shallow uphill incline. They follow it uphill, finally reaching its crest, where they stop and take in the view before them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PACIFIC OCEAN. Straddled by the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - the once-great structure has partially collapsed from decades of neglect and disrepair. The span sags and hangs low over the ocean, the asphalt cracked and ruptured.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the other side of the bay, SAN FRANCISCO - or the little that remains of it. The city has been almost TOTALLY DESTROYED - entire areas reduced to rubble, the few buildings still standing looking on the verge of collapse.
</DIRECTION>

Solara looks at it all in horrified awe. Eli, unperturbed, keeps on moving, still clutching his side.

Eli leads Solara through the rubble of what used to be San Francisco. It's like walking through the wreckage of 9/11's Ground Zero, but a hundred times the scale. Horrifying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pass by the wreckage of a HOTEL, nothing but the lobby still standing. A HILTON sign protruding from the rubble.

Eli uses his sheathed sword as a walking stick, poking around ahead of him for loose rubble underfoot. He steps carefully.

More buildings are still standing here, but they're nothing more than great dead monoliths. Solara looks up at the blasted skyscrapers - she's never seen anything like it.

Once a bustling oceanside tourist spot, now a ghost town.

Eli and Solara walk along the litter-strewn street, passing the old RIPLEY'S BELIEVE-IT-OR-NOT and WAX MUSEUMS. The celebrity mannequins are still in fair condition, but slumped at their feet are CHARRED HUMAN SKELETONS.

Eli is struggling now. He looks pale from the blood loss. His breathing labored. Solara takes him by the arm to help him.

A dead, ruined place, like everywhere else. We hear the sound of SEAGULLS nearby - the only sign of life at all.

Eli and Solara walk along the pier, until they reach its end. The original end has long since collapsed into the sea, but a RICKETY HAND-MADE ROPE BRIDGE has been affixed to the pier's sheared-off edge.

Eli and Solara stand at the pier's end, looking out to sea.

ALCATRAZ ISLAND

Looking much the same as it always has, old and dilapidated. The coastal fog shrouding it gives it an ethereal look. It feels almost like a mythic place - the "promised land" Eli has sought for so many years.

A tattered STARS AND STRIPES still flutters in the breeze atop the prison lighthouse.
</DIRECTION>

Eli and Solara arrive at the prison gates. Securely locked. As they inspect it for a possible way to enter:

In the opposite tower ANOTHER GUARD has his rifle trained on them too. Eli looks up, raises his hands.

Keeping the gun trained on them, the tower guard uses his free hand to talk into a WALKIE-TALKIE RADIO. We don't hear the conversation. All Eli and Solara can do is wait.

The guard puts away his radio and shouts back down:

Eli and Solara look at each other, then step gingerly inside.

As soon as they step inside they are SURROUNDED BY DOZENS OF HEAVILY-ARMED SOLDIERS. Not U.S. military, more like a semi- official militia. But every bit as deadly.

Eli and Solara raise their hands. A pair of SOLDIERS take Eli's pack and sword, pat them both down for other weapons.
