A SHELF OF BOOKS holds such classics as Dante's Inferno, Beyond Good and Evil, The Catcher in the Rye, and The Dark Knight Returns. A FRAMED DIPLOMA, dusty and unkempt, hangs askew on the wall. A snapshot of a girl is stuck in the corner, and a bra weighs one end down. A PHONE sits quietly atop a bundle of laundry. It suddenly explodes with a resounding ring-once, twice, three times. A CLOSET DOOR swings open, and a half-clad figure falls out. THE PHONE rings yet again, and a hand falls upon the receiver, yanking it off the trash can, O.C. THE RUMPLED FIGURE lays with his back to the camera, phone in hand.

THE PHONE RECEIVER slams into the cradle. THE RUMPLED FIGURE slowly sits up and remains motionless. He musses his hair and stands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DOG stands and wags its tail. A hand pats its head. The Rumpled Figure lays down on the bed. We now see his face. It is the face of DANTE and this is Dante's room; this is Dante's life. DANTE grabs the dog and wrestles it.

A very dark room barely lit by the daylight. Suddenly, the lights flick on, revealing the glorious interior of the convenience store. THE CAT looks at DANTE as he passes the camera quickly. THE PAPER BUNDLE is snapped open with a knife. Newspapers slam into the appropriate racks. One rack remains empty. A coffee filter is placed in a metal pot. Ground coffee follows, and the mix is shoved into place in the coffeemaker. The switch is flicked and the machine comes to life. The empty newspaper rack with the heading ASBURY PARK PRESS seems out of place among all the other stacks of papers. DANTE rubs his chin and stares, puzzled. He rolls his eyes as it occurs to him.

Through murky glass and thin metal grating, we see DANTE approach. He stops and drops a quarter in the slot. He pulls the door down, finally allowing us a clear view as he reaches toward the camera.

DANTE pulls a stack of newspapers from the Asbury Park Press vending machine. He struggles to hold them all in one hand as he lets the door slam shut. He turns to walk away, but the sound of the quarter dropping into the change slot stops him. He takes a step back to grab the coin.

The lock is gummed up with gum or something hard and obtrusive like gum, preventing the key from being inserted. DANTE looks around and kicks the shutter angrily. The car trunk pops open and a hand reaches inside, pulling out a folded white sheet.

	Okay, champ. What's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DIRECTION>
DANTE lifts his head and shoots her a disgusted look.
</DIRECTION>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, stupid question. But don't you think you're taking this a bit too hard?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too hard?! I don't have enough indignities in my life-people start throwing cigarettes at me!

	At least they weren't lit.

<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate this fucking place.

</DANTE>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then quit. You should be going to school anyway...

</VERONICA>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Veronica. Last thing I need is a lecture at this point.

</DANTE>
<VERONICA>

<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not even supposed to be here today!

</DANTE>
<VERONICA>

	I know. I stopped by your house and your mom said you left at like six or something.

	Why did you agree to come in then?

	I'm only here until twelve, then I'm gone. The boss is coming in.

	Why don't you open the shutters and get some sunlight in here?

	Who's fighting? Why are you so defensive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's defensive? Just...Would you just hug me?! All right? Your boyfriend was accosted by an angry mob, and he needs to be hugged.

She stares at him.

<DIRECTION>
VERONICA stares at him.

<DANTE>

</DANTE>
<DIRECTION>
VERONICA looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. You don't trust me, don't hug me. I see how it is. All right Pissy-pants, you just go on being suspicious and quiet. I don't even want to hug you at this point.
	</DIALOGUE>

VERONICA looks back at him.

A NOTE on the counter next to a small pile of money reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLEASE LEAVE MONEY ON THE COUNTER. TAKE CHANGE WHEN APPLICABLE. BE HONEST.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DANTE and VERONICA are slumped on the floor, behind the counter. VERONICA holds DANTE in her arms, his head on her chest. Change is heard hitting the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<DANTE>
<DIRECTION>
(to O.C. customer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANTE>
<DIRECTION>
The door is heard opening and closing-a customer leaving.
</DIRECTION>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much money did you leave up there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like three dollars in mixed change and a couple of singles. People only get the paper of coffee this time of morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANTE>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're trusting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you say that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANTE>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know they're taking the right amount of change? Or even paying for what they take?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Theoretically, people see money on the counter and nobody around, they think they're being watched.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANTE>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honesty through paranoia. Why do you smell like shoe polish?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had to use shoe polish to make that sign. The smell won't come off.
	</DIALOGUE>

<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think anyone can see us down here?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, right. You can't get enough of me.

<VERONICA>

<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you figure?

</DANTE>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You show some bedroom proficiency, and you think you're gods. What about what we do for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Women? Women, as lovers, are all basically the same: they just have to be there.

</DANTE>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Be there?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Making a male climax is not all that challenging: insert somewhere close and preferably moist; thrust; repeat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANTE>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How flattering.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, making a woman cum...therein lies a challenge.

</DANTE>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you think so?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A girl makes a guy cum, it's standard. A guy makes a girl cum, it's talent.

</DANTE>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I actually date you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANTE>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it takes more than that to get a guy off. Just "being there"-as you put it-is not enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I touched a nerve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANTE>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm astonished to hear you trivialize my role in our sex life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't directed at you. I was making a broad generalization.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANTE>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were making a generalization about "broads!"
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are my opinions based on my experiences with the few women who were good enough to sleep with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANTE>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many?

	We might have; I don't remember. How many?

<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Including you?

<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three including you.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. That's great. That's something to be proud of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANTE>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am. And that's why you should feel like a pig. You men make me sick. You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERONICA>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Animal, vegetable, or mineral.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANTE>
<VERONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vegetable meaning paraplegic.

<VERONICA>

<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. Name it.

<VERONICA>

	Can't we ever have a discussion without that coming up?

	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANTE>
<VERONICA>

	After he gets a blow job, he likes to have the cum spit back into his mouth while kissing. It's called snowballing.

	So?

	You could've broke it to me gently, you know; at least started by telling me you had a boyfriend. I told you I have a girlfriend.

	No, I wasn't. Not really. I told you'd I'd been seeing other people.

	Yeah, but not seriously. Christ, you're ready to walk down the aisle-I'd say that constitutes something more than just seeing somebody.

<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANTE>
<CAITLIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to marry him. I don't want to get married now. I'm on the verge of graduation. I want to go to grad school after this. And then I want to start a career. I don't want to be a wife first, and then have to worry about when I'' going to fit in all of the other stuff. I've come way too far and studied too hard to let my education go to waste as a housewife. And I know that's what I'd become. Sang's already signed with a major firm, and he's going to be pulling a huge salary, which would give me no reason to work, and he's so traditional anyway...

	Give me a bit more credit. I think it's time we got back together, you know. I'm more mature, you're more mature, you're finishing college, I'm already in the job market...

<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So...what? So we should just make pretend over the phone that we're dating?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you need a hug or something? 'Cause I would have no hang-ups about hugging you...you know, you being a guy and all. Just don't knead my ass when you do it.

<DIRECTION>
RANDAL exits. A second later, he reenters and tosses DANTE the sheet-sign.
</DIRECTION>
<RANDAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're closed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDAL>
<DIRECTION>
He exits. DANTE pushes the sign over from Open to Closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DANTE climbs behind the counter. He pops the register open and starts counting the drawer out. The door is heard opening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV JOHN: DANTE counting out the register, not looking up.
</DIRECTION>
<DANTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd you forget something?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks up, surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. I'm sorry, we're closed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DANTE>
<DIRECTION>
A gunshot blasts out. DANTE flies back, his chest exploding. He stares ahead and slumps to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHN walks behind the counter, stepping over DANTE'S body on the floor, and takes the money out of the register. He grabs a paper bag and jams the money in it. He grabs handfuls of change, shoves it in his pocket, and then quickly exits the frame. DANTE continues to lie on the floor.

CREDITS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Credits end, and the door is heard opening. A customer comes to the counter and stands there. He waits, looks around for a clerk, looks down the aisles.
</DIRECTION>
<CUSTOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Little help?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CUSTOMER>
<DIRECTION>
No reply. He looks around again, and glances at the door to make sure nobody's coming in. Then he reaches behind the counter and grabs a pack of cigarettes. He leaves.
</DIRECTION>
