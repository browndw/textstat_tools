INT. SARA'S LIVING ROOM - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Harry Goldfarb, young twenties, is an eccentric kid with a seductive smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to stop his mother, Sara Goldfarb, from locking herself in the closet.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ma! Ma! C'mon, Ma!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harold. Please. Not again the TV.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
She slams the door closed and Harry talks to the shut door.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you haveta make such a big deal out of this? Eh? You know you'll have the set back in a couple of hours.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
(frustrated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahhh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry walks across the room to the early eighties TV with ridiculous rabbit ears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara locks the door and retreats to the back of the closet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry starts to push the set on its stand when suddenly it jerks - almost falling. Harry spies a thick bicycle chain going from around the TV to the radiator.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus! Whatta ya tryin' to do, he? You tryin' to get me to break my own mother's set? Or break the radiator?

</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry marches to the closet.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>

	..an' maybe blow up the whole house? You tryin' to make me a killer? Your own son? Your own flesh and blood? WHATTA YA DOIN' TA ME? YOUR OWN SON!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Then, a thin key slowly peeks out from under the closet door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry works it out with his fingernail and yanks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you always gotta play games with my head for krist's sake?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Don't you have any considerations for my feelings? Why do you haveta make my life so difficult?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then, meekly from the closet -
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Harold, I wouldn't. The chain isn't for you. The robbers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why didn't you tell me? The set almost fell. I coulda had a heart attack.
	</DIALOGUE>

Sara shakes her head in the darkness.

<SARA>

</SARA>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>

Harry tries to open the locked closet door but can't.

<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See what I mean? See how you always gotta upset me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
Harry walks to the TV, unlocks the chain and starts to wheel the TV towards the front door. He pauses by the closet.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ma? Ma? C'mon out? Please, Ma.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
No response. Inside, Sara hugs her knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, he throws up his hands, mumbles -
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eh, screw it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
and pushes the set carefully out of the apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the closet, Sara hears the door shut. She mumbles to herself -
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not happening. And if it should be happening it would be alright, so don't worry, Seymour. It'll all work out. You'll see already. In the end it's all nice.

Old and squat Mr. Rabinowitz shakes his head as Harry and Tyrone push the set into his store.

He stands behind a cage of bulletproof glass with all of the pawn shop's possessions.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_RABINOWITZ>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TYRONE'S DIVE PAD - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyrone's pad is run down but it'll do. Tight on Harry back- spinning a record on the turntable and halting the beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he lets the other turntable spin and start a new tune.
</DIRECTION>
<TYRONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheeit, that's some boss scag, baby. I mean DYN-A-MITE.

Tyrone and Harry sit at the counter of an all-night donut shop, sipping hot chocolate and eating chocolate Crullers.

<TYRONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ya know what we oughta do, man? Huh? We oughta get a piece of this Brody shit and cut it and off it, ya dig?

<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This stuff's good enough to cut in half and still get you wasted. We could double our money. Easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<TYRONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. An' then we buy a couple a pieces an' we got something' else goin', man. It sure would be righteous.

	</DIALOGUE>
</TYRONE>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, a hulking Cop sits down on the stool next to Harry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyrone and Harry both fall silent and slowly sip their hot chocolates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry looks down at the Cop's gun. It's maybe six inches from his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, he reaches over and undoes the safety latch on the Cop's holster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tyrone's eyes fill with fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Waitress comes over and gives the Cop his office.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>

<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<DIRECTION>
Harry smiles as the Cop charges. Tyrone snickers. Then Harry tosses the gun over the Cop's head. Tyrone catches it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cop chases Tyrone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry and Tyrone laugh as they toss the gun back and forth just over the frustrated Cop's head. The Cop slips and falls on his ass and we -

Mr Rabinowitz shakes his head as Sara enters. He pulls out a ledger book that is labeled 'Sara Goldfarb's TV'.

<MR_RABINOWITZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening, Mrs Goldfarb.

Sara pulls a crinkled ten dollar bill out of the corner of her blouse and hands it to Mr Rabinowitz.

Sara chains the TV to the radiator again. She turns on the set, adjusts the rabbit ears and watches whatever is on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara smiles as she settles into her chair. She ceremoniously removes the plastic wrapper from around a box of chocolates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Immediately, she pulls out a chocolate, covered cream and lets it dissolve in her mouth. Her eyes shut in gentle ecstasy.

</OLD_LADY>

Harry mumbles again. When the buzzer rings we're on -

<DIRECTION>
THE ELEVATOR

and Marion jump around as they head to the -

PING! Harry dips his head out the open doors.

All clear. He grabs Marion and they dash to the -

Her phone rrrings and Sara leans towards it but she continues to adjust the rabbit ears on her set, torn between the priorty of the two activities.

Finally, four rings later, she lunges for the phone and flops down in her viewing chair. She is greeted by a Cheery Voice.

INT. SARA'S BEDROOM - A BIT LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara picks up a framed photo. The picture was taken on Harry's high school graduation day years ago. Harry, in the middle, is an eighteen-year-old in cap and gown. Sara's husband Seymour hovers over Harry's left shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On Harry's right is a younger-looking Sara. She is thirty pounds lighter, has brilliant red hair and wears a red dress and gold shoes. Sara stares at her outfit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she rushes to the closet. As she hums a tuneless monotone, she carefully pulls out the last dress on the hook.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She ceremoniously removes the dry-cleaning plastic and smiles at her red dress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She puts it on. In the mirror she looks over one shoulder and then the other. She tries to zip up the back, but after half an inch and many minutes of exertion she gives up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On her hands and knees, she searches through mounds of shoes for the special pair. She pulls out the gold shoes and dusts them off. Shakily, Sara puts them on. She smiles at herself in the mirror.

Sara sits in her viewing chair watching television and reading her diet book as she slides herself a chocolate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The diet book is called 'Ten Pounds in Ten Days.'
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She flips through about a hundred pages of introduction until she comes to the words, 'FIRST WEEK.'
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at the page and suddenly she becomes concerned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches for a chocolate-covered caramel as we read the page with her:

NOTE: Drink at least 2 quarts of water each day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara stares and chews Her eyes focus on the words, 'no' '1,' and '1/2'. They focus on the repetition of meals. They focus on the insanity, searching for the real information between the lines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hears a giggle and turns to look at the refrigerator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fridge tremors slightly -- a small mechanical rattle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Defeated, she drops the book and reaches for another chocolate. Her head starts to hang and tears begin to well up in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But then she notices something on the television.

There she is! Herself dressed in red, her hair gorgeous red, walking across the screen, so slim, so trim, so sexy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Such curves. This is Red Sara.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our Sara's tears fade as her chin lifts and she begins to smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She watches Red Sara pose for the television audience. She can hear the applause and the wolf whistles.

She puts the chocolates away and lifts up the book -- new hope.

Harry spins some vinyl, rolls a joint, sparks it and takes a few pokes. He starts grooving with the music as his nervousness dissolves.

Then something is off and Harry feels it. He stops the turntable.

Suddenly, it's a sunny day in Tyrone's bedroom. The back wall is gone and stretching into the sea is --

Now, strolling with a baby carriage is a woman in a red dress. It's Marion.

Harry watches her from Tyrone's apartment.

He calls for her but she keeps going. He chases after her.

He's trying to get a glimpse into the carriage. Finally, Marion hears him and she spins around. She smiles and waves.

She reaches into the carriage to pick something up. Harry is almost with her. He keeps running.

Everywhere she looks in the room steaming hot food appears.

Over there, by her plants, is a bacon doublecheese burger.

Then over there, by the lamp, is a chocolate-covered eclair.

She grabs a glass of water and downs it.

She turns away and goes into --

She flips off the light and tries to sleep.

She closes her eyes but they pop open. Then slowly her beige ceiling disappears and turns into a clear blue sky with puffy, white clouds. Then it dissolves into a sizzling, juicy pizza- pie.

Sara twists and turns. Then the pie turns into a chocolate- covered cherry. Then it becomes a bagel smothered with lox, onions and crowned with a healthy slice of tomato.

When the truck stops at the dock, two White Heavies emerge from the front cab. They wear ski masks and carry glistening machine guns.

Sara is terrified.

The fridge leaps towards her. Sara cries onto her wrinkled red dress.

INT. PSYCHE WARD - SHOCK THERAPY ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Someone sticks something between Sara's teeth. The people around her talk casually and laugh occasionally.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to look around but her body is immobile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She can make out shadows on the edges of her vision but mostly all she sees are the lights above her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she feels two cold metal discs placed against her temples.

INT. EMERGENCY OPERATING ROOM

<EMERGENCY_DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're taking it off at the shoulder. Let's move here people, otherwise we lose him.

</EMERGENCY_DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Harry remains semiconscious as the Anesthesiologist sticks a mask over his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everything starts to go white. The Emergency Doctor starts up a circular saw.

Before everything is gone, Harry witnesses the doctor cutting into his shoulder.

INT. BIG TIM'S LUSH PAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In slow motion and tight close-ups we experience the orgy with Marion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's nipples, tongues, sex toys, eyes closed in ecstasy, men's glares, men's smiles and the like. The images aren't sexy, they're scary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the girls holds up a double-headed dildo and says:
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What should we do now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
PERVERT SCREAMS OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<PERVERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ass to ass, ass to ass!
	</DIALOGUE>

Marion complies and the flashlights shine. Then the Pervert starts a chant:
</DIRECTION>
<PERVERT>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cum! Cum!

<DIRECTION>
Marion is at first afraid. Then, she closes her eyes. Her lips start to quiver. Big Tim's smile gets wider and wider and wider.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then Marion comes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

INT. PSYCHE WARD - SHOCK THERAPY ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara's arched and stiffened body looks as if fire has just shot through her body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes are almost popping out of her head as her mind screams AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She settles for a moment on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her heart does not beat, her lungs do not breathe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later, the breath returns. Then the heartbeat slowly emerges. And then, the Technician:
</DIRECTION>

	OK, ready and two.

INT. PSYCHE WARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once again Sara tries to scream in pain. Flames seem to sear every cell of her body and her bones feel like they are being twisted and crushed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smoke simmers off of her hair and skin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As her body settles, it happens one last time:
</DIRECTION>
<TECHNICIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK, ready and three.

SMASH CUT TO:

EXT. CONEY ISLAND PIER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pier stretches off into the beautiful sea. A woman in a red dress walks a baby carriage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we're on Harry, looking healthy and vibrant. He screams for Marion!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But she doesn't hear him and she keeps walking. He runs after them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he gets close, he suddenly stops. Marion turns around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches to hug her. But, as he does we are in --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harry gets terrified. He starts to scream for Marion.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marion? Marion?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<DIRECTION>
He steps backwards off the edge of a cliff and rushes headfirst into a concrete sidewalk as he screams:

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM
</DIRECTION>

An Angelic Nurse looks down upon Harry. Tubes stick into every part of him. His eyes are half-open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She wipes the sweat from his brow.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ANGELIC_NURSE>

	It's alright. Don't worry. You're in a hospital and you're going to be just fine.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's that? She'll be sent for. She'll come. She loves you and she'll come.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANGELIC_NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
Then Harry opens his eyes fully. For a moment he understands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is an adult and he is calm.
</DIRECTION>
<HARRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARRY>
<ANGELIC_NURSE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the foot of Marion's couch are the torn and smeared sketches of Marion's designs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marion comes in through the front door. She walks across the sketches and sits on the couch. She has lipstick smeared across her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls out a large bag of dope and stares at it. Happily, she fondles the bag. Then, she hugs it tight against her bosom. Slowly, she curls up into a fetal position, content.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

INT. JAIL DORMITORY

The work gang collapse onto their individual bunks. Tyrone, sweaty and dirty, does the same.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He fights the cramps in his stomach for as long as he can until he passes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, Tyrone and his bed dissolve into the past. Young Tyrone rests in his mom's generous arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, it is peaceful. Tyrone's mom brushes the tears from his eyes.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ada and Rae sit in the corner of the room stunned by their surroundings. Mounted on the wall is a television. Tappy Tibbons is on. No one is watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara shuffles towards them and they barely recognize her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her grey roots match her grey skin which matches her grey gown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ada starts taking food out of a large shopping bag.
</DIRECTION>
<ADA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got some lox and cream cheese and bagels and blintzes with sour cream and some danishes and pastrami and chopped liver on rye with mustard and onions and a container of tea and... How are you, Dolly?

</ADA>
<DIRECTION>
But Sara doesn't answer. She can't. They put their hands on their friend's shoulders but nothing seems to reach her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then they notice that water is dripping down Sara's leg and onto the floor. Sara has urinated on herself.

Sara lies on her bed. A tiny smile emerges on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We get closer and closer to her until we go into the blackness of her pupil.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deep in the blackness we see another world. It is a world of PRIMARY BLUE. And sucking us into the blue is the roar of a crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And there with a giant smile is good ol' Tappy in black tie.
</DIRECTION>

He looks into the camera and says:

They hug and they hug as the audience scream their applause.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A smile fills Sara's beautiful face. Happiness. Total and complete love.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Except for the truth, the nagging reality. It means tears for Sara and her sparkling eyes well up with fantastic, warm tears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But they don't damage her glorious smile.
