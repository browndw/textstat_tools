An aerial shot of a magnificent island estate. An Italianate wonder of Florentine architecture. Armed guards patrol the grounds. The telecaption reads "Capulet Mansion."

EXT. CAPULET MANSION. DAY/NIGHT.

JUMP CUT: Aerial shot of Capulet Mansion. We time lapse from late afternoon to night; fairy lights illuminate, guests appear, music swells, and a single incandescent flare, explodes pink against the inky sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: Romeo: his face glows pink. He is sitting on the grubby shoreline of Verona Bay dressed as a boy King Arthur, with fake chain mail and sword.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Romeo watches the dying flare sink into the bay. The sound of the party drifts across the water. Balthasar, dressed as Frankenstein's monster, touches a lighter to a large bong and Romeo inhales smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them, Benvolio, drunk and dressed as a pizza, is yelling at Gregory, who, dressed as a Viking, is trying to cut slices off his pizza costume. Sampson, also dressed as a Viking, sits in the back of a car. One arm is bandaged and he swigs from a bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the darkness is slashed by headlights. A reckless sports car speeds toward the boys. Stereo screaming, the car skids to a halt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: Music blares from the sound system. A silver stilettoed foot emerges from the car and plants itself firmly in the dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: The boys, eyes wide with amazement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: Another stiletto follows the first. Guitar groans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAN: Slowly up a shapely pair of black stockinged legs, past a hint of garter belt to a black sequined mini-skirt and up over a muscular dark skinned stomach and tiny sequined bra top, to discover: the 21 year old male, African American face of MERCUTIO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: The boys. Recovering from the initial shock, they laugh and cat-call raucously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: Mercutio. He roughly jams a short black wig onto his head and yells above the music.
</DIRECTION>
<MERCUTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strike drum!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERCUTIO>
<DIRECTION>
Mercutio magically produces invitations from somewhere within his mini-skirt and dances down the beach to the boys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aggressively bumping and grinding, Mercutio distributes the invitations. Reaching Romeo, he declares:
</DIRECTION>
<MERCUTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll on without apology.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERCUTIO>
<DIRECTION>
Romeo lets the invitation fall to the sand.
</DIRECTION>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not for this ambling. Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<DIRECTION>
Romeo pulls on the bong once more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Mercutio is upon Romeo. Hauling him to his feet, he waltzes him through the sand.
</DIRECTION>
<MERCUTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERCUTIO>

Mercutio in mock sympathy.
</DIRECTION>
<MERCUTIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too great oppression for a tender thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERCUTIO>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>

Romeo lies staring up at the stars.
</DIRECTION>
<MERCUTIO>

With the rush of a mind altering cocktail, we ZOOM IN on Romeo's eyes; they shimmer with the shooting star reflection of exploding fireworks - a bending Eastern chord, we launch into Donna Summer's 'I Feel Love', sung by the vocalist from Soundgarden with orchestration by 'Deconstruction' and sitar by Ravi Shankar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MERCUTIO'S CAR - ON FREEWAY. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL OUT: From Romeo's eyes. He is lying in the passenger seat of Mercutio's convertible as it rockets along the freeway. The camera is directly above Romeo. He stares up at the fireworks that reflect in the windshield. The car and freeway begin to rotate and the camera follows. We feel that the car is now travelling upside-down. The camera sways through a brilliant explosion of fireworks that fill the screen with a zillion pixilating, colored dots of fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAPULET'S MANSION - BALLROOM. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL OUT: To discover the glittering dots of fire refracting from the sparkling domed roof of the magnificently ornate Capulet Ballroom. The camera swoops down over bizarrely costumed revellers cavorting to a driving Latin big band. The camera partners with a drugged Mercutio and Benvolio who shamelessly caper with each other in a mock antic adagio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: Romeo gazing blankly at the dance floor.

CUT TO: Mercutio. He sweeps up a thirty-something sophisticate and twirls her in Romeo's direction.

CUT TO: ROMEO'S P.O.V.: Contorted images of costumed guests eat, drink and laugh in a grotesque collision of Yves Saint Laurent cocktail party and Bacchanalian romp.
</DIRECTION>

Suddenly a large arm coils around Romeo's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISTORTED EXTREME CLOSE UP: A seriously intoxicated Fulgencio Capulet; his puffy red face squeezes against Romeo's.

<DIRECTION>
Blood drums in Romeo's ears. Breaking free from Capulet's grasp as he pushes through the crowd toward the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silent, underwater shot. Romeo's tranquil features submerged in a basin of water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEAT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a gasp, Romeo rises. A moment. His breathing calms. Then, smoothing water into his hair, he gazes into the bathroom mirror. He turns:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entire wall opposite the mirror, is a magnificent salt- water fish tank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Romeo, drawn by it's submarine beauty, leans against the fish tank. Applause echoes faintly through the bathroom speakers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BALLROOM. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the applause dies, a dark-haired Latina Diva takes the spotlight. The band ease into the opening bars of a love ballad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the music swells, Romeo watches a moustached catfish glide past a medieval castle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Romeo pulls away. Peering back at him through the castle is a pair of exquisitely beautiful angelic eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Diva's first pure, achingly beautiful notes soar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Confused, Romeo looks again. There is no mistake - it is a girl. Through a shimmering curtain of ribbon weed, two dark wide eyes, a childish nose and sumptuous full lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Romeo pushes his face closer to the glass. The other face snaps abruptly away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POWDER ROOM. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: Juliet, dressed as an angel, on the other side of the tank. We now realise that the girls' powder room and the boys' bathroom are divided by this watery wonder world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juliet warily moves closer to the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>

Romeo leans his face against the glass. The love ballad builds.

<DIRECTION>
SLOW TRACK: From Romeo's profile, in through the water, and...

INT. POWDER ROOM. NIGHT.

<DIRECTION>
...out the other side, to find Juliet in profile, peering into the tank.

Romeo presses his nose lightly against the glass.

Suddenly, CRASH! The door slams open. Juliet turns, startled. It is the Nurse.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Juliet, your mother calls.

<DIRECTION>
The Nurse bustles Juliet out the door. Juliet looks over her shoulder at the mystery boy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BALLROOM. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Romeo, now without his mask, slams out of the bathroom - Juliet and the Nurse have disappeared into the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: Juliet being dragged along by the Nurse. She glances back toward the mystery boy, but he is gone.
</DIRECTION>

Juliet and the Nurse rejoin Dave Paris, who is dressed as an astronaut, and Gloria, at the side of the dance floor.

Dave, irresistible smile, extends his hand to Juliet.

	Will you now deny to dance?

Juliet looks to Dave, desperately searching for a reason to decline. Gloria, brushing aside her silly daughter's protests, slugs the last of her champagne and corrals them onto the dance floor.

As Juliet is dragged onto the floor her eyes furtively search for the boy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: Romeo in the crowd. Desperate to find the girl, he roughly shunts aside a reveller dressed as Lucifer, Prince of Darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLD ON: Lucifer. He removes his mask: it is Tybalt. He turns to Abra, who's dressed as a demon.

<TYBALT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis he.

</TYBALT>
<CAPULET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Content thee gentle coz, let him alone. I would not for the wealth of all this town Here in my house do him disparagement. Therefore be patient; take no note of him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPULET>
<DIRECTION>
Tybalt can't believe it.
</DIRECTION>
<TYBALT>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, goodman boy! I say he shall! Go to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPULET>
<DIRECTION>
Capulet violently shoves Tybalt to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPULET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll make a mutiny among my guests!

</CAPULET>
<DIRECTION>
A middle aged couple look on shocked - Capulet waves to them

<DIRECTION>
FESTIVELY:
</DIRECTION>
<CAPULET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Cheerly my hearts!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPULET>
<DIRECTION>
Capulet snorts at Tybalt in disgust.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPULET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll not endure him! Am I the master here or you? Go to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPULET>
<DIRECTION>
Smoothing his hair into place, Capulet turns back into the ballroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: Tybalt choking back tears of rage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: Romeo moving through the crowd. For a moment the crush clears and he spies the Angel on the dance floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: Romeo whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did my heart love till now? Forswear it, sight. For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<DIRECTION>
Romeo begins to circumnavigate the dance floor in an attempt to get closer to Juliet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: Dave slow dancing with Juliet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juliet's eyes search the room for the boy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: Romeo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: Juliet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes connect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juliet looks quickly back to Dave who, oblivious, returns his most devastating smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: The songstress, her voice soars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: Juliet. Unable to look away from the boy, she stares over Dave's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: Romeo. Ignoring the danger, he continues to move toward the Angel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the Diva's spiralling final notes, the ballad concludes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A complete black out. As the crowd break into wild applause, Juliet's eyes search the darkness, but the boy is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd cheers and screams its applause. An avalanche of balloons, tinsel and confetti rains down from the roof; swathes of red silk drop from the ceiling and the space is transformed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: Juliet, searching for the boy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly: A gasp, Juliet's eyes widen, shocked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the dark, a hand has shot out from the drape curtaining off the stage and clasped hers. Juliet barely dares breathe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She glances furtively to Dave Paris - he watches the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly Juliet turns toward the hand; there through a break in the curtain she can see eye, cheek and lips of the mystery boy. As the Diva reprises the chorus, Romeo gently pulls Juliet behind the curtain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEHIND CURTAIN. NIGHT.

Concealed from the party by the red velvet drape, hands still clasped, the teenagers are so close their bodies almost touch.

	This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this. My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

</HAND>
<DIRECTION>
Romeo moves his lips toward Juliet's. She stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this. For saints have hands that pilgrim's hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

	O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do, They pray: grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

They kiss again.

Suddenly a harsh light falls across the entwined couple. They break apart - Nurse has pulled open the curtain and stands eyeing them severely.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

She takes firm control of her charge.

Juliet furtively motions for the startled Romeo not to follow as he trails them across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: ROMEO'S P.O.V.: The Nurse and Juliet reach the door, but instead of leaving, they turn and ascend the staircase that arcs around to the mezzanine level. They join a vexed Gloria Capulet who clings to a patient Dave Paris.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inaudible words are exchanged. Juliet flickers her eyes nervously to Romeo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: Romeo. He halts at the foot of the stairs unsure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: Gloria. Catching Juliet's interest in the boy, she indicates to her daughter to 'COME ALONG'.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: Romeo; a dawning realisation.

<ROMEO>

(under his breath)

An orchestral treatment of Joy Division's "Love will tear us Apart" swells;

CUT TO: Mercutio. He throws himself upon the shell shocked Romeo.

EXT. CAPULET MANSION - MAIN ENTRANCE. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: Mercutio's convertible and its noisy confederacy joining the line of departing limos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge sign combusts into blinding fireworks that write in giant words "CAPULET."

As the convertible passes beneath the blazing words, Romeo turns. Through a deluge of falling sparks, he glimpses the mystery girl high up in the tower.

Warm wind blows the smoke from the expended fireworks. Juliet closes the window and leans against the glass.
</DIRECTION>

CRANE DOWN: The side of the building past revellers who don't know when to leave. Standing in the front doorway is someone else who cannot take their eyes off the departing Romeo. It is Tybalt. The music darkens as we push through the smoky wind.

	Romeo! Humours! Madman! Passion! Lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh. And the demesnes that there adjacent lie, That in thy likeness thou appear to us!

Romeo hauls himself up onto the wall. Below is a Greco- Roman style pool area. To the right the darkened rear wing of Capulet Mansion. Suddenly the back of the house explodes with light. Romeo takes cover.

	But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?

Romeo's question is answered as out onto the verandah comes Juliet. She is still clad in her angel robe, but without the halo and wings. She slowly descends to pool level.

<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Tis but thy name that is my enemy. Thou are thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? It is not hand nor foot Nor arm nor face nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? That which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet. So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name, And for thy name, which is no part of thee, Take all myself.

Romeo wildly calls:

Juliet drags Romeo firmly into the grotto.

	I know thou wilt say 'Ay', and I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swearest, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully. Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won, I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay, So thou wilt woo. But else, not for the world. In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond, And therefore thou mayst think my 'haviour light. But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true Than those that have more cunning to be strange.

	Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'it lightens.' Sweet, good night. This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast.

	Well, you have made a simple choice. You know not how to choose a man. Romeo? No, not he. Though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's and for a hand and a foot and a body, though they be not to be talked on, yet they are past compare. He's not the flower of courtesy, but I'll warrant him as gentle as a lamb. Go thy ways, wench, serve God. What, have you dined at home?

The music swells in celebration. Romeo and Juliet, now newly-wed, rush from the side door of the church. The priest follows, throwing handfuls of rice. Peter studiously takes a snap as the bride and groom kiss.

Peter holds the door of the limousine open. Reluctantly Juliet gets into the car.

Another incredible sleight of hand routine and Mercutio has managed to draw Benvolio's pistol, retrieve his own gun, and trap Benvolio with a barrel at each temple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The joke has worn thin for Benvolio; he pushes past Mercutio toward where Balthasar, Sampson and Gregory lounge in the shade of the beach-side hang.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he stops dead - a monstrous black sedan prowls into the beach side parking lot.

Romeo turns, and to the amazement of all, walks back to his car. Tybalt, unable to shoot him in the back, is confused. He hurls himself into his sedan.

Tybalt's anger must be answered. He ceremoniously disarms, gives his weapon to Abra, and sprints after Romeo who is now passing a beach side lot that houses an abandoned grand hotel. A bone-cracking kick sends Romeo crumbling into the vacant lot. The boys swarm toward the fray. Romeo, still refusing the fight, scrambles up the stairs of the deserted hotel. Tybalt trips him and Romeo careens into an ornamental wooden railing, smashing it to pieces.

Tybalt kicks savagely at the helpless Romeo.

The rap, rap, rap is very loud now. We move toward Romeo and realise he cannot hear the knocking because he has Walkman headphones on.

<DIRECTION>
The heraldic 'Wedding Chimes' by JS Bach. Juliet stands resplendent in a radiant bridal gown. The image floats ethereally in a towering slab of mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL OUT: From the mirror. The wedding dress is in fact being held in front of Juliet by two members of the house staff. Juliet is dressed in her night gown. The Nurse suggests various pairs of shoes.

Alone now, Juliet hurries to her bedside drawer. She cautiously removes a rolled piece of cloth from which she produces the glass vial.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
	</DIALOGUE>

She cautiously begins to unscrew the tiny black lid. Suddenly, a knock at her door. Palming the vial, Juliet swings around to meet the arrival of her mother. Gloria probes her daughter's uneasiness.

The room is in darkness but for patterns of moonlight through windows.

The sky is filled with green and grey clouds. A gusty rain blows the flower arrangements across the lawn. Large white wedding marquees flap in the wind.
</DIRECTION>

Through blurring rain, we see ambulances and police vehicles, lights flashing. Father Laurence, accompanied by a dour looking man in black, alights from his car. We follow their P.O.V.: We hear snatches of radio calls.

Moving swiftly toward a doorway, the music builds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAPULET MANSION - JULIET'S BEDROOM. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens. On the bed Juliet's still body. Father Laurence closes the door. The priest kneels and hastily examines Juliet's pupils. He looks to the man in black who retrieves the glass vial from the floor and pockets it.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On view, enshrined in literally thousands of lit candles, is Juliet's peaceful body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move through lines of Capulet mourners. In the shadows of the front door a young man hides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: The young man. We recognise the distressed face of Balthasar.

PUSH IN: Balthasar rushes from the Mausoleum.

EXT. MANTUA. DAY.

We are high above Mantua. Beyond the trailer park stretches a long ribbon of black highway.

As a Speed Express van turns off the highway and into the park, we hear Romeo's voice over:

His voice over continues.

Romeo yells joyously.

<DIRECTION>
Balthasar does not know how to say what he has come to tell. He looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<BALTHASAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then she is well and nothing can be ill. Her body sleeps in Capels' monument, And her immortal part with angels lives. I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault.

</BALTHASAR>

For a long moment Romeo is profoundly still. When he speaks, it is with a chilling calm.
</DIRECTION>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it e'en so?

Balthasar nods.

As silent tears begin to flow, Romeo turns his face to the setting sun.

Romeo shoves a wad of money at THE APOTHECARY'S face.

Standing in the doorway is The Apothecary. Sixty something, he has a face scarred with age and abuse.

PULL BACK: The Apothecary's apartment is filled with cats. Dozens of feline eyes glow in the dim room. Romeo stands nervously. The Apothecary extracts a small chemist's vial from inside a 'Statue of Our Lady' table lamp - he now speaks with cool professionalism.

WHIP PAN: The patrol car is almost upon them when... in a seemingly suicidal manoeuvre Balthasar throws his car into a right-angle turn across four lanes of oncoming traffic. Horns blare.

Suddenly a hurricane wind and whirr of machinery: like a huge black insect, Captain Prince's chopper swoops down over the mausoleum.

Romeo is caught in the glare of the chopper's burning arc light. Sirens scream, police units race through the cemetery. Blinded, Romeo fires wildly toward the chopper.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACK: Down the marble corridor lit by the eternal flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISCOVER: Romeo. He weakly stands at the entrance to the viewing chapel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chapel is dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Romeo's eyes adjust he can just see, picked out by a shaft of blue moonlight, the glowing figure of a sleeping girl. He moves down the aisle past the tombs of long-dead Capulets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Romeo is close now. He halts as if in the presence of an unbelievable vision. He lights a match and the room glows gold. The warm light reveals a Juliet even more beautiful in seeming death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Romeo lights some of the hundreds of candles that surround her.
</DIRECTION>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O my love, my wife, Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath, Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty, Thou art not conquered. Beauty's ensign yet Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks, And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<DIRECTION>
Romeo kneels close, as if not wanting to wake a sleeping child. Unconscious tears fall from his eyes as he whispers.
</DIRECTION>
<ROMEO>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, dear Juliet, why art thou yet so fair? Shall I believe that unsubstantial

</ROMEO>
<DEATH>

	From this world-wearied flesh.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
He lays himself close.
</DIRECTION>
<ROMEO>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eyes, look your last. Arms, take your last embrace. And, lips, O you The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<DIRECTION>
Gently Romeo kisses Juliet's lips. Ever so slightly, Juliet's hand moves - Romeo does not notice.
</DIRECTION>
<ROMEO>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A dateless bargain to engrossing death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<DIRECTION>
Romeo drinks from the vial; the power of the compound is immediate. He convulses and falls, his head resting on Juliet.
</DIRECTION>
<ROMEO>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT.) (fighting for breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O true apothecary, thy drugs are quick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<DIRECTION>
Behind Romeo's head we can see Juliet's eyes opening. Romeo sucks the last few breaths of life into his lungs. Through a blurry consciousness Juliet becomes aware of Romeo.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Romeo, what's here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIET>
<DIRECTION>
Forcing herself up, she cradles his head in her arms. Romeo's clear wide eyes stare back, he is completely still but for the sound of weak breaths desperately drawn across motionless lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juliet finds the vial clenched in Romeo's hand. Tears slip from her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIET>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drunk all, and left No friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Haply some poison yet doth hang on
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIET>
<THEM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To make me die with a restorative.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEM>
<DIRECTION>
She delicately kisses Romeo's lips.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIET>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT.) (a heart-broken whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thy lips are warm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIET>
<DIRECTION>
Desperately the lovers cling to each other. With all his desire to stay alive, Romeo whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thus with a kiss I die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<DIRECTION>
There is no breath. He is still. Silence. Sobbing, Juliet hugs the lifeless Romeo to her.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Romeo. O' my true love Romeo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIET>
<DIRECTION>
She looks to the gun in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACK: Quickly past Captain Prince and the Capulets taking cover behind a patrol car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two police officers urgently convey Montague and his wife toward them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Discover Father Laurence arriving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: Father Laurence's P.O.V.: Patrol cars, lights flashing, surround the mausoleum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees, through the open door of a police car, a hand- cuffed youth. It is Balthasar. Father Laurence hurries to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is dawning on Father Laurence.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_LAURENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Balthasar?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_LAURENCE>
<BALTHASAR>
<DIRECTION>
(DESPERATELY)

<FATHER_LAURENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long hath he been there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_LAURENCE>
<BALTHASAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Full half an hour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BALTHASAR>
<DIRECTION>
Father Laurence turns towards the mausoleum.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_LAURENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Romeo.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a shock of realisation)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The lady stirs...

INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.

<DIRECTION>
TRACK SLOW TOWARD: Juliet: Sobbing uncontrollably she prises the gun from Romeo's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Father Laurence, desperate, breaks through the police line and runs toward the mausoleum.
</DIRECTION>

	Hold! Go not forth!

Juliet turns the gun on herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: Father Laurence, he screams as he mounts the mausoleum stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_LAURENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The lady stirs!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_LAURENCE>
<DIRECTION>
CRACK! The sound of a single gun shot rips through the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: Captain Prince.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: The parents, a look of cold shock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: The priest - his cry echoes through the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Juliet lies peacefully on Romeo's chest. Her eyes awake. A wash of deep red blood floods across them both. As we move away from the forms of the two young lovers lit by a ring of candles, the police burst in, guns ready to resolve what has already been resolved. Continuing up, we pass through the glass dome of the viewing chapel, and over the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAUSOLEUM. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There, huddled at the base of the Mausoleum steps, are the Montague and Capulet parents and Father Laurence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From high up we see Captain Prince emerge from the Mausoleum and speak to the group. A moment, then their cries float gently up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKY. NIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are travelling high into the sky now. The cries of the parents and the buzz of radio calls fade to nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VERONA BEACH STREET - CHRIST ROUNDABOUT-FROM AIR. DAWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the sun struggled to rise, we push toward the figure of Jesus silently surveying the city.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VERONA BEACH - CHRIST ROUNDABOUT. DAWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Jesus' face fills the screen, droplets of water begin to streak his cheeks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLD: Music swells; the droplets grow to a torrent, and a heavy rain begins to fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a long beat, we stay with this image.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRANE DOWN: From the Jesus. A sea of black umbrellas stretches back from the steps of Freedom Tower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FREEDOM TOWER. DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the top of the steps are a pair of flower strewn caskets. Before the caskets stand Fulgencia and Gloria Capulet, and Ted and Caroline Montague. They stare with blank, uncomprehending sorrow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Among the crowd we see the distraught faces of Benvolio, Balthasar, Father Laurence and the Nurse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The caskets are gently slid into a pair of long black cars. Montague and Capulet descend the stairs. Captain Prince blocks their path. He holds them in his gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN_PRINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See what a scourge is laid upon your hate, That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love; And I, for winking at your discords too, Have lost a brace of kinsmen. All are punished.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN_PRINCE>
<DIRECTION>
The Prince steps aside. The procession moves off. Montague and Capulet look to one another, a moment, and then the two adversaries together follow the bodies of their dead children.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AERIAL SHOT: The rain falls. Two black cars lead the people of Verona Beach in a sorrowful parade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the cars pass beneath the towering effigy of Jesus, the image pixilates into a television picture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL OUT: A TV anchor woman watches the image on a studio monitor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns:
</DIRECTION>
<ANCHOR_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to camera)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A glooming peace this morning with it brings: The sun for sorrow will not show his head. Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things. Some shall be pardoned, and some punished, For never was a story of more woe Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANCHOR_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The anchor woman changes beat to the next story; but her dialogue fades, and her image gets smaller as the television recedes into a black distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music that reminds us most of these two lost lives swells. When the television is very small it is switched off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK SCREEN. HOLD A BEAT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
