INT. BUNK CAR The dormitory of the section gang. The men are through for the day and lounging on their bunkbeds. DUFF ANDERSON plays checkers with FRANKIE, using bottle tops as pieces. Duff makes the winning move and Frankie, disgusted, turns over the board. He saunters over to JOCKO, who is shaving in a broken mirror. Frankie watches him with a grin.

STREET (Night) Duff is walking along the deserted street in the black part of town.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Music from the pool hall fades and we pick up the strains of gospel singing from a nearby church.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHURCH The choir is singing "Precious Lord." The women are spirited and the congregation in the small wooden building is alive to the music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duff appears in the open doorway and stops to listen.
</DIRECTION>

When the song ends, REVEREND DAWSON rises from his chair.
</DIRECTION>
<REVEREND>

CHURCH YARD Long tables laden with food are lit by strings of lightbulbs. The sound of a gospel piano from inside the church.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A smiling middle-aged woman has taken Duff in tow and leads him over to a young woman (JOSIE), who is serving food.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Josie - this is Brother Anderson. Now you give him some of that good food. He's a fine young man.

(on her way)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ain't it a wonderful meetin'?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Duff studies Josie with a smile. She is clearly middle class. While she puts food on a paper plate, she glances at him - matching his ironic detachment with her own. She hands him the plate
</DIRECTION>
<DUFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.

I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DUFF
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Don't look like there's a right way.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	REVEREND DAWSON
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DUFF
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
It ain't in me.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

I guess I'll rob a bank.

Oh yeah? (he gets up) Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	REVEREND DAWSON
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DUFF
	</DIALOGUE>

Hey, Duff! Run the truck down Holly Road. There's a guy in the ditch.
</DIRECTION>

CAB OF TOW TRUCK (Night) Duff is driving along a wooded country road. Shreds of fog drift across the headlights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ditched car comes into view, its front end crushed against a tree. A tubby white man stands beside it, waving to Duff with a flashlight. Duff passes him and backs up to the car.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OWNER
	</DIALOGUE>

Most folks around here got no use for nigrahs. Got to understand them, that's all. How you doin', boy?
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

He gets back under the car.

<DIRECTION>
That's the trouble with you boys! Don't listen when a man tells you something.

<DIRECTION>
Don't do her no good to get banged like that.

<DIRECTION>
(enraged) What did you say, boy?!

GAS STATION (Night) Duff is changing a tire outside the repair bay.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A car shoots out of the dark with its horn blaring, and screeches to a stop at the pump.

<DIRECTION>
Brad Ellis steps up to the driver.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ELLIS
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Can I help you?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driver is the white mill hand who gave Duff a hard time at the mill.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DRIVER
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating Duff) Like some service from that boy there. Like the way he takes care of us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELLIS Okay.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duff has come over. He is aware of impending trouble. One of the men in the car is the owner of the ditched vehicle.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DUFF
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Fill her up?
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DRIVER
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
No, boy. Thirty-eight cents worth of gas. And watch you don't make it thirty-nine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duff starts the pump.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DRIVER
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Didn't hear you say "Yessir!" Don't they say "Yessir" where you come from?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duff finishes pumping and puts the nozzle back onto the pump.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DRIVER
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Boy - you hear me?!
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DUFF

	SECOND WHITE

<DIRECTION>
How 'bout this windshield, boy? Like a little service.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duff takes a moment before moving to the windshield and wiping it. The men inside the car watch him through the glass.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	THIRD WHITE
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hell, they're getting' too big for their britches.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SECOND WHITE
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Yeah, his wife's the same way, struttin' through town like she owns the place - shakin' that little rear end.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	THIRD WHITE

<DIRECTION>
It's all that education they're getting.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DRIVER
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Real cool, ain't he! Just like we're not here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duff moves over to the driver.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DUFF
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DRIVER
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
You in a big hurry, boy?
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SECOND WHITE

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Bet she's pretty hot, huh?
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DUFF
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(very tense) You watch your mouth, man!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driver has finally found a way of getting to Duff and a grin spreads over his face.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DRIVER
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
I bet she's a sly little nigger, that girl. Wouldn't mind a piece of her myself!
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DUFF
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
All right, you get out of here, man!
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DRIVER
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(exploding) Who're you tellin' to get, boy?! You watch it, or there'll be some dyin' done 'round here!
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DUFF
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He steps away from the car, a hand on the rear pocket where he keeps his knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the backseat, the owner of the ditched car looks nervous.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OWNER
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Let's go, Al. He ain't worth it.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DRIVER
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning on him) Now you stay out of it!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brad Ellis has come over.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ELLIS
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
What's goin' on?
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DRIVER
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
You better get rid of this white-eyed nigger!
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ELLIS
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Duff) What happened?
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DRIVER
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Never mind! You keep him workin' here and this place won't be around. And I ain't kiddin'!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He guns the engine and shoots out of the service station in a cloud of dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duff looks at Ellis, whose next move is predictable, and leaves the frame to run a water hose over the back of his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ellis stops next to him.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ELLIS
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Guess we got trouble.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DUFF
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
I'm sorry, Duff.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DUFF

<DIRECTION>
(tossing down the hose) Don't tell me. I know.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUFF AND JOSIE'S LIVING ROOM (Night) Duff enters.

Josie comes out of the bedroom in her nightgown. She has been waiting up.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	JOSIE
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
I called the gas station. I've been worried.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duff slumps down on the sofa, utterly discouraged.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DUFF
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hell, if they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. Don't make no difference no-how.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	JOSIE
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(anxiously) What d'you mean?
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Nothin. Quit lookin' at me like that!

<DIRECTION>
He gets up.

<DIRECTION>
(approaching him) Duff, I love you.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DUFF

Well, that don't do me one bit of good!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She touches him.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	JOSIE
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Come on, Duff - let's go to bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gives her a sudden, violent shove. It sends her sprawling to the floor. She picks herself up, weeping.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DUFF
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
I never should have married you in the first place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at her.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DUFF
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Ain't you goin' to say something?
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	JOSIE
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
There's nothing to say.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Well, that'll be the first time.

<DIRECTION>
He leaves the room.

	JOSIE
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
I don't think that'll happen.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DUFF
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	JOSIE
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
You're not a man because of a job, Duff.

	DUFF
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
You don' know nothin' 'bout it, baby. Nothin'! And don't kid yourself - you did your bit.

He closes his bag.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DUFF
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
What is it? What's the matter?
