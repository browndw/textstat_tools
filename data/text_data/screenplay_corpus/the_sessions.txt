<DIRECTION>
A busy intersection near the UC Berkeley campus. A strange, self-propelled motorized gurney whirrs into view and makes its way over a pedestrian crosswalk. The passenger, MARK O'BRIEN, in his early 30s, is visible only from the neck up. The rest of him is covered by a blanket. He operates the gurney with a mouth control and a set of mirrors positioned around his head.

<DIRECTION>
THE SCENE CHANGES to the interior of a large auditorium. A graduation ceremony is in progress. Suddenly, everyone in the hall, GRADUATES, their FAMILIES, ACADEMICS and OTHERS, rise to their feet as Mark, in his gurney, buzzes across the stage, a mortar board hung on one of the handles.

SUPER CAPTION: "A FEW YEARS LATER" EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MARK'S. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is about 4.00 a.m. All is quiet. We follow a mean-looking alley cat to the front of a modest, ground-floor apartment. It pauses, then slinks round the side, onto a ledge and in through a partially-opened window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARK'S PLACE. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cat comes through the window, hops onto the floor and quickly finds a nice little plate of food scraps that has been set out specially. As it settles down to its meal, we become aware of a heavy and regular sound, like a ship's pump, coming from somewhere close-by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the center of the room is an object that looks like a prop from a `50s sci-fi movie. A human head protrudes from one end. The object is an iron lung, and its purpose is to keep its occupant, Mark O'Brien, breathing. Every 4.5 seconds, the pump mechanism creates a vacuum inside, forcing Mark's chest to expand and suck in air. He is fast asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Breathing Look you This most excellent canopy, the air, Presses down upon me At 15 pounds per square inch A dense, heavy, blue-glowing ocean. Teasing me with its nearness and immensity. And all I get is a thin stream of it. A finger's width of the rope that ties me to life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Having now eaten its fill, the cat has a good scratch, then wanders over to the iron lung.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It hops up onto the small platform that supports Mark's head and slides itself along his face, once this way, once the other way, then jumps on top of the iron lung and walks its length. Through the portholes, we just make out the shape of Mark's bent, undersize body. Suddenly, Mark's nose twitches. He opens his eyes and grimaces.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
His face continues to contort as he tries to cope with the terrible itching. He shakes his head violently, then stops suddenly and closes his eyes. We hear his thoughts.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, just focus. Now, scratch with your mind, okay, your mind, scratch with your mind...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
After a couple more nose twitches, he settles down. It seems to have worked. In his peripheral vision, Mark can see the cat making itself comfortable in a corner chair, one of the only other pieces of furniture in the room. The first hints of dawn start to appear through the curtains. They illuminate a large framed portrait of the Virgin Mary hanging on the wall. Mark acknowledges it.

A LITTLE LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The center of the iron lung, basically a thin mattress, has been slid out, and Joan is in the process of giving Mark a bed bath. He is frail and helpless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a look of resentment in his eyes as this apparently unfeeling woman exercises total control over him, at least temporarily.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joan I swear this was one crazy bitch Who'd swing me about enough to scare me, But careful enough so she could say: "Now what was all the yelling about? You polios are screamers. Always were." I didn't say a word, but typed my skinny novel in my head, And thought about revenge.

In the course of washing his private parts, Mark has an involuntary erection. Joan gives him a shriveling look. He feels belittled and humiliated. A LITTLE LATER

Mark is on his side, his trousers are on and she is buttoning up a bright red shirt. It is an awkward business. They do it in silence, avoiding eye contact as much as possible.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MARK'S PLACE. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joan pushes Mark along in a gurney, similar, but slightly different from the one in the news clip. There are no mirrors and no motor, just an oxygen tank, a tube and a mouthpiece just next to Mark's mouth. Most of him is covered with a colorful blanket. The whole thing is a sports-coupe version of his iron lung.

	<DIALOGUE>
	The Apostle Luke tells us that when Elizabeth spoke to Mary, the baby in her womb leapt - "For lo, as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in mine ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy". So Mary's fear and apprehension slowly gave way to pride and purpose. Elizabeth saw the greatness in Mary. "Blessed art thou among women". Elizabeth, pregnant herself with St. John, felt the power of this wondrous woman. It was Elizabeth, and her absolute faith, that gave Mary the courage she was lacking, and she gave thanks saying: "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour".

INT. SIDE CHAPEL. DAY

Mark waits alone in a tiny chapel off to the side of the church. He turns his head, takes a suck on the mouthpiece of his portable respirator, then looks around at the impressive stained glass windows. The expression on Mark's face is that of a true believer.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm definitely a true believer. But I believe in a God with a sense of humor. A wicked sense of humor. One who created me in His own image.

Father Brendan enters. There is an awkward short moment when he realizes that there is no point in offering to shake hands. For no good reason, he nods instead.

	Hello. I'm Father Brendan. I don't think we've met.

	<DIALOGUE>
	The most immediate thing on my mind would be my attendant, Joan. I'm thinking of getting rid of her. It's an evil thought, but I can't help it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<FATHER_BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is she dishonest, or incompetent?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_BRENDAN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, neither of those. She looks at me the wrong way. It's that you- need-me-more-than-I-need-you look. I'd like to show her she's wrong, just for the evil satisfaction it will give me. Is that a sin, Father?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<FATHER_BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it obviously troubles you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_BRENDAN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, it troubles me a lot. Because maybe it's really a power trip. Me against her. Me against the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<FATHER_BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really wouldn't worry too much about that. The question is whether you like having her around.

<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't stand her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<FATHER_BRENDAN>

	Then get rid of her. If I were in a position to choose, I'd get someone nice. Even it was a power trip.

	Then I have your blessing to fire her?

Carmen, early 30s, is a paraplegic in a wheelchair. She is pretty and animated, and has full use of her hands.

<CARMEN>

	I don't know if you can quite visualize it. It's called a lateral, or sideways reverse cow- girl.

It is obvious that Mark cannot visualize it. Although she doesn't give much away, we sense that Vera can.
</DIRECTION>
<CARMEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry about it then. It's just a question of depth of penetration. To some people it's really important, like my partner, for example. It's not such a big deal for me. I get just as excited when he licks my nipples, if and when he bothers to do it.

Mark doesn't get it. Vera, as usual, is impassive.
</DIRECTION>
<GREG>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And one thing that really works in my favor is that I smoke so much weed that my taste buds are pretty jaded. This gives me a great deal of stamina in the tongue department, and stamina is key in cunnilingus.

There is something of a commotion going on at one of the elevators. Vera, and a small, well-meaning CROWD, are trying to get Mark and his gurney inside. It will not fit horizontally. As they angle it up, Mark begins to panic.

</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you ever discuss sex with your parents?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. That would have been unthinkable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the way they saw the world. It wasn't just that polite people didn't think about sex. No-one did. It was never discussed. As far as they were concerned, there was nothing down there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Laura listens. She is pretty in a dark, angular way. A phone on her desk rings.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry about that.
	</DIALOGUE>

She walks over to it, pushes a button, then comes back. She has a noticeable limp.

<MARK>

	What's that from?

</MARK>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cerebral palsy.

</LAURA>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd hardly notice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People notice. It's not easy, the whole thing, attracting a guy, dating, sex, all very problematic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I find that hard to believe in your case.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you better believe it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what sort of chance do you give me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of achieving your romantic fantasy? Very small to minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, there's no need to pull any punches. You can be as direct as you like with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark, I'm just a humble sex therapist. I try to help people with sex problems that can be addressed. Your problem, I understand, is that you have never had sex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's correct.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would I be correct in assuming you're unable to masturbate?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Correct.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Has anyone done it for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever asked anyone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not specifically. I asked someone to marry me. She declined. Does that come close to masturbation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, being with the person you love is not the only way of expressing yourself sexually. There are people called sex surrogates.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Psychotherapists and psychiatrists are not allowed to have sex with their clients, even if it seems like a good idea. Sex surrogates don't have that limitation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would this be covered by my medical benefits?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unfortunately, no. You'd have to pay the full fee, whatever that was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, basically, I would be paying for sex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes Mark, you would be paying for sex. But the person you would be paying is not a hooker. She is a highly trained and sensitive professional, who is not motivated by money. Just as I'm not. In fact, you can think of a surrogate as an extension of me. Do I seem like a hooker to you?

	What sort of cost would I be looking at?

<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It depends how many sessions you need.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say, one, just to try it and see if I like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<LAURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, it doesn't work that way. It's a process. You have to be patient with yourself. There can be quite a lot of talking involved.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've set aside $500. Do you think that would cover things?
	</DIALOGUE>

	Oh yes, that's ample. So, what do you think?

<FATHER_BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_BRENDAN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My penis speaks to me, Father Brendan. Sometimes I ejaculate during a bed bath in front of my attendant. All I feel is shame and mortification, while other men, apparently, get pleasure. I'm sorry if I sound angry.

	You're serious, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_BRENDAN>
<MARK>

	I think sex is a serious matter. It's one of the most persistent themes in the bible. So, is it possible for me to know a woman, in the biblical sense, and do I want to find out?

<TONY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	She's coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TONY>
<DIRECTION>
CHERYL arrives. She is in her mid-30s. She grabs the phone, puts her hand over the mouthpiece and glares at Tony.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not your girlfriend. When someone calls, particularly someone you don't know, you can use the word 'Mom'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Tony glares back. Cheryl takes off her right earring.

	Hi, it's Laura.

</LAURA>
<CHERYL>

	I haven't heard from you in a while. How are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty well. Look, I called to ask how you would feel about working with a severely disabled client.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURA>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Cheryl notices that Tony has opened the refrigerator and is drinking straight out of the orange juice bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on a moment, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
She covers the mouthpiece of the phone.

<CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, cut that out!
	</DIALOGUE>

He takes no notice. She puts the phone down and moves towards him. He closes the fridge door and runs.

INT. MARK'S PLACE. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark is having a bed bath. His shoulders and neck are covered with soap suds. Rod is washing his back. The phone rings.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you get it please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<ROD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.

Rod eases Mark back onto the rubber mattress and goes to answer the phone.

<ROD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hullo, Mark O'Brien's phone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROD>

He switches it to speaker so Mark can hear.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, this is Cheryl Cohen-Greene. May I speak to Mark?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Rod holds the phone toward Mark like a question. Mark's face looks drained of blood.
</DIRECTION>
<ROD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just one moment, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROD>
<DIRECTION>
Rod switches the phone off speaker.
</DIRECTION>
<ROD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I doing here? Yes or no? Make up your mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROD>
<DIRECTION>
Mark hesitates, then nods weakly. Rod puts the phone back on speaker.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hullo, this is Mark.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Mark. I'm Cheryl. Laura called to introduce you. I understand you'd like to meet. Is that right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Mark can hardly speak. He eventually forces the sound from his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could see you on the seventeenth, at eleven o'clock. Would that be any good for you?

</CHERYL>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, yes, I think that would be fine for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, where you from?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boston. You?

</MARK>
<CHERYL>

Cheryl is on the phone, holding the receiver with one hand while she puts away groceries with the other.

INT. MARK'S PLACE. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

The iron lung pumps away. Mark is alone. He stares at the picture of the Virgin Mary.

	Holy Mother of God, what are "body awareness exercises"?

Vera holds up two shirts for Mark to see, a dark red and a light blue.
</DIRECTION>
<VERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERA>
<DIRECTION>
Mark is lying on his side, shirtless. His face is even more grim than when we last saw it.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't matter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<VERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you stop acting as if you're going to your own execution.

	I'm not acting.

Vera wheels Mark to his doom.

Vera says nothing. She rings the bell again.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God, she's forgotten, or she's gotten the date wrong. Okay, we might as well turn round and go back. Come on, let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<VERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She hasn't forgotten.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERA>

From inside the house, we hear the faint buzz of an electric wheelchair approaching. The door opens. Mark closes his eyes in despair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CARMEN'S PLACE. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vera eases Mark onto the bed, positioning him so that he can see the doorway. As a finishing touch, she dabs a little cologne behind his ears, then puts the mouthpiece of his respirator within easy reach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carmen picks up her bag and wheels herself to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<CARMEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I'm going. I'll be back some time after one. If I'm not here, just let yourselves out.

</MARK>
<VERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twelve after eleven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERA>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think there's a strong possibility she's had second thoughts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<VERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark, please calm down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERA>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if she does arrive, she would be perfectly within her rights to turn around and run.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
The doorbell rings. They stare at the door. Vera finally goes over and opens it. Silhouetted against the light is Cheryl with a substantial bag. She could be the Avon lady. She has a light blouse, light skirt and her long hair is loose.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, I'm Cheryl. I'm sorry I'm late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<VERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that's fine. Come in. I'm Vera, I'm one of Mark's helpers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERA>
<DIRECTION>
Cheryl sees Mark. There is no noticeable reaction in her face, just a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Mark O'Brien.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Mark clears his throat with a little difficulty.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Cheryl Cohen Greene.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Vera is already at the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<VERA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be back, say, in two hours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VERA>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, two hours, that would be perfect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
She closes the door behind her. Mark feels totally abandoned.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Mark blurts out.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your money's on the dresser.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Cheryl walks over to the dresser. When her back is turned, Mark screws up his face in self-disgust. She finds an envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
She puts it in her bag. Mark eyes her carefully.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was the wrong way to start off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, it was. Shall we start again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, you start.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
She sits down on the bed and looks at him. It is a very frank stare. She is trying to take a lot in.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Although the aim is for us to have sex, I'm not a prostitute and you don't need to pay me up front. I've nothing against prostitutes, but there's a difference. We can talk about that later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The other thing is, there is a limit to the number of sessions we can have together. Did Laura mention that when you saw her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, I don't remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The limit is six. But that gives us plenty of opportunity to explore. Now, I understand you are able to have an erection.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but not out of choice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know how many men there are on this planet who would give anything for a natural erection?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
She looks around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this your place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's a friend's. The only bedroom furniture I have at my place is an iron lung. I've sometimes thought about buying a futon, in case the need arose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's worth thinking about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got the space. It can be expensive though, a nice futon. I mean, how much do you think a good one would cost?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark, just take a deep breath, then let go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I seem anxious?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do a little.

<DIRECTION>
Cheryl lies down beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Laura told me you were a poet. What's it like to be a poet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a way of living inside your own head, which is where I spend most of my time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But not today. By the way, I like your shirt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles, genuinely flattered.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I need to ask you some basic questions. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is the iron lung for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It keeps me breathing. I can spend a few hours outside of it, with my portable respirator, depending on how I feel. But I work and sleep in the iron lung.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you feel right now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out of my league.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I meant your breathing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh...fine. In fact, better than usual.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's great. Do you have any areas of unusual sensitivity? Any parts of your body you don't want me to touch?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have normal sensitivity all over. It's just that my muscles don't work. You can touch me anywhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall we get undressed then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Mark is taken by surprise by the suddenness of it. He hesitates momentarily.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Cheryl starts to unbutton his shirt. Mark's terror is visible in his eyes and she can also feel his heart palpitating. She starts to slowly extract one of Mark's arms from his shirt- sleeve. Suddenly, he lets out a piercing scream.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ow! Ow! Stop! It hurts!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
She recoils, shocked.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy Mother of God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me what's wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My fingers! They're caught!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
She discovers that his fingers have been snagged in the fabric of the shirt and his fingers are being bent backward.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, okay, I've got it. Don't worry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
She carefully frees his fingers and eases the sleeve off.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be careful, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark, I'm going to be really careful with you. I don't want to hurt or injure you in any way, but it's really not sexy when you yell at me. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't yell at you any more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you'll tell me calmly the moment anything starts to hurt?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, let's do the other arm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Little by little, she extracts the other arm. He grimaces his way through it, but more in fear than in pain. She finally sets his shirt down on the end of the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice shirt.
	</DIALOGUE>

<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You already said that.

</MARK>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I? I guess I'm a little anxious, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
She undoes the top of his pants.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I'm going to slide these down. Hold your breath.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>

She pulls. He screams, in fear more than pain.

Mark, his body now under the sheets, looks towards the bathroom door. He can hear the sound of water running. He looks at a wall clock and notes the passing of time.

Cheryl turns off the tap. She has done a great job of pulling herself together, and is wrapped in a kimono, which she has brought herself.

Cheryl emerges from the bathroom and starts to undress.

	Ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
Cheryl continues undressing, Mark looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, the difference between me and a prostitute is that I don't want your return business. I'm here to help you communicate about your sexual feelings, so you can share them with a future partner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
She stands there for a few moments, but he keeps his eyes averted. She turns back the sheets, gets into bed beside him and he finally looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whenever I'm naked, everyone else in the room is usually dressed. Now that I'm in bed with another naked person, I'm very confused.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
She strokes his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, why is it confusing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd always expected that God, or my parents, would intervene to keep this moment from happening.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>

She slides her hand down. She can feel his heart thumping.
</DIRECTION>

He closes his eyes.

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like you to tell me how it feels each time I touch a different part of your body. If something feels good, tell me. If something feels ticklish or bothers you, let me know. I don't want you to tolerate anything. I'm going to start with the top of your head...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
She strokes his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERYL>

She moves her fingers round behind his ear, then the front of his ear.

</CHERYL>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything good so far, except the ear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>

She moves her fingers along his side, very, very lightly. For Mark, so far, this is the best.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are these the body awareness exercises?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're clever to have worked that out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Her hands massage their way down his torso. Mark's reactions are a little like shock waves.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People tell me I'm very perceptive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like to see what I feel like?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>

She carefully takes his hand and caresses the fingers around one of her breasts, then puts his hand back. Cheryl's hands move further down his body.

<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmm, my favorite brand. Okay, I'm going to move my hand along your stomach... and down to your pen...

	Let me think. It wasn't all that pleasant. I mean, it was consensual and everything, and I really was in love with the guy, but his dick seemed enormous to me, I didn't think it would fit. It was scary. But he was nice. I guess he couldn't help it.

	<DIALOGUE>
	First session. Mark is the oldest of four children and raised Catholic. He was extremely nervous. He yelled a lot when I took off his shirt, but I think more out of fear than pain. He cannot masturbate. Has only had the occasional kissing experience. He is capable of achieving an erection easily, but the unusual curvature of his body could be a serious obstacle to intercourse.

	I don't know what I had envisaged it would be like, the first time I mean. But that wasn't the image I had. I thought there would be more to it. Not that it was unpleasant. After all, I was in bed with a naked woman. She complimented me on my shirt and my hair. She held my penis. I haven't even seen my penis for over thirty years. Anyway, onward. Am I sharing too much?

Mark is in his iron lung. With his mouth stick, he turns the page of one of those anatomical instruction books on sex. There are the typical graphic cross-section diagrams of penises entering vaginas. Ravel's "Bolero" plays quietly in the background as he reads to himself.

Mark closes his eyes. In his mind's eye, he sees the saintly figures in the beautiful stained glass windows of the church with the afternoon sun blazing through. An equally saintly, but naked Amanda floats towards him, her arms beckoning.

When he opens his eyes, Cheryl is straddling him, but in a Leaning Tower of Pisa sort of way. It is a struggle for her, but somehow she is managing to get Mark into a workable position for intercourse. Suddenly, he panics.

<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark seemed to be at his most relaxed when I sucked his penis. At the moment he is fixated on penis- vagina and his anxiety is focused around that. The root of his anxiety is his parents and his religion. He believes he doesn't deserve sex. He believes he is responsible for his little sister's death at the age of seven, because his mother was too busy looking after him.

	I'm sorry to lay all this on you, Father. My worry now is that it's never going to happen. I'm never going to have intercourse with Cheryl, or any other woman. Maybe intercourse would prove I was an adult. Maybe I don't want to cross that line. Maybe this was a bad idea.

	My husband asked me to do it before his grandmother dies. The idea is, if it makes her happy and him happy, then it will do the same for me. Our son is neutral on the subject, but theoretically, if it looks like it makes me happy, it'll make him happy too. That's the way my husband's family talks, and thinks. The fact that I'm happy already, doesn't seem to be relevant.

<DIRECTION>
Josh crawls into bed with Cheryl. She is still awake. He snuggles up to her.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I really upset you before.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSH>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you didn't. I'm fine.

<JOSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?

	Yes, I've come around to your point of view. You were right. You're generally right about these things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<JOSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was quite a nice poem. I mean, nothing astounding, but heartfelt, at least.

	Josh, I need to go to sleep. Everything's good.

INT. CHERYL'S PLACE. NIGHT

Cheryl rummages around in the kitchen garbage. She finds nothing. She storms off to the laundry, flings open a cupboard, pokes around and comes up with a flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHERYL'S BACK YARD. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cheryl makes her way to the end of the yard. Holding the flashlight between her teeth, she rummages around in the outdoor trash bin. Finally, she finds what she is looking for. An envelope. She takes the poem out of the envelope and reads it.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me touch you with my words. For my hands lie limp as empty gloves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
She goes over to the back steps, sits down and continues reading.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She puts it back in the envelope and walks back inside the house. She is visibly affected.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET OUTSIDE MARK'S PLACE. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From behind, we see Vera wheeling Mark in his gurney. ANOTHER FEMALE FIGURE creeps up beside Vera and whispers in her ear, all unbeknownst to Mark. The other female figure takes over from Vera, who trails along, a few feet behind. Mark remains unaware. He has a new and different-looking shirt, even more out there than the previous one?
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think she'll like the shirt?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<AMANDA>

<AMANDA>

</AMANDA>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you going to Germany?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<AMANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To study German.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMANDA>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For how long?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<AMANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One or two years maybe. But we should keep in touch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMANDA>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But why go to Germany? It's the only place in the world where humor is actually forbidden.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
She laughs, then smiles quietly, then touches him.
</DIRECTION>
<AMANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could always make me laugh. I love you, Mark. I really do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMANDA>

Mark's face is a picture of anguish and confusion.

Mark lets out a deep, meaningful sigh. For a time, he and Father Brendan maintain a respectful silence.

</AMANDA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SIDE CHAPEL. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had this faint hope that she would show the merest hint of jealousy. It shows you how naïve I am. The fact that I was no longer a virgin, that I was a `made man', so to speak, made no difference to her at all.

<MARK>

They kiss. Then Cheryl's head slides down and disappears from view.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember about the breathing. Concentrate on breathing out rather than in. Think of anything neutral. Sky, water, trees, ships, music, nothing too dramatic.

Mark closes his eyes.

<DIRECTION>
INT. SIDE CHAPEL. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The first time, I really didn't know what was going on. Technically it all happened, but nothing really happened in my head. This time it did, and my head has never experienced anything like it before. Of course, I ignored Cheryl's advice about having neutral thoughts.

Amanda is giving Mark a pole dancing demonstration, complete with disco beat and mirror-ball lighting.

Mark opens his eyes and looks up at Cheryl. She seems divine. His excitement increases. We hear the change in his breathing. Also in her breathing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SIDE CHAPEL. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The expression of elation on Mark's face morphs dramatically into something else.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then afterwards, there was this moment, this glimpse of an awful sadness to come.

Father Brendan closes his eyes and nods knowingly.

Cheryl is dictating.

	Mark achieved an erection as soon as I started to suck on him. He did the controlled breathing, as I had suggested, and I was able to get on top and guide him in quite easily.

</CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Mark's face from Cheryl's POV. His eyes are still closed.

<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it in? Is it really in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, it's really in.

We hear the sound of typing.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MARK'S PLACE. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark is in his iron lung, typing. At the top of the page, we can see the title of the piece:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"On Seeing a Sex Surrogate" Page 8.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was finally there. Too soon, I came. But she kept holding me inside her. Then a look of pleasure brushed lightly over her face...

<DIRECTION>
We see Cheryl's face from Mark's POV. It is as beatific as we have ever seen it.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... as though an all-day itch were finally being scratched. Letting me go, she put her hands down on the bed by my shoulders and kissed my chest. This act of affection moved me deeply.

Cheryl's lips move away from Mark's chest. She kisses him on the lips, light and lingering. As soon as there is enough space between them, he whispers to her.

Cheryl continues dictating.

Cheryl pauses, then goes on.

</MARK>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What people?

<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what happens next?

</MARK>
<CHERYL>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?

</MARK>
<CHERYL>

	Then maybe we should pull the plug now.

Just then, Vera runs up and taps on her window. The window winds down. Vera hands Cheryl an envelope with money in it. At first, Cheryl just looks at it, then realizes what it is.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I wrote letters to Amanda in Germany. Five, six pages long A year passed, Heard nothing. Was it my fault? Of course it was. But the guilt isn't enough to patch over the rage. I pound the insides of my mind with words, such puny fists, And nobody hears.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
The poem ends and we hear instead a RADIO BROADCAST of a Giants' game. Mark is engrossed. Suddenly the broadcast stops. The digital read-out on the clock radio, which says 12:57, disappears. A street light, visible through the window, goes out. The electric pump under Mark's iron lung whirrs to a halt. We hear the sound of air escaping, then an eerie silence. Even the cat is motionless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a few moments, Mark seems hypnotized. Then, he twists his head and clamps onto his mouth stick. He manoeuvres it over to the speaker button on the phone and manages to press it in the semi-darkness. We hear a dial tone.

INT. MIKVAH (JEWISH RITUAL BATH-HOUSE). DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cheryl enters the room wrapped in a white, terry cloth robe. The room is dominated by a small, beautifully tiled immersion pool with a hand rail and steps. The MIKVAH LADY gets up from her chair and approaches her.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKVAH_LADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this your first time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKVAH_LADY>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, it is. I'm converting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
She takes off her robe and hands it to the Mikvah Lady, who does not fail to notice Cheryl's body.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKVAH_LADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what do you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKVAH_LADY>
<DIRECTION>
Cheryl closes her eyes and thinks for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think you'd understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<MIKVAH_LADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can try me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKVAH_LADY>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. I'm a housewife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<MIKVAH_LADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why shouldn't I understand?

</MIKVAH_LADY>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess I was mistaken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Cheryl steps towards the pool.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKVAH_LADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see you're very comfortable with being naked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKVAH_LADY>
<DIRECTION>
She takes hold of the rail and puts her foot in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That has never been one of my problems.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<MIKVAH_LADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes new brides come with their mothers. Do I have to take this off? Can I please leave this on? They've never been naked before. No honey, it all has to come off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKVAH_LADY>
<CHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it does?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Cheryl takes another step into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKVAH_LADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And it does. They stand on the edge of that pool without anything to cling to but themselves. Nothing to hide behind. This is your body. This is the body that God crafted for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKVAH_LADY>
<DIRECTION>
Cheryl immerses herself up to her chest.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKVAH_LADY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Immerse completely. Go completely under the water, without touching the walls or anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKVAH_LADY>
<DIRECTION>
She immerses completely. We see her under the water. She hears a voice in the distance, her own voice. At the same time, there is a look of elation in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay Mark, you can open your eyes now.

INT. MOTEL ROOM. DAY

Mark is on the bed alone. He opens his eyes.

<CHERYL>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is your body.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
A few feet in front of Mark, Cheryl is holding a full-length mirror. The angle is such that he can see all of himself. He is mesmerized by his own image. Flashes of light from the mirror flicker over his face.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So this is the body that someone was able to love. Not quite as bad as I thought.

</MARK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Overhead fluorescent lights flash by, as we observe the ceiling from Mark's point of view. We also hear the sound of rapidly rolling rubber wheels, and a voice.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark, can you hear me? Open your eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL. DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mark is in a regular hospital bed, with a temporary plastic cocoon over him in place of his iron lung. There is a volunteer called SUSAN in the room with him.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll be letting you go today. Whoever looks after you will leave the portable respirator switched on at night, fully charged, so you'll have at least one back-up system.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How close was I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, to that tunnel thing and the light, and the voice saying don't go near the light.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that what you remember?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I assume I passed out. Before that, I remember feeling sorry for myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you feel relieved now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I mean, I'm relieved that Rod got to me in time, but I still feel sorry for myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure there's a cure for that. Would you like to talk to someone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel comfortable talking to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm only a volunteer, not a therapist. I can refer you to someone if you like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<DIRECTION>
Mark breaks into a broad smile, then a chuckle.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude. I'm just smiling at the idea that a therapist could do anything useful for me right now. My priest couldn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you religious?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I would find it absolutely intolerable not to be able to blame someone for all this. Are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't go to any church and I don't think about God very much. But I believe there's a mysterious logic, or poetry to life. I guess that makes me a spiritual type.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, that would count.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like me to visit you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSAN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you married?

</MARK>
<SUSAN>

	No.

She gets into the ambulance and squats down next to him.

<MARK>

</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, are you in a relationship at the moment?

</SUSAN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it was a passing thing.

Mark is accompanied by an AMBULANCE OFFICER. We see clear blue sky through the back windows. The sun shines in and warms Mark's face. He closes his eyes in contentment.

We see the disappearing figure of Susan from the point of view of the departing ambulance.
</DIRECTION>
<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I met Susan five years before I died. She was the love of my life. We had the same priorities, baseball pretty much came first, and we wrote each other mushy poems. I never expected it, nor did she, but that's often the way things turn out.
	</DIALOGUE>

Father Brendan sits in a chair next to Mark's iron lung.

<FATHER_BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was quite something. What do you propose to do for an encore?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_BRENDAN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yep, I almost found out the big secret. But here I am, back with the living. If there is another place, then I think they took one look at me and decided to throw me back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<FATHER_BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And welcome back.
	</DIALOGUE>

Father Brendan is rather taken by surprise.

	Yes, I am. In fact, at this point in time, I feel very blessed.

</MARK>
<FATHER_BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blessed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_BRENDAN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, blessed. They put me on this new anti-depressant and now I can really see life from the cup half full rather than cup half empty point of view.

Father Brendan looks truly amazed.

	You're kidding me. A real girlfriend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_BRENDAN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A very real girlfriend. She adores me. She'll do anything for me. And I can get pretty kinky sometimes, believe you me. Her name is Susan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<FATHER_BRENDAN>

	I'm flabbergasted. Is she pretty?

</FATHER_BRENDAN>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no. Please make the little speech. I'd love to hear it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<FATHER_BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, but I'll try and keep it short.
	</DIALOGUE>

<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't make it too short.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>
<FATHER_BRENDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, fine. Here goes. The meaning of love. Love is a journey.

</MARK>

<MARK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, I was on drugs, I was taking anti-depressants and they were helping a bit. At least I was able to see the cup-of-life metaphor as a useful tool. Of course, the two halves were never even. Not in my case, that's for sure. Look at all the years of unendurable crap I've had to put up with. That fills most of the cup. But in the little bit that's left, what do I have to show for myself? Journalism? Poetry? At the very least, three beautiful women who all loved me and will all show up at my funeral.

(TO THE CONGREGATION) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been branching out lately, reading Native American stories about the character of the trickster. Sometimes he shows up as a coyote, sometimes as a raven, but he always does the unexpected. The trickster breaks the rules. Mark O'Brien, whose life we're celebrating today, was very much the trickster -- anyone who knew him knew that. Besides his irreverent humor and alarming honesty, he always did the unexpected. In nearly every aspect of his life, Mark did the unexpected. His was a dynamic voice in a paralyzed body, a full life lived long after he should have been dead. He graduated from college, wrote and published articles and poems, and -- against all odds, by his own admission -- entered into the fully human experience of physical love. In this way, Mark lived from day to day to day, from breath to breath to breath, for 49 years. He loved, and he was loved and in his quiet voice, he spoke loud truths.
