EXT. HUNTING WOODS - LANDSDOWN COUNTY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a clear but cold Autumn night at some time in the nineteen thirties. The Landsdown Woods are an assortment of various elements of nature: quiet water streams, rushing rivers, heavy brushland, small trees, and the more dominant, great tall pines. NATHAN LEE MORGAN, a Black man in his late thirties or early forties, treks deep into the woods with his eleven year old son, DAVID LEE, and his hound dog, SOUNDER. NATHAN LEE is a well built, strong manner of a man with a deliberate and quiet manner - DAVID LEE, like his father is tall and strong with big, bright active eyes. SOUNDER, their hound dog, is a mixture of red-bone hound and bulldog, with great square jaws.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES BEGIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN LEE carries an old rifle, and a burlap sack thrown across his shoulder -- DAVID LEE walks with a lantern as SOUNDER tracks ahead of them. They keep moving until they come upon a quiet river stream --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIVER STREAM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They walk along the edges of the river, with deliberation. It is obvious that they have walked this route many times. They reach a cut-off point and circle back into the woods, and pick up a pathway --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PATHWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pick up speed in close approach to a weeded area and stop. DAVID looks about in disappointment. SOUNDER scratches the earth -- NATHAN looks out into the darkness with a nagging expression on his face --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES INTERRUPTED
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There ain't no possums in this woods tonight, Daddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID_LEE>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks that way, son. Guess the cold done drove most of 'em down to the big water country -- but if there's one left out here -- we gotta find him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's cold, Daddy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID_LEE>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, put my jacket over you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN takes his jacket off and drapes it over the boy's frame as SOUNDER begins to scratch and whine with intensity. He moves to stand over the dog.
</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You all right, boy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly SOUNDER's voice lets out and he breaks away in a burst of speed. NATHAN and DAVID react quickly and take up the chase behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES BEGIN AGAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As SOUNDER makes his way through the woods -- NATHAN and DAVID rush behind him, following the great unique sound of the dog's voice. It is a sound that bounces -- soulful, louder and clearer than any purebred redbone. It is spaced with precision, bouncing from slope to slope like a rubber ball, filling up the night with music as though the branches of all the trees were being pulled across silver strings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE BASE OF THE TREE WHERE THE POSSUM HAS TAKEN REFUGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUNDER arrives and makes a leap to climb the tree as NATHAN and DAVID rush on to the scene. NATHAN looks up and points to the spot where the possum is. He puts his rifle down near him, and DAVID assists him in the shaking of the tree as SOUNDER makes his leaps upward to the rhythm of the sound coming from his voice. The possum gives way to the force and falls to the ground. SOUNDER charges for the animal -- NATHAN quickly picks up his rifle and aims for the animal. He fires into blank darkness and misses. The possum recovers from the fall and scampers into thick brushland, with SOUNDER in close pursuit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE AREA OF THE THICK BRUSHLAND - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUNDER cannot overcome the briar thickness of the brushland -- but the possum with his smaller size manages to elude the dog.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE EDGES OF THE BRUSHLAND AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUNDER comes out of the brush area, whining in frustration as NATHAN and DAVID approach him. NATHAN immediately realizes that the possum has gotten away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END OF TITLES
</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(slams his rifle to the ground)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dammit! And I remember the time when a bull couldn't a stopped him from gettin' that possum!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID LEE kneels down and caresses SOUNDER's frame. NATHAN realizes that DAVID is disturbed over his harshness.
</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come here, son--
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID LEE goes to his father, who kneels to him, and puts both of his huge hands on the boy's shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right. He did his job -- I just got foolish for a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
He gives the boy a quick embrace and rises to his feet --
</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If anybody's to blame, it's me -- I oughta nailed him when I took that shot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was too dark, Daddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID_LEE>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. We better git back to house now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN puts his hand on SOUNDER's neck, gives him an affectionate rub. They gather their equipment and head for home. They move out of the brush area on to a pathway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD AND CABIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This area of the road is about ten hundred feet from the front yard of the cabin. The yard is wide, and stretches out to the very edges of the road which comes to a horseshoe deadend about two hundred feet at the far end of their cabin.
</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In all the years me and Sounder been tracking down possums and coons in these woods -- he ain't tore one of 'em up yet... He always brought 'em back whole and healthy... And that's the difference between a hound dog that's dirty and mean, to one that's great like ol' Sounder here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE CABIN'S FRONT YARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They move through the yard, up the steps, on to the porch, and open the door to the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE KITCHEN-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN, DAVID, and SOUNDER step into the cabin. It is an old house but it is the home of the Morgan family so it is kept neat and clean at all times. To one side of the area is a kitchen table, a wood stove, and an old beat-up cabinet. To the other side are two old rockers, an old dresser, and one or two pieces of other old living room furniture -- there are three portals in this area: the backdoor in the kitchen section which leads to the backyard, and two in the sitting room which leads to the childrens' and NATHAN and REBECCA's rooms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REBECCA MORGAN, an attractive brown-skin woman in her thirties, sits in a rocker by the stove alone, picking kernels out of walnut shells with a bent hairpin. She looks up to NATHAN as he stands just inside the door, and looks down at her.
</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We cornered one, but he got away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
He does not wait for a response from her -- he, DAVID and SOUNDER keep moving across the floor, and on out the back door. REBECCA's eyes slowly trail their backs out the door. Her eyes just hang there after they have moved out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE SHED - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shed is medium in size and old like the house. There is a long wide table running along side the right wall. There are hanging nails on all of the walls and alongside the table. The various pieces of archaic farm equipment are all neatly put in organized places. NATHAN, DAVID and SOUNDER enter the shed. NATHAN hangs the burlap sack on one of the wall nails, and places the rifle down on the table -- DAVID does likewise with the lantern.
</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bet you're a tired little fellow, David Lee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN takes the lantern apart and begins to clean it -- and DAVID LEE picks up a small can of oil and puts it on top of the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID_LEE>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You oughta be tired, too, Sounder. That possum shore whipped the hell outta you tonight!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs behind his own remark as he finishes the business with the lantern and picks up his rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He beat you, too, Daddy, and you had a big ol' shootin' rifle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID_LEE>
<NATHAN_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(serious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy, you don't make funny with your daddy like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
His father has caught him off guard -- he was only joking -- he doesn't understand the attitude -- he doesn't know what to say -- he turns and walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David Lee...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DAVID_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(stops and turns)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID_LEE>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had a rough time out there tonight -- so you stay home from that school tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanna go -- the trip don't bother me none.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID_LEE>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You learnin' anything at that school?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir -- I learn to write a little bit, and I can read a lot--
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN LEE looks on him for a moment, and then softly nods his head--
</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Readin' must be somethin' powerful, huh, son?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN LEE slams the rifle closed, moves towards the exit and steps hastily out into the backyard -- DAVID LEE and SOUNDER follow him --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE BACKYARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The backyard spreads out in the form of a jagged horseshoe, surrounded by low levels of grass -- at the far end is a pathway, running about three hundred feet away to where the tall grass grows. The shed sits to the far left edge and more to the right edge is a water well. To the right of the water well is a woodpile. Up against the house, to the right of the steps to the back door are two wash tubs with homemade scrubbing boards. NATHAN keeps walking directly to the water well, reaches it and lowers the bucket down into the well, brings the bucket of water up, scoops up with a dipper, drinks, and tries to look out over the plains and hills from the back of his house.
</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When the fall comes in these parts, the Night moon runs away like a rabbit -- you could stay out here lookin' all night, and not see a thing out yonder.

	We goin' huntin' again tomorrow ?
	</DIALOGUE>

<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yep. I guess you must wonder why though, what with the luck we havin', but like I always say--
	</DIALOGUE>

	"You lose some of the time, what you always go afta, but you lose all the time what you don't go afta!"

<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now who says I didn't lay my mark on you, boy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
They both laugh as REBECCA steps out into the backyard from the house, and moves swiftly towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodnight.

</DAVID_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
He starts moving away towards the house.
</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Night, son!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And don't wake up Josie Mae and Earl!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<DIRECTION>
They watch DAVID LEE enter the house -- then NATHAN LEE looks to SOUNDER as they begin to move for the house.
</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your bedtime too, hound dog.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
SOUNDER hops up on him -- he strokes the dog's back and then pushes him away.
</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Off you go, boy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
SOUNDER scampers away around the side of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, Nathan Lee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
They start back into the house.

EXT. FRONT OF THE HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUNDER crawls just under the front porch and lies down on a burlap sack for his night's sleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CHILDREN's ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID LEE has taken some of the walnuts and is sitting up in the bed. EARL and JOSIE MAE, their sister, are fast asleep across from them. EARL is a sprightly little boy about eight years of age who has the kind of round face that gives one the impression that he is forever smiling. DAVID LEE grabs his book and starts to read.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN and REBECCA enter the house through the back door -- NATHAN stops at the table in the kitchen area as REBECCA moves directly to the door of the children's room -- just before she gets to the door, she notices that the bowl of walnuts on the floor by the rocker has been disturbed -- she snatches the bowl up from the floor and looks to NATHAN --
</DIRECTION>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The boy is hungry, Rebecca.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
His words cut through her frustration -- she puts down the bowl on an old dresser next to the door that leads to the children's room and just stands there for a moment -- she and NATHAN, looking directly on each other -- after a moment she moves across the floor and nestles into the embrace of his arms -- he holds her close to him for a moment and then they break the embrace --
</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dammit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
He moves halfway across the floor and stops as REBECCA goes to the stove to prepare his coffee --
</DIRECTION>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What we make it to? The next season to work ourselves to death, share croppin' for ol' man Howard, so he can get richer and we can't even eat when the croppin' time is done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
His coffee is ready -- she puts it on the table -- he moves to it and sits and takes a sip with the frustration still nagging him. She stands over him from behind and puts her hand on his strong neck for a moment and then she moves for the children's room and enters -- he drinks his coffee --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REBECCA and NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REBECCA enters, unrobes and crawls into bed -- she lies there for awhile in thought, rolls over to position herself and then she hears the back door SLAM. She raises her head for a moment and then she decides to get up. She puts her clothes back on hurriedly and moves out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN-SITTING ROOM - NIGHT

REBECCA moves with directness through the room, on out door to the backyard.

There is not a sound -- then she moves hastily around the side of the house to the front yard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE FRONT YARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks down under the edge of the porch to see SOUNDER fast asleep. She turns and tries to see through the darkness down the road -- she slowly moves up on the porch and stands in the doorway looking out into the night. She begins to hum -- the kind of hum to relax the nerves -- to move the thoughts away from the mind -- thoughts that were plaguing her.

This is a Southern White school where they segregate off into a far corner one or two black children they allow to attend the school.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID LEE enters the room in an exhausted state as he stops just inside the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All eyes are upon him, including a black boy and girl who are segregated off in the back corner of the room. The teacher picks up his clock from the desk and looks at it.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID LEE, with all eyes still upon him, moves carefully to a chair in the far corner -- sits next to the black boy and girl. MR CLAY takes up his book from the desk, and looks out on the class --
</DIRECTION>
<MR_CLAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now where were we before we were interrupted-- Oh yeah, Huckleberry Finn, chapter thirty-four! This chapter is called: WE CHEER UP JIM! Here we go: "Tom says: What's the vittles for? Going to feed the dogs? The colored boy kind of smiled around gradually over his face, and says: Yes, Mars Sid, a dog. Cur'us dog, too. Does you want to go en look at 'im?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_CLAY>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ANGLE - DAVID and other two children. The teacher's words can hardly be heard as he continues with the reading -- as the CHILDREN'S faces hold mixed expressions of confusion, pain, and mostly boredom. A head shaking, pathetic moment --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT OF MRS. BOATWRIGHT'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a medium size one-family house, painted gray -- trimmed in white around the edges of the frame -- the yard is surrounded by well-kept hedges -- the yard is mostly green grass and flower beds -- with walkways leading to the front and back of the house. The children and the dog move into the yard from the residential street --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDE OF THE HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They walk around the side of the house to a back door. The boys put the basket down -- DAVID knocks on the door -- after a moment, MRS. BOATWRIGHT, a tall, attractive white woman in her early forties, opens the screen door.

<MRS_BOATWRIGHT>
	<DIALOGUE>

She moves for another room as the children all look to each other -- she returns immediately with the book, and hands it to DAVID LEE --
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_BOATWRIGHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's about the Three Musketeers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_BOATWRIGHT>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. OUTSIDE MRS. BOATWRIGHT'S BACK DOOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MRS. BOATWRIGHT is in the doorway as DAVID, EARL and SOUNDER move ahead of JOSIE MAE, who stops and turns to MRS. BOATWRIGHT --
</DIRECTION>
<JOSIE_MAE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's a Chinaman, Miss Boatwright?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSIE_MAE>
<DIRECTION>
Before MRS. BOATWRIGHT can struggle up a response --
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Josie Mae! We gotta hurry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
JOSIE MAE turns and catches up with them -- they all rush around and out of MRS. BOATWRIGHT'S yard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE COUNTRY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They run up the road and into a field -- continue on across the field and over a slope until they can see crowds of people at a make-shift baseball diamond where two teams of black sharecroppers are engaged in a heated baseball contest. They keep moving on into the crowd --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE BASEBALL DIAMOND AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Men, women and children are standing around, loudly rooting for their team as the three children make their way through the crowd to find their mother. NATHAN LEE is pitching on the mound for his team. He throws a pitch -- the Batter misses it --
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at Daddy throw that ball!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
They keep moving until they spot their mother, who is seated on a bench with another woman. They rush to her.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rebecca, your children git bigger by the hour!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Boatwright gave me this book and all of us a nickel apiece!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
REBECCA holds her hand out with palm up as if to say "hand it over" -- the three children pass the money on to her --
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's winning, Mama?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID_LEE>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<DIRECTION>
The ballgame goes on as they shout and roar for NATHAN's team. NATHAN is putting on quite a pitching performance in the close, exciting game.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN's team is at bat -- there are two out -- a man at second and a man at bat. The man at bat hits a ground ball to the second baseman, the ball trickles away from his glove into the outfield -- he quickly retrieves the ball and tries to make a play at First Base, but the Batter is called safe -- meanwhile the runner on Second has moved past Third Base and is attempting to score -- the first baseman throws the ball to the catcher at Home Plate as the runner slides into Home. It is a close play and the umpire makes the decision to call the runner safe. An uproar takes place as the other team shows its displeasure over the umpire's call -- but the people who are rooting for NATHAN's team shout and scream in ecstasy. After a short time, order is restored.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ON THE ROAD AWAY FROM THE BASEBALL DIAMOND - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN and his family are on their way home, accompanied by a guitar-playing friend named IKE. As he plays, he sings one of those basic black back-country blues. He finishes the song and gives out with a big laugh and boasts --
</DIRECTION>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If they heard me sing like this up North I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if they saw me pitch the way I did today -- they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN and IKE give out with a big laugh. REBECCA just smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD AND CHURCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pass a white church on the road. A number of people are standing in the yard of the church and some are entering. DAVID watches with inquisitiveness.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do they do in the white churches, Mama?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID_LEE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	They probly thought you was crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<IKE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</IKE>
<DIRECTION>
Ike bursts out in loud laughter, joined by NATHAN, REBECCA and the children --
</DIRECTION>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If there ever was a devil in this county, Ike, you is it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<NATHAN_LEE>

<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeh -- possums and coons better hide deep from us tonight!
	</DIALOGUE>

IKE moves away from them -- As they continue on home they can hear him singing to himself --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ABOUT THREE HUNDRED FEET AWAY FROM THE MORGANS' CABIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dark has set well as the family approach the house. SOUNDER starts to growl -- the children stop, and DAVID LEE turns his head to NATHAN and REBECCA --
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's two men in front of our house, Daddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
They all stop -- and can see the shadowy figures of two men, standing in their yard, and a Pick-Up Truck parked off the road toward the other side of the cabin.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID_LEE>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Children, come here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<DIRECTION>
The children move back -- NATHAN LEE looks behind himself and across the fields as if he would like to make a dash for it -- but REBECCA's eyes follow every physical and mental motion he makes.
</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We better see who they is...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
They begin to move slowly toward the house with deliberate caution, with the two men becoming more visible identifiable with their shotguns dropped to their sides. They move into the yard and stop about twelve feet from the two men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE FRONT YARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHERIFF YOUNG steps out of the front door of their house. The two groups do not speak for a moment -- they merely stare at each other -- the MORGAN family with inquiring and fretful eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_YOUNG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We been in your house, Nathan--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_YOUNG>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN and REBECCA look to each other with knowing glances.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_YOUNG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We found what we was lookin' for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_YOUNG>
<DIRECTION>
He moves away from the door and stops at the edge of the porch --
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_YOUNG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You took some food and stuff from the James' Smoke House last night so me and my deputies here gon' hafta take you to the County Court House.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_YOUNG>
<DIRECTION>
SHERIFF YOUNG nor the DEPUTIES make a physical move toward NATHAN. There is a long moment of tense silence. For a second, NATHAN seems to want to make a desperate break and run, but REBECCA holds him by the arm with all the strength her hand can afford.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_YOUNG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, boys...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_YOUNG>
<DIRECTION>
The DEPUTIES move in and take NATHAN by the arms from both sides and put handcuffs on him.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What they doin', Mama?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be quiet, son...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<DIRECTION>
EARL falls into his mother's embrace - suddenly, SOUNDER's voice rips into the atmosphere, and for the first time the DEPUTIES draw their shotguns to waist level --
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_YOUNG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut that mongrel up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_YOUNG>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID runs to SOUNDER and tempers him as the sound fades to a growl -- the dog frantically scratches the earth as DAVID holds on to him --
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_YOUNG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Git that truck up close here, and quick!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_YOUNG>
<DIRECTION>
One of the DEPUTIES moves out in a hurry to fetch the vehicle as SHERIFF YOUNG moves down the steps into the yard and looks to DAVID, holding SOUNDER.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_YOUNG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now boy, if you love that dog, you better keep a good, strong hold on him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_YOUNG>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of the truck is heard moving up close to the house, and stopping. REBECCA moves away from JOSIE MAE and EARL, and stops directly in the face of SHERIFF YOUNG.
</DIRECTION>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You been knowin' Nathan for a long time, Sheriff Young, and you know what kind of man he is, and you know the trouble we face in these off-seasons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<DIRECTION>
The SHERIFF cannot look her in the face -- he walks away from her and everyone, and just looks out over the fields -- then finally he motions with his hand to the two DEPUTIES, standing at NATHAN'S side to put him into the truck. They lift him up into the truck as JOSIE MAE, standing up on the porch with EARL, starts to cry softly as REBECCA moves to the edge of the vehicle, real close to NATHAN'S face. She kisses him lightly on the mouth, and then they just look on each other for awhile, in a way they knew and loved each other so well. Then in a physical, tough manner, REBECCA turns away and walks up on the porch with JOSIE MAE and EARL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One DEPUTY gets in the back of the truck with NATHAN, and the other sits at the wheel -- as SHERIFF YOUNG climbs up and sits next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_YOUNG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, let's go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF_YOUNG>
<DIRECTION>
The truck starts to pull away -- DAVID lets go of his grip on SOUNDER, and makes a dash out into the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't take my Daddy! Please don't take my Daddy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID_LEE>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David, come back here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<DIRECTION>
SOUNDER lets out with his voice, and charges past DAVID for the truck on the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DEPUTY in the back of the truck aims his shotgun as SOUNDER leaps for the truck -- the thunder from the DEPUTY's shotgun is the only sound that can be heard in the entire valley -- SOUNDER falls to the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE PORCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REBECCA rushes down from the porch to the edge of the yard.
</DIRECTION>
<REBECCA>

	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID keeps running in the direction of the truck and SOUNDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees SOUNDER rise and fall, give out with a faint yelp, and circle into the field. He moves in the direction of the house, falling and floundering, with the hind part of his body staying up -- moving from side to side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID arrives at the spot where the animal was cut down, stops with his eyes deadpan on the truck as it fades from his view. He looks down on a huge blot of blood in the sand -- reaches down and digs his fingers into it -- lifts his hand up and frowns -- looks out into the field to track the dog's movements -- then makes his way back to the cabin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE FRONT YARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID trots back to the front yard -- REBECCA is at the edge of the yard -- JOSIE MAE and EARL are still on the porch -- DAVID keeps moving on around the house -- REBECCA stares down the road -- in her background, the figure of DAVID and the lighted lantern can be seen faintly, crawling under the house. JOSIE MAE and EARL come down from the porch, and stop just behind their mother.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSIE_MAE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mama, why did they take Daddy away?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSIE_MAE>
<REBECCA>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.

</DIRECTION>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>

He stops and looks all around him with a pained expression on his face -- SOUNDER is not under the house...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The following morning REBECCA pours the walnuts from the bowl into a paper bag and proceeds to tie the bag up as DAVID LEE looks on. JOSIE MAE and EARL enter.

	Josie Mae, I'm goin' into town for awhile to see about your Daddy -- David Lee is gon' be in charge here, so you and Earl do just like he tells you.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REBECCA and DAVID LEE slowly move along up the road.
</DIRECTION>
<REBECCA>

	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<DIRECTION>
They come to a halt at a short distance from the house -- and then she looks softly down on the boy for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Bye, Mama...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID_LEE>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID LEE chops wood at the woodpile -- rakes up a few chunks into his arms and heads back into the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crawls under the cabin, searching about carefully, looking for the dog.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy charges up the road away from the house and then cuts off into the field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He spirals the brown stalk land in ever-widening circles, searching the fence-rows -- and then he comes to the edge of the woodlands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID LEE searches under the jack oaks and cottonwoods, but SOUNDER is not there. He stands in one spot, looking about the woods in painful confusion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LANDSDOWN MAIN STREET - DAY

A few minutes later, he puts her last article up on the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what I wanta talk to you 'bout is Nathan. He oughtn' done what he did: sneakin' into the James' place and takin' they goods. That looks bad on me. I been good to y'all -- didn't I go to all that trouble to get the people of Landsdown to let your David Lee go to they school? Didn't I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_HOWARD>
<DIRECTION>
With the mood she's in, REBECCA does not have anything to say to this man concerning NATHAN, DAVID LEE or that damn school. For a moment he waits for her to say something and then he goes on --
</DIRECTION>
<MR_HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And another thing; with Nathan stuck in jail and all, how you gon' crop for me when the spring season comes, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_HOWARD>
<DIRECTION>
She still can't find words to say to this man, but tries. He is impatient, and a little snap cracks in his voice.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dammit, I'm talkin' to you, woman! I gotta farm to think about and I need answers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_HOWARD>
<REBECCA>

(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard, and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain't, believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you all that money -- Mr. Howard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<DIRECTION>
What she has just said about the money they owe is a frustrated thought in HOWARD'S mind as he looks to her helplessly.

	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>

</DAVID_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN takes the box and immediately opens it --
</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN_LEE>

</NATHAN_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
He walks away from the cell door and moves to the window of his cell, looks up with his back to DAVID.
</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a shame they won't let 'em come in here. If I had the strength I'd knock down these damn walls -- if I could just git my arms 'round your mama right now -- is they on this side of us, son?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think so...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
NATHAN jumps up to the window a couple of times until his hands can get a grip around the bars of the small window -- he strains and pulls, trying to get his eyes up to the window level --

</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can see them! I can see them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
His arms give way and he drops back to the floor on his feet -- he moves slowly to DAVID and takes him by the arms through the bars of the cell --
</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son, don't ever let yourself get caught in a place like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
There is a moment of agonizing silence as they look at each other --
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you say what camp they gon' send you to, Daddy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID_LEE>
<NATHAN_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, Daddy; you won't be here?

<DIRECTION>
REBECCA and the children attend services at the Church -- Everyone is standing -- they are in the midst of a song, led by the Pastor of the Church.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like everything else in Landsdown for Black People, it is an old disinherited structure with creaky, movable chairs for the worshipers to sit in -- there are two high windows on both sides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Pastor reads the verses of the song in the traditional, dramatic Black Preacher's fashion, and the congregation repeats the verses musically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Song --

</HARRIET>
<DIRECTION>
REBECCA notices the PREACHER talking to a group of women across the floor.

<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I don't go over there and butt in, I ain't gon' ever get to talk to the Preacher about Nathan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<DIRECTION>
She rises and moves across the floor. DAVID LEE watches closely as his mother approaches the PREACHER and gets his attention by touching him on the arm, and they move off to a more secluded spot in the Church. DAVID rises and moves to join their company.
</DIRECTION>
<PREACHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I ain't got no word yet, Rebecca. I went to the courthouse yesterday to see 'bout it, but they just won't tell me nothin' about what labor camp Nathan was sent to. I'm sorry, Rebecca.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREACHER>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<PREACHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you don't take to bitterness, Sister Morgan. I tell you like I tell all the women in this church who got the same trouble you got. No matter what the trial or what the misery is, I tell 'em to stay with God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREACHER>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<PREACHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not that simple, Sister Rebecca -- the Lord works in mysterious ways -- we come into this life with nothin' and we'll leave it with nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREACHER>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that a blessing, Reverend?
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE PORCH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID stops just at the top of the porch, and there, scratching at the door and wagging his tail, is SOUNDER. The side of his head where the shot scraped him is discolored and hairless -- the top of his eye is scarred causing it to be half-closed, and what's left of his ear on the same side, sticks straight out. Upon seeing DAVID LEE, he raises his good ear and whines. DAVID rushes to grab him.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You come back, boy! I just knowed it! I just knowed you'd come back!

<DAVID_LEE>

After a moment of hesitation, EARL gets down on his hands and knees --
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Git him, boy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
EARL jumps to his feet quickly and backs away across the yard --
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tell that dog to git me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
SOUNDER merely turns to DAVID LEE and gives out with a few muffled whines --

REBECCA is looking on about three hundred feet away as DAVID LEE runs about with SOUNDER in open field, trying to work him back into physical shape -- he halfway picks the dog up -- drops him to the ground, takes off and runs but SOUNDER does not follow him. He comes back to the dog and ruffles him affectionately -- takes off and runs again -- this time, SOUNDER takes off after him. REBECCA and DAVID look to each other and smile broadly -- success!! He caresses and hugs the dog -- they move toward REBECCA, join her, and they start walking back toward the house -- and then the rains come -- they and the dog take off in speed with huge raindrops splattering against their faces and bodies. From the field, as they make a run for it, their figures become smaller as they near the backyard and the doorway to their home...

A bright sunny day -- DAVID LEE is just about to quit for the day in some gardening work he is doing for MRS. BOATWRIGHT -- He moves to the side of the house to put some equipment away when the lady approaches him --

INT. COURT CLERK'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE DAVID, the Court Clerk, is standing behind his desk -- MRS. BOATWRIGHT is seated in a chair before his desk. There are two windows in the small office, a coat rack in the corner diagonally behind his desk, three chairs, another small working desk, and a row of file cabinets against the wall --
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't do it, Rita -- that's the policy here on colored prisoners, and I ain't about to change it, not even for a friend like you.

</CHARLIE>
<MRS_BOATWRIGHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored, you--
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_BOATWRIGHT>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now look, Rita, I don't make the rules -- you puttin' yourself on a limb, comin' here, askin' me to do a thing like this. And I be damn if I'm going to jeopardize my job because you are in love with a little colored boy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
The phone on his desk rings -- he picks up the receiver to his ear and sits down --
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	County Clerk's office, Charlie Davis speaking... Yes, sir... You bet your life, sir...Yes, sir, I'll be right there.

He puts the receiver down -- jumps up, goes to the rack and gets his coat and starts to fix his tie --

<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was Judge Elliot on the phone and when Judge Elliot calls, I jump! Good day, Rita.

</CHARLIE>

</MRS_BOATWRIGHT>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NO! N-O, NO!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Just like that he is gone. MRS. BOATWRIGHT stands in the middle of the floor in a moment of frustration, with DAVID LEE looking on from the alcove. She thinks for a moment and then looks to the file cabinets against the wall. DAVID stands in the doorway as she decides to go to the file cabinets. She checks the outer notation on each one of the cabinets until she comes to the one that reads: PRISONER CASES. She quickly opens the cabinet drawer and hurriedly fingers through the files until she finds the file with NATHAN LEE MORGAN's name on it. She goes through it until she has gotten the information she wants and just as she is about to put it back, CHARLIE DAVIS has returned and has caught her in his files. She looks cheaply to him, slips the file back into its place, closes the cabinet drawer and backs away from the file cabinet. He moves past DAVID LEE into the office on to the file cabinet where she was, opens it enough for him to tell that she has disturbed the one single file of NATHAN LEE MORGAN. He slams the file drawer back shut and turns to her.

	Charlie, you have no legal right not to let this boy know where his father is! You hear that, you and this whole damn court house; what you are doing is wrong!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_BOATWRIGHT>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tell me about what's wrong. You come into my office as a friend and steal city files! I could have you arrested for that -- and if you give out that information to anybody, that's exactly what I'm going to do -- and I'll tell everybody in this town how you got the information and who you got it for! You won't have a friend left in this county to bring you a piece of candy!

<MRS_BOATWRIGHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The camp Nathan is at is called Wishbone Labor Camp. It's in Nolan Town!

EARL and JOSIE MAE arrive and stop at the corner of the house -- can't quite make out what this crazy laughing is all about but they move to the center of the yard with them and join in with the laughing. After a short while the laughter comes to a sudden stop -- sudden, absolute silence --

	Oh no, these maps are easy to read.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_BOATWRIGHT>
<DIRECTION>
But she is having trouble locating the place as her pencil moves about in several confusing spots on the map -- like having to find a bigger town's indicating alphabet and number in order to search about at random to locate a smaller town -- but finally --

<MRS_BOATWRIGHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There it is, right there!

	How do you get there, Miss Boatwright?

Everybody straightens up to get MRS. BOATWRIGHT's directions. She holds the map up as they look on.

<MRS_BOATWRIGHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now they have numbers and letters on here to tell you where to look on the map, but Nolan Town is not under a number but we know it's in Northern Landsdown -- the number for Northern Landsdown is: "h7", but since Landsdown is the largest county, it actually stretches over into "a2" but "a2" is -- Am I making myself clear?

	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can do it, Mama -- you know that. In the Bible stories you read to us, everybody's always goin' on a long journey. Jacob goes into a strange land where his uncle is and he don't even know where he lives, but he finds him. Everybody finds what they supposed to find.

A number of trucks roar through the gate and DAVID checks them all thoroughly, but his father is not on any of them. Finally the last truck comes out-

The truck pulls to a halt just outside the gate, and DAVID eyes the men on the truck carefully us the GUARD makes his check --
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He gotta be on this one, Sounder, it's the last truck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
There are not too many men on this truck which makes it quite easy for DAVID to see that his father is not on it. Then where is he? The boy thinks to himself as he sees the truck move away up the road. The truck is moving no more than about twenty miles an hour -- DAVID LEE makes a decision and takes off after the truck, running --

<DIRECTION>
EXT. A FARM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A half hour later, the truck with the convicts pulls into a huge farm area -- the TWO GUARDS jump down from the truck and herd the men into a group while a third guard gets out of the cab -- and they distribute farm equipment to the men. A picket fence stretches the area where the men work.

EXT. THE ROAD - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Some minutes later DAVID LEE and SOUNDER, walking, approach the farm area where the convicts are, moving along the road outside of the fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stop -- DAVID watches the men work and the guards, covering them from distances of about three hundred feet in a half moon formation, spread out. DAVID decides and moves to the fence to question the men. When he gets to the edge of the road next to the fence, one of the guards spots him and starts moving over --

</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID hurriedly gets back across the road with SOUNDER and watches the guard as he moves the men back. DAVID looks on in frustration, trying to figure out what his next move will be -- The guard moves away from the men and walks up to another guard to engage him in a conversation -- while the two guards are rapping with each other, DAVID decides to make a desperate try of it --
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Sounder, let's go!

DAVID LEE and SOUNDER dash across the road, and slip under the fence into the farm area --

	</DIALOGUE>
</CONVICT>
<DIRECTION>
SOUNDER lets out a growl at one of the Guards who is now charging toward them. DAVID takes off in a circle with the Guard in pursuit of him, away from the direction of the road -- SOUNDER is close behind him -- They circle back into the direction of the road and zoom past the group of CONVICTS -- DAVID is running at electrifying speed. DAVID and SOUNDER are making tracks with the Guard still after the boy. They come to the fence and quickly slip through, but DAVID's hand falls on a broken bottle with gashing force -- he leaps up and continues on across the road and into an open field. The Guard stops at the edge of the road and gives up the chase --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIELD - DAY

DAVID and SOUNDER are still running with great speed. DAVID looks back over his shoulder to see if the Guard is still after him. They slow down when they approach an old abandoned barn --

DAVID, holding his hand, sits on the road with the dog -- puts his hand up before his eyes -- it is practically covered in blood. A pain strikes him, causing him to grimace for a moment -- looks about the area -- They rise and start out once again --

EXT. ROAD AND SCHOOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They come upon a large schoolhouse with the name over it: Borderdale School. They stop when DAVID sees a number of Black Children playing on the grounds -- climbing on little ladders and swinging on swings. He notices a water pump on the grounds, looks at his blood-covered hand -- hesitates for a moment and then decides to enter the grounds --

	Some people came and took my daddy away and other people said we couldn't work the farm. But we had to,'cause we didn't wanna lose our farm. We planted the crops and they grew. I believe his story 'cause his story is about what he did when he had to do somethin'. He didn't know how to swim but he had to or else his sister woulda drowned. That's how he did it...

CAMILLE and DAVID LEE exit from the school house -- DAVID is filled with excitement over his adventure in the class room. They are joined by SOUNDER who is impatiently waiting for DAVID. DAVID LEE strokes the dog a few times, and they keep moving on out of the school yard --

<DIRECTION>
CAMILLE is busying herself, sweeping, dusting furniture items, putting things in place, etc. -- DAVID LEE is following her about the place, helping her wherever he can -- His spirits are very high at the moment. SOUNDER is crouched in a corner, looking on at the activity --
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... So me and Sounder, ran right by the men that was the prisoners, and crawled under the fence! That's when I cut my hand on the glass. It hurt like mad! But I kept runnin', and then I didn't feel no more hurtin' till I stopped runnin'!

(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why was that, Miss Johnson?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DAVID_LEE>

	He was real scared nobody would believe him -- I could tell, even when he first stood up.

	Not now, David, it's time for bed. You have a long trip ahead of you in the morning...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAMILLE>
<DIRECTION>
A thought grips the boy, and he moves to the window, and stares out into the darkness, as CAMILLE starts to make the bed for him -- she stops for a moment, and looks up and over at him at the window --
</DIRECTION>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	But where is my daddy!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID_LEE>
<CAMILLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.

She returns to making up the bed.

<DAVID_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Johnson... Do you think I can come back here, and you let me study school with the other children?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
The question stops her work -- and then she momentarily struggles for an answer for the boy -- she sits down on the bed as he turns back to gazing out of the window. She looks on him for a moment, rises, moves to the window, puts her arm around his shoulder -- and they both look out of the window into the blank darkness --

<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If your father is back by then it's all right with me if it'll be all right with him...

REBECCA moves out just like that, leaving the boy thrown and bewildered for a moment -- he looks in the direction of his mother's room for awhile and then slowly starts to eat, with his appetite practically gone -- JOSIE MAE and EARL on the other side of the table are staring at him.

<DIRECTION>
A hot, mid-July day -- late afternoon -- REBECCA, DAVID LEE, JOSIE MAE and EARL are working the mill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID LEE points with his fingers in giving out assignments to JOSIE MAE and EARL. They run across the fields to a particular row of corn, with croker sacks in their hands.
</DIRECTION>

JOSIE MAE and EARL are behind REBECCA, picking the corn in armfuls -- run back to the stationary place where they left their croker sacks, and drop the corn into the sacks.

EXT. THE WOODS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID LEE walks through the woods with a book in his hand -- he stops, sits down at the base of a tree, when suddenly he reacts as if he hears something -- he rises and rushes away -- he runs, stops and looks around him, in search of someone, and then he takes off again at high speed along a pathway of the woods. His speed builds and builds, and suddenly he breaks the woods, and the night, into high grass field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRASS FIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is broad daylight, and the sun is shining -- DAVID LEE wipes his eyes and looks about the field of high grass -- he hears a voice and takes off running until he breaks the high grass into open field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OPEN FIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees his father, with SOUNDER at his side, standing about three hundred feet away from him, smiling. He rushes to his father -- they embrace and then they start to run across the open field, the three of them. They run and they run, keeping pace with each other, as their speed increases. DAVID LEE drops his book, stops to pick it up -- after he straightens up with the book to continue the running, he stops in his tracks -- his father and SOUNDER are nowhere to be seen -- he looks out over the entire field -- they are not there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHILDREN'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID LEE wakes up -- he looks to EARL and JOSIE MAE, and then into the empty darkness of the room, and wonders; where did the dream come from -- where did it go to --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE PORCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Later the same day, DAVID LEE is lying on his stomach, reading from one of his books. REBECCA is doing some sewing -- SOUNDER comes from around the side of the house, hobbling back and forth to the road and back.
</DIRECTION>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong with him, David?

</REBECCA>
<DAVID_LEE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
REBECCA sees a lone figure upon the landscape way out from the house emerge as a speck and slowly grow into a ripply form through the heat waves -- JOSIE MAE and EARL come from around the house and sit down in the yard.
</DIRECTION>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's that to be fightin' scorchin' heat out in open land like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<DIRECTION>
SOUNDER moves about restlessly in the yard -- and then suddenly the voice of the great coon hound breaks the sultry August deadness and dashes across the road toward the figure. REBECCA jumps to her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<REBECCA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's gone mad! Stop him, David!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REBECCA>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID LEE takes off after SOUNDER -- his voice is ringing at a peak as he keeps moving until he arrives at the figure. REBECCA sees the man kneel and take the dog into his arms, and now the light hits at the top of her mind.
