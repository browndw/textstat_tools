:SC: BLACKNESS.

<DIRECTION>
Pink Floyd's "Dark Side of the Moon (Brain Damage)" plays as WHITE TITLES appear over black. As the song crescendos at the first chorus, SUNLIGHT flares over the lunar horizon and a crescent sliver of THE MOON is illuminated - huge, filling the screen from top to bottom. We're in space, circling around from the dark side until a HUGE FULL MOON fills the screen with whiteness - TITLES continue as we pull back from the moon, into the earth's atmosphere, through CLOUDS, until we reveal

PARIS AT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We come to rest on an ancient, vaguely wolf-like GARGOYLE high atop a gothic cathedral in the Latin Quarter - a maze of narrow, twisting streets - desolate at this late hour. Clouds move over the moon. End TITLES. The song fades. A THUNDER CRACK. Rain drops spatter on the church's metal roof. Water trickles out of the gargoyle's mouth. We follow the STREAM OF WATER down to street level where it falls onto

<DIRECTION>
A YOUNG COUPLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
wobbling down the street, sharing a bottle of wine. They open an umbrella and stand underneath it, smooching and giggling. We follow the STREAM OF WATER from their umbrella to the street, where it swirls into drain holes in the MANHOLE COVER that they're standing on. Suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLANG!! The manhole cover pushes up under their feet. He flinches - bites down on her lip, drawing blood. She yelps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLANG!! The cover thrusts up again. They lose their balance, fall to the ground - the wine bottle smashes. The manhole cover flips off it's hole. Horrified, they scramble from it. Then, out of it comes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TERRENCE MCDERMOTT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a fiftyish college professor in a turtleneck and old tweed jacket, clutching a well worn leather shoulder bag and gasping for breath. He's balding, with longish gray hair and intense eyes. He climbs out of the hole, replaces the cover and dashes off desperately through the rain, looking back over his shoulder as he disappears into a narrow alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The couple watch him go, befuddled. She touches her hand to her lip and looks at the blood. She slaps her boyfriend upside the head.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Idiot!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
The guy shrugs. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAM!! The manhole cover explodes off the hole, sails twenty feet into the air and clatters to the ground some distance away. We cut to the couple's horrified reactions as they watch something emerge from the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON A NEARBY STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terrence, running, hears the couple's horrible SCREAMS echo through the twisting streets. He comes to A STONE STAIRWAY and hurries down it, four steps at a time. At the bottom he turns right and arrives at a star shaped five way intersection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A low, muffled growl stops him in his tracks. He stands in the rain, panting, looking around at the dark maze of streets, trying to pinpoint the source of the sound.

A TAXI appears a block away. He waves his arms and calls out in a very good French accent.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Taxi! Ici, s'il vous plait!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRENCE>
<DIRECTION>
It turns and drives towards him. He starts off towards it. He glances over his shoulder - sees nothing. He's twenty feet from the taxi. He smiles. Then -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's jerked violently downward into A STORM DRAIN. He screams. Some monstrous force pulls him down, his bones crushing as his body is forced through the too-small drain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CABBY gets out and runs up to the drain, where Terrence's thrashing upper body is quickly disappearing into the hole. Horrible growls and sounds of ripping flesh emanate from the sewer. BLOOD spurts through the grate. Terrence reaches up to the cabby, SCREAMING for help.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God! Help! Au securs!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRENCE>
<DIRECTION>
The terror stricken cabby shakes his head and starts backing up. Terrence lunges forth and grabs the cabby's leg. The cabby screams and tries to get loose. He falls to the ground and is dragged towards the hole. He grabs the bumper of his cab and strains to pull himself away, kicking at Terrence's hand with his free foot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIGHTS come on in an adjacent building. A MAN in pajamas runs out into the rain. The cabby loses his grip on the bumper and he and Terrence are jerked closer to the sewer but the man grabs the cabby's hand and pulls. Some OTHER RESIDENTS gather on the sidewalks. A police car SIREN approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something gives and the man in pajamas falls backwards into a puddle. The small crowd looks down and sees TERRENCE, pulled free from the hole, moaning semi-consciously. We move down his body, past the bleeding stumps where his legs used to be, and follow the BLOOD as it swirls into EDDIES of rain water and flows into the BLACKNESS of the storm drain.

The camera settles on ANDY MCDERMOTT, 22, as he joins the crowd in a rousing cheer, waving a bottle of wine with native gusto. He's good looking in a scrappy sort of way, with shoulder length brown hair, grungy plaid shirt, khakis, and glasses.

BLOOD splatters on white paper. Pull back to see a CHEF with a cut finger standing at the admitting counter, dripping blood on a form. The uptight Parisian NURSE scolds him and pulls out a new form.

ANDY, lugging his back pack, trudges through the sliding glass doors marked "St. Severin Hospital". Bleary eyed, hung over, burdened by a heavy backpack and carrying the crumpled telegram, he approaches ANOTHER NURSE at the counter.

Andy tries to push his way back in, but the shrill little dog yaps at him. Andy grabs his aching "hangover head" in agony. The bleeding chef walks away, dripping, leaving the other nurse free. Andy approaches her. She has her head down in some paperwork.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon... Excusez moi. 'Allo.

TERRENCE lies comatose under a clear plastic oxygen tent. An ORDERLY changes the dressing on his bloody stumps. A NURSE fiddles with the vast array of bleeping, burbling, sucking, life support machinery.

	Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<MARCEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<MARCEL>

	Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...

<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean, maniacs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<MARCEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.

	Yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws.

BEEP BEEP! Something's wrong with uncle Terrence's machinery. The IV bottle is sputtering and bubbling, the EKG monitor is flashing. The orderlies snap into action and pull the curtain shut, waving "no problem" to Andy and Marcel. Marcel leads Andy away, trying to calm him down.

	Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new -

EXT. TERRENCE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy opens the gate of this beautiful 19th century building and walks through THE COURTYARD to the main entrance. A POODLE yaps at him. The dog is in the open doorway of the Concierge's apartment, which opens into the courtyard. The nosy concierge, MADAME CHRETIEN calls the dog, LULU, back in and shuts the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy enters the dark LOBBY, finds the timed auto shut-off light switch and turns it on. He boards the old fashioned wire cage elevator and presses the button for #4. McDermott. The elevator ascends painstakingly slowly. Andy resigns himself to waiting, thumbs through his uncle's date book.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy turns to the day Uncle Terrence was attacked. A circled, cryptic entry at the bottom of the page reads "Meet Claude, Medusa - 11:00". Andy wrinkles his brow. At this second, the light goes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy ascends the rest of the way in darkness. The doors open on the fourth floor. He gets out and finds his way to the apartment. He tries a key in the lock. It won't turn. He jiggles it. No luck. He goes through this with two more keys, grumbling under his breath. Finally he finds the right one. He pushes the door open and gasps.
</DIRECTION>

He's face to face with a scary TRIBAL MASK hanging in the entrance way. It startles him for a second.

	Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately?

As he speaks, he scans the apartment. It's cluttered with an overwhelming assortment of anthropological oddities from around the globe, medieval illustrations, molecular models, and an artsy periodic table that's been used as a dart board.

	He's doing a book with Professor Roussel, about medieval chemistry. I was just transcribing his notes onto the computer and - oh shit!

	If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy.

</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
She flicks a switch on the back of the computer, rebooting it. Andy pauses to look at some nearby photos of his uncle.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I still can't get over it. The cops said it was a "maniac", but he looked like, I don't know, like he'd gone through a combine harvester or... something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Serafine gets kind of emotional at the thought...
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They wouldn't let me see him. Family only. I told them, Terry was almost like a father to me, you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
Andy reacts to her use of the informal "Terry"...
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Depends. Was "Terry" a father like Ward Cleaver or a father like Woody Allen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. She grasps his meaning. She's offended. She starts typing on the computer, giving him the cold shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.

	Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.

Andy sees he's sunk. He heads for the door, but something on the wall catches his eye. A small flyer on the bulletin board with a big drawing of Medusa. He takes it down.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?

<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>

She points to a paperback on the desk. It's French, with a psychedelic cover depicting a man, half King Louis XIV, half witch doctor. The title, (in French) "History Inside Out - Psychic Illumination Through the Ages" by Dr. Claude Roussel. A picture on the back shows an academic looking Claude in a tweed jacket, with gray hair.

	Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.

</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
He walks out of the office. She calls after him.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a fucking lunatic!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
The front door slams. She looks after him, incredulous.

	God damned Americans.

</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUE D'ENFER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MEDUSA HEAD is carved in the stone above the doorway of a crumbling old facade in a rundown Parisian neighborhood. Andy tries the front door. It's locked. There's no sounds or signs of life.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Andy starts off, then pauses as three PARTY GOERS approach the door. They're "modern-primitives" - tribal tattoos, pierced noses, and weird beaded hair. One fishes a key from the Medusa's mouth, opens the door, and lets the group in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy slips in behind them. One GUY in the group looks Andy over and mutters something in French to his friends. They snigger amongst themselves and walk to a door across the foyer. Andy follows, a few paces behind, through the door, down some stairs, into
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DILAPIDATED BASEMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lit with a few candles. They walk past an old boiler, through another door, into
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A NARROW STONE SPIRAL STAIRCASE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They proceed down the ancient stairway, also lit only by the occasional candle placed on the steps. They reach the bottom of the steps and enter a dark, drippy stone tunnel, still lit by candles. Some rats scurry away through the puddles under Andy's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Candles lead the way through the maze of intersecting tunnels. Some graffiti scratched in the wall catches Andy's eye: "Jean Philippe 1803". He pauses to look at it for and loses the group ahead of him. He follows the candles on his own, turning right, left, and left again. A loud, muffled bass beat gets louder. He rounds the corner into
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WILD UNDERGROUND PARTY SPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In an open cavern, lit with torches and strobe lights. Two hundred people are gyrating to eerie techno-tribal dance music. It's a weird crowd, mostly young modern primitive pierced and grungy RAVERS, many wearing day-glo tribal face paint. Clusters of sullen, militant SKINHEADS hang around the periphery.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An attractive, blissed-out WAIF approaches Andy with a paintbrush and a jar of day-glo face paint and a brush. She goes to paint Andy's face. He stops her.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's alright. I'll be a cowboy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles and pushes his hand down. He shrugs and lets her paint two day-glow red stripes on his cheeks.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright. Fine...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with mock enthusiasm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ooh. I can feel it tingling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Andy sniffs and makes a face - the paint has a weird smell.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Phew. What's in this stuff, liquid plumber?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he pulls the book
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	out of his pocket and shows her Claude's
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
picture)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know this guy? Claude?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<WAIF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah oui, le professeur. La bas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAIF>
<DIRECTION>
She points to a dark alcove off the main cavern. Andy nods and starts off. We move in on a leather clad young man leaning against the wall, watching Andy go. This is GASTON DUFAUX, a self-styled Parisian thug, who seems to be cultivating a sort of "Mickey Rourke" look. He takes a drag from his cigarette and we see he's missing two fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy makes his way through the crowd. People are dancing with wild abandon, and many carry torches. A SKINNY GUY IN A DIAPER and a paper mache skull mask runs through the crowd, ranting and spraying fluorescent silly string. He does a weird dance around Andy and jabbers at him in French.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, lemme get back to ya on that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Andy approaches the side room and peers in. A small group of young people are listening intently to CLAUDE, whose back is to us. He's expounding about something in a solemn tone.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
(French, to group)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...How ironic. A man who dedicated his life to opening the doors of the mind now lies trapped behind them. Locked behind a door without a key.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
We follow Andy as he steps around the crowd and sees Claude's face. He looks older than in the photo - he's in his late fifties, with white hair and intense eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excusez moi, I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Claude notices the book in Andy's hand. He speaks fluent English.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Claude is taken by surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God, I'm sorry. But how did you find your way down here? Wait, let's go talk...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
He excuses himself from his "flock" and leads Andy to a quiet corner of the room. The kids disperse, several looking sympathetically at Andy.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The cops. It's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place, endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception, exploring new states of psychic awareness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
They're suddenly doused with day-glo silly string as the gibbering idiot in the diaper pops in to deliver a rant at them.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY_IN_DIAPER>
<DIRECTION>
(French)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The moon is bleeding! Prepare for the downpour!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY_IN_DIAPER>
<DIRECTION>
He ducks back out. Andy picks the silly string out of his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Psychic awareness. Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah well, that's like really groovy and everything, but who hacked my uncle's legs off?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Claude frowns. He looks grave.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Andy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terrence and I came down here to do serious work. For centuries these tunnels have been home to subcultures mainstream society would not tolerate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
He gestures to the main cavern, where people are far gone into various states... some in a trance, some gyrating lustily to the eerily hypnotic music. We intercut with these images as Claude speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These people carry on traditions dating back to pagan times - the ancient quest for expanded consciousness. At the same time they're pioneering a chemical revolution, powerful state-of-the- art compounds... But you know what I mean....
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he gestures to Andy's face paint)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A year ago who would have dreamed of topically applied hallucinogens like TMD? Except Terry of course...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Andy's eyes widen with comprehension. He touches his face.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What!? Hallucinogen? Oh shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
He rubs the face paint off with his shirt sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Claude lowers his voice. He looks grim.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... We stumbled on something else down here Andy. Something horrible, almost unbelievable. But very real. It's been going on for centuries, though most people wouldn't believe it, or wouldn't want to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Andy's somewhere between spooked and incredulous. He glances at the book in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Andy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
Andy turns and sees Serafine run up to him. She looks worried.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must get out of here. It's not safe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs him by the arm. He resists.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not you too -
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
(checks his watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bon nuit Claude.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Andy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
Claude dashes off. Serafine drags Andy into the main cavern.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, chill out a second!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
She leads him across the cavern towards the entrance. Andy stops short and pulls away from her. It's not easy - she has a strong grip.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, hold on. I'm not gonna get dragged around like some kid in a shopping mall. I want you to answer some questions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Serafine sees something over Andy's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merde. I knew I shouldn't have come here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
Andy turns to see Gaston approaching. He leers at Serafine.
</DIRECTION>
<GASTON>
<DIRECTION>
(French)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Serafine, mon cher. I hear your boss looks great in cut-offs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GASTON>
<SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
(French)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the fuck away from me, Gaston.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<GASTON>
<DIRECTION>
(French)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First you tell me where the ADM is, eh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GASTON>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his hand on her shoulder. Andy notices the missing fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
(French)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
She shoves his hand away and pulls Andy past him. Gaston grabs her and spins her around. This time Andy grabs Gaston's hand and pulls it off her. He holds up Gaston's three fingered hand and glares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, this explains the two fingers they found in Liberace's asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Gaston jerks his hand away. He stabs his finger in Andy's chest.
</DIRECTION>
<GASTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Enculé d'Americain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GASTON>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
CRACK! Andy hauls off and belts Gaston in the jaw as hard as he can. But Gaston doesn't even lose his footing. He sneers with rage and hits Andy with a vicious combination. His glasses fly off as he reels into the crowd, knocking a few people into a group of nearby SKINHEADS. The skinheads erupt into randomly directed violence - a full fledged BRAWL breaks out. It's chaos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the floor, Andy squirms away from the skinheads and retrieves his glasses. He hears Serafine call his name. He gets up amidst the mayhem and sees Serafine being carried away by the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Serafine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Someone knocks into Andy and he falls to the ground. He gets back on his feet - Serafine's nowhere in sight. He pushes his way through the crowd, looking for her. He catches sight of her white dress in a distant corner. It's there for a second and then gone again - apparently into a tunnel. He runs over to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy peers into THE TUNNEL, which houses some old pipes. It fades quickly into darkness. He grabs a kerosene torch from the wall and runs into the tunnel. About a hundred yards in he passes an ALCOVE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leans in with his torch and peers around. The cave like room is empty but something catches Andy's eye. Scratched into the stone wall, amidst various graffiti, is A PENTAGRAM. It looks to be centuries old.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy's transfixed by it. The sound of his own breathing suddenly becomes deafening and his vision begins to distort: the textures of the stone wall begin to churn and crawl, and the flames from his torch melt into different hues. The pentagram glows and seems to grow out of the wall...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hallucinatory flash is over as fast as it began. Panting, stunned, Andy shakes it off. He wipes his face, checking for traces of paint. He tries to reassure himself.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa. C'mon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
A woman's SCREAM echoes through the tunnels. He runs towards it.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Serafine!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Another scream - anguished, tortured. Andy runs faster. He arrives at an intersection with another tunnel, turns the corner and finds...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A decrepit old WINO hogging a bottle from his warty HAG companion, provoking her to scream like she just lost her only son. They look up at Andy. The hag shuts up. They fix Andy with an odd stare.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry... I, uh, did you see a girl, la femme, um, avec, la dress blanc?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
They just stare at him. Spooked, he walks past them. They follow him with their creepy stare as he continues into the tunnel, which slopes downhill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes to an old stairway leading down into darkness. WATER pours out of a hole in the ceiling. The steps are severely eroded and slick with flowing water and moss. Andy sees something. It's SERAFINE'S SHOE, laying on a landing a few yards down the stairs. He leans in further, loses his footing and slips.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahh! Son of a bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
He shoots down the stairs on his back, past the shoe which lies at the mouth of an intersecting tunnel. His glasses come off. The torch goes out. He stops at the bottom of the stairs on a gravel surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He winces a bit as he sits up. It's too dark to make much out. He feels around the gravel, finds his GLASSES - they're shattered. He scowls. He stands up and walks ahead, feeling his way along the slick wall, peering into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SERAFINE!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
The echo sounds different - like he's in a larger space. The echo decays into a familiar low RUMBLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A reflection of light appears in a puddle on the floor. The light gets brighter until Andy sees the subway tracks at his feet. The rumble gets suddenly louder as
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
METRO TRAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
barrels around the corner, flooding the tunnel with light and closing on Andy fast.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and runs for THE STAIRWAY. He skids on the gravel and overshoots it. He scrambles back and up into it just as THE TRAIN whooshes past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy scurries a few feet up the slick steps, using a rusty pipe for a handhold. As he looks back at the SPARKING, RUSHING TRAIN WHEELS, his heart pounding in his head, he has another HALLUCINATORY-FLASH: the sparks explode into streaking patterns of color and light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It passes quickly. The train goes by and its rumble fades. Andy squeezes his temples and takes a deep breath. Before he finishes exhaling, an UNEARTHLY HOWL echoes through the tunnels. The howl literally takes his breath away - he's frozen there, eyes wide, not breathing for a long moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quietly, carefully, he makes his way back up the dark, wet stairs. He comes to the landing, picks up Serafine's shoe, and steps into the INTERSECTING TUNNEL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He squints into the darkness. Without his glasses, ANDY'S POV is a bit blurry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks into the tunnel. Another HOWL. Andy swallows hard.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
He hurries along. WATER DRIPS from the tunnel ceiling, down the walls, onto the cobblestone floor, flowing into rivulets around Andy's feet and joining a stream that flows ahead of him, disappearing into the blackness ahead. He approaches another intersection. He stumbles over something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down and makes out a GIRL'S BARE LEG lying in a puddle in the dark intersecting tunnel. He follows the leg up with his eyes - it's messily severed above the knee. He gasps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks further into the tunnel and sees A PAIR OF GLOWING YELLOW EYES staring back at him out of the darkness. Andy turns and runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a horrible ROAR, the eyes lunge after him and turn the corner. As it gains on Andy, we see the dim outline of the massive wolf-like beast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy dives for a SMALL CONDUIT, barely big enough for his body, and wriggles into it. Behind him the yellow eyes appear at the mouth of the conduit - the beast SNARLS but can't fit in. Andy can see a dim light at the end of the conduit. He crawls along.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He emerges into ANOTHER TUNNEL. Some thirty yards away, light and street noise come through a GRATE on the ceiling of an antechamber beyond an iron gate. Relieved, Andy starts off towards it. A SNARL stops him in his tracks. THE BEAST comes tearing around a corner fifty yards behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy breaks into a sprint towards the antechamber. He slips on the wet floor and lands in a puddle, drenching himself. The beast closes in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy gets up, runs into the antechamber and slams the iron gate shut. There's a rusty DEADBOLT lock on the gate, but no key. The beast is twenty five yards away and closing fast - it's massive silhouette filling the diameter of the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy whips out his SWISS ARMY KNIFE, opens the screw driver and tries it in the old-fashioned keyhole - it doesn't work. The beast is twenty feet away. Andy tries the can opener - no luck. Ten feet. Andy jams the corkscrew into the hole. The beast leaps. The corkscrew turns. The DEADBOLT SLIDES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLAM!! The beast rams the gate, shaking the anteroom. But it holds. Flashes of CLAWS and TEETH thrash through the bars, but it's still too dark to make the beast out clearly. Andy runs across the anteroom, grabs the steel sewer grate on the ceiling, and hoists himself up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the bars, he sees a BUSY BOULEVARD in the Pigalle (the "Times Square" of Paris). There's a COP a few paces away. Andy screams to him.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HELP! OFFICER!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE BOULEVARD - Over the roar of traffic and midnight revelers, the cop can barely pinpoint Andy's screams. He looks around, confused. He sees Andy and angrily shakes his baton at him.
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
<DIRECTION>
(French)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! You shouldn't be down there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST slams the gate, wrenching one of the iron bars loose - two more bars and it'll fit through. Andy jumps down, picks up the loose bar. It's got a STAR SHAPED SPEAR TIP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rushes at the gate and jams the spear through the gate, aiming for the thrashing teeth and eyes in the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beast ducks and the spear sinks a couple of inches into the BACK OF IT'S NECK and stops, apparently on bone. It recoils and ROARS with pain, shaking the spear free.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE STREET - The cop raps the bars with his nightstick and peers into the dark anteroom.
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
<DIRECTION>
(in French)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are not allowed down there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE ANTEROOM - The beast rams the gate - it's rage redoubled. Andy jumps up and grabs the grate.

</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Fuck"? You think I don't know this word "fuck"? Is that how you talk to policemen in America?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<DIRECTION>
Enraged, the cop runs to his car, muttering to himself. He opens the trunk and rummages around for something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE ANTEROOM - The beast knocks another bar off the gate. Andy watches in horror as it rams even harder, loosening the NEXT BAR.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
(to the cop)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE STREET - The cop looks over at Andy, incensed. He takes a crowbar from the trunk, runs back cussing in French, and struggles with the grate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE ANTEROOM - The NEXT BAR on the gate gives. The beast sticks its head through the gap and focuses it's searing yellow eyes on Andy. It rears back, ready to pounce...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GRATE - comes up. The cop grabs Andy and pulls...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE ANTEROOM - Andy's legs dangle like bait. The beast lunges, teeth and claws bared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE STREET - Andy screams as a bus roars by. The cop pulls him up and out. Andy's right pants leg is torn open and he's bleeding from a GOUGE in his ankle.
</DIRECTION>

He points frantically at the open hole. The cop aims his flashlight in the hole. It's empty. He looks Andy up and down.
</DIRECTION>
<COP>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your passport.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<DIRECTION>
Shaking, Andy takes his passport out of his pocket. The cop takes it and copies some information. Andy raves at him - a blur of English and broken French.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's something down there! A bear or something! A god damn monster! Beau coup teeth! Huge, Grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed Serafine! My God...

	No... I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
He looks disoriented, half-crazed. He definitely seems like he's on drugs. The cop shines his flashlight in Andy's eyes - his PUPILS are like saucers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANDY'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cop's flashlight sparks another HALLUCINATORY FLASH. The cops face melts like liquid, sounds swirl together, the garish neon signs of The Pigalle explode into streaking colors and we BURN INTO WHITE.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy walks up to the apartment door. Disoriented and shaking, he manages to open the door and walk in. He locks the door, and switches on the lights. He looks out the small PEEPHOLE. No sign of anyone or anything. He leans back against the door and rubs his hands across his face.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh god. Je suis seriously messed up...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
There's a DRIPPING sound coming from the kitchen. Andy looks across the living room into the dark kitchen. The DRIP continues. He steps forward cautiously. Suddenly he feels something and looks down sharply.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNCLE TERRENCE, bloody stumps and all, is clutching Andy's legs and looking up at him desperately. He's trying to speak but can't seem to make a sound. Blood from his wounds soaks the WHITE BEAR RUG beneath them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy's terror struck, he tries to jump away but falls backwards to the floor. Terrence crawls up and gets close to Andy's face. He croaks out two words in a rasp -

	Saint Severin...

INT. TERRENCE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME TIME

The EKG monitor shows a FLATLINE. Alarms are BEEPING. Terrence's body lies motionless under the oxygen tent. A DOCTOR and a NURSE rush to the bed. The nurse rips the oxygen tent away and the doctor SLAMS his fists down on Terrence's chest. The EKG show s a tentative blip. The doctor SLAMS again. An erratic heart beat starts back up on the EKG.

</LEDUC>

Perotin nods, still laughing. Marcel walks him to the door. Before he steps out, Perotin bares his teeth, growls again, and cracks up some more. Marcel, laughing, claps him on the back and shuts the door - then he and LeDuc go instantly stone faced. They look at each other gravely.

INT. TERRENCE'S APT. - LATE MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SAME OLD BOOK, sitting on the coffee table. The pages are stuffed with notepaper place markers, many covered with scribbling, and CHEMICAL NOTATION. In the background, on the floor, is Andy - fast asleep and snoring where he collapsed the night before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a key in the lock. The door opens, smacking Andy in the head once, twice.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aoww! Hey! What the hell...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs the door so it can't hit him again. Serafine pokes her head around and sees him. She's surprised, relieved, elated. Andy's reaction is more disoriented, stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Andy! Holy shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Serafine...?
	</DIALOGUE>

She kneels beside him and helps him sit up.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
	</DIALOGUE>

<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
He looks over at the clean bear rug. Andy rises to his feet groggily. He looks down at the rip in his pant leg. He feels the torn fabric, trying to remember.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened? Did you cut yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
He goes over to the window and parts the curtains. It's a brilliant sunny day.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was fucking stupid, going down there. You could have been killed. I tried to warn you, But you don't listen. Just like your uncle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
Andy's only half listening. He opens the window, and inhales deeply. Across the court yard, a MATRONLY WOMAN leans out a window, hanging her laundry. In the courtyard, Lulu the obnoxious poodle YAPS at another resident, and Madame Chretien calls her back. Andy's head is clearing. His mood lifting.

He turns around and smiles at her.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Actually, I feel fan-fucking- tastic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>

Serafine laughs. She hasn't heard this expression before. He approaches her.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fan-fucking-tastic?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.

He makes a grab for her, and she pushes him away.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Calm down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
He jumps up on the sofa, unable to contain his energy.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>

	Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.

She turns and heads off to the office. He runs in front of her and blocks her path.

	What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour?

<DIRECTION>
on a TV screen, dubbed with a zany French voice, undergoes a radical physical transformation in "The Nutty Professor". Pull back to reveal Andy and Serafine watching this scene on a dozen or so TV's in a store window display. Several PARISIAN PEDESTRIANS watch Jerry with reverence.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now this is Paris!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
On screen, the Nutty Professor's alter ego, "Buddy Love" launches into his swinging version of "That Old Black Magic". To this accompaniment, we cut the following -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PARIS MONTAGE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- AT A BRASSERIE: Andy is about to escort Serafine into the trendy eatery, but she stops him at the door and points to the menu, or more specifically the prices. He makes a horrified face, and they move on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- IN A BOULANGERIE: Serafine buys cheese, Andy buys meats - the counterman shows Andy how big a slice off the pate loaf he's about to cut. Andy nods "yes". The counterman cuts it and offers the slice. Andy shakes his head "no" and points to the much larger remainder of the loaf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- AT AN OUTDOOR MARKET: Detective Marcel, wearing a lame "disguise" (new wave sunglasses ala "Diva"), watches Andy and Serafine shop from a distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- IN A PATISSERIE: Andy points to a large baguette, says something suggestive and winks boastfully at Serafine. She gives him a "yeah, right" look and points at a small breadstick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- IN A WINE STORE: Andy looks at each bottle closely, then "tests" it by shaking vigorously. Serafine's amused. The owner's baffled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- ON THE RIGHT BANK: Arms full of groceries, Andy and Serafine pass the row of outdoor pet stores near the river. Andy looks longingly at the live ducks in their cages. Serafine pulls him along. MUSIC fades out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ILE SAINT LOUIS - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy and Serafine sit on the river bank facing a magnificent Paris vista. Serafine unpacks the food.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
She laughs and pushes him playfully.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...

</ANDY>
<SERAFINE>

	So's Woody Allen.

(Andy laughs. She
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	starts uncorking the
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
wine.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.
	</DIALOGUE>

(she uncorks the wine
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	and fills their
	</DIALOGUE>

plastic cups)

	You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(They raise their
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	cups. Andy taps his
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
forehead.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A la votre.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
They "clink" and drink. He notices her KEYCHAIN lying on the ground. It's a miniature replica of Rodin's famous sculpture, "The Kiss". He picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This looks familiar...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc-
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she catches herself and laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
She gestures across the river. Andy looks at the gorgeous panorama.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I gotta admit, you French are pretty good at beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at Serafine. She looks back at him. He holds up "The Kiss".
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bet you're pretty good at this too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles playfully.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, sculpting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes his head "no" and moves towards her. They kiss tenderly. They separate and share a deep, passionate look. They kiss again, hungrily, falling into a passionate embrace. They're really going for it. Her NAILS dig into his back. He pulls her body into his until they look like one form - just like Rodin's sculpture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
APPLAUSE and CHEERS break the moment. A TOURIST BOAT is gliding by on the Seine, it's ELDERLY PASSENGERS applauding the young couple. Serafine pulls away, blushing a little, and turns to the boat. ANDY doesn't even notice the boat. He's staring at Sera fine with a scary kind of intensity. She starts to say something but he starts kissing her again, cutting her off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he's out of control, pawing at her... It takes an effort for her to pull back from him.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, calm down a second...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks into his eyes and freezes with fear. HIS STARE is terrifying, totally predatory, inhuman. Something's ignited in him. She pushes him away and shakes him.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong with you!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
Andy blinks and seems to come a couple of steps back to normality.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Aren't I a good kisser? What's the matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
She fixes him with a heavy, suspicious stare. She glances down at his ankle, where the bottom of HIS WOUND is visible. She seems to understand something. She fumbles in her purse, takes out a compact mirror, and checks her face.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, look at my lipstick. Look, I'm going to run into the bathroom at that cafe. Stay here and watch the stuff, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
She gets up and starts off. He looks after her.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Serafine...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be right back. Stay put.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
She runs up the steps to street level. Andy watches her go. He turns back to his glass of wine and chugs it. He puts the bottle to his lips and takes a long belt. He picks up the big block of pate and bites into it like a piece of cake. He likes it. He takes another huge bite. He looks after Serafine. He gets up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAFE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Serafine puts her "telecarte" into the pay phone and dials. She looks anxious, upset. We hear the phone ringing at the other end. Behind her, Andy comes into the cafe. He walks up to her, pissed off.

<ANDY>

She drops the phone and runs out of the cafe. On the sidewalk, she looks in all directions. Nothing. Andy's gone.

He hangs up. He strokes his chin and furrows his brow, sinking deep into thought.

EXT. STREETS OF PARIS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Music cue: "Wolf Call" by Elvis Presley. Andy pays for a crepe at one of the roadside stands, and eats it as he walks along the narrow sidewalk, still brooding about Serafine. He stops to gawk at the PRETTY GIRLS that pass by, and bumps into a young FRENCH TOUGH with a ROTTWEILER.
</DIRECTION>
<FRENCH_TOUGH>

	Idiot!

<ANDY>

</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
He glares at the tough and his growling dog. The dog suddenly shrinks back in fear and decides it's time to leave. He pulls his owner along. Andy continues on his way. He ditches the half finished crepe. That's not what he's hungry for.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy comes upon a trendy little CAFE with several tables of diners eating in the open air. Andy notices an attractive young blond sitting alone, thumbing through a "Let's Go" guide. This is AMY SINGLETON. Andy approaches confidently.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahem. Did you know that, according to the "Let's Go" code of conduct, whenever two Americans meet in Paris, the one with the sexiest smile has to buy dinner?
	</DIALOGUE>

Amy smiles. She is indeed sexy, with remarkable, sparkling BLUE EYES.

INT. TERRENCE'S APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - SAME TIME

Serafine unlocks the door and enters the apartment. She's stopped cold by what she sees. The place has been totally ransacked - drawers opened, shelves cleared, furniture overturned, the works. The window is open.

<SERAFINE>

	Merde! Salots!

She walks across the room, kicking at the debris in her path. She stands in the middle of the mess, absolutely furious.

EXT. CAFE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Three successive tables of upscale PARISIAN DINERS are gawking at something. At one table, Inspector Marcel hides behind his menu, and shakes his head in disdain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow their glances to Andy, greedily licking the last bits of Steak Tartar off his plate. Amy giggles in amazement as she pours the last from the bottle of wine. She's a bit drunk - enough to be amused by Andy's antics.

<AMY>

	God. How can you eat like that?

</AMY>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all in the tongue. Another bottle?

Amy laughs and nods "yes". JEAN-LUC, 25, a well dressed, powerfully built Frenchman enters. He kisses Amy on both cheeks, all the while watching Andy uneasily.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jean-Luc. You're kinda late sweetie.

</AMY>
<JEAN_LUC>

	I was busy. Is this a friend of yours?

<AMY>

	Well, yeah, kinda', but -

</AMY>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're so much more than friends. We're soul mates, sex slaves, pen pals, the whole nine yards. Well, nine yards is a slight exaggeration, but believe me, for a white boy, I got nothing to be ashamed of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Amy laughs in mid gulp and wine comes through her nose. Andy looks at Jean-Luc, who is - of course - pretty steamed.

<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I'm kidding... It's a joke! Here, maybe if I say it in metric.

Jean-Luc brings his hand back and slaps Andy in the mouth.

	Shut up. Why are you Americans always so loud?

<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Maybe it's so we can drown out the sound of your mother fucking the navy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Jean-Luc takes a swing at Andy. With amazing reflexes, he dodges it deftly. Jean-Luc jabs - again Andy avoids it easily. He smiles, impressed with himself. Jean-Luc is incensed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes for Andy's throat, but Andy catches him by the arm and, with superhuman strength, FLIPS him head over heels, through the air and - SMASH! - onto a nearby table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy casually leans past the semi-conscious Jean-Luc and plucks a CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE out of its ice bucket. The WAITER is about to object, but thinks better of it. Andy takes Amy by the arm, she grabs the RED WINE BOTTLE, and they start off away from the cafe.

<AMY>

	Wow. You know Kung Fu or something?

In the background, Marcel hurries to pay his tab and follow them. He slips on some of the broken glassware spilled by Jean-Luc's fall, and almost goes for a tumble himself.

Marcel is hiding behind a grave, spying. His passion for police work has been reborn, judging from his rapt, totally absorbed stare. He's watching...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANDY AND AMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
having extremely hot and primal sex on Jim Morrison's grave, lit by dozens of flickering candles people have "left for Jim". He pours red wine into their mouths. Sweat and wine drip off their naked bodies. The sex heats up to an intense, screaming climax. Amy squeals with ecstasy.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God! You're an animal!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
But Andy's still accelerating - transported to another plane. Sweat pours from his brow. His face contorts with each groan, but now it's hard to tell if it's from pleasure or pain. His body jerks violently and his skin suddenly blushes bright red. Amy winces.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahh! Jesus! You're burning hot! What the hell -

Andy's skin literally glows red, turning his sweat to steam. He leaps off Amy and disappears into the sprawling cemetery, screaming in agony. Amy watches him go.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, where are you going!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Marcel starts off after Andy, taking the wide route around Amy. Andy's scream echoes through the cemetery. Amy pulls her dress on.

	Creep.

ANDY

red hot (literally), weaves through the tombs, screaming. He comes to a small courtyard with an ORNATE FOUNTAIN. He dives into the brackish water. Clouds of steam rise off the water as he thrashes about under the marble goddess in the center of the fountain.

<DIRECTION>
AMY
</DIRECTION>

searches through the graveyard. She's got Andy's clothes.

THE FOUNTAIN

<DIRECTION>
Andy's gurgling screams are changing, becoming less human. We catch glimpses of body parts as they surface from the churning froth - GROTESQUE, FLAILING LIMBS somewhere in mid- transformation between human and beast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
steps cautiously through the ancient, ornate tombs and mausoleums, listening to the distant splashing and sporadic inhuman screams. He draws his gun and loads a cartridge. Suddenly a horrible grunt and loud SMASH pierce the air. Marcel wheels around and smacks nose first into a gravestone.

	Merde!

Amy feels something and looks down. There's a stream of water flowing around her feet. She follows it towards its source and steps into
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE COURTYARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fountain has been smashed - the stone rim cracked into bits and the center statue fallen to the ground. There's no sign of Andy. Amy walks up to the fountain.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
She notices something on the ground. It's the STONE GODDESS, smashed into several pieces. We hear a low growl. Amy looks up, terrified. She scans the GRAVES around the perimeter of the courtyard. She takes a few tentative steps backward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a MASSIVE TOMBSTONE is wrenched off its base (most of the ancient stone markers are eroded and crumbling - many already fallen over). It falls like a tree, revealing the familiar pair of piercing yellow eyes behind it, framed by the dim outline of a massive beast. Amy emits an odd, primitive whine.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unnnhh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
She runs away from the beast, across the courtyard and disappears into the graves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the DENSE FOREST OF TALL TOMBSTONES, Amy zigs and zags through narrow spaces, barely wide enough for her slender body to fit through. The camera CRANES UP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIGH ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thirty paces behind Amy, pairs of tombstones split apart like jungle vegetation, crashing thunderously to the ground. The unseen beast's path is slowed by the monuments, but still follows Amy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy looks back as she runs. She sees the tops of tombstones fall behind her. She comes to a railing at the top of a fifteen foot wall separating a LOWER LEVEL of the cemetery. She hangs over the edge and quietly drops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs down a path comes to an intersection where six paths converge. She looks down each of them, but can't see the outer walls of the cemetery - just an endless landscape of graves. She sprints down a path and ducks behind A LARGE CRYPT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up on the higher level, the beast howls. She looks up and sees its silhouette sniffing the air, the full moon looming behind it. She looks up at the iron door on the crypt. Then she reaches into her purse...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Its HEAVY BREATH dominates the soundtrack. It scans the sprawl of graves from its perch on the hill, sniffing. It locks it's stare on the large crypt. It sniffs again. With a growl, it leaps over the railing (we stay with its POV) and hits the ground running. It runs up a twisting path, closing in on THE CRYPT. It arrives at the back of the crypt and circles it, sniffing. It stops in front of the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST'S EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Narrow and glow with intense predatory focus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE CRYPT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're looking at the door. CRASH! It flies open, revealing the snarling beast, backlit by the moon. It lunges in and stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scans back and forth - the crypt is empty. The beast sniffs again and growls with rage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
somewhere else in the graveyard, sprays a long blast of perfume into another crypt, and sneaks into the endless maze of tombs. We hear the enraged beast smash into another crypt a hundred yards away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy comes to ANOTHER FOUNTAIN and slips into the water, quietly rinsing herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
smashes into another crypt. Nothing's inside. It backs up and runs to another crypt. SMASH! Nothing. The growls grow more furious. It crashes down another door. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy, dripping wet, pads down a row of ancient family mausoleums. She pauses as the beast lets loose a horrible howl and topples a monument some distance away. She tries the heavy iron door on a SMALL GOTHIC MAUSOLEUM. It opens. She slips inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE MAUSOLEUM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy crouches under the small portal and STAINED GLASS WINDOW, which depicts the Virgin Mary. She struggles to quiet her breathing, and listens...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hears only the trickling water from the nearby fountain. Then... some crackling twigs... then a SNIFF... another SNIFF, closer. Trembling, Amy quietly raises herself, peers out the portal and sees
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARCEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing a few paces away, SNIFFING and trying to stem the flow from his bloody nose.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merde...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCEL>
<DIRECTION>
Amy breaths a sigh of relief. Then -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST springs out of the darkness behind Marcel - a blur of eyes, claws, and teeth - and tackles him to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE MAUSOLEUM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy drops down to the floor, huddled in terror. A GUN SHOT hits the STAINED GLASS above Amy's head, shattering the Holy Virgin. Another GUN SHOT followed by a ROAR OF PAIN from the beast. But the pained roar quickly becomes VICIOUS SNARLING again. There are no more shots, just horrible snarls, screams, and ripping flesh. BLOOD splatters through the portal and drips down Amy's face. She hunkers down. Then, the sound of steps going away, and at last... silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy waits. We hear only the fountain and another, closer DRIPPING. It's Amy's wet clothes, still dripping into A PUDDLE on the floor, which is dripping UNDER THE IRON DOOR, into a small STREAM flowing on the otherwise dry STONE WALKWAY, away from the mausoleum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the mausoleum, Amy listens a bit more. Satisfied the coast is clear, she quietly turns to the iron door, grasps the handle and slowly turns it. But
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
before it clicks open -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RRRIIP!! The iron door is wrenched out of Amy's hand and off it's hinges, revealing
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST, up close and in clear view for the first time - it's truly awesome - a huge leering mouth full of razor sharp teeth, a hulking body built like a wolf but as massive as a bear, and vaguely humanoid paws with big hook claws. There's a bloody FLESH WOUND in its right shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It snarls savagely at Amy. She chokes out a little cry. The beast lunges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE THE MAUSOLEUM - HIGH ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beast's powerful hind section sticks out of the mausoleum, kicking a bit as it rips into its prey. The graveyard sprawls endlessly under the big moon, which hangs low in the sky.

We hear Lulu the poodle's bell jingling behind a bush. Madame Chretein pokes her head out her door and whistles for Lulu. The bell keeps jingling, but Lulu doesn't come. She calls its name. It still won't come. She steps out into the courtyard in her bathrobe and walks towards the bush, calling for the dog, annoyed as its disobedience. She looks behind the bush and sees - A CROW picking at the scant remains of Lulu, ringing the collar bell with its beak. She SCREAMS.

She hangs up. Andy is very confused. He sees the front door - it's ajar and the door frame has been splintered where the deadbolt sits. Stunned, he stands up, only to double over with a wave of nausea. He covers his mouth and runs stooped over to the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leans over the toilet and vomits. After a few heaves his body relaxes and he catches his breath. He opens his eyes and looks down in the bowl - horror and disbelief sweep over his face as he focuses on:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HUMAN EYEBALL
</DIRECTION>

staring back at him from the bloody water. The iris is a familiar shade of sparkling blue...

	Oh no... no...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>

The doorbell rings. He leaps up, flushes the toilet and runs out of the bathroom, still naked, to find himself in full view of LeDuc and two UNIFORMED COPS standing in the open door. One of the cops is examining the splintered door frame.

LeDuc looks to be in an even worse mood than usual. His English is rough, but firm.

We're close on a metal body drawer. A TECHNICIAN pulls it open, revealing a severed human foot, nothing else.

It's badly lacerated. Parts of her throat and midriff are missing, and she has only one eye. Andy gasps in horror.

He leaves the room. The technician leaves too. Andy's alone, staring at the corpses. Through the window, he can see LeDuc arguing loudly with his superior... Andy tries to breath deeply, calm down. He turns back to look at Amy's corpse. Suddenly, her eyes - well, her eye - snaps open and looks straight at him!

Andy spins around to see Claude standing by the hallway to Terrence's office. Andy reaches for the gun and points it at him.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Andy! No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
She puts herself between Claude and the gun barrel. Andy pushes her out of the way.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Serafine! Move! Don't you see, he's just after the drug, that ADM stuff. He's using you to get to it, just like he used Uncle Terrence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Claude approaches Andy, speaking calmly.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why the fuck would I do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because, Andy. It's a cure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A cure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A cure. With ADM we can wipe out lycanthropy, the curse of the werewolf, forever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Andy is shocked, stunned, skeptical. He bluffs with the only card he's got.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that so? Maybe we should go to Saint Severin church and make sure, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Claude's face changes. He's surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, you've done your homework... Excellent. Get your coat. Leave the gun with Serafine. She can keep searching. We don't have much time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Andy and Serafine share a heavy look. He hands her the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...

EXT. SAINT SEVERIN CHURCH - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheets of rain crash down over this ancient gothic church. Sharing an umbrella, Andy and Claude walk inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNMARKED POLICE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parked across the street, Rene and Francois watch them enter the church. Rene talks into a cellular phone.
</DIRECTION>
<RENE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Really... Okay, keep checking in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEDUC>
<DIRECTION>
LeDuc hangs up and thinks a moment. He turns the page of the old book on his desk, revealing an old woodcut illustration of a policeman being attacked by a werewolf. He frowns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAINT SEVERIN CHURCH - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An evening mass is in progress. The boy's choir fills the church with a solemn hymn. Andy follows Claude to a narrow staircase. An OLD WOMAN gives them the evil eye and crosses herself as they pass. Claude and Andy go up the stairs and arrive at a balcony under a magnificent wall of ancient STAINED GLASS. One of the panels catches Andy's eye.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
THE PANEL shows a weird medieval ritual - a man draining blood from another man's neck into a goblet. ANOTHER PANEL features a pentagram. ANOTHER PANEL shows a huge werewolf eating a monk under a frowning sun. All the transcriptions are in Latin. Claude signals Andy to follow him.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The panels that concern us are over here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he directs Andy to a group of panels)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll translate the Latin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
A PANEL shows a different werewolf, tied down, being stabbed in the heart by a knight under a frowning moon.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Then Simon did slay the demon spirit, the same as had made him unclean,"
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
THE NEXT PANEL - the knight now holds the beast's heart aloft, impaled on his dagger. Where the beast was, a man lies bleeding in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"and Simon did cut out the heart of the beast which once dead, regained the shape of a man"
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
THE NEXT PANEL shows the beast's heart on a platter. The Hero is sitting at a table, cutting into the heart with a knife, as if he's about to eat it.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he turns to Andy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These pictures are not just myth, Andy. The scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public. This is the medieval version of a newspaper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
(skeptical)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well what if it's the Weekly World News...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It's all true, Andy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Startled, Andy turns to see Amy and Marcel, a little worse for wear, standing behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, if by some miracle you can find the werewolf that bit you, and then manage to eat it's heart, the curse is lifted. I was gonna tell you but Marcel wouldn't let me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<MARCEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh sure, it was all mean old Marcel's idea. Give me a break! We didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! Not to mention disgusting. Look...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCEL>
<DIRECTION>
Marcel reaches into his own chest cavity, rips out his own slimy purple heart, and thrusts it in Andy's face.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A little Grey Poupon and then Bon appetite, eh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCEL>
<DIRECTION>
Andy grimaces and turns back to Claude.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Amy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe we've been introduced.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he rolls his eyes)
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles and extends her hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amy. Nice to meet you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<DIRECTION>
Claude shakes her hand - SQUISH. Some sort of body fluid oozes out of Amy's hand. Claude frowns and discreetly wipes his hand with a handkerchief. Marcel smiles and extends his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marcel.

	<DIALOGUE>
	My wife has all your books.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCEL>
<DIRECTION>
Claude nods "thank you". Andy's had enough.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Claude)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uncle Terrence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because Gaston was after it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<MARCEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's -
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCEL>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Claude)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what about you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Believe me, I won't go through another night of that hell. I have my contingency plan right here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
He removes a WHITE PILL from his coat pocket and holds it up.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sodium cyanide.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
The CHURCH BELLS ring. The group listens tensely as the solemn bells sound eight times.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
The wheels in Andy's head are turning. He looks over at Amy and Marcel. He smiles. He's got an idea.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Andy, please. Don't smile like that. You're scaring me.
	</DIALOGUE>

INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy and Serafine walk down the corridor of the Terminal Ward. Andy looks determined. Serafine looks upset.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What makes you so sure this will work?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose you're right. But I still don't like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
They stop at the door to Terrence's room.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. You don't have to watch. Stay out here and stand guard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
She nods. Andy goes into
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TERRENCE'S HOSPITAL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights are off. Andy approaches Terrence's oxygen tent. In the dim light, he can barely make out Terrence through the plastic, lying motionless, barely making an impression under the sheets. He looks at the body wistfully and surveys the array of machinery that's keeping him "alive". Most of the machines are plugged into a TRANSFORMER BOX on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. We meet again... Look, I know you understand what I'm about to do here. I think. But I hope you forgive me anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Andy takes a deep breath. He leans down to the transformer and opens the safety cover, and flips the power switch. All the machines power down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the old man in the bed sits up, gasping, and clawing at the walls of the oxygen tent. Oh my God! It's NOT Terrence!! Andy nearly soils himself, diving down to fumble with the transformer, suddenly all thumbs. He switches the power on again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE NURSE STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fat, sour looking duty nurse sees the alarm from the failed life support system. She's about to call for help when the indicator stops flashing. She watches it intently for a few seconds, nothing. She decides to dismiss it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TERRENCE'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The old man is lying back down, asleep. He seems to be okay. His support machinery is functioning normally again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a sigh of relief, Andy turns and pulls back the curtain behind him. There's Terrence, sans oxygen tent, hooked up to another extensive support system.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. You moved...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls the curtain closed behind him, and moves in close to his uncle. Terrence's expression looks unmistakably morose.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't look happy... Um, I don't usually go in for this stuff, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(He crosses himself,
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	and says a silent
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
prayer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Andy leans down, opens the transformer box, and flips the power switch. The machines power down - all except the EKG monitor, which shows a flat line and emits the familiar steady tone. Andy switches off the monitor. Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terrence's body is completely still, peaceful. He leans down over its face and speaks in a soft voice.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uncle Terrence? Can you hear me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Terrence's body remains motionless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE NURSE'S STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This time the nurse doesn't wait to respond. Seeing the indicators from Terrence's room, she presses the intercom.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE>

	Chambre 411. Code bleu! Code bleu!

</NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
IN TERRENCE'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Andy's worried. He takes his uncle by the shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on... Skip the undead orientation and get down here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing. He looks at the door nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE THE DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Serafine sees a squad of doctors and nurses pushing trolleys of emergency equipment her way from the far end of the hall. She leans her head in the door to warn Andy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy is beside himself with stress. He shakes Terrence's bed a little to rouse him. Nothing. He tries a little harder shake... The door opens. It's Serafine, also in a panic.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're coming!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit. What have I done?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Serafine)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
She shuts the door, just in time. The emergency team are right there.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
(feigning hysterics)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay away from him! You butchers! Haven't you done enough already!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
They struggle to get past her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy can hear Serafine arguing outside the door. He looks out the window to the three story drop into the alley below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE THE DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Serafine is finally shoved aside. They push the door open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy rushes to the door and pushes it shut. He cranks the DOORKNOB all the over and bends it down, jamming it in the locked position. He steps away. The door holds, but for how long? He looks at the old man in the oxygen tent. Hmm. He pushes the old man's bed up against the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy forces the window open and steps out onto the ledge. He looks back at his uncle, and the old guy. He shrugs apologetically, then takes a deep breath, closes his eyes, and jumps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE THE HOSPITAL ROOM DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fat nurse is getting impatient with the doctors, who are attempting to pick the lock "surgically". She pushes them aside and heaves her considerable heft against into the door. It opens a crack. She backs up and slams it again...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The nurse's jolts shake the old guy's bed, sliding it forward. He dozes happily like a baby rocking in the cradle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE BACK ALLEY BEHIND THE HOSPITAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy runs behind a nearby dumpster to avoid being seen from the window above. He kicks the wall in frustration.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn it!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
A voice calls out from behind Andy.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRENCE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa! What an outrageous nightmare!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRENCE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Andy spins around and sees Terrence, the undead version, perched atop some trash bags, scratching himself.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uncle Terrence?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<TERRENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Andy? Andy is that you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRENCE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Terrence mutters distractedly, excitedly, and quickly...
</DIRECTION>
<TERRENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Andy, I have to tell you about the dream I had - or that I'm still having - it feels like a systemic, physio- tropic reaction to some drug, maybe a triptamine or phenethylamine derivative. But it is hyper-real. I'd swear my legs had been cut off or... wait a second... I'm getting a strange meta-physical buzz. Shit. I'm, uh, dead, aren't I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRENCE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sort of...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
BACK IN THE HOSPITAL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doctors have clustered around Terrence's corpse. The nurse is lubricating the electro-shock paddles for the doctor. Serafine slips out the door into the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOMEONE'S POV, spying from behind a supply cart in the hallway (we see a hand on the cart), watches Serafine walk away, unnoticed by the doctors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK IN THE ALLEY
</DIRECTION>
<TERRENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRENCE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<TERRENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRENCE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I went to St. Severin church.

ZAP! The doctor jolts Terrence's chest with the paddles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE ALLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terrence's zombie jerks with sudden pain.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there!

	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is it! Please!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<TERRENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRENCE>
<DIRECTION>
Another zap. The undead Terrence twists his face in pain. In the background, Serafine appears at the mouth of the alley. Terrence croaks out a few last words.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lies! All lies! Ahhhh!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRENCE>
<DIRECTION>
Andy turns towards Serafine, then back to his uncle, but Terrence is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terrence's face is contorted with pain. The EKG monitor shows a weak but regular heartbeat. The doctor pulls off his mask and wipes his brow. The other technicians congratulate him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE ALLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Serafine approaches. Andy runs up to join her.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess that's why he hid it there. Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
They run out of the alley and see GASTON jump on his hopped- up Kawasaki enduro.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit! He must have heard us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
Gaston sees them, gives them the finger and tears off down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dammit! C'mon!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
They run to Serafine's Vespa - the tires are slashed. Enraged, she kicks it over.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That bastard! Fuck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
Andy looks around desperately. A GUY pulls his motorcycle out of its parking spot and starts up the street towards Andy. Andy jumps out in front of the accelerating bike and grabs the handlebars, stopping it short, sending the rider tumbling forward, over Andy. He lands on his butt in the street and starts yelling at Andy, who climbs on the bike.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry... I'll bring it back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Serafine hops on the back and they burn rubber down the street after Gaston. Music cue: CCR's "Bad Moon on the Rise". They screech around the corner onto
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAINT GERMAIN BOULEVARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's red lights as far as the eye can see. Andy grits his teeth and accelerates towards the cluster of traffic stopped at the first light.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh merde!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
She shuts her eyes as Andy zooms between the rows of stopped cars and roars through the red light. SCREECH!! Crossing cars slam on their brakes and swerve to avoid the speeding bike. Andy bears down on the next red light.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you crazy!?

Andy speeds through more stopped cars and runs the next red light. SCREECH!! More swerving cars. Andy has to swerve himself to avoid one. He bears down on the next light. Meanwhile...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GASTON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is stopped on his bike, casually talking on a cellular phone, two red lights ahead of Andy and Serafine. He hears their bike and turns to see them zoom through the intersection in back of him. Gaston curses, puts the phone in his pocket and twists his throttle, accelerating through the red light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANDY AND SERAFINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
gain on Gaston. They're seventy five yards behind him.

GASTON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pulls a pistol and aims over his shoulder. BANG! He fires back at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERAFINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pulls her pistol out. Both bikes roar through another red light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A POLICE CAR pulls out onto the boulevard and turns on its flashing lights and siren and pursues the bikes. The traffic lights turn green.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gaston leads by fifty yards. The cop car pulls alongside Andy and Serafine. She discreetly pockets her gun. The COP in the passenger seat aims his gun at Andy.

Serafine curses again. Andy tries to calm her down. The arguing escalates... In the car, the first cop is talking on the radio.
</DIRECTION>
<FIRST_COP>

	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRST_COP>
<DIRECTION>
He turns, looks out his window and sees

RENE AND FRANCOIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
parked in their unmarked car. Rene is talking with him on the radio. Francois waves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SECOND COP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is trying to put handcuffs on Serafine. She's still screaming at him. He's incensed. The first cop gets out of the car and walks up to them.

Serafine smiles at the second cop. Andy peels out, races through the red light and disappears down the boulevard. The cops watch them go, then turn to each other. The second cop is apoplectic - about to explode.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNMARKED CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rene and Francois speed off to keep pace with Andy. Rene is dialing his cellular phone. As they pass the other police car, we glimpse the two cops in an angry shoving match against the car. Rene's call goes through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAINT SEVERIN CHURCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LeDuc is on the balcony, studying the stained glass panels and consulting an old book. The cellular phone in his coat pocket rings. An OLD PRIEST nearby frowns at him.
</DIRECTION>
<LEDUC>

(Pause)

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll meet you there in ten minutes.

</LEDUC>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up. The priest is still frowning at him. LeDuc shrugs gruffly - "what do you want from me?" and turns back to the stained glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the church bells sound ten o'clock we cut to different panels: Several scenes of werewolves terrorizing people. A scene where some people mix potions and dump a strange flower into a cauldron. Another shows an evil looking man shaking his arm defiantly at a frowning sun - though he is human his raised arm is the enlarged, hairy limb of a werewolf. Another shows a saint throwing the strange flower into a fire in the town square.
</DIRECTION>
<LEDUC>
<DIRECTION>

EXT. TERRENCE'S APT. BUILDING

Music cue: "Evil" by Howlin' Wolf. Gaston stops, jumps off his bike, and runs into the court yard.

<DIRECTION>
ANDY AND SERAFINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
speed along on the bike, weaving through narrow side streets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GASTON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
riding the wire cage elevator in the apartment building down to the basement. He gets out and walks down the dank hallway, past several padlocked doors. He stops at one with a MCDERMOTT nameplate. He's about to shoot it off, then looking around, thinks again. He grabs the lock and, grimacing with the effort, twists it off with his bare hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANDY AND SERAFINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stuck behind a garbage truck on a narrow street. Andy hops the curb and races down the sidewalk, scattering pedestrians.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GASTON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
flicks on the light switch in the wine cellar. There are six large racks of wine bottles. He walks past them, scanning the bottles. He stops at the third rack and removes a bottle. The label reads "Chateau Margaux". He tries to peer inside, but it's too hard to see. Instead, he hurls it at the wall - SMASH!! Wine sprays everywhere, but no metal cylinder. He grabs another bottle. SMASH!! Just wine. He grabs another...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANDY AND SERAFINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
arrive in front of the apartment and hop off their bike. Serafine eyes GASTON'S BIKE hatefully. Andy pulls her along.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a second...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls out her gun. BLAM! BLAM! She blasts the gas tank - WOOF! The bike goes up in a fireball. Serafine nods, satisfied. Andy looks at her like she's nuts. They rush into the courtyard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GASTON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
throws another bottle. SMASH! Just wine. The floor is awash in the pricey Burgundy. He throws another bottle. SMASH! Nothing. He licks his fingers. He's enjoying this...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERAFINE AND ANDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the elevator, going down, maddeningly slowly. Through the window they can see the full moon in the sky. Andy checks his watch. They look at each other nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GASTON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Throws another - SMASH! A small METAL CYLINDER clinks as it bounces on the floor. Gaston picks it up and smiles. BANG! A gunshot hits Gaston in the arm - he drops the cylinder. Serafine and Andy stand in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dirty bastard...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
Serafine fires again - BANG! The shot misses as Gaston hits the deck and draws his gun in one very fast motion, taking aim at Andy who's rushing towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<GASTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's far enough!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GASTON>
<DIRECTION>
Andy stops, Gaston's gun aimed at his chest. Serafine steps slowly towards Gaston, her gun aimed at him.

	Another step and he's dead!

<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Serafine stops. The three of them stand there in a close triangle, the metal cylinder on the floor between them. It's a Mexican standoff... in Paris. Then...
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You heard him. Do it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>

Gaston just smiles back at her. Claude steps forwards and cocks his gun against Serafine's head.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said drop the gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Serafine's expression turns confused, horrified. Andy is shocked. She drops the gun. Claude picks it up and pockets it, keeping his gun on Serafine, who stares at him, aghast.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<GASTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GASTON>
<DIRECTION>
Andy and Serafine react with confusion to Gaston's outburst. Claude picks up the metal cylinder and unscrews its cap with his free hand. He slides out a vial filled with amber fluid and holds it to up to the light. He smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, did I hurt the little girl's feelings? Well excusez moi... I confess my desire for ADM is quite "intense". So I deceived you and our poor friend Terry - a competent technician, but let's face it, a bit naive. "The great cure for lycanthropy!" Hmph. He didn't have the vision to grasp the potential of ADAM, until it was too late. And even then, he came rushing down to tell me, as if I would be just as shocked! Ha.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
He pockets the vial, pulls out the white "cyanide" tablet and pops it in his mouth. Andy reacts with shock.

	Oh this? Rolaids. I had a midnight snack that... disagreed with me.

Serafine's been doing a slow burn. She explodes and lunges at Claude, knocking his gun out of his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fucking traitor!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
She picks Claude up and hurls him across the room. CRASH!! Claude smashes into a rack of wine bottles. Serafine jumps after him and dives on top of him pummeling him in a blind rage. Andy looks at her, agog.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a second...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
He and Gaston notice Claude's gun at the same time. They both dive for it. Andy grabs it but Gaston steps on his hand and aims his gun down at him.
</DIRECTION>
<GASTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to be cured?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GASTON>
<DIRECTION>
He cocks the gun. Andy lets go of Claude's gun. Gaston picks it up and aims one gun at Andy and the other at Serafine, who's wrestling with Claude. Claude throws her off and she lands on her butt next to Andy. Andy looks at Serafine.

Claude gets to his feet, drenched with wine and smarting from Serafine's punches. He walks over to Serafine and kicks her in the face.

<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Gaston grabs the vial, uncaps it and drinks it down greedily. He stands there, waiting. Nothing happens...

Serafine hangs her head sullenly, in a quiet rage. She won't meet Andy's gaze. He looks over at Claude and Gaston. Gaston is restless, edgy. He grabs Claude by the collar and shakes him.

SLAM! He's interrupted by the sound of Gaston's head snapping back against the wall. His eyes bulge wide. He grins and starts to laugh. First a little. Then a lot.
</DIRECTION>
<GASTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes! Yes! Ha! Haha hahaha...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GASTON>

He stands up, laughing, power-mad. Suddenly his body is jerked by a spasm and he falls to the floor. He's not laughing anymore. He flails about wildly, croaking out strangled cries, gripped with a terrible seizure.

Gaston flops around on the floor like a fish, grabbed by a flurry of convulsions. He bites off his tongue, spitting blood everywhere. Finally, he goes rigid with one last seizure, then falls totally limp. Andy studies the very dead corpse.

Claude takes a folded PAPER CUP from his jacket pocket. He blows into the cup to bring it back into shape. He then takes a SHARPENED STEEL TUBE from his pocket, plunges it into Gaston's neck, and fills the cup with the blood that pours forth. Andy and Serafine are horrified. Claude puts the cup of blood to his lips and pauses.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>

He swallows the cup of blood down in one gulp, and sits back to wait for the effects, smiling dreamily.

<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is the curse of the werewolf? I'll tell you. The curse is to possess such awesome power and yet be completely unconscious of it. It may as well belong to someone else. But it wasn't always that way. A thousand years ago the Gauls had a drug powerful enough to unlock the door to lycanthropic consciousness, to full control. It came from moonsbreath. A small white flower once found in the hills of this region, until the thick headed crusade by our famous Saint Severin eradicated it for all eternity. But now, thanks to ADAM, the "curse" is over...
	</DIALOGUE>

Claude cocks his werewolf fist and SLAMS it into the back doors, inches from Andy's head. He leaves a deep dent, and opens the doors just a crack. It's a gesture that seems calculated to frighten them. It works.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claude holds up his LEFT ARM and transforms it to match his right. It takes some effort and a little pain, but he keeps a smile on his face throughout the process.

He stops short as Claude turns around, revealing his monstrous arms. Mortified, the cop reaches for the SHOT GUN under the dash. Claude races up towards the view window. As the guard pokes the muzzle through the window, Claude grabs hold of it. BLAM! The guard's shot hits the side wall. Claude rips the gun from the guard angrily, and smashes it to pieces against the wall, grinning like the devil himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile ANDY throws himself at the doors, kicking them, trying in vain to break them open. He spots the SHOTGUN BARREL on the floor and grabs it.

CLAUDE reaches through the window and grabs the guard by the head. He repeatedly smashes the guard's head against the back wall of the cab.

Andy and Serafine take another run - it works. THE DOORS bust open, and Andy and Serafine, still handcuffed, go tumbling out into THE STREET, rolling on the pavement.

SCREECH! HONK! Cars swerve to avoid them, just barely. CRASH! A minivan plows into a parked car. Claude watches from the back of the van. He rears his head to the moon and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CAB of the paddy wagon, the driver hears an unearthly howl. It's hellish. Without looking away from the road, he points his pistol through the hole in the compartment. He adjusts THE MIRROR to see into the rear compartment - The back doors are hanging open. He steals a look over his shoulder - Other than Gaston's corpse, it's empty... He breathes a sigh of relief and turns back to the road as -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HUGE WEREWOLF - Claude fully transformed - bursts through the windshield and rips into him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PADDY WAGON is traveling over the Pont Neuf bridge. A GASOLINE TRUCK approaches from the other direction. The werewolf leaps off of the hood just as the paddy wagon, swerving all over the road, hits the gasoline truck head on.

Andy lies by the roadside, dazed, bruised, handcuffed, but conscious. He sits up unsteadily, and looks for Serafine.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Serafine?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
He sees a small crowd of people a little further up the road, outside a small bistro. He staggers up to them and pushes his way through. Serafine is there on the ground by the curb, eyes closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kneeling beside her, he turns angrily on the onlookers.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out of here! Go on! Move it!

He shoos them away. Of course, they just back up a bit, still gawking at the handcuffed couple.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Serafine... Get up, come on...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Andy brushes away the hair from Serafine's face. He feels her neck for a pulse - she has one. But as he takes his hand away, he notices a smudge of BASE MAKE-UP has rubbed off on his fingers. He looks at the back of Serafine's neck and sees that the makeup had been covering A SCAR. It bears the unmistakable star shape of the wound Andy inflicted on the werewolf that bit him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Horrified, he stands and backs away a few feet. Serafine opens her eyes, sees him.

INT. UNDERGROUND PARTY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy and Serafine emerge from the tunnel, wearing grim, determined expressions. The party is in full swing - throbbing beats and sweaty dancing bodies. They walk straight across the dance floor, pushing their way through the crowd. Amongst the variety of freaky types here, no one raises an eyebrow at two people in handcuffs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Serafine, who's scanning the room, is approached by a leather clad HIPSTER GUY.

He goes to kiss her on both cheeks. Without breaking stride, she puts her handcuffed hands on his face and shoves, sending him reeling.

Serafine points out a gang of four militant skinheads off in a corner. Andy nods and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This could be fun.

They make their way to the skinheads. Andy walks up to the SKINHEAD LEADER, who's got a swastika tattoo, a bad disposition, and a fifty pound advantage on Andy.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got something you want. Follow me.

Andy and Serafine walk into A SMALL CHAMBER off the main space. The skinhead signals his mates to come along, slips on some BRASS KNUCKLES, and follows Andy into

The skinheads surround Andy and Serafine. There's no one else in the room. The skinhead leader looks at Andy's handcuffs and sniggers.

The skinhead turns red with rage and throws a punch at Andy's head. With lightning speed, Andy grabs the skinhead's fist, twists his arm around his back and hurls him across the room. He slams face first into the stone wall and collapses on the floor with a THUD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simultaneously, the other three skinheads attack. Serafine BASHES one across the face with both fists, sending him to the floor. The other gets her in a headlock from behind. She runs backwards and - SLAM! - crushes him against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The third skinhead tries to kick Andy in the groin. Andy grabs his boot and flips him over backwards - he actually does a full back flip and lands on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The leader groggily pulls a pistol and aims it at Andy. Andy snatches it out of his hand.

They walk into the DRIPPING, dank tunnel, away from the party, which fades away in the background. Each carries a pistol and a flashlight. BEADS OF SWEAT appear on their foreheads.

The tunnel tilts downhill. Heavier DRIPPING. They turn a corner and...

SLAM! Something barrels into them - it's a HYSTERICAL GIRL. She's about nineteen and splattered with blood. She SCREAMS uncontrollably. Serafine holds her by the shoulders, trying to calm her.

They run in the direction she pointed. They arrive at the intersection with A STAIRWAY to the right. They start down it. They see something up ahead -

SOMEONE'S HAND is sticking out on the ground from a passage at a landing on the staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<SERAFINE>

They hurry down to the landing, shine their light into the passage. The hand is severed, and A BIG RAT is dragging it along with some difficulty. A dozen or other rats munch on scraps of flesh scattered over a grisly mess of blood and body parts. Andy and Serafine stare at it for a moment. Suddenly Andy looks away.

Andy shines his flashlight around, illuminating two large tunnels which lead into a twisting, intestinal maze, lined from floor to ceiling with HUMAN SKULLS and FEMURS. The bones form the building blocks of the tunnel walls and are arranged in various patterns - from crucifixes to Masonic pyramids and even pentagrams. Ground water seeps from the ceilings and walls, DRIPPING over the eroded, crumbling bones.

Despite the situation, Andy can't help but be dumb struck by the spectacular necropolis.

Andy sees some flickering light reflecting off the wet skulls up ahead. He approaches it. It's coming out of AN ANTECHAMBER. He holds his gun out in front of him and steps quietly. He peers into the antechamber and finds

It's the old hag and the wino he saw in the tunnels at the first party. They've been killed very recently - blood still drips from their gaping wounds.

He kneels over the wino's body. There's a big chunk missing from his neck. Andy stares at the BLOODY FLESH, transfixed. He shudders with a sudden spasm. His breathing gets quicker. More sweat.

THE BEAST

rounds a curve and comes into view about thirty yards away. It's running straight at Andy and closing fast. Andy aims the gun. BANG! A miss - the bullet shatters a skull on the wall. BANG! Another miss. BANG! The bullet hits the beast in the shoulder. It stumbles but keeps coming. BANG! A miss. Andy aims carefully.

BANG! A direct hit in the chest. The beast falls. Snarling in pain.

Andy aims his gun and his flashlight as he nears the corner of the recess. The wailing and thrashing settles down. Andy proceeds cautiously. He rounds the corner, and shines the light on

<SERAFINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't let me die for nothing...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERAFINE>
<DIRECTION>
Andy winces with pain - his brow bulges, his teeth enlarge, the transformation is starting. Uncle Terrence is worried.
</DIRECTION>
<TERRENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Andy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TERRENCE>
<DIRECTION>
CLAUDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
still walking. The light is getting brighter - he's almost around the bend. He's buzzing with a scary kind of euphoria.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The choice is yours Andy: deny your own blood, die an unfulfilled child, or face the challenge of mind and body united at last. Which will it be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
He rounds the corner and sees Andy hunched over Serafine's body. He keeps walking.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be confused by old beliefs. This is beyond mere words like good or evil. You have to feel it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
ANDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
whips around, BLOOD streaming from his mouth, gun aimed, grip rock solid, his features back to normal, eyes locked on the beast with determined, controlled rage.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Feel this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM! BLAM! He pumps out two shots. One hits Claude in the upper left part of his CHEST. The other hits his CHEEK, exits at the back of his jaw and shatters the cheekbone of A SKULL on the wall behind him. He screams in pain and dives for cover into a SMALL INTERSECTING TUNNEL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy gets up, pausing for a second to look back at Serafine's face. It looks peaceful. The undead are gone. He starts after Claude.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLAUDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sits leaning against a wall of skulls. The face wound is bleeding but not mortal.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stupid boy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
With an awesome rage he grimaces and starts to TRANSFORM HIS LEFT SIDE - his muscles swell around the chest wound and THE BULLET actually squeezes out of the hole and falls to the ground. The wound closes up as the flesh keeps morphing and growing hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
creeps around the corner, gun and flashlight aimed, towards the small tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When the flashlight beam falls on Claude, he's in mid pounce - rocketing at Andy with bad intent. BANG! Andy gets off a shot - it hits Claude in his THIGH as he tackles Andy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They wrestle, Claude in mid-transformation, his left side further along, hairier, his facial bones shifting. His thigh swells and ripples and THE BULLET SQUIRTS OUT of its wound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His left arm, mostly transformed, grips Andy's gun hand. BANG! Andy squeezes off a shot, blowing off the tip of Claude's transforming THUMB.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRUNCH! Claude clamps his vice like grip and crushes the gun. Andy wrenches his hand away as Claude hurls him off like a rag doll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy flies through the air and SMASHES into the tunnel wall. The wall of ancient SKULLS and BONES shatters and collapses around Andy - burying him in ossified fragments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy lifts himself out of the pile and looks at Claude, who lies on the floor finishing his transformation. His right side is catching up with his left and his head is now more beast than human. All the while he glares at Andy and doesn't appear vulner able.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy takes advantage of the moment to get the hell away - he runs into the tunnel, leaving Claude behind to finish transforming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy makes a few quick turns through the maze - it seems he has evaded Claude for the moment. He pulls the GRENADE from his pocket, turns off his flashlight and pads along softly, listening for the beast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a sharp sound from behind him makes Andy jump.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(French - screaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	STOP WHERE YOU ARE! HANDS UP!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Andy turns around. A scared COP is aiming his gun at him, shining a flashlight in his face. Andy puts his hands up.
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
<DIRECTION>
(English)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's you. You should be dead in that wreck with Bazin and Racine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up! Save your stories. The only thing I want to hear is you begging for your life. I want to see you suffer, like they did.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he sees Andy's look of terror)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Haha! You're scared now, eh? Come on. Where's the scary monster now huh? Ha ha... We'll see who -
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<DIRECTION>
A ROAR cuts him off. The cop spins around - the beam from his flashlight flooding THE BEAST with light as it springs through the air at him. Andy runs.
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
<DIRECTION>
(French)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<DIRECTION>
He gets off one shot - it hits the beast in the arm, but it's too late. The beast clamps it's massive jaw onto the cop's neck and bites his head clean off. THE HEAD rolls across the floor and comes to rest in a pile of skulls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERAFINE'S BODY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the tunnel. Two queasy cops stand over it. LeDuc approaches them.
</DIRECTION>
<LEDUC>
<DIRECTION>
(French)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have you got?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEDUC>
<COP>
<DIRECTION>
(French - disturbed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the girl. Someone cut out her heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<LEDUC>
<DIRECTION>
(Matter of factly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEDUC>
<DIRECTION>
The cops look at him like he's nuts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is crouched at a corner of two catacomb tunnels, grenade clutched in his hand. He hears something and carefully peers around the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANDY'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the end of the long tunnel of bones, the beast lurks at another intersection, sniffing the air and growling, some forty yards away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy ducks back around the corner. He holds up the grenade, pulls the pin, and whispers a quick prayer...
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just throw a strike...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
With a determined grunt, he pitches the grenade around the corner and then ducks back. Suddenly the beast's growling stops. Andy grits his teeth and closes his eyes, awaiting the explosion. Just silence. Then a small skittering sound close by. He opens his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GRENADE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
skitters to a stop, a couple of feet from him.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
He bolts and gets five steps from it when
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KA-BOOM!! It explodes behind him, launching him through the air along with a spray of bones and rubble. He lands twenty feet away and clutches his left leg, wincing in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahh! Son of a bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
LEDUC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and the cops turn towards the sound of the blast.
</DIRECTION>
<LEDUC>
<DIRECTION>
(French)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEDUC>
<DIRECTION>
ANDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
struggles to his feet. He clicks on his flashlight and sees the blast has caved in the tunnel- a wall of rubble seals Andy off from the beast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy breaths a sigh of relief. At least he's got time. He starts limping away from the wall of rubble...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH!! The rubble explodes again as the beast crashes through it like a freight train, sending rocks and bones flying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy runs as fast as he can with his bad leg. The beast closes in on him quickly. Andy jumps up for a NARROW OPENING in the tunnel ceiling. He grabs the metal rung inside and pulls himself up into the vertical shaft as the beast pounces. The beast catches Andy's foot with its claw. Andy pulls out of his sneaker and just barely eludes the beast's grasp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy climbs up the metal rungs in this old service shaft - barely wide enough for his body. The beast claws and gnashes his teeth at the opening but can't fit in - for now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy reaches an iron grate, pushes it up and crawls out into
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER DRIPPY TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like the ones near the party - no skulls. There's a lot of water in this one. It looks familiar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLAUDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is transforming back into human shape. His face is now more human than beast. He screams into the vertical passage in a growling, not quite human voice.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have no advantage, Andy! My body has no limits!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
ANDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looks around in the tunnel. He sees something (we don't). He limps off towards it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLAUDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in his human shape, crawls into the vertical service passage and climbs up the rungs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claude emerges from the shaft into the dark tunnel. Andy's no where in sight. We hear only dripping water.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So this is how you choose to die. Hiding like a scared rabbit. Just praying I don't find you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
ANDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
crouches under a concrete ledge in a very dark space. Claude's voice sounds distant, echoey, and competes with the closer sound of trickling water.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I assure you, your nervous sweat glands will give you away soon enough my trembling little rabbit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
CLAUDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
begins transforming. He falls to the ground and groans with joyous pain as his body noisily transforms.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	AHHHH! IT'S FUCKING GLORIOUS! AAAARRGGGHHH!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
ANDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
huddles in his hiding place, looking out into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon already...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
A glint of light appears in a puddle on the ground. Andy's eyes widen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLAUDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His head is transforming - his exaltations become more animalistic.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE_BEAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	RRAAAAAARRRRRRGGG!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE_BEAST>
<DIRECTION>
LEDUC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
still in the catacombs, hears Claude's yell echo through the tunnels. He thinks it came from above. He runs towards a stairway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claude is fully transformed. He sniffs the air, locks in on a scent and sets off through the tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watches intently as the light in the puddle gets brighter. It starts reflecting on the wet concrete walls of this tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
Andy clicks on the flashlight, shines it at himself, and yells for all he's worth.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HEY YOU DIRTY EVIL FUCK! C'MON AND GET ME! I DARE YOUR UGLY ASS!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(etc.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
cocks its head towards Andy's taunts. The sound of flowing water is close by. The beast pounces towards Andy's voice, into
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WET, SLIPPERY STAIRWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
that Andy slid down that first night in the tunnels. The beast loses it's footing and slips helplessly down the slick, eroded stone, GROWLING furiously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LEDUC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
runs down a tunnel, towards Andy's screaming voice. The beam of his flashlight illuminates the landing ahead of him, halfway down the stairwell. He sees THE BEAST slide by, clawing in vain for a grip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A METRO TRAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
screams around the bend, lighting up the whole metro tunnel. Andy is still SCREAMING from his refuge under a ledge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shoots out of the stairwell and lands on the tracks. It looks up, frozen for a split second - it's horrible snarling face is caught in the speeding train's harsh glare...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH!! Impact. The beast is sucked under the wheels and ground to bits between track and wheels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LEDUC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
at the landing, looks down the stairwell as the train rushes past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANDY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
huddled next to the passing train, clenches his fist in victory.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
The train passes. Andy gets up and shines his flashlight around the ground. The beasts body lies in chunks, smears, and puddles. The parts begin morphing back into Claude's human forms - A THIGH here, A PIECE OF SPINE there...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LEDUC inches his way down the last few feet of the stairway, using the rusty pipe for a handhold. He walks up with his flashlight and aims it at the BEAST'S HEAD, which finishes turning back into Claude's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LeDuc glances at Andy. He takes a small envelope from his pocket and shakes out a single SILVER BULLET. He loads it into his gun and FIRES straight into Claude's lifeless head.
</DIRECTION>
<LEDUC>
<DIRECTION>
(to Andy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I always wanted to do that. I saw it in a movie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEDUC>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<LEDUC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My men think you died and floated away in the Seine. If I wanted to, I could let them believe that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a long pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that would be illegal...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEDUC>
<DIRECTION>
Andy looks at him carefully, trying to read him. LeDuc's face is impassive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COURTROOM, NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The prosecutor, who speaks English with a thick French accent, has an extremely sarcastic look on his face. He wheels around dramatically, and confronts Andy, who sits uneasily on the stand, wiping the sweat from his brow.
</DIRECTION>
<PROSECUTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You intend us to believe that you committed these murders because the moon was full and you were somehow magically transformed into a huge powerful beast with an insatiable appetite for human flesh, is that right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSECUTOR>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't understand!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
The prosecutor turns away towards the jury to mock Andy.
</DIRECTION>
<PROSECUTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh? So I don't understand? You think it's me who has a hard time coming to grips with reality?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSECUTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The JURORS snigger at Andy's expense. But wait, suddenly they look concerned - something's wrong. The prosecutor continues, his back to Andy.
</DIRECTION>
<PROSECUTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think I'm the one who needs my head examined? I don't understand? Well, Mr. McDermott, enlighten me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSECUTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He wheels around to Andy and comes face to face with
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
huge and ravenous. It goes for his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<PROSECUTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good God!!! Aaaaaaaa!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROSECUTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The beast tears the prosecutor apart, spraying blood everywhere. The jury - oddly enough - break into polite applause. One less lawyer...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andy wakes up with a start - a concerned STEWARDESS is leaning over him. Disturbed PASSENGERS crane their necks, peering at him like he's nuts.
</DIRECTION>
<STEWARDESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were screaming in your sleep, sir. Are you okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEWARDESS>
<DIRECTION>
Andy looks around, getting his bearings. He takes a deep breath and shakes it off.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. It was just, um... something I ate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
The stewardess nods and smiles, a little uneasily. He picks up the Bloody Mary from his table and gulps some down. A little bit of tomato juice dribbles down his chin. He looks out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AIRPLANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It flies along over a blanket of clouds, past the huge, silver moon. The song is Cat Stevens' "Moonshadow", sardonically covered by Nirvana, with the oh so appropriate lyrics: "If I ever lose my legs..."
