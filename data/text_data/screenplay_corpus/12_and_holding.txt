TWIN BOYS, RUDY AND JACOB CARGES (12), ride their bikes through a suburban neighborhood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rudy, the more athletic of the two, rides at a breakneck pace. Jacob rides slowly due to a HOCKEY MASK that he wears over his face. It's making it difficult for him to see. The boys turn down a DIRT PATH and ride deep into some WOODS.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO BOYS, JEFF AND KENNY (14), trailer park, punks come running out of the woods, rocks in hand.
</DIRECTION>

Rudy and Jacob climb the tree, using makeshift RUNGS that are nailed into the trunk. In the floor of the tree house is a DOOR. Rudy removes a KEY from a chain around his neck and unlocks it. He climbs inside and pulls Jacob in after him.

<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God! Is it serious?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Anosmia is when a person looses their sense of smell. It's not uncommon in patients who suffer serious head injuries. Unfortunately, it's also affecting his ability to taste. Again, not uncommon.

	What she means is, he won't eat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATRICK>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leonard's association with food is no longer about taste. It's about texture. While we may be partial to sweet or salty foods, Leonard will become partial to crunchy or smooth ones. Once he settles on a texture he likes, his appetite will increase.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe this is happening.
	</DIALOGUE>
