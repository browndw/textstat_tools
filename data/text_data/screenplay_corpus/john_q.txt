EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mancini's "Ave Maria" fills the screen as a white BMW speeds along the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CREDITS ROLL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN is behind the wheel. We never see her face. Hanging from the mirror is a rosary with a crucifix. Her porcelain hand turns up the volume and the music swells. A silver bracelet dangles from her wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A slow-moving semi obstructs her path. The woman leans out the window to see if the road is clear before moving into the oncoming lane. She steps on the gas. She's in the wrong lane and can't get over. There are headlights in the distance and the moan of an airhorn is heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the headlights are upon her. And airhorn blasts and she's trapped between two monstrous big rigs. She cuts the wheel hard, but too late. The oncoming truck clips her, sending her car end over end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLO-MO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The accident is violent and horrible. The BMW cartwheels along the highway in a grotesque ballet of destruction. The music crescendos and sparks fly as the car skids along the pavement on its roof. And as the BMW violently smashes headfirst into the embankment, the beautiful woman is slammed into the windshield like a crash-test dummy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MIDDLE AMERICAN TOWN - PRE-DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The indigo horizon shimmers with the first light of morning. Vapor spewing smokestacks dwarf brick and mortar homes. Dairy Queens, Hardee's, and Walmarts line the main drag. Stars and Stripes flutter from lampposts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ARCHIBALD HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man sits propped up against pillows, his sleeping wife snuggled next to him. His name is JOHN QUINCY ARCHIBALD. His strong, handsome face is beginning to show wear and tear. From across the room, last night's news broadcast drones on the TV. The President is telling everybody how wonderful the country is doing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHN Q. watches impassively, the irony not lost on him. Suddenly, he hears a noise. Something's not right. He jumps out of bed, wearing only a pair of BVDs.

<DIRECTION>
The truckers quickly circle to the front and hop in. John Q. just watches as the truck speeds away, dragging the car along the cement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The neighbors now stand on their porches, staring. J.Q. turns to see his wife, DENISE, standing in the doorway. She's not a happy camper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their nine year old son, MIKE, appears at his mother's side, wiping the sleep from his eyes.

<DR_TURNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The first step is to get Mike's name on an organ recipient list. Once he does, his chances are very good. Your son's an extremely rare type so there's less demand. With B-positive blood, Mike could go to the top of the list right away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_TURNER>
<PAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not that simple. There are other considerations before a prospective recipient is placed on the donor list, Mr. Archibald. The cost of transplant surgery is expensive. In most cases, prohibitively so.

	We have treated him. We continue to treat him. Now I understand how upset you are, sir. But with other options available, we are not obligated to cover a procedure this costly.

I break my ass every day trying to make a difference, trying to plug the dam. I'm in it up to my elbows. I've seen people live who shouldn't, and the other way around. And when I say I do my best, I mean it. So don't tell me about doctors, because they're the last stop between you and six feet under.

Steve leaps from his seat and goes after Mitch, bristling with the racial slur. J.Q. moves in fast, trying to separate them. But instead of going for Steve, Mitch goes for broke and rushes J.Q. The Ethylchloride is out and Mitch sprays it into J.Q.'s eyes, temporarily blinding him.

John tries to get his bearings but Mitch is already swinging the scalpel. As J.Q. blocks the knife, his arm is sliced and starts to gush. Mitch goes for the kill, but J.Q. grabs his arm and they wrestle to the ground, the scalpel and John's gun clattering to the floor. The element of surprise gone, Mitch is now getting the worst of it. J.Q. is getting in some heavy blows and no one is stepping in to stop it. Mitch sees the gun across the floor next to Julie.

	Sure, to a point. Except when it's their life on the line, the Dutch, the English and everyone else go to their private doctors or come to America because we have the best technology. That is if they can afford it.

INT. COURTROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERIMPOSE: THREE MONTHS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gavel pounding down. The black-robed JUDGE silences the crowd. The courtroom is standing room only. Packed with cops, TV cameras, reporters, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Denise next to a grim-faced Jimmy and Gina Palumbo. As the jury flies into the jury box, the people take their seats. The bailiff hands the verdict card to the judge who reads it before addressing the FOREMAN.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Has the jury reached a verdict?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>

AT THE DEFENDANT'S TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
J.Q. Archibald gets up and faces the judge. His attorney, a P.D., by his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing next to Denise, we REVEAL MIKE - he looks healthy and rosy-cheeked. He grabs his mother's hand with anticipation.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDGE>

The courtroom explodes in cheers. In the crowd, we see familiar faces: Debby, Dr. Turner, and Dr. Klein. Behind them, Maguire.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDGE>
<DIRECTION>
J.Q. stares straight ahead and takes a breath. After a moment, the public defender leads him over to the rail, where he is greeted by Jimmy, Gina, Denise and Mike.
</DIRECTION>
<PUBLIC_DEFENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's going to do some time. But there's not a judge in the country that will give him more than a year. And with time served, John will be home very soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUBLIC_DEFENDER>
<DIRECTION>
J.Q. leans over to talk to his son.
</DIRECTION>
<J_Q>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You alright?

</J_Q>

Mike nods and stands there trying to hold back the tears.

<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. If anybody messes with us, I'll take care of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
J.Q. embraces his boy and moves over to Denise.
</DIRECTION>
<DENISE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A year, huh? I could have lost you forever. I guess I can live with that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENISE>
<DIRECTION>
A hand taps him on the shoulder. J.Q. looks up. Sees Grimes.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time to go, John.

</GRIMES>
<DENISE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</J_Q>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COURTROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An enormous crowd lines both sides of the granite steps. They cheer their support as J.Q. emerges. Grimes steers J.Q. out through the confusion as reporters stick their mics in J.Q.'s face. They ask ridiculous questions about justice, health care, and politics. J.Q., uncomfortable with all the attention, has no comment. He pushes past politely, head down, his attention joslted when he hears a familiar voice.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_IN_CROWD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, John. Good luck, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_IN_CROWD>
<DIRECTION>
J.Q. recognizes the voice, turns and sees LESTER. Both smile to each other as J.Q. is pushed further through when --

<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John Q.? Do you feel like your country has let you down?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<J_Q>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It's a wonderful country.

</J_Q>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you. Could you repeat that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
Grimes steps forward and speaks directly into the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<GRIMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said, "America is the greatest goddamn country in the world." Now excuse us, I have to take this man to jail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIMES>
<DIRECTION>
They push past the barricades and into the street.
</DIRECTION>
<MEDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John Q.! John Q.!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEDIA>
<GRIMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at all this. You're a celebrity, John.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIMES>
<J_Q>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? Check with me in a couple of days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_Q>
<DIRECTION>
They move to the street and Grimes opens the car door. J.Q. climbs inside. He looks up to see the CROWD, in all its glory, cameras flashing, microphones pointed at J.Q.
</DIRECTION>
<J_Q>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is ridiculous. I don't even know these people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_Q>
<GRIMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can I tell you? You're their hero.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIMES>
<J_Q>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not hero, Frank. I'm just a regular guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</J_Q>
<GRIMES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRIMES>
<DIRECTION>
Grimes slams the door. The "cherry" light spins, the siren wops and the cop car rolls through the crowd of people.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the street, J.Q. sees Mike wave to him from the sidewalk, trying to get John's attention. Mike is saying something. J.Q. turns to look closer and finally he gets it: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike's lips say "Thank you."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John winks at his boy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS Mike makes a muscle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John smiles, and the car picks up speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cop car pulls away. Away from the courtroom. The circus. Finally disappearing from view and we --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
