INT. BLUE DOOR FIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERIMPOSE OVER ACTION... "NOVEMBER 12, 1975 - PHILADELPHIA"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... The club itself resembles a large unemptied trash-can. The boxing ring is extra small to insure constant battle. The lights overhead have barely enough wattage to see who is fighting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the ring are two heavyweights, one white the other black. The white fighter is ROCKY BALBOA. He is thirty years old. His face is scarred and thick around the nose... His black hair shines and hangs in his eyes. Rocky fights in a plodding, machine-like style. The BLACK FIGHTER dances and bangs combinations into Rocky's face with great accuracy. But the punches do not even cause Rocky to blink... He grins at his opponent and keeps grinding ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The people at ringside sit on folding chairs and clamor for blood... They lean out of their seats and heckle the fighters. In the thick smoke they resemble spectres. Everyone is hustling bets... The action is even heavier in the balcony. A housewife yells for somebody to cover a two dollar bet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BELL RINGS and the fighters return to their corner... Somebody heaves a beer can into the ring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Black Fighter spits something red in a bucket and sneers across the ring at Rocky.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACK_FIGHTER>
<DIRECTION>
(to cornerman)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I'm gonna bust his head wide open!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACK_FIGHTER>
<DIRECTION>
In Rocky's corner he is being assisted by a shriveled, balding CORNERMAN, who is an employee of the club... He works on Rocky without any enthusiasm.
</DIRECTION>
<CORNERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(lackluster)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Ya waltzin' -- Give the suckers some action.
	</DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKY>
<DIRECTION>
A FIGHT FAN rushes up to Rocky... He is sixty-five, with yellow teeth and wearing sunglasses.
</DIRECTION>
<FAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should I bet the fight don't go the distance -- Ya feel strong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAN>
<ROCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>

<CORNERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CORNERMAN>
<ROCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I just want the mouthpiece.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKY>
<DIRECTION>
The BELL RINGS... Rocky makes the sign of the cross. The fighters engage in battle. The other fighter grabs Rocky in a clinch and purposely butts him... The butt opens a bleeding cut on the corner of Rocky's eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky becomes furious over the foul and drives a flurry into the man's body... Rocky slams the man on the jaw and the fighter is out for the night. The fans throw rubbish into the ring. Rocky ignores it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fans loudly go about collecting bets. The referee does not bother to even count the fighter out and drags him under the ropes where he is placed on a stretcher. Two new fighters enter the ring. Rocky slips on a tattered robe. Embroidered clumsily on the back is, "The Italian Stallion."
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Winner, Rocky Balboa -- Next a six rounder between local lightweights.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
Without pomp Rocky climbs out of the ring and bums a cigarette from a spectator... The fighter on the stretcher passes behind him. He watches for a moment and continues up the aisle... Before he even reaches the rear of the club the BELL RINGS and the next fight has already begun... Rocky fades into the darkness of the rear of the club.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TITLE CREDITS END:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky has nearly completed dressing and reaches into his locker for his hat... Also in the dingy room are ten other fighters... Two taped fighters talk shop in the corner.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</FIGHTER_1>
<DIRECTION>
Another paces nervously... Two other fighters shadowbox and spit nervously on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A young pug combs his hair and listens to a portable RADIO that is BLASTING MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fighter that Rocky has just defeated is drinking a beer and joking with three other fighters... Some of the fighters are smoking. The room is cloudy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A short man of fifty enters. He is dressed in a sweater buttoned over a t-shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<PROMOTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Balboa!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROMOTER>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky raises his head. The promoter steps over.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	... Twenty bucks for the locker an' cornerman -- Two bucks for the towel an' shower, seven for tax -- The house owes ya, sixty-one dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROMOTER>
<DIRECTION>
The man peels off the money and departs... Rocky closes his locker, nods to the defeated fighter, and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TROLLEY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky is on the trolley heading to South Philly... The trolley is empty except for a thin old black WOMAN... The black Woman studies Rocky's bruised face... Rocky becomes self-conscious.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKY>
<DIRECTION>
(almost apologetic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a fighter.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky exits the trolley and walks down the block... He waves at a pair of high-heeled hookers and they wave back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky passes a sleeping wino curled in front of a dirty bookstore. Rocky drags the man into a protective passageway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Further down the street, Rocky pauses in front of the "ANIMAL TOWN PET SHOP"... He peers into the dark store and sees a sad, huge dog sitting in the window. He mumbles to the dog and continues to the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A short while later, Rocky approaches his apartment located in the most deprived section of South Philly. He kicks away the litter that has gathered against the apartment steps and enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROCKY'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The narrow hallway is painted olive brown. A single light bulb illuminates the gloomy corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky enters. The one-room apartment is drab, with a curling boxing poster of Rocky Marciano tacked on the wall... Nailed against the far wall is a mattress. The mattress is used as a punching bag. Stuffing spills out of the center.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky drops his coat on the floor. He puts on a pair of glasses. He crosses to a small turtle bowl... He lifts the creatures.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Look who's home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKY>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky starts to boil a pan of water on his hot plate, then places an old 45 RPM record on a battered phonograph. The record is a tune, "ALL IN THE GAME."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... As the CRACKLING MUSIC BEGINS, Rocky picks up his hairbrush. Using it like a microphone, he mimes to the record. He assumes the posture of a famous singer crooning to thousands of adoring fans... He then switches into a bullish fighting stance and throws several punches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water boils. Rocky soaks his badly-swollen hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUNRISE OF PHILADELPHIA SKYLINE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE the jagged skyline, highlighted by the towering figure of William Penn that rises above the dawn haze as it sits majestically above City Hall...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOCKS - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky is walking along the waterfront... He has a bandaid over one eye. He looks at the rugged stevedores going about their business... He stuffs his hands in his cheap wool jacket and approaches a ship being unloaded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky passes two thick Mafia types leaning against a parked car. These men look like blood drinkers.
</DIRECTION>
<MAFIA_1>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MAFIA_1>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky shrugs and moves away... He nears a heavy man working the crane. The heavy man looks frightened... He stops the crane and hurries into the ship's hole. Rocky dashes up the gangplank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHIP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man enters the ship's hole and runs past tons of stacked crates and coffee beans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky sprints after him... He lunges and flings the man by the neck against the wall of stacked cargo.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>

At wits' end the man picks up a large metal hook used by stevedores. Rocky remains cool.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goin' fishin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKY>
<DIRECTION>
The man drops the hook.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKY>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky's determined expression strikes home. The fat man quickly fumbles through his pockets and hands over a small wad of bills.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; counting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A hundred an' thirty.

</ROCKY>
<FATS>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</FATS>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky looks almost sympathetically into the fat man's flushed expression.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... The juice is climbin' every week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKY>
<FATS>

	Waits! -- Be smart. Ya don't have to break nothin' -- Here, take my coat, it's worth fifty-sixty dollars. It's yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATS>
<DIRECTION>
The man quickly removes his coat and extends it...
</DIRECTION>
<FATS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, ya a smart guy, Gazzo's don't have to know nuthin'. I'll go tape up the hand like ya broke my thumb. Gazzo won't be wise to nothin' -- Be a smart guy, keep the coat, we'll fake like ya broke the hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATS>
<DIRECTION>
The man extends his coat again... Rocky suddenly grabs the man's thumb and bends him to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<FATS>
<DIRECTION>
(almost a whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No - no - no - Please - Please - Please don't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATS>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky releases the man who remains almost in shock. The thumb is fine.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...That's what coulda happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(walks off.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Later that morning Rocky passes "Animal Town Pet Shop" in South Philly... The shop is not very prosperous looking. In the window hangs a sign reading "Today's special -- Mixed Kittens -- $1.50"... Rocky stops at this shop every morning. He stares at a litter of Lhasa Apsa puppies. He taps the window and whistles. He SEES a girl behind the counter and presses his face against the window and does his impression of the Hunchback of Notre Dame. The girl nervously looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girl behind the counter is ADRIAN KLEIN. She is not very attractive, but pleasant-looking. Thirty years old. Brown hair pulled back. Light skinned. She wears glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky really stops by to flirt with Adrian, but she is so painfully shy nothing ever gets started... Rocky enters.

</DIRECTION>
<CUSTOMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get away from me - Give me that!

Mickey's Gym is surrounded by bars and a couple of greasy spoons. Out front a crowd of young Blacks talk and jive among themselves. Two winos lean against the entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky enters the gym... The place is nearly full. The MEASURED BEAT of SKIP ROPES and THROBBING SPEED BAGS makes the room come alive, like it was a mindless piece of machinery. Over the loudspeaker MUSIC by the Isley Brothers BLARES out... The music adds a background to the CLANG of the AUTOMATIC TIMERS, SNORTING SPARRING PARTNERS and the THUDDING of HEAVY BAGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is divided -- Fifty percent Black -- thirty-five percent Latin -- ten percent white -- five percent other.

<DIRECTION>
The dressing room is lined with dented lockers. Wooden benches stretch across the room. On the wall is a sign that reads, "NO KISSING."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky goes to his locker. He tries to open it but fails. He leans his ear against the lock and rolls the tumblers. Still it does not open. He shakes the lock forcefully, no luck... Rocky is flustered and sits on a bench to ponder the situation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment of deep thought, Rocky stands, seizes the bench and smashes open the lock. Opening the door Rocky is taken aback when he sees a set of very flashy clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKY>

Dejected, Rocky travels to the locker room. He passes Big Dipper sparring in a ring... Dipper spits a mouthful of water in a bucket and looks smugly at Rocky.

PAULIE is presently trying to comb his hair in the only remaining piece of mirror in the room... Paulie is in his early thirties. He is medium height. Brown hair. Square shouldered. He has a foul personality... A classic misanthrope.

Rocky shakes his head no and raises his eyes towards a suspended television... the nightly sports broadcast is on.

He is a tall, smooth-muscled Black with barely a scar on his light coffee- colored face...

He is followed by an entourage of mixed trainers and cornermen. Also tagging alone is a small group of hangers-on.

The sports show cuts away, but Rocky continues to look at the television with a pensive stare... Andy has been speaking the following dialogue over Apollo's broadcast.
</DIRECTION>
<ANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody cares what's happenin' in the world of sports nomore -- Downhill. Baseball, downhill -- Basketball, downhill. Football's goin', too. Bank on it. Baseball use to be America's best sport... Sure -- Nuttin' like squattin' through a great double header, but now baseball's all business.

<MARIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

Rocky and Marie exit the dark school yard... Standing in the shadows of the building are three young muggers. The light from their cigarettes flares red in their faces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The muggers pace Rocky across the street and follow them down the block... Rocky sees them and stops and faces the three. The muggers pause and study Rocky from a distance of twenty yards. Rocky gives a loud boxer's snort, wipes his nose with the side of his thumb and rolls his shoulders... The muggers are intimidated and slowly peel off the meander away.

<COMMENTATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A Bicentennial Fight -- January first. It will be the first sporting event on our two hundredth birthday and is already being called by many the greatest farce in sports history. If this man lasts more than a minute I would say he's on borrowed time.

INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky returns home and enters his apartment. After turning on the light, he flips on his RECORD PLAYER. He now feeds the turtles.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look who's home!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKY>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky notices two telegrams laying inside the threshold. He approaches them with a sense of awe. He opens and reads one. Settling on the bed, he reads the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A KNOCK is HEARD. Rocky opens the door. Mickey Goldmill, the gym owner, stands framed in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>

By the manner in which Goldmill listens, it is obvious something important is preying on his mind.
</DIRECTION>

Rocky is slightly uncomfortable, almost embarrassed at having outsiders see how he lives.

</ROCKY>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Freak luck is a strange thing.

Mickey looks hard into Rocky's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ya need a manager. An advisor. I been in the racket fifty years. I done it all, there ain't nothin' about the world of pugilism that ain't livin' up here.

He lights a half-smoked cigar.

</ROCKY>
<MICKEY>

</ROCKY>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(driving each word hard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.

Mickey deafly continues, becoming more engrossed every second.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at this face -- twenty- one stitches over the left eye, thirty-four over the right -- my nose was busted seventeen times, the last being the Sailor Mike fight New Year's Eve, 1940, in Camden, New Jersey -- What a professional pastin' I give him. Here, read about it.

Rocky points to his most prized possession.

<ROCKY>

	Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture.

</ROCKY>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey has rung the bell. Nothing could please Rocky more than being compared to his idol.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really think so?

<MICKEY>

Rocky shifts against the wall and lowers himself into a crouch.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ, I know this business. Rocky, when I was fightin' it was the dirtiest racket goin', see. Pugs like me was treated like fightin' dogs -- throw ya in the pit an' for ten bucks ya try to kill each other. We had no management... fought in boxcars, in whorehouse basements, any joint with a floor -- October 1931 I fought a bum who put a tack in the thumb of his glove an' punched so many holes in my face I had spit shootin' outta my cheeks -- I never had no manager watchin' out for me -- See that picture outside the gym -- 'Mighty Mick,' that's me in my prime. I had all the tools. I coulda starched any lightweight husky on the East Coast -- But I had no management. Nobody ever got to know how slick I was, but I had a head for business an' stashed a few bucks an' opened the gym -- It's a dirt hole, I know it, but that an' a lotta scars is what I got to show for fifty years in the business, kid -- now you come along with this shot an' I feel like it's me gettin' the shot I never got... Yeah, we was treated like dogs -- like them Dago's, no offense, in the Colosseum in Rome there -- An' now I got all this knowledge, I wanna give it to ya so I can protect ya an' make sure ya get the best deal ya can!

	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKY>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey drops the ashtray and kneels to pick it up... He remains on one knee.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask? Just ask.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<ROCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Rocky, I'm seventy-six years old. Maybe you can be the winner I never was -- your shot is my last shot!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky is choked and goes into the bathroom and closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey struggles to his feet and, like a beaten man, leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several moments later Rocky steps out and lowers himself into bed. Springing up a second later, he runs outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET OF ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky races up the block toward the shadowy and hunched form of Mickey. Way in the distance, we SEE Rocky stop the old man beneath a street lamp. He places an arm around his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The following morning, Rocky's ALARM CLOCK GOES OFF at exactly four A.M. Not accustomed to rising this early, with great difficulty Rocky staggers to his feet and wavers to the bathroom. He turns the light on and roaches scatter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the top of the mirror hang the telegrams. Rocky fills the basin and submerges his face in cold water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky sways to the icebox and removes a dozen eggs. He cracks five raw eggs into a glass and downs it in one swill... his body quivers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET OF ROCKY'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky steps outside. He is dressed in a well-worn sweat suit with a hood, gloves and sneakers. It is pitch dark and his steaming breath attests to the cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He begins running down the center of the deserted street. He can only be clearly SEEN as his form passes beneath the street lamps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two garbage men stop hoisting cans to watch him pass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ART MUSEUM STAIRS - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky stands at the base of an overwhelmingly steep flight of stairs. He stares up at the stairs that nearly disappear into the morning gray. Taking a deep breath, he starts up. From the start, he looks out of shape and halfway up his legs give way. Standing, he brushes off and descends the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY HALL - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky passes City Hall and veers to the river. He pauses, heaving great gusts of exhausted breaths. He throws several lazy jabs in the air and walks awhile with hands on his aching sides. Men delivering the morning papers observe with amusement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky forces himself to begin running again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ELEVATED TRAIN STATION - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heading along Spring Garden Street, Rocky passes beneath an elevated train station. The ROARING TRAIN overhead seems to blend perfectly with his muscular running style.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOCKS - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sky is beginning to lighten. The fighter now runs along the piers and past anchored freighters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EASTERN PACKING COMPANY - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is five-thirty and Rocky approaches the loading platform belonging to Eastern Packing Company. Alongside the loading platform come several boxcars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky mounts the ramp and knocks on the metal door. It soon opens and Paulie guides him inside. Paulie is drunk.

</PAULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky smiles and Paulie leads him out of the office and to the large metal door of a walk-in refrigerator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FREEZER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They enter. The freezer resembles a modern torture chamber... row after row of hanging slabs of beef stretch into the darkness to the far end of the refrigerator. The blower overhead causes the men to speak loudly.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULIE>
<DIRECTION>
(teasing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?

Paulie opens a jackknife and idly jabs the hanging meat. He swills whiskey from a pint bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Y'know, d'ya think you an' my sister -- Ah, doin' good together?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULIE>

</ROCKY>
<PAULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</PAULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Paulie speaks like a man who has been mulling this over for quite a while.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULIE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)

	<DIALOGUE>

</PAULIE>
<ROCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ROCKY>
<PAULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</PAULIE>
<ROCKY>

<PAULIE>
<DIRECTION>
(tersely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, ya screwin' her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULIE>
<DIRECTION>
From across the room Rocky looks him hard in the eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why I can't put ya together with Gazzo, cause ya talk too much -- big mouth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKY>
<DIRECTION>
Paulie reddens. He steps forward and slams his fists in a hanging beef.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The punching of the beef is a muted challenge and Rocky responds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky walks up to a beef and slams his fist into the ribs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The grotesque object swings in a wide arc like a hanging corpse. Rocky moves to the next one and hooks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky's face reveals a never before seen concentration, as though he were locked in total battle.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hit the rump. The rump! Ya'll break the ribs!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky speeds up and continues pounding on the second row of beef. Paulie's eyes widen and his face grimaces with every punch, like he were receiving it. Rocky moves into the dark recess of the refrigerator. Only the dull SOUNDS of his POUNDING FISTS can be HEARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky works his way to Paulie again. Every hanging beef swings and appears surrealistically alive.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULIE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We do that to Creed an' they'll take us to jail for murder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky looks at his hands. They are drenched in red up to the elbows with beef blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Paulie hands him a package of beef.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKY>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky takes the package and runs out. Paulie's bleary eyes reveal a fearful respect and slight resentment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GOLDMILL'S GYM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gym is filled to capacity. The NOISE is DEAFENING. Rocky pounds a heavy bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey steps forward and removes a piece of string from his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(passionate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop! Stop! I can't stand it! It's clumsy. You're off balance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
He motions to his bullish helper, Mike. He hands him the string.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<ROCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never had good footwork.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKY>
<DIRECTION>
Mike completes the task.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget the footwork -- You're off balance. The legs are sticking everywhere. Marciano had the same problem, an' the string cured it. When you can hit and move without breakin' the string you'll have balance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll be a very dangerous person.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>

Two young boys in street clothes interrupt Mickey.

The boys depart.

Mickey strains his eyes to see a group of REPORTERS and NEWS CAMERAMEN entering his gym.

The camera turns to Rocky.

The gym explodes with laughter.

He faces Mickey. Mickey whispers in his ear.

The gym freezes... everyone turns and stares in wonderment... Mickey Goldmill shakes his head in disbelief. He now realizes it is a publicity stunt.
</DIRECTION>
<APOLLO>

	</DIALOGUE>
</APOLLO>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone laughs... Dipper moves across the room like a large snake. He brushes people aside and steps behind Rocky. He nudges him... Rocky thinks it is an accident and ignores it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dipper pushes harder and Rocky looks questioningly at him.
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</DIPPER>
<DIRECTION>
Silence looms over the gym... Apollo is apprehensive. The scene is becoming too real. The frightened television crew slyly begins putting away their expensive equipment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIPPER>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, yo' best keep them cameras out! Fight me, boy! Let Creed here see the kind of punk he's fightin'!

	<DIALOGUE>
	See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Dipper suddenly steps forward and slaps Rocky very hard across the side of the head... The gym becomes stone cold. Dipper is in total command and enjoying every moment of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If yo're afraid to fight me, then get down an' kiss my feet, boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIPPER>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey looks nervously around and knows it's only seconds before the blood will run... Rocky stands motionless.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's take a walk, Rock. Please, don't take a chance. He wants to hurt you so you can't fight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky swallows his pride. He still has the string around his ankles. He starts to shuffle away with Mickey... Dipper steps forward and viciously slaps Rocky again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike jumps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why you tryin' to cut 'im, man! Back off, scumbag, or I'll bite your face!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Dipper cuts loose with a hook and knocks Mike flat. The room reeks of fear... Apollo's eyes flick back and forth between Rocky and Dipper. Apollo taps his bodyguards and they begin to ease away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Now, boy, kiss my feet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIPPER>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky eyes his friend lying on the floor. He shuffles forward and stands before Dipper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIPPER>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; almost in a whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Kiss 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIPPER>
<DIRECTION>
Rocky looks at Mickey, then lowers his eyes to Dipper's feet... Dipper smiles. Rocky starts to bend towards the shoes. Without warning, he explodes with a pair of combinations into Dipper's exposed ribs. A CRACK is HEARD and Dipper sinks to the floor writhing in pain... The room is silent except for Dipper's moaning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Apollo is stunned by the scene. The gym has become a very gloomy place. He eyes Rocky with admiration and a hint of apprehension... He leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mickey is the first one to shake off the chill... He shakes his fists at the Reporters, and puts his arm around Rocky.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The kid's got cannons -- Print that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd disperses, leaving Dipper a pathetic and broken figure lying on a dirty gym floor.

<DIRECTION>
INT. ROCKY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

They enter the dismal apartment... On the floor are at least ten telegrams. Rocky scoops them up and tosses them aside. Next to the door is a pile of over a hundred telegrams.
</DIRECTION>
<ADRIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you open them anymore?

	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKY>
<DIRECTION>
Adrian steps to the window. She pulls a pair of short but lovely curtains from a shopping bag... The colorful curtains glare in the dark room.
</DIRECTION>
<ADRIAN>

Adrian smiles and pulls out a small Christmas wreath... Rocky smiles. His eyes show what he feels for this woman.
</DIRECTION>
<ROCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.

<ROCKY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... But I think weak legs ain't bad sometimes, y'know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROCKY>

Rocky approaches in a seductive manner. Adrian uncharacteristically removes her sweater. Underneath is a T-shirt that reads "Win, Rocky, Win."
</DIRECTION>
<ADRIAN>

The only thing I wanna do is go the distance -- That's all. Nobody's ever gone fifteen rounds with Creed.

INT. ARENA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is the night of the Bicentennial fight... The location is the Philadelphia Spectrum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Spectrum is filling to capacity... Grandly dressed celebrities and wealthy fight fans lower themselves into their ringside seat. Nearly everyone is holding a red, white, and blue sweater...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The arena is decorated in tons of patriotic red, white and blue. High above the ring are huge posters of GEORGE WASHINGTON - ABE LINCOLN - DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. - BEN FRANKLIN - and APOLLO CREED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Apollo Creed sits in his dressing room... It is dead silent except for some NOISE that filters under the door from the arena.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a CLOSE-UP of Apollo's hand being taped... The RASPING SOUND of the adhesive tape is very pronounced.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The atmosphere is identical to Apollo's dressing room. Adrian watches in silence as Mike wraps Rocky's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again, the most pronounced SOUND is the RASPING of the adhesive tape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Apollo's other hand is being wrapped. Dead silence except for the TAPE and APOLLO'S BREATHING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

Rocky's other hand is being wrapped in a CLOSE-UP. The only SOUND is the TAPE and ROCKY'S mounting BREATHING PATTERN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UP of drops being placed in his nose to help increase his intake of oxygen. The tremendously magnified SOUND of APOLLO TAKING IN AIR.

<DIRECTION>
INT. APOLLO'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Apollo's trainer slips a mouthpiece into Apollo's mouth. Apollo shakes his head and the trainer removes it and places another one in the champ's mouth... Creed nods yes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROCKY'S DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone present is motionless as Rocky is in the bathroom. Alone, Rocky is on his knee praying. Completing his silent prayer, he stands and looks at himself in the mirror. Suddenly a wave of emotion sweeps over him as he thinks that in a few moments he will face the most overwhelming challenge of his life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out in the dressing room, the door opens and a guard leans in and nods that it is time. He leaves... Rocky steps out.
</DIRECTION>
<MICKEY>

	We would like to welcome our viewing audience to the Grand World Championship Bicentennial Heavyweight Fight -- the first major event of the Bicentennial Year... A point of interest is that the fight is being beamed to more than seven hundred and fifty million fans in theatres in nearly every corner of the world. I would like to welcome an old friend, and co- commentator for this evening's event -- Jimmy Michaels.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COMMENTATOR_1>
<COMMENTATOR_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Bob. The electricity is everywhere tonight. Rocky Balboa, a fifty-to-one underdog, is living a Cinderella story which has captured peoples' imaginations all over the world -- to quote a popular sports magazine, 'The fighting style should be 'The Caveman Against the Cavalier.' From the increase in sound it appears the challenger is now approaching the ring... His record is forty-four wins, twenty losses and thirty-eight knockouts.
	</DIALOGUE>

ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wedge of uniformed guards knife down the aisle to the ring. Many people wish Rocky well as he passes... people also hurl insults. From the expression on Mickey's face it is also the greatest night of his life. In the audience are familiar faces from the gym. From the back of the arena a ROAR goes up... Apollo Creed is in a mock boat dressed like George Washington. He throws silver dollars. The NOISE builds to DEAFENING proportions. Creed's trainer holds the rope and Creed bounds into the ring. He tears off the Washington outfit and it is clearly SEEN that Apollo Creed is garbed in an outrageous Uncle Sam outfit... On his head is a red, white and blue sequined top hat. The robe is sequined red, white and blue. His boxing trunks are red, white and blue silk with stars around the waistband. The boxing shoes match the trunks. On his chin is a pointed white Uncle Sam beard.

Round three... Apollo comes out dancing. He skips and side- steps Rocky's sledgehammer hooks. An expert ring general, Apollo uses the ring fully.

	Apollo almost sprints out of his corner -- feints and throws a pair of left-right combinations.

Rocky wades in and Creed employs incredible footwork. He sets himself and cuts loose with a thunderbolt right cross to Rocky's already broken nose. Blood sprays from the wound and red droplets drip from his chin...

Rocky takes a merciless beating and is staggered by a torrent of combinations. Rocky's eyes are closed. But Creed cannot drop him... The BELL RINGS.

Mickey nods to Benny. He secretly places a small ring knife between his index and middle finger. In one smooth movement he drags the razor over the blood welts and quickly covers the draining wounds with gauze... It is done so quickly no one is ever aware of the operation.

The BELL RINGS for round fourteen. Rocky bores in close, but Apollo still has spring in his legs. He seems determined to end it this round... Apollo catches Rocky flush on the jaw. Rocky is staggered. Like a wolf, Apollo cuts loose with pure savagery. Rocky is driven against the ropes and receives a devastating beating from the Champion... Rocky is dropped.

Rocky sits stunned in the middle of the ring... Everything is a distortion. He looks for familiar faces as though to ask for help... Mickey and Mike scream frantically for him to stay down.

Rocky gets to his feet and tenses with renewed energy. He is like a wounded wild animal. The tide suddenly turns. Rocky drops low and catches Apollo with a pair of terrific body punches that seem to drive Apollo's diaphragm up to his throat... A CRACK is HEARD. A glaze of pain covers Apollo's eyes. It is only a supreme effort that keeps the Champion upright... Apollo is badly hurt. He is bent over.

Rocky moves towards Apollo. Apollo flicks dread jabs into Rocky's eyes... The Italian wades in with punches that seem to bulge out Apollo's back. Creed takes the punishment like a stoic.

Blood is running from Apollo's mouth. In the clinch he leans over Rocky and it drips down the Italian's neck and shoulders. Apollo shields his wound from the ringside judges and continues to fight.

	The fight has slowed down to a near stand-still -- Creed circles to Rocky's right... The spectrum is nearly silent -- Neither fighter has made a motion to throw... I've never seen anything like it in the last round of a championship fight... Apollo spits blood on the canvas. It appears he is protecting his right side. His ribs were probably injured at the end of round fourteen. It's confirmed, unofficially, Creed's ribs may be broken -- Apollo fakes a left and throws a big tired right -- Balboa's mouthpiece is out! Creed attacks with one hand!

Rocky frantically looks in all directions and barely manages to see Adrian jumping up and down waving. The crowd is carrying him away. He attempts to lower himself but the crowd won't permit it.

Rocky instead turns and begins climbing across people's heads and shoulders. He resembles a man trying to go up a down escalator. People are jammed so tightly together Rocky manages to crawl across them to Adrian.
