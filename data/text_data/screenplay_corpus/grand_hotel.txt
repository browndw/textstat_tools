:SC: GRAND HOTEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Berlin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Season is March.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Action of the picture takes place in approximately 36 hours.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Picture commences at approximately 12:35 in the day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Time: The Present.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR REVOLVING DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Show general natural action of people going in and people coming out but in it is the definite inference of people arriving and people leaving the big hotel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE INSIDE THROUGH THE REVOLVING DOOR -- very quickly. CAMERA PAUSES ON THE THRESHOLD like a human being, seeing and hearing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE OUT. :SC: DISSOLVE INTO: Clock. It is twenty minutes to one -- and then moves slowly into the crowd of busy mid-day business jumble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA pushes through crowd and passes by the foot of the steps that lead up to the restaurant. In its journey, it passes Kringelein looking up. He is not pointed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA then saunters -- getting a slow profile movement across -- near Senf's desk. Senf is very busy. THE CAMERA now passes -- profile -- the desk of Senf. General action. Senf stands before his background of slots and keys. WE PROCEED until we are facing the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment the elevator is opening. Among the people who emerge is Suzette, who moves too quickly for us to distinguish who she is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA PANS quickly with her and in the distance we hear her saying to Senf:
</DIRECTION>
<SUZETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam Grusinskaya will not want her car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZETTE>
<DIRECTION>
This line is only just above the general clatter of action but it is picked-up sharply first by Senf then by Bell-Captain -- and as the CAMERA SLOWLY TURNS AROUND, we see the boy going towards the door and we hear the voice in the distance, saying:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cancel Madam Grusinskaya's car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA now backs away from the scene into the BAR. (a section.) It backs to the back of the bar and proceeds -- in profile -- behind the backs of the barmen. A mixed crowd of people drinking before their lunch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We pick up the Doctor, leaning his head upon his hands, looking into space. The woman next to him, a noisy blonde, is laughing. The doctor glances up at her -- she glances at the doctor. She and the audience see the scarred side of his face -- the laugh dies on her lips and she turns suddenly to her companion, who is the Baron. We do not get much of a chance to see him because at that instant he is glancing at his watch, his shoulders are turning away from THE CAMERA and he moves out towards the lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK UP a few feet and LAP DISSOLVE as you move into the main aisle of busy room in restaurant. Great activity of waiters. The bustle and activity of fashionable lunchtime. A string orchestra is playing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Among other things, we pick up the smiling face of the pompous Maitre d'hotel, he has apparently just shown someone important to a table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA watches his face and follows him. His face just as CAMERA reaches service table. The pompous Maitre d'hotel now becomes a thing of drama as he demands of a waiter:
</DIRECTION>
<MAITRE_D_HOTEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is that gentleman's soup?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAITRE_D_HOTEL>
<DIRECTION>
The waiter, frightened and perspiring, doesn't bother to argue -- he tears off quickly (CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM) to another service table. The waiter seizes buss-boy's arm:
</DIRECTION>
<WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's that soup?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITER>
<DIRECTION>
Boy goes off at great rate of speed, CAMERA FOLLOWS HIM, into service room of kitchen. Boy stops at soup chef's counter. He is not the only waiter wanting soup at that moment. He pushes his way to the front and puts his ticket forward.
</DIRECTION>
<BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quick -- come on -- come on...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<DIRECTION>
The soup chef, used to impatient waiters, makes no exception of the young man. He looks at him as much as to say: "I'll slap you on the mouth." At the same time he is pulling over a cauldron of soup.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: CAULDRON OF SOUP being pulled over -- it dislodges a small cauldron that is near the edge. We see the soup fall and hear the scream of a woman before showing her agonized face -- She has been scalded. General steamy confusion. The chef has filled the plate. WE PROCEED the buss-boy out. Half way down the aisle, the waiter takes it from him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA follows the waiter who places the soup before Mr. Preysing. Preysing has been waiting, with his serviette carefully tucked in his collar. His spoon is in his hand. A horrible man, ready for action. The soup is in front of him, he tastes it, pushes it away, frowns, we feel he is going to tear the place down.

Get away?,... No, I can't -- I'd lose my job. It's like being in jail. Oh, I hope the child comes along all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENF>
<DIRECTION>
At the conclusion of Senf's speech, CAMERA MOVES TO NEXT BOOTH. Thru the glass door we see Preysing approaching from desk. He enters booth and commences conversation:
</DIRECTION>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello! Long Distance?,... Get off the wire... No... I was talking to Fredersdorf... What?,... Oh... Hello!... Is that you dear?... How is everything at home?... What do you hear from the factory?... No... How are the children?... I left my shaving set at home... Yes, is your father there?... Hello, father?... Our stock has gone down twenty-three points. If our merger with the Saxonia doesn't go through -- I don't know what we can do... Hello, hello... yes, papa. Rely on me -- everything depends on Manchester... If they refuse to come in -- well, we will be in bad shape... no... Rely on me, I'll make it go through -- I'll make it go through... Waiting?... Yes, I'm still speaking...

Every minute costs two marks ninety... What?... Otto Kringelein! Yes, I'm in Berlin, staying at the best hotel, the Grand Hotel... No, don't you understand? I want to explain, but I must do so quickly, it costs so much. Please don't interrupt me -- hello? Hello! Listen! You know that will I made before my operation? I gave it to you. I want you to tear it up. Destroy it. Because, listen, I came to Berlin to see a great specialist about that old trouble of mine... It's pretty bad, Heinrich. The specialist says I can't live much longer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(louder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't long to live! That's what's the matter! Hello, hello. Are you on the line? No, it isn't nice to be told a thing like that. All sorts of things run through your head. I am going to stay here in Berlin. I am never coming back to Fredersdorf. Never! I want to get something out of life, too. You plague, and bother, and save -- and all of a sudden you are dead. Heinrich... You don't say anything. I am in the Grand Hotel, do you understand, the most expensive hotel in Berlin? I'm going to get a room here. The very best people stay here. Our big boss, Preysing, too. I saw him -- not five minutes after I was here. Sometime, I'd like to tell him exactly what I think of him. Listen, Heinrich -- I have taken all my savings; my life insurance, too; I cashed in all my policies, the sick benefit fund, the old age pension, the unemployment insurance, the burial fund and everything... What's that, miss?... Hello, Heinrich. I have to hang up now. I have to pay three times overcharge. Just think, Heinrich! There's music here all day long. And in the evening, they go around in full dress... Yes, sometimes I have pain, but I can stand it. Everything is frightfully expensive here. You can imagine, the Grand Hotel... What? Time's up...

THE CAMERA does not wait but backs down the room. It is the hour of the tea-dansant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the CAMERA IS BACKING OUT OF THE ROOM which is in reality the restaurant converted -- the tall figure of the Baron -- he proceeds through the door of the restaurant --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Note: Question here as to whether Yellow Room will be the restaurant converted, or not. In which case it will be necessary to add scene of Baron walking through corridor upstairs -- giving sense of distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Baron is whistling the tune of the orchestra, he proceeds through the lobby as if on a mission. He glances at a pretty woman who passes and nods good evening to the Doctor, who is seated in his chair, not far from the desk. He enters.

<PIMENOV>
<DIRECTION>
(looking up from his

	<DIALOGUE>

off at the doctor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is Doctor Otternschlag -- You know him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIMENOV>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<PIMENOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The war dropped him here and forgot him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIMENOV>
<BARON>
<DIRECTION>
(beams)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I was in the war.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<DIRECTION>
CUT IN: FLASH OF DOCTOR --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns as he hears the Baron say this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls at his cigarette and looks grimly at the Baron... then he looks off at Kringelein -- who is trying to get Rohna's attention (the reception Clerk) -- at the reception desk, which adjoins that of Senf's.
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please -- please pay some attention to me -- I have no time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Pan back to desk:
</DIRECTION>
<ROHNA>
<DIRECTION>
(engaged with a lady
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	and gentleman, who
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
have just arrived)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you will wait one moment, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROHNA>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<ROHNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a very nice room and inexpensive, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROHNA>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
Rohna, sensing a scene with this strange dirty little gentleman, looks furtively around for the manager.
</DIRECTION>
<ROHNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just one moment, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROHNA>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
Second Clerk is looking straight at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kringelein turns his attention directly to this man and proceeds:
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came here because I wanted to live here, two weeks, maybe three -- God only knows -- I've told you I'll pay -- I'll pay anything you ask. I'm tired -- I'm ill -- I can't wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
As he finishes the Doctor draws into the scene -- he is watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Assistant Manager enters.
</DIRECTION>
<ASSISTANT_MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Has the gentleman a complaint?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASSISTANT_MANAGER>
<DIRECTION>
Rohna and Kringelein speak together.
</DIRECTION>
<ROHNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The gentleman is dissatisfied with room number five fifty-nine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROHNA>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
He senses an audience and warms up. The Baron and Pimenov enter the scene. The lady and gentleman have turned. The bellboy stands watching curiously and even Senf pauses and looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came here from a long distance to stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a room -- a big room -- like you would give General Director Preysing -- I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you give him a little room, way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going -- bang -- bang -- bang...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he bangs at the desk with his fist)
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This gentleman can have my room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
(turning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Send his bags up to my room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh -- but -- I --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're tired. I can see that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are ill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
During this scene the manager has been talking with Rohna quietly. The manager now turns.
</DIRECTION>
<MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Kringelein will take room number one-seventy-six, one of our most expensive rooms. It is large and on the front with bath.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANAGER>
<KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
(subdued -- exhausted --)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certainly, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANAGER>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. That's what I want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- Yes, that's what I want. I can pay now if you like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
He takes out his wallet and nervously commences to extract money.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That will not be necessary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The manager is instructing the bellboy to take Kringelein to the new room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kringelein accidentally drops a bill -- the Baron, who has noticed the money, stoops to pick it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In bending himself, Kringelein drops his hat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Baron picks up the hat and considerately brushes it with his sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<BARON>
<DIRECTION>
(amused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at all, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he beams)
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
(finding a friendly face)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Baron von Gaigern.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, a Baron!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he is impressed)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Baron catches the mood of making this gentleman suddenly popular.
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to Doctor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(his finger goes
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	nervously to his
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
collar)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zinnowitz passes through scene quickly on his way out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment, Pimenov returns from the news-stand, where he has bought the evening papers.
</DIRECTION>
<PIMENOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Baron -- I must go and dress.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIMENOV>
<KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
(to doctor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this gentleman a Baron, too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<PIMENOV>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unfortunately no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIMENOV>
<DIRECTION>
The Manager comes into scene.
</DIRECTION>
<MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will Mr. Kringelein kindly register.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANAGER>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANAGER>
<DIRECTION>
Kringelein turns to the desk. The Doctor turns up with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment the Baron's chauffeur touches his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<CHAUFFEUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you a minute now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAUFFEUR>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<CHAUFFEUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time's getting short.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAUFFEUR>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've told you a hundred times not to speak to me with a cigarette in your mouth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<DIRECTION>
Chauffeur takes the cigarette out of his mouth -- but still holds it in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<CHAUFFEUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to speak --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAUFFEUR>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<CHAUFFEUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAUFFEUR>
<DIRECTION>
The Baron leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
General moving off, towards elevator, of Baron, Pimenov, Kringelein and the Doctor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: SENF'S DESK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On another shot, shooting profile onto Senf's desk, bring in Flaemmchen. Flaemmchen enters. Her back to CAMERA.
</DIRECTION>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
<DIRECTION>
(we hear her ask)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Preysing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<SENF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you wait please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENF>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<SENF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENF>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(calling off to elevator)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heigh! -- Wait!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<DIRECTION>
She crosses to elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA RUSHES UP BEHIND HER, ALMOST PUSHING INTO ELEVATOR WITH HER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she enters the elevator and the gate shuts, she turns around, back pressed against the Baron -- who is looking down at her. The look on her face is the look we often see on Flaemmchen's in elevators when they are pressed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOTE: Good introduction, for Flaemmchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lift ascends.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: UPPER CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flaemmchen steps out of the lift. She is looking around for the numbers. She moves out of scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Doctor, Kringelein and the bellboy with the bag, move straight down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pimenov is chatting volubly.
</DIRECTION>
<PIMENOV>
<DIRECTION>
(to Baron)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor Grusinskaya -- how can she receive anyone. She can't -- theatre, trains, hotels -- hotels, trains theatre.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIMENOV>
<DIRECTION>
We see Flaemmchen being directed by the floor clerk to Mr. Preysing's room.
</DIRECTION>
<PIMENOV>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must go and dress -- she'll be waking up and calling for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIMENOV>
<DIRECTION>
He proceeds up the passage, pompously, humming the air of his ballet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment, Flaemmchen, who has been directed to Preysing's door, by floor clerk, passes the Baron and there is an amusing exchange of glances between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flaemmchen knocking at Preysing's door hears a voice.
</DIRECTION>
<PREYSING_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREYSING_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
She opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: PREYSING'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Preysing has had a bath and is actually steaming from it. He stands before a long mirror, rubbing himself with a towel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees her through the mirror, wraps the towel around him very cutely, for a big man, and turns upon her.
</DIRECTION>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What...! --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREYSING>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm the stenographer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you will please wait outside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREYSING>
<DIRECTION>
He is very much affronted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flaemmchen, who has seen many large gentlemen in the altogether --
</DIRECTION>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
<DIRECTION>
(lightly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't hurry -- take your time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<DIRECTION>
She goes out of the room and shuts the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: UPPER CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flaemmchen emerges from Preysing's room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Baron loitering in the hall. (Whistling as outlined). Baron approaches, he is also whistling -- the same tune that Flaemmchen is whistling. She glances at him, as he continues whistling with an amusing dance step, as much as to say: "Are you mad?"
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like dancing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not with strangers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Baron glances back up the passage; it is apparent that he is going to make conversation here with this girl, in order to keep legitimately in the passage until Grusinskaya comes out.
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to Flaemmchen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a fool!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I am rather.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<DIRECTION>
He glances down the passage again, his hands in his pockets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She glances impatiently at her watch.
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He must be very nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?

(indicating Preysing's door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you seen it?

</FLAEMMCHEN>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating Preysing's door)

(she twittles her fingers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tea would spoil my dinner.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(lightly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reducing?

	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- why? -- should I?

	Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing in his face)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Money -- Ever heard of it?

<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(moves fingers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very little.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too bad.

</BARON>
<FLAEMMCHEN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>

<BARON>
<DIRECTION>
(glancing up passage)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.

<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where downstairs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yellow Room where they dance --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(business)
</DIRECTION>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're very funny --

</FLAEMMCHEN>
<BARON>
<DIRECTION>
(with great meaning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes? -- Tomorrow?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<DIRECTION>
Flaemmchen laughs at him.
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll dance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
<DIRECTION>
(slowly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. We'll dance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment we hear Kringelein's voice calling from his doorway at the end of the passage.
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baron -- Oh, Baron!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The Baron turns and looks off at ---
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KRINGELEIN .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kringelein is in his door in the distance -- radiant. He waves.
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us.

(to Baron and Flaemmchen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment Grusinskaya's door opens suddenly and Suzette comes out into the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ssshh! Please! Madam is asleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZETTE>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
By this time the others are entering Kringelein's room. The Baron turns back for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
<DIRECTION>
(calling back quietly to Suzette)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Asleep? -- Ssshhh -- sorry!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<DIRECTION>
Suzette turns back into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is typical hotel. Half-open trunks, etc. Curtains are drawn -- room is in semi-darkness. There is a sense of silence, except for distant music coming from the Yellow Room below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In Suzette's hands we see one of Grusinskaya's ballet slippers which she has been mending.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is about to tiptoe to her seat when she stops suddenly and looks off dramatically at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRUSINSKAYA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shot from her angle. She is sleeping beneath a Chinese robe, on the chaise-lounge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Apparently she has changed her position, because the hand which is outside the robe moves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA, as though it were Suzette, moves up towards Grusinskaya. Her eyes are closed. Suzette crosses to the chaise-lounge and is looking down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grusinskaya's eyes open suddenly. She looks at the ceiling and then her eyes turn and look straight at Suzette.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZETTE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly and reverently -- almost a whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam has slept well.

	The performance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<SUZETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZETTE>
<DIRECTION>
Like a soldier called to attention Grusinskaya sits suddenly upright --
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she pauses and droops suddenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she takes the bottle
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	of veronal which is
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
nearby)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Veronal didn't even help me to sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs a little)
</DIRECTION>
<SUZETTE>
<DIRECTION>
(speaking into telephone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZETTE>
<DIRECTION>
While she is speaking Grusinskaya rises -- with the grace of a dancer she picks up the Chinese robe that has fallen to the floor and although there is only one other woman in the room -- she holds the robe around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She crosses to the mirror and looks at her face, running her fingers through her hair. She gently massages under her eyes and the CAMERA sees Grusinskaya for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is silence in the room -- neither of the women speak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suzette gets madam's clothes ready. She crosses, puts the case of pearls down on the dressing table and opens them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grusinskaya looks into space -- silence -- dead silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suzette kneels as if to put Madam's stockings on for her. Grusinskaya pulls her foot away.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't dance tonight --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<SUZETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZETTE>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let us cancel the engagement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<SUZETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, Madam. cannot do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZETTE>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely. I feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
She leans forward against the dressing-table and her hands unconsciously touch the pearls.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(very quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The peals are cold -- everything is cold -- finished -- it seems so far away -- so threadbare -- the Russians -- St. Petersburg -- the Imperial Court -- the Grand Duke Sergei --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(long pause as though
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	she were reliving incidents of the
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
past)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Sergei -- dead -- Grusinskaya -- it's all gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
She throws the pearls away, down upon the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZETTE>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Suzette crosses replacing the pearls.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZETTE>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Grusinskaya's eyes are looking off into space -- she is away in Russia -- she does not look --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Telephone rings -- Suzette crosses to telephone.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZETTE>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Send it away -- I shan't need it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
There is a knock at the door -- a certain kind of knock.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
She picks up the telephone and as she does so Pimenov enters. Suzette quickly gives Pimenov a signal that there is trouble. As Pimenov is closing the door we hear Grusinskaya speak into telephone.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(authoritatively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam Grusinskaya will not require her car -- no -- she will not be going to the theatre.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she turns)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pimenov (at heart a clown) makes a grand comedy bow. He will deliberately try to tease Madam out of her mood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She glances at him, without smiling, crosses to the dressing- table and sits.
</DIRECTION>
<PIMENOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is time for the performance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIMENOV>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(under her breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The performance -- the performance -- the performance.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(during this scene
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	the orchids fall to
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
the floor)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a hysterical out-burst. It is not a woman who is just temperamental, it is something deeper than that. She is very near a nervous breakdown. We, the audience, must feel with her a revulsion against the word performance.
</DIRECTION>
<PIMENOV>
<DIRECTION>
(tenderly -- as he
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	touches her shoulder
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor little Lisevata -- she still has her stage frights -- it will pass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIMENOV>
<DIRECTION>
Pimenov kneels by Grusinskaya -- he is chafing her hands, he attempts to soothe her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Grusinskaya draws her hands suddenly away.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<PIMENOV>
<DIRECTION>
(tenderly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What -- what is it? Last night...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIMENOV>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last night?... There was no applause.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<PIMENOV>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was -- there was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIMENOV>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- I was frantic -- I finished -- the last beat and...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she reclines her
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	head as the swan
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
finishing the dance)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I waited -- I listened -- but the applause didn't come -- nothing. A man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed, Pimenov. We are dead -- it's finished.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
There is a sudden knocking at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<PIMENOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Meierheim --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIMENOV>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens suddenly. Meierheim bursts into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<MEIERHEIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this that you have cancelled your car? Who am I that I should wait like a fool at the door? And here on a whim, you cancel your car. Have you forgotten there is a performance? Do you know the time? Or, are we all mad? Am I your manager?... Have we a contract? Have we obligations? Am I blind?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(glances at his watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Or is that the time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEIERHEIM>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm cancelling the engagement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<MEIERHEIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEIERHEIM>
<DIRECTION>
Business of Pimenov signaling to him.
</DIRECTION>
<MEIERHEIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh! Madam is cancelling the engagement. Madam has chosen a funny time for such a funny joke. Ha, ha, ha -- hurry, come on. Tonight -- there's a line in front of the theatre since six o'clock. The house is jammed to the roof.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEIERHEIM>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The house is not full -- Is it really full?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<MEIERHEIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Packed to the ceiling. Hurry -- get dressed. And what an audience -- the French Ambassador -- American Millionaires -- Princess Ratzville -- er -- er --

(to Suzette)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh -- but it can't be.

	Oh, come, Madam -- please come.

<DIRECTION>
(she holds up her frock)

<GRUSINSKAYA>

(changed mood)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<PIMENOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We will wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIMENOV>
<MEIERHEIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are late. Hurry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEIERHEIM>
<DIRECTION>
Meierheim goes over to telephone, he picks up receiver and says:

<MEIERHEIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell Madam Grusinskaya's chauffeur to bring the car.

</MEIERHEIM>
<DIRECTION>
They are walking towards Kringelein's room. They are pacing rather like men who walk the deck on a liner. They turn almost together, but when they turn back past the CAMERA the CAMERA PROCEEDS on into Kringelein's room. The CAMERA ENTERS THE ROOM to a burst of laughter. Champagne bottles open, caviar, smoke, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the room are the Doctor, Kringelein, the Baron, Flaemmchen, and a very fat waiter -- comedian.
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- and for me, it's going to leave at any minute. Let's drink.

The Baron offers Flaemmchen a glass of champagne. She shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know.

(he has a slight case
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	of hiccups from the champagne. He touches
	</DIALOGUE>

the drapes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And these are real silk drapes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<FLAEMMCHEN>

	Have you seen the bathroom? -- Hot and cold running water -- You see, I can get a bath whenever I like.

At that moment Preysing's voice is heard calling to the Floor Clerk.
</DIRECTION>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The stenographer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREYSING>
<DIRECTION>
Flaemmchen, hearing this, turns and looks off, apparently through the door. Her manner changes, she puts down her glass.
</DIRECTION>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her master's voice!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns to Baron)

Kringelein's optimism has left him for a moment, he stands looking out of door undecided, he is drooped suddenly, as though years had returned to him.

Grusinskaya sweeps into scene.

The Baron leans forward quickly and pushes the bell with a glance at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other. He fixes his eyes on her characteristically. She glances at him. This is the first time they have met in the picture.

She is impatient. As if to break an awkward silence, she turns to Suzette.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My coat.

Suzette is carrying the coat over the pearls. As she takes the coat off her arm, Grusinskaya glances down at the jewel case.

</ZINNOWITZ>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.

FADE IN ON BLACKNESS OF PREYSING'S ROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the distant voice of Preysing and the keys of the typewriter rattling. The reason for the blackness is that Preysing's back is flat into the camera. His hands are behind his back and his fat fingers are moving restlessly. It is an odd effect. We don't know quite what it is.
</DIRECTION>

It seems a silly kind of lull.

<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREYSING>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- only occasional jobs.

	You pay me.

<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a very unusual stenographer --

	Moreover...

<PREYSING>

<DIRECTION>
(as he paces the room,
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	it is obvious that he is trying to

<DIRECTION>
collect his thoughts)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him, waits a moment and then begins characteristically to, change the sheet of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Movies?

</PREYSING>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I photograph very well. Look --

</FLAEMMCHEN>
<DIRECTION>
She tosses magazine -- as if it were nothing at all over to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down at it without touching it.
</DIRECTION>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREYSING>
<FLAEMMCHEN>

(natural -- unabashed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<DIRECTION>
He drops her hand suddenly.

<PREYSING>

Preysing paces the room trying to get his thoughts back to the work in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Moreover... He was a lucky man -- that man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREYSING>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps.

<DIRECTION>
(she waits at attention)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He paces back and forth again.
</DIRECTION>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREYSING>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?

(she takes cigarette)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I went to Florence once, too.

By this time she is smoking her cigarette.

<FLAEMMCHEN>

	Cotton Company --

<DIRECTION>
There is a sudden knock at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREYSING>
<DIRECTION>
Boy enters with telegram.
</DIRECTION>
<BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Telegram for Mr. Preysing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<DIRECTION>
With almost hysterical speed, Preysing snatches the telegram -- opens it. Flaemmchen powders her nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IMPORTANT CLOSEUP OF PREYSING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
it is bad news. He wipes the perspiration from his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh -- oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he throws the telegram
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	away from him, onto her desk. Paces the
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
room.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flaemmchen, believing the telegram to be something that she must copy, picks it up quite naturally and reads it.
</DIRECTION>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Deal with Manchester Cotton Company definitely off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Preysing turns and snatches the telegram from her.
</DIRECTION>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Preysing paces the room with the telegram.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flaemmchen rises, stretches. Quite naturally she glances at the pictures on Preysing's dressing-table.
</DIRECTION>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How nice -- your daughters?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<PREYSING>

	My daughters -- yes, my daughters.

<PREYSING>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Definitely off.

<FLAEMMCHEN>

	Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she is looking at

	<DIALOGUE>
	picture of Mrs.

<DIRECTION>
Preysing)

(turns, speaks quickly -- definitely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he turns, goes out
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	onto balcony with
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
telegram)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flaemmchen, delighted and with alacrity, crosses, piles up her papers and is prepared to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
:SC: FLASH OF CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trim Flaemmchen out of Preysing's room. Take her down to elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the same time, CAMERA PANS OVER and shows the Baron's chauffeur knocking at the Baron's door.
</DIRECTION>
<BARON_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Trim the chauffeur into the Baron's room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: BARON'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Baron is busy changing his clothes. Chauffeur steps in, he closes the door behind him and stands there with an inquisitive look.
</DIRECTION>
<CHAUFFEUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are late -- the dancer's gone to the theatre.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAUFFEUR>
<BARON>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well?

(ready to explode)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what are you going to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAUFFEUR>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The pearls are in her room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<CHAUFFEUR>
<DIRECTION>
(threateningly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAUFFEUR>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<CHAUFFEUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAUFFEUR>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>

</CHAUFFEUR>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<CHAUFFEUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you got that skeleton key?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAUFFEUR>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the skeleton key out of his pocket and produces it to the Baron.
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<CHAUFFEUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAUFFEUR>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<CHAUFFEUR>
<DIRECTION>
(contemptuously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could take care of her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAUFFEUR>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<CHAUFFEUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAUFFEUR>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- no -- no -- no...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<CHAUFFEUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAUFFEUR>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<CHAUFFEUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAUFFEUR>
<BARON>
<DIRECTION>
(swings suddenly on him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like your tone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<CHAUFFEUR>
<DIRECTION>
(comes up to him -- face to face)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAUFFEUR>
<DIRECTION>
Baron is suddenly seized with uncontrollable temper -- twists his wrists -- backs him to door, speaks quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<CHAUFFEUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With the pearls?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAUFFEUR>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With the pearls --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<DIRECTION>
The Chauffeur leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The moment he is gone -- Baron looks the door -- business ad lib.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crosses to window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: FACADE OF HOTEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Baron peeps out onto balcony -- it seems to be clear. He proceeds along and peeps into Preysing's room. Preysing is apparently in the bathroom. Baron skips nimbly past the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Working at thrill of pass through to Grusinskaya's room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRUSINSKAYA'S BALCONY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Baron is pretty shaken by jump.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darkness -- light from transom and building opposite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Business of finding key and getting pearls. INTERCUT Preysing coming out onto his balcony, bringing out with him, loud speaker of radio -- which announces noisily as follows:
</DIRECTION>
<LOUD_SPEAKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'You are listening to the music of the Eastman Jazz Band, in the famous Yellow Room of the Grand Hotel.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOUD_SPEAKER>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRUSINSKAYA'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Baron starts suddenly -- when he hears voice and with pearls in his hand, looks cautiously out of window -- only to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT FROM HIS ANGLE ONTO PREYSING'S BALCONY:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Preysing seating himself upon his balcony -- Radio loud speaker seen. Possibly Preysing commences dinner scene bullying waiter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRUSINSKAYA'S BALCONY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Baron knows he is trapped, if he jumps onto Preysing's balcony, Preysing is the man that will cause the alarm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quickly he moves across the room -- tries the door -- it is locked securely. He looks for skeleton key and then remembers refusing it from the chauffeur. He is trapped in an absurd way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he moves back from the door, he knocks the telephone off of the table. He watches it for a moment, realizing that the operator must now know that there is someone in Grusinskaya's room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up the telephone, replaces the receiver, wipes finger prints off with his handkerchief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is moving back to window when telephone starts to ring suddenly. The thought crosses his mind they they will want to know who is in the room. He lets the telephone ring. Crosses to the door again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above the din of the telephone we hear the chambermaid's voice singing an absurd song.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He listens. She is coming in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The key turns in the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quickly he hides behind the curtains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly and amusingly the chambermaid, tired and dragging, enters the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is looking for an opportunity to dash through the door. After all, this maid should be an easy person to get around. We have a feeling he wishes to dash through the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chambermaid might be singing the same tune that we hear from Preysing's radio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The telephone commences ringing. Chambermaid does not answer it but continues her duties.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At last, because of the noise of the telephone, she picks it up and speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<CHAMBERMAID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- no -- there is no one here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she replaces the receiver)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment, the Inspectress, a large stout woman, appears at the open door.
</DIRECTION>
<INSPECTRESS>
<DIRECTION>
(to Chambermaid)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're late... What have you been doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INSPECTRESS>
<CHAMBERMAID>
<DIRECTION>
(grumbling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone -- all the time says, 'Come back - come back.' They won't get out of their rooms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAMBERMAID>
<DIRECTION>
The Inspectress, in a very businesslike way, proceeds around the room, coming nearer and nearer the Baron. She is looking at ashtrays and running her fingers over the woodwork looking for dust. She tries the door to the next room, to see if it is locked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Telephone bell rings again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inspectress picks it up quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<INSPECTRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Madame Grusinskaya is not here... The Western Theater?... No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INSPECTRESS>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, out of scene, we hear the voice of Suzette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suzette is calling out to the night clerk in the passage.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZETTE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you seen Madame?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZETTE_S_VOICE>
<CLERK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(replying)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't she at the theatre?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Suzette comes in and hurries to telephone.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, hello, Mr. Pimenov? Yes... Mr. Pimenov, have they found her?... No, she is not here... Yes, I'm at the hotel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZETTE>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the Baron watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRUSINSKAYA'S BALCONY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
During this action the Inspectress has waven the chambermaid out of the room. Business ad lib.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meierheim enters, he has heard the word 'Pimenov' on the telephone -- he takes the receiver from Suzette.
</DIRECTION>
<MEIERHEIM>
<DIRECTION>
(into telephone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pimenov?... What's happening?... No, I haven't found her. Is Desprez dancing?... How is it?... Oh, all right. Keep the show going.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(bangs down receiver)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait till I see her, she'll pay for this -- this little trick is going to cost Grusinskaya a suit for breach of contract.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEIERHEIM>
<SUZETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madame is ill -- her nerves...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZETTE>
<MEIERHEIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her nerves... What about my nerves?... Who is she anyway? Where does she think she is -- Russia? Those days have passed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEIERHEIM>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and sees Grusinskaya standing at the door. She is in costume, very pale, very beautiful. Her coat, over one shoulder, is ragging, she lets it drop and moves slowly into the center of the room. Her hair, dressed for the dance, make-up is on her face -- she is breathless.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madame --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZETTE>
<MEIERHEIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEIERHEIM>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to be alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
The other women in the room draw out, leaving Suzette to pick up the robe that has fallen to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<MEIERHEIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where have you been?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEIERHEIM>
<SUZETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should I -- Does madame wish...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZETTE>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suzette, please go, I want to be alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Suzette obediently crosses to door and pauses on threshold, waiting for Meierheim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meierheim approaches Grusinskaya.
</DIRECTION>
<MEIERHEIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose I can cancel the Vienna engagement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEIERHEIM>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish to be alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<MEIERHEIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll be very much alone, my dear madame. This is the end.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he stamps out)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suzette, with a frightened look through the door, closes it on Meierheim's exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DURING THIS SCENE, INTERCUT SHOTS OF BARON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is some time before Grusinskaya moves. She crosses to door -- turns the key -- takes the key out of the lock and throws it away from her -- out upon the floor. She crosses slowly to the mirror, regards herself, silently. We hear the strains from Preysing's radio playing a light Viennese waltz.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grusinskaya begins suddenly to sob.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH OF BARON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watching her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRUSINSKAYA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quite suddenly -- as if with resolution she begins to undress. Then she becomes weary again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a garment in her hand, she moves slowly toward the curtain -- where the Baron is standing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BARON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see him tense himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRUSINSKAYA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She drops the garment listlessly to the floor -- moves out of scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP OF BARON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He peeps around the curtains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRUSINSKAYA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is in a thin robe. She sits before mirror -- looks steadily at her face. Her head goes down suddenly in her hands and we hear her say:
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The end -- over -- finished --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly she moves quickly across the room. Goes to bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Baron half starts out toward door. He watches -- darts across the room as if towards the door. He hears her coming and darts quickly into the half open door of the closet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She re-enters -- carrying a glass of water. She crosses, places the glass down beside the bed -- her movements are quick and furtive -- then she crosses, picks up the telephone -- asks for the theatre.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Western Theatre --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
She leaves receiver down -- crosses quickly to mirror -- stands there and brushes back her hair -- crosses back to telephone speaks:
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Western Theatre?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
She glances up at the clock.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The stage -- Mr. Pimonov -- the ballet master... Grusinskaya -- hurry -- hurry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Again she puts the receiver down -- picking up a pencil she commences hastily to scribble a note. She writes frantically. Her other hand goes up and picks up the receiver.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- yes, I'm waiting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
She finishes the note -- commences suddenly to speak into the telephone --
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Pimenov? -- I'm at the hotel. I couldn't go on -- I couldn't... No, no don't --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(long pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Just alone... Good night, good night, my dear -- goodbye... Pimenov, how is it going, badly?... Uh?... Who's dancing?... Desprez?... Oh -- and how is it?... Oh, -- oh, I see -- they didn't miss me?... They didn't miss me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she lets her hand
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	drop with the receiver and goes on talking
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
into the air)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They didn't miss me -- good night, Pimenov...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
She is about to replace the receiver. She sits with it in her hand, unreplaced.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music has stopped. The room is strangely silent. Behind her the Baron peers from the closet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her head sinks down upon her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A funny, singing noise comes from the telephone. She lifts the receiver to her ear. In a very strange voice, the voice of Opehlia, she speaks:
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(with great humility)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh -- I'm sorry, yes... I have finished.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she replaces the receiver)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The foregoing scene is much better played than described. It is in fact, ballet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quite calmly, Grusinskaya finishes the notes on the table. She folds it up and places it in a prominent place on the table, or hangs it over the telephone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She crosses to the window pulls back the curtains -- the Baron has been hiding behind a few minutes before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the Baron watching. He glances at the door quickly. "No, there is not time." She is returning calmly. She crosses to the dressing table and takes the veronal out of a drawer. She looks at it thoughtfully, her lips are trembling a little. She moves to the radiator as if to seek warmth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sinks into a chair and her head droops over her folded hands which contain the veronal, she seems to pray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Baron comes from the closet -- now is his chance, he looks at the door but can't make it. Looks on the floor for the key which Grusinskaya has previously thrown there, his eyes fall upon the note on the telephone -- he reads it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a death farewell note to Suzette -- do not insert it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At this moment she has finished, the Baron returns to his hiding place. She makes the sign of a cross and goes to her bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks around nervously, apprehensively -- like a deer who has heard something, then reassured. She places the veronal on the night table beside the glass of water. She is quiet and deliberate. She arranges the pillows under her head and lies down. She reaches for the bottle of veronal and empties it generously in her hand. She has to lean away upon one elbow, from the Baron's position, in order to balance herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Baron steps like a cat from his hiding place. He goes to the bedside noiselessly and stands there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches for the glass-her hand stretches out for the glass. The Baron takes her wrist suddenly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns quickly looking at him. The glass falls to the floor with a crash and breaks. As she moves, the veronal falls out of her hands upon the bed. She struggles up to a sitting position.
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, do not be alarmed, Madam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<DIRECTION>
She glances up at him. She is bewildered. She seems to be coming out of a trance. Again she wants to jump from the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Careful -- there's broken glass on the floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<DIRECTION>
Now she becomes conscious of almost nakedness. She draws her kimono tightly around her, glances across the wide expanse of bed. We see her consider passing over that way, but she is now a woman again -- a woman of the earth -- it would be a silly movement.
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(takes a pillow from
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	the bed throws it upon the floor over the glass, steps
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
back)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gets up quickly and crosses, putting on her robe which was lying across the back of a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her first movement is not one of alarm but of -- shame. She draws her robe more closely around her and looks at the Baron puzzled. She thinks, dreamily, "What is this?" She glances back at the veronal and the bed showing us plainly that this man must have watched her preparation for bed. We get a sense of relief with her. She is trembling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Baron has controlled his nerves perfectly. He senses his danger. He is caught red-handed with five hundred thousand marks worth of pearls in his pocket. He is wondering if she will ring the bell. For an instant he thinks of escape. He could dash for the balcony. He could strike her dead or silence her with threats. There is in the room an intoxicating sense of romance and danger. (It should be in the scene.)
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please do not be frightened, Madam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(after a silence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing -- only to be here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you hide in my room?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But surely you must know -- because I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because you love me -- you love me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him for a few moments and then suddenly she throws herself upon the bed and begins to weep more and more passionately.
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
<DIRECTION>
(going over to her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sitting up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(regaining control)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid not -- I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<DIRECTION>
A look in his eyes reminds her of the strangeness of the situation. She rises with returning dignity and pulls her robe around her -- she is becoming the Grusinskaya of Imperial Russia; she is the woman Grand Dukes have fought for. She sweeps across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
<DIRECTION>
(following her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certainly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
She gets her cigarette box from the writing table and holds it out to him. He takes a cigarette and lights it. She watches him curiously. She smiles, as she watches him greedily inhale the smoke. She crosses and sits before her looking glass. She brushes her hair back and powders her face. She looks into the mirror, we feel that she has regained a desire to live. He crosses and looks at her in the mirror. He smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you look at me like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(bitterly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then --?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(involuntarily closing her eyes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And -- and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How tired you are!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- tired...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alone. All alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers in Russian)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mustn't talk Russian to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strange man...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I quite strange to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he embraces her)
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go away. Who are you --?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- I do understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to be alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is not so -- you don't want to be alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he looks back at the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	bed as if remembering
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
the suicide.)
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to be alone --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just for a minute then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Outside the distant noise of Kringelein is heard --
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Say it again -- I didn't hear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<DIRECTION>
She whispers.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You -- man...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
The way she says it, the word goes home. It hurts him. She has looked into his eyes for a moment with a strangely melting and almost happy expression. She gets up suddenly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(NOTE: The other side of the bed -- not where the glass is)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches with her feet for her slippers. She puts one on. She can't find the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Business as he gets other slipper for her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses her ankle and looks up at her. She smiles down.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you -- you are gallant.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she turns, her mood has changed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a sentimental scene. Grusinskaya weeping is a sight worth seeing. It is many years since she did such a thing... You frightened me -- badly. You're responsible for this -- painful scene.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
He watches her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of her own voice reassures her. She is generating warmth. Her cry has done her good, she speaks quickly, volubly.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<DIRECTION>
Grusinskaya turns, she is graceful again.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
<DIRECTION>
(naive as he says frankly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should like to smoke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<DIRECTION>
She rises. She had expected something else. His reply strikes her as chivalrous and considerate. She crosses to the writing table brings back her little cigarette box which she holds out to him. He takes a cigarette and lights it. She watches him curiously. She smiles, as she watches him greedily inhale the smoke. She crosses and sits before her looking glass. She brushes her hair back and powders her face. She looks into the mirror, we feel that she has regained a desire to live. He crosses and looks at her in the mirror, he smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you smile?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he pauses suddenly)
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can you see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are beautiful!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he stoops, takes her shoulder in his hands and kisses it. A long tender and sincere embrace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes close. A tremor passes through her. Suddenly his whole being is aware of her. She turns, rises and disengages herself.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you had better go now. The key is on the floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
He glances back. He speaks suddenly with an air of command.
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to be alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is not the truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he catches her wrists)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do not want to be alone -- you're afraid of being alone -- I know you're afraid. I know you. You were desperate, just now, if I go away you'll be more desperate than ever. Say I am to stay with you... say it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he almost shakes her)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her head falls slowly on his breast.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For just a minute then.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she pulls away,
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	crosses the room, quickly to the door, with almost a cry. She looks around for
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
the key to the door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- oh, no!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses quickly to her and holds her in his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just for a minute, Grusinskaya --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<DIRECTION>
Outside the distant noise of Kringelein and the doctor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: FRONT ON SHOT OF KRINGELEIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
approaching the CAMERA with the Doctor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are returning from the bar and are passing Grusinskaya's room. THE CAMERA precedes them. The Doctor is characteristically drunk. He is silent, tense, cynical. A distinct contrast to Kringelein, whose soul is warmed for the first time by alcohol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kringelein's hat, the same, eccentric one, is twisted upon his head jauntily. The carnation is in his buttonhole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA backs into Kringelein's room and pauses, because the Doctor has paused at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(with a deprecating gesture)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Grand Hotel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he leaves)
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
(to doctor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Doctor --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
But the Doctor has gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kringelein re-enters his beautiful room. He crosses to the mirror, regards himself. Business ad lib.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at himself in the mirror and raises his hat. Imitating the doctor, he repeats:
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Kringelein -- you are drunk -- good night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his hat on the knob of the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes off his coat, holds it up and carefully takes the carnation out of his buttonhole. With the coat over his arm and the carnation in his hand he looks around for a glass and some water which he sees standing on the night table by his bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He puts the carnation in the glass, having filled it with water and then his eyes fall upon his small group of medicine bottles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His demeanor changes. He immediately becomes a thing of pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He glances at his watch -- it is long past his medicine time -- his spirit droops -- he might almost be in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up a small bottle and carefully counts eight drops into the glass. He is about to take it, he smells it, a sudden impulse of well-being surges over him. He flings the medicine away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a great wave of optimism he commences to sing the song that we have heard during the evening -- the chambermaid song - the Preysing radio song -- the love song. He saunters around the room, undressing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

The atmosphere has changed, the sun shines. Grusinskaya is reclining on the chaise-lounge -- her Chinese robe drawn about her. She speaks voluably.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name.

<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.

<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No?

</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>

	When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---

<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.

</BARON>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what do you do -- now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>

	I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail

<BARON>

(turns -- takes both her hands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he releases her hands and turns away again.)
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is the matter?

</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
He does not answer.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Flix!

(in the silence

	<DIALOGUE>
	Grusinskaya puts her head in her hands

The Baron makes a gesture as if to stroke her hair and then holds back.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>

(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you come here just -- just for that? Oh -- it's horrible.

<DIRECTION>
Pause.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is suddenly cold.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>

	You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.

	Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --

</BARON>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.

<BARON>

(his head goes down

	<DIALOGUE>
	into her lap -- he

<DIRECTION>
sighs:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remarkable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<DIRECTION>
His hand touches her hair -- tenderly.
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- yes -- yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
There is a sudden knock at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quickly -- here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
With a quick gesture Grusinskaya beckons the Baron to the bathroom. He disappears into the bathroom. She opens the door, after finding the key and radiantly addresses Suzette.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, Suzette.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<SUZETTE>
<DIRECTION>
(delighted to see her in a good mood)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, Madam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZETTE>
<DIRECTION>
She puts the coffee down on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charming piece of business as Suzette, in putting the coffee down on the table must necessarily push back the heavily crested cigarette case of the Baron.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam has slept well?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZETTE>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(enthusiastically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes, Suzette.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<SUZETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam will dress now, it is late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZETTE>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<SUZETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, madam Suzette knows all about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZETTE>
<DIRECTION>
She is a French woman. She is pleased.
</DIRECTION>
<SUZETTE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam is beautiful this morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUZETTE>
<DIRECTION>
As Grusinskaya hurries Suzette to the door she says:
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Suzette.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Suzette goes out. Quickly Grusinskaya crosses and flings open the bathroom door. The Baron comes out.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must go now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
As she speaks the telephone goes. She gives the telephone a dirty look. Telephone rings again. She pulls him across to the telephone.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There -- it begins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
With a hand in his she lifts the telephone receiver and speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello -- hello -- Meierheim? Yes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
During this scene the Baron is touching her shoulder. A charming light moment. She continues to speak into telephone. His touch probably tickles her, she laughs -- quickly covers the receiver so that Meierheim will not hear her laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(to Baron)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
During this scene she is listening to Meierheim. She frowns suddenly --
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?... Cancel Vienna?... Are you mad? We always have great success in Vienna... Certainly not. Come here and see me... yes... good-bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to the Baron and their arms go around each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The telephone rings again.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There -- the day begins... I must go to rehearsal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
She lets the telephone ring.
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grusinskaya --

</BARON>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do believe that I really love you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.

<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?

	Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<DIRECTION>
They move towards the door.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I shall dance and you'll be with me and then -- listen -- After that you will come with me to Lake Como, I have a villa there. The sun will be shining. I will take a vacation -- six weeks -- eight weeks. We'll be happy and lazy. And then you will go with me to South America -- oh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Telephone starts ringing.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.

</BARON>
<DIRECTION>
She holds him back. The telephone is ringing.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. I'll be on the train.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he kisses her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He leaves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<DIRECTION>
Alone with the telephone bell ringing, Grusinskaya breathes deeply, stretches herself. She goes to the glass and looks at herself -- smiling. Happily she takes the pearls, kisses them, drops them into the casket -- picks up the telephone.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(speaking into telephone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Pimenov... Yes... where are you, in your room? Come, I will see you now... hurry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
She rises from the telephone flutteringly, she is humming a tune. She crosses to the mirror, pulls back her hair happily, she is indeed younger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suzette is putting out a dark dress.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not that dark dress -- something light -- bright -- it's a sunny morning, Suzette.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
Suzette happily glances at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a knock at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sings)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pimenov enters, before he can speak --
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, Pimenov.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<PIMENOV>
<DIRECTION>
(a little puzzled at change in her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, Gru -- your --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIMENOV>
<DIRECTION>
Before he can start speaking of last night she quickly speaks:
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pimenov, I have an idea -- a new ballet -- it must have mad music -- I'll explain it to you later. But now, hurry to the theatre -- I want full rehearsal -- properties -- full ballet and some musicians. Hurry -- Quickly. I will be there --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
During this scene Grusinskaya has not looked at him, she is busy in the glass. Nice photography on hair and face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Side scene between Suzette and Pimenov, as Suzette shows him the cigarette case on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he goes through the door Grusinskaya crosses and almost sweeps Suzette to the door with him.
</DIRECTION>
<PIMENOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gru -- you are positively radiant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIMENOV>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Pimenov.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly to Suzette)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One minute, Suzette, I will call you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
They leave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grusinskaya shuts the door. She sweeps happily to the telephone.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(very very softly -
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	her voice is like
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
music to operator)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello -- will you -- will you get me Baron von Gaigern, please... yes... Baron von Gaigern -- yes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
While she waits, she moves with a sense of dance.
</DIRECTION>
<GRUSINSKAYA>
<DIRECTION>
(again into telephone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you get me Baron von Gaigern, please...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she speaks quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cherie... yes... it is you... nothing... good morning, good morning, cherie... nothing... no... just to tell you I'm happy.

EXT. HOTEL - SIGN

<DIRECTION>
Music effect over sign "Grand Hotel." Precisely the same angle as before. The sign lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: LOBBY - BY SENF'S DESK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music comes up on the DISSOLVE into the original key shot of the lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Senf is busy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Baron's chauffeur is standing impatiently by his desk. Business ad lib of Senf. He turns to the chauffeur who is barring the way of an important looking alien.
</DIRECTION>
<SENF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Step back please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENF>
<DIRECTION>
Chauffeur makes no effort to move. Against the normal busy, happy traffic of the evening he is a sinister figure. He does not move but glares at Senf.
</DIRECTION>
<SENF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've told you three times -- Baron von Gaigern is out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENF>
<CHAUFFEUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he leave any message for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHAUFFEUR>
<SENF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, he did not -- there is no message.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENF>
<DIRECTION>
This whole scene is played in a very low key, almost in a whisper, it is interrupted by the entrance of the Doctor.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(to Senf)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any letters?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<SENF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SENF>
<DIRECTION>
During this short scene the chauffeur saunters off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kringelein comes to the doctor.
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Doctor, such a day -- such a day!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
They move away from the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kringelein's voice diminishes as the CAMERA MOVES following the chauffeur.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chauffeur saunters unthoughtfully past the florist shop and out of the door. As we pass the florist shop we see the back of the Baron in the shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS chauffeur out to door. He has not seen the Baron in the florist shop. THE CAMERA PANS back to florist shop waits for the Baron who emerges carrying his usual box of orchids. CAMERA FOLLOWS BARON back to Senf's desk. Key shot.
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>

(Quickly -- shortly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he glances around apprehensively)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kringelein is speaking to the doctor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Baron approaches them.
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, quite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<KRINGELEIN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've been together all day... and in an aeroplane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
The Baron smiles. He slaps his gauntlets on his dusty coat.
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<BARON>
<DIRECTION>
(amused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where the music's playing and the ladies are...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<DIRECTION>
The Baron leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No pain, Mr. Kringelein?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it...

While Kringelein is talking, they move away from the CAMERA.

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
:SC: FLASH OF BARON'S ROOM.

The Baron enters, throws his gloves down on the bed, turns up the light, picks up a piece of paper that's been pushed under the door, glances at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH INSERT OF THE PAPER
</DIRECTION>

BARON.
</DIRECTION>

We again see the apprehension on the Baron's face. He crosses, closes the window. As he does so we hear the noise from the conference room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bring up noise from the conference room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: CONFERENCE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We must have the feeling that these men have been arguing all day. Cognac bottles, cigar ends, selzer water, remains of some sandwiches. In other words it is a business battlefield. Preysing is drawn and tired. Zinnowitz is on his feet. Flaemmchen is fast asleep in her chair, making a pretty picture.
</DIRECTION>
<ZINNOWITZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and let me say again for the tenth time...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he is hoarse and tired)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZINNOWITZ>
<GERSTENKORN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GERSTENKORN>
<DIRECTION>
Preysing jumps to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Evil days -- I've shown you here --

<DIRECTION>
(he bangs the paper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, come on -- we're going home.

</GERSTENKORN>
<DIRECTION>
Due to the long tedious session the men's collars are wilted.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...

IMPORTANT CLOSEUP OF PREYSING

His hand goes to his pocket. Slowly he takes out the telegram and glances at it. The following scene is played over this closeup.

	Sorry, Preysing.

<PREYSING>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he develops almost a passion)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester.

<GERSTENKORN>

	I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.

<GERSTENKORN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.

</GERSTENKORN>
<PREYSING>

By this time, Waitz and Zinnowitz have the articles out upon the table.

Hasty hand-shaking, business of exits.

<DIRECTION>
Preysing does not answer.

<DIRECTION>
Zinnowitz amiably shrugs his shoulders.

<ZINNOWITZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- the deal has been put through.

	Yes, it has been put through -- it has been put through.

</PREYSING>
<DIRECTION>
During this scene, Flaemmchen has risen, piled up her papers, glanced at her watch. During this action Flaemmchen motions to Zinnowitz that she is going down to dance, etc., Preysing is unaware of this action. Flaemmchen leaves the room trying not to attract attention.

They are not speaking. The Baron is looking off at:

	I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!

The Baron looks off, sees the chauffeur --

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keep the CAMERA on Kringelein as he watches the Baron.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes out his pocket-book and looks at his money commencing to count it. The thought is in his mind of offering the Baron money. Charming scene.

Moving into position. They are talking.

:SC: Like a pageant Grusinskaya sweeps forward -- pretty shot. Music comes up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grusinskaya is followed by Suzette, Pimenov and Meierheim. People turn to look at her. She sweeps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she gets to the door she faces the Baron. She steps quickly aside to him. Pimenov and Meierheim pause.

During this scene Kringelein has been hovering nearby. As Grusinskaya turns away and exits, Kringelein approaches the Baron, who is standing perfectly still, looking off, -- his mind miles away.
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<BARON>
<DIRECTION>
(lightly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.

</BARON>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If the Baron -- if you would permit me --

The Baron looks at him suddenly.
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I could get into a game I might win some.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.

<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we could scare up some men to play.

	Going?

</BARON>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes --

</FLAEMMCHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Flaemmchen hesitates as though she wanted to say something that is on her mind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A curious little scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't speak, she just turns suddenly through the door. The Baron glances after her a little puzzled, turns back to Kringelein.
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ready, Kringelein?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<KRINGELEIN>

:SC: KRINGELEIN'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Possibly ten men are gathered about a green table. They are playing cards. There are champagne bottles, glasses, etc., on the table -- a great deal of smoke. Good atmosphere. The game is [...] fer. There is a dead silence except for the monotonous words of the players.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
White faced, the Baron has the bank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Otternschlag is seen to close the door quietly and approach the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kringelein's back is to us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are smart people, not professional gamblers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a tension in the room. The men are gathered around tightly. We do not see the cards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The following voices are heard:
</DIRECTION>
<BARON_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, gentlemen.

</KRINGELEIN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Several men glance at Kringelein and the size of his stake.
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that too much, Baron?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<BARON>
<DIRECTION>
(glances down at his own money)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- not at all.

</BARON>
<KRINGELEIN>

	All right then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<DIRECTION>
There is tension in the room. The Baron deals two cards. Kringelein takes cards.
</DIRECTION>
<A_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't show them.

</A_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Kringelein turns it down. He is like a little boy learning a new game.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Baron deals himself a card.
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Baron)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do I do now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
The Baron is serious. There is enough money on the table to take him to Vienna.
</DIRECTION>
<A_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(next to Kringelein)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn 'em up.

</BARON>
<A_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Kringelein)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you take the bank, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_MAN>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- I'll take everything gentlemen -- please, let us drink -- champagne --- champagne is expensive and good. I'm winning more than I used to earn in a year -- double what I used to earn.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he is counting his money)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They hand him the cards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kringelein kisses the Baron -- he looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is the Baron -- where are you, Baron?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
At the side table the Baron is standing -- he is drinking -- his face is white -- he has lost.

	Excuse me, gentlemen.

	I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.

</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Kringelein has come to the Baron.
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was my last.

</BARON>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've lost everything?

<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again...

<DIRECTION>
(he puts bills in Baron's hand.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Baron pours out a glass of champagne -- he has been drinking plenty -- he hands glass to Kringelein.
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my last chance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, Baron and to win.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's good, -- come along, Baron.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>

They both move back to the table where the Doctor holds the bank.

</BARON>
<KRINGELEIN>

</DOCTOR_S_VOICE>

<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it. The luck's with you.

<DIRECTION>

Kringelein seats himself, puts his glass of champagne down on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doctor leaves table, crosses to Baron who is pouring another drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out, Baron?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<BARON>
<DIRECTION>
(bitterly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For a while -- I'll recover -- in ten or twenty years.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he points)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<DIRECTION>
He has pointed and turned off because we hear Kringelein's voice:
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've won again, Baron -- I've won again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN_S_VOICE>

Baron moves out of scene followed by Doctor. As Baron approaches table.

<DIRECTION>
(he is pulling money

During the foregoing scene, one of the men at the table has answered the ringing of the telephone bell, he comes back now.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been very lucky... Where's my coat? Let's go. He's drunk anyway!... Goodnight, Baron. Let's wind up the game, I'm broke and tired; you can't play against him. I put my hat down here, somewhere. I think I'll have a drink before I go. By the way, I've got to see you tomorrow morning. How've you been, Doctor?

<DIRECTION>
Business ad lib. General business of slow normal exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kringelein looks up from counting his money. He has been like a little boy with a Christmas stocking. He looks up suddenly, sees men are leaving --

<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, don't go, gentlemen! -- Stay a while.

(he is a little drunk)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<A_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(slapping him on back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Splendid!
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
There is a general feeling in the room that although this man is drunk he is terribly sincere, and that there is no wish to embarrass themselves or him. In fact, there is a nervous impatient movement among the men. But Kringelein has reached an emotional pitch.
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. You must have courage for it, then it's wonderful. You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but I -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life.

	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not used to champagne -- why does he drink it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRUNKEN_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Little comedy on exit. Ad lib.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT FOR RELIEF -- Kringelein's face -- white, drawn, tragic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One man, perhaps, remains.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I help, doctor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, the Baron will stay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certainly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<DIRECTION>
Man leaves. During this scene the Baron has been carefully making Kringelein comfortable on the bed, bolstering pillows behind his head. Kringelein's eyes are shut tightly, his hands are limp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By the business of the Baron, although we do not of course know it, this is the time that he takes the wallet from Kringelein and puts it in his own pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We might perhaps remember a sudden turn away in which we see his back and his right hand raised as though reaching in his inside pocket --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands looking down at Kringelein.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(drops Kringelein's hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It will be over in a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Kringelein's eyes flutter. His voice sounds hoarsely:
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he closes his eyes suddenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, the pain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
(mutteringly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to live a little longer but -- I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<BARON>
<DIRECTION>
(touching his shoulder gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll be all right, Kringelein.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he moves from the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	bed -- takes out a cigarette, moves to the table. He seizes
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
his drink)
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(out of scene)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My pocketbook... my money in it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN_S_VOICE>
<DOCTOR_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you say -- what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
We watch Baron's face, he looks back over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You what -- Oh, isn't it there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR_S_VOICE>
<KRINGELEIN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- But no I -- Baron, I've lost my pocketbook.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Baron turns in this scene. He walks forward toward them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Doctor's hands are on Kringelein's coat.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(He glances down)
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
(starting up suddenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at Baron)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fourteen thousand marks... One can travel -- one's happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks -- don't you think so, Baron?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<BARON>
<DIRECTION>
(with a shrug)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quite possibly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment, Kringelein, who has been staring up at the ceiling, his hands clenching and reclenching, starts up.
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I've got to find it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay where you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- I must find it --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he starts talking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fourteen thousand two hundred marks.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he pulls himself to the side of the bed)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doctor goes to restrain him.
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm all right, Doctor. There's no pain now -- only you don't know what that money means to a man like me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
He is suddenly on his hands and knees, crawling along the floor, looking for it, like a little boy; his drunkenness, his condition, makes the situation tragic. He actually gets under the card table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Doctor looks at the Baron.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Baron only watches Kringelein. He follows him, fascinated.
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
(talking at intervals
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	as he crawls looking
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
for money)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know, because you've never lived like a dog -- in a hole -- and saved and scrimped. My life hangs upon that money, Baron. Nobody gives you anything. You have to buy everything and pay cash for it. I wanted to pay for my last days with that money. Every hour costs money. I've nothing -- nothing but that pocketbook.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he crawls along the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	floor on his hands and knees talking to the carpet as he
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
looks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must have it back.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he pauses breathless --
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	like an animal along the wall -- looking
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
up at the men)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The foregoing speech is intercut with the following action in which Kringelein's voice is heard throughout -- thus it is not a long speech:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Baron watches. He throws his cigarette away -- he bites his lip -- sweat breaks out upon his forehead; again he is a thief. When he wanted pearls the love of a woman stopped him. Now he wants this money and pity, a slow growing pity for this tragic, dying thing is stopping him -- and all the time the Doctor watches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The one, whole eye pierces into the Baron's melting conscience.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Twice during the speech at a spot, through and during rehearsal, to be selected, the Doctor's voice, droning but piercing, says:
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He must find his money, Baron.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(next time)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Kringelein should find his pocketbook, Baron, shouldn't he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
These are two interjections.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now, Kringelein lies upon the floor, a troubled little sack of pain, his head down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Baron turns away. He bends down as though he were looking for the pocketbook. We see him take it from his pocket and turn. There is a very light, almost triumphant ring in his voice as he says:
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
(his head coming up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<BARON>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodnight, Kringelein.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he moves towards the door.)
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- no please -- oh, don't go -- don't go -- don't leave me alone, Baron.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've nothing to fear, Kringelein
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come, get up -- come let me help you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<DIRECTION>
NOTE: If he is a strong actor he can pick Kringelein up -- If not, he and Doctor lift Kringelein to bed.
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
Baron bites his lip. It is the first and only time in the play that we see a tear near -- the strong man almost breaks.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodnight, Baron.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR_S_VOICE>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodnight.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(his hand presses on
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kringelein's shoulder --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
he exits)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT OUT INTO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Baron shuts door and pauses. In front of him is the door of the woman he loves. Down beyond is his own empty room. In his pockets nothing. In his CLOSEUP he makes the audience feel his problem with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This man who has lived and whistled and love through the play becomes a tragic, lonely, harrassed figure. The Baron has broken. His fists dig into his eyes -- he brushes his hair back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over this comes with almost an impertinence, a tiny whistle. He looks up and away down the corridor. The figure of Flaemmchen stands there, a small black bag in her hand. The Baron pulls himself together and smiles characteristically. He walks down the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You live here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she points to door --
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	she looks at him a
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
long time)
</DIRECTION>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- oh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<DIRECTION>
They both go into their respective rooms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Here are our two gay young characters. The gay, fresh Flaemmchen and the debonair Baron, crucified for lack of funds. Both trying to smile, both trying to be light about themselves. Yet, each about to involve themselves tragically for the want of a little money.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: FLAEMMCHEN'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flaemmchen enters her room cautiously. Except for one lamp burning the room is in darkness and empty. From the adjoining door to Preysing's room a thin stream of light. She puts down her bag quickly, tiptoes through the bathroom to his door. She peeps through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH OF PREYSING'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
from her angle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Preysing stretched on bed flat, his stomach a mountain and on it the magazine that he has been reading with Flaemmchen's picture. He is looking at the ceiling. She knows he is awake because a thin stream of smoke comes from his cigar in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH OF FLAEMMCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An idea occurs to her. She could possibly sneak into bed and he would go to sleep and there would be nothing that night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA FOLLOWS HER as she tiptoes to her room. She closes the door noiselessly and listens. She throws off her hat and takes off her coat. Opens her bag and takes out night dress, lingerie, etc. The lid of her bag falls suddenly. She starts at the noise. "Has it awakened him." She looks off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOT AT BATHROOM DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The thin stream of light is filled suddenly, the door of the adjoining room opens and back-lighted from the other room the huge form of Preysing appears. In this odd lighting he is a little more than Preysing. He comes forward. He speaks hoarsely, quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Flaemmchen!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he seizes her to him)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to his arms passively. He rubs his face in her hair. She is passive -- cold.
</DIRECTION>
<PREYSING>
<DIRECTION>
(breathlessly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREYSING>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had to arrange about the trip.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're sweet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREYSING>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think so?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<DIRECTION>
He holds her again, trying to kiss her. She deliberately avoids his kiss.
</DIRECTION>
<PREYSING>
<DIRECTION>
(awkwardly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he sits heavily on
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	the bed, sitting on
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
her night dress.)
</DIRECTION>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, hold up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Preysing rises while she pulls her night dress from under him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He draws her to him.
</DIRECTION>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREYSING>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
<DIRECTION>
(pulling away, glad
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	of an excuse for
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
conversation)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREYSING>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREYSING>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not funny at all. One can't get intimate just off hand. I could go to England with you and everything like that -- supposing I met you next year and I said: 'How do you do, Mr. Preysing! And you said:
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she imitates him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'That was the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<DIRECTION>
Preysing laughs. She laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all quite proper.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she is happy again.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She would rather
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
talk than be squeezed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But supposing I met you when you were with your wife and I called out: "Hello you big baby -- remember Manchester?' And you with your wife, how would you like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<DIRECTION>
There is a pause for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Flaemmchen -- we'll leave my wife out of this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREYSING>
<DIRECTION>
Flaemmchen yawns straight in his face.
</DIRECTION>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. I'll get undressed -- get out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<DIRECTION>
He moves towards the windows which are open. She pushes his fat body out, almost playfully, through the doors and onto the balcony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Preysing stands out on the balcony. He looks down in the street below, then off. He starts suddenly because he sees a shadow over the railing of his own balcony. He is puzzled. Shadow crosses again. "Who can be in his room?" He moves forward and peeps through the window. One side of the French window is closed. From his angle we see the Baron furtively searching the room. He is now wearing an overcoat, the collar is turned up. Business ad lib. He finds Preysing's wallet. He stuffs this in his overcoat pocket. Preysing's face watching him. As Baron turns to exit, Preysing surges forward, pulling the window after him. The two men face each other.
</DIRECTION>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREYSING>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must have made a mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(the Baron starts to leave.) (bellowing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay here... Give me that money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREYSING>
<DIRECTION>
The Baron hands him the pocketbook without a word.
</DIRECTION>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that's how we stand, Baron.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREYSING>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREYSING>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be quiet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARON>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to call the police. I'm going to watch you play the great Baron with the police. Aristocrat! Aristocrat!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he picks up the telephone)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Baron makes for the door on the other side of the room, pulls at the knob.
</DIRECTION>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The door is locked, Baron.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREYSING>
<DIRECTION>
The Baron makes one dive across the room. Preysing grasps at his coat and tears it. With one hand holding the telephone, (the receiver dropping on its cord towards the ground) and one hand holding the Baron.
</DIRECTION>
<PREYSING>
<DIRECTION>
(into telephone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello! Hello! --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREYSING>
<BARON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he tries to snatch
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	the telephone from
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Preysing.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Preysing wrenches the telephone suddenly away from the Baron. The action excites him.
</DIRECTION>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strike me, would you? Attack me would you? Attack me --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREYSING>
<DIRECTION>
With a terrific lunge, Preysing brings the telephone down upon the Baron's head. The Baron sways, stunned. (as in book). In his mad rage, Preysing, hits again with the telephone.
</DIRECTION>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll strike you -- I'll strike you -- I'll strike you -- Strike me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PREYSING>
<DIRECTION>
By this time the Baron is a heap on the floor. We see Preysing come out of his blind trance. He even repeats again.
</DIRECTION>
<PREYSING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I strike you --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with telephone
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	foolishly in his hand, he looks down
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
at what he has done.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWNSTAIRS TELEPHONE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sharp sound of buzzing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dozing night girl plugs in, lazily.
</DIRECTION>
<NIGHT_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- yes -- Operator -- Operator --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she listens -- says to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They are having a nice little game up there with the telephone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIGHT_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
With nonchalance she flicks plug out again, as she does so:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: PREYSING'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
New angle. Preysing is on his feet. He has replaced the receiver on the telephone, he is putting it back slowly. He is terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Door opens behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flaemmchen, with a dressing gown on, light, filmy thing, crosses and looks down at the Baron, without a word. Preysing seizes her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her hand goes to her head, her eyes roll; for a moment we think she is going to faint right on top of the Baron. She is trying to collect her senses, it cannot be true. We can hear nothing but the heavy breathing of Preysing and the traffic below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a motor horn in the street below sounds strident, it is the first time we have been conscious of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a swift movement, Flaemmchen dashes towards the door. It is locked. She rushes back as if to cut through her own room. He reaches for her and rips her dressing gown from her, leaving her almost naked. He lunges after her. She tears through her own room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flaemmchen enters from her room. She looks this way and that. After all, it is Flaemmchen and not Lillian Gish, running across the ice in "Way Down East," -- it is Flaemmchen, a Berlin girl. She pauses to try and clear her brain. "What the hell is this -- what is it." The impulse naturally is to scream in alarm. She doesn't -- Flaemmchen's don't. She looks around. At the end of the passage is Kringelein's room. She will go there. We watch her run down the passage uncertainly. Without knocking she pushes open Kringelein's door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: KRINGELEIN'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is in darkness. The only light comes through the windows. The form of Kringelein lies prone upon the bed, the Doctor had just thrown a coat over him. He is still in his trousers and shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like a ghost, Flaemmchen, the shreds of her filmy clothes hanging to her, crosses.
</DIRECTION>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
<DIRECTION>
(hoarse whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Kringelein -- where are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<DIRECTION>
She sweeps to bed. She shakes him. Kringelein starts up.
</DIRECTION>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh -- what -- what --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he is looking up at
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	what seems to be a
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ghost.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls on the light by the bed, it flames up on their faces.
</DIRECTION>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
	</DIALOGUE>
</FLAEMMCHEN>
<KRINGELEIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Preysing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KRINGELEIN>
<DIRECTION>
It occurs to him that this girl with her torn clothes must have been roughly treated by Preysing. He suddenly assumes a strength.
</DIRECTION>
<FLAEMMCHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, don't wait -- go -- it's awful -- it's awful.
	</DIALOGUE>
