One small step for man, one large pile of garbage for moon- kind. Untouched for years, the flag stands next to the castoff remains of the Apollo mission. Slowly the discarded equipment begins to RATTLE and SHAKE.

AN ENORMOUS SHADOW creeps towards us blotting out the horizon, a loud RUMBLE is heard.

He stands and looks around. Spotting the beat up and incapacitated alien Attacker, Steve gets an angry resolved look. He marches over to the fallen alien Attacker. He scans it quickly, spots a type of door that has been knocked ajar.

With all his might, Steve YANKS the door OPEN.

For the first time we get a quick glance at these aliens, an odd hybrid creature with fluctuating skeletal structure.

The reason we only get a quick glance is because the moment it turns woozily towards us, Steve rears back and SLUGS HIM IN THE FACE, knocking the alien totally unconscious.

EXT. AIR FORCE ONE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flying over the desert, Air Force One sails over an immense valley, Area 51 below - hangars, a few buildings, a small air strip, not much.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Super: N.I.A. Base - "Area 51", Nevada
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RUNWAY - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Air Force One lands. Wheels touch down, skid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HANGAR - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The large hangar doors open and Air Force One is rolled inside. The President and his entourage are met by a contingent of base personnel led by field operative, LT. MITCHELL. He escorts them to a side hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lt. Mitchell walks over to an odd wall switch as the President and his entourage wait in the center of the hall. With a loud hydraulic HUM, the entire hallway begins to SINK DOWN, an enormous ELEVATOR.
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT>
<NIMZIKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two words, Mr. President. Plausible deniability.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIMZIKI>
<DIRECTION>
General Grey shoots Nimziki a pissed off look. When the elevator stops, a door SLIDES open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RESEARCH FACILITIES - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stepping out of the elevator, they walk into a large state of the art, sterile clean research facility. It is amazingly well staffed and organized.
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't understand. Where did all this come from? How did this get funded?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT>
<MOISHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't think they actually spent ten thousand dollars for a hammer and thirty thousand for a toilet seat, did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOISHE>
<DIRECTION>
The President shoots him a look. They are greeted by a group of SCIENTISTS in whit coats led by, DR. OKUN.
</DIRECTION>
<MITCHELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. President, I'd like to introduce you to Dr. Okun. He's been heading up our research here for the last fifteen years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCHELL>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Okun is an odd, hyper-energetic man who's spent too much time in isolation.
</DIRECTION>
<OKUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. President, a real pleasure. They don't let us out much, you you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OKUN>
<PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
(uncomfortable)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT>
<OKUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I guess you'd like to see the big tamale? Follow me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OKUN>
<DIRECTION>
They walk up a ramp at the end of the room. Large heavily enforced doors SLIDE open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STORAGE LAB - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The group steps inside and nearly gasps at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ALIEN ATTACKER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just like the one that chased Steve. The entourage stares in horror and wonder. We can SEE the patch-work repairs they've made on the ship over the years.
</DIRECTION>
<OKUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's a beaut, ain't she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OKUN>
<DIRECTION>
Moishe leans close to David and Constance.
</DIRECTION>
<MOISHE>
<DIRECTION>
(smug)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never any space ships recovered by the government, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOISHE>
<PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've had this for forty years and you don't know anything about them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT>
<OKUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell no, we know tons about them. The nearest stuff has only happened in the last few days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OKUN>
<DIRECTION>
The President slowly walks around the ship as Okun talks. David, mouth agape, just stares at it.
</DIRECTION>
<OKUN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, we can't duplicate their type of power so we've never been able to experiment. But since these guys started showing up, all the gizmos inside turned on. The last twenty four hours have been really exciting!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OKUN>
<PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
(exploding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People are dying out there. I don't think "exciting" is the word I'd choose to describe it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
The room goes silent, letting the President blow off steam.
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
(calming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can you tell us about the enemy we're facing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT>
<OKUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not all too dissimilar to us. Breathes oxygen, comparable tolerances to heat, cold...probably why they're interested in our planet.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly excited)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you wanna see them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OKUN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MEDICAL RESEARCH VAULT - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights slowly TURN ON, illuminated the vault. Okun leads the group to a sealed partition.
</DIRECTION>
<OKUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is vault, or as some of us have come to call it, the "freak show."
	</DIALOGUE>
</OKUN>
<DIRECTION>
Okun hits a switch and the sealed partition lifts revealing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FORMALDEHYDE TANKS - ALIENS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three dead aliens float in the milky formaldehyde tanks. The murky fluid and condensation obstructs our view. What we do see is not pretty.
</DIRECTION>
<OKUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When we found them they were wearing bio-mechanical suits. Once we got them off, we were able to learn a great deal about their anatomy; eyes, ears, bipolar digestive system... no vocal cords though. We're assuming they communicate with each other through other means.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OKUN>
<DIRECTION>
David cannot contain his fascination. He steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of other means? Hand signals, body language?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<OKUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some kind of extra sensory perception. Telepathy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OKUN>
<PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can they be killed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT>
<OKUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These three died in the crash. Their bodies are as frail as our own. You just have to get past their technology, which is, I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OKUN>
<DIRECTION>
The President turns to David.
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You unlocked a part of that technology. You cracked their code.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I did was stumble onto their signal. I don't know how helpful I can be...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show them what you've discovered. Work together. We've got to find a way to beat them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SECURITY GATE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Four armed GUARDS watch the gate. An armada of trucks and trailers heads right for them. They move into position to block their entrance as a blue pick-up skids to a halt before them. Steve stands up from the back of the pick up.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, Lt. Colonel, I can't open the gates without clearance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<STEVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to see my clearance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVE>
<DIRECTION>
Impatiently Steve grabs the Guard by the collar, pulling him over the side of the truck putting him face to face with the bundled parachute in the flatbed. Steve rips the fabric aside revealing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ALIEN CREATURE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still unconscious, the alien stirs. The Guard JUMPS BACK, shitting in his pants. Quickly he signals for the other to open the gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The armada quickly drives past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACKNESS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Total darkness. Suddenly light pours in as a door is open. We see the faces of Okun, David and three technicians all peering at us with inquisitive expressions.
</DIRECTION>
<OKUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See the gizmos flashing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OKUN>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE - INSIDE ALIEN CRAFT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sure enough, tons of gizmos with lights flashing. High tech meets organic organisms. This alien ship looks familiar to our own technology and completely different at the same time.
</DIRECTION>
<OKUN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've been working around the clock trying to get a fix on all this crap. Some stuff we figured out right away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OKUN>
<DIRECTION>
David climbs in, fascinated. He touches everything. Okun points to everything as he describes it.
</DIRECTION>
<OKUN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This thing we're pretty sure is the life support for the cabin, this do-hickey over here is connected with the engines, this crap...we have no idea what that stuff is for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OKUN>
<DIRECTION>
David is transfixed by it. He stares at the small screens with flashing light patterns on them.
</DIRECTION>
<OKUN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this over here is clearly what they use to navigate and guide the craft.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OKUN>
<DIRECTION>
But David still stares at the small screens.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone grab my laptop for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
One of the technicians rushes off as Okun leans close.
</DIRECTION>
<OKUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Find something interesting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OKUN>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
The technician hands David his retrieved laptop which he quickly flips open and turns on.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These patterns here, they're repeating sequentially, just like...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
David turns his laptop around for Okun to see. The pattern on David's laptop flashes identically as the alien screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DAVID>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...their countdown signal. Their using this frequency for computer communications. It's how they co- ordinate their ships.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAVID>
<OKUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, you're really starting to make us look bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OKUN>
<DIRECTION>
The two men exchange a smile. Another TECHY pops his head inside.
</DIRECTION>
<TECHY>
<DIRECTION>
(out of breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They got one! They got one, alive!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TECHY>

INT. HALLWAY OFF MAIN HANGAR - AREA 51 - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bundled alien lays on a stretcher that's wheeled quickly into the hall. Okun and his staff surround it. Trailing behind them is Steve, Russell and Miguel.
</DIRECTION>
<OKUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long has it been unconscious?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OKUN>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me Doctor...

</RUSSELL>
<STEVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three hours.

</STEVE>
<OKUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get him into containment, stat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OKUN>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My boy is very sick, he needs immediate attention.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Okun ignores Russell, hitting the elevator switch on the wall, the room begins its hydraulic HUM.
</DIRECTION>
<OKUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's dying out. I want him sprayed down with saline.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OKUN>
<DIRECTION>
Russell SLAMS his fist against the switch, the room stops. He GRABS a doctor nearby, gets in his face.
</DIRECTION>
<RUSSELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My boys is slipping into a diabetic coma. If you don't do something about it right now he will die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUSSELL>
<DIRECTION>
Miguel is surprised and proud of Russell as he holds DOCTOR ISAACS, meaning business.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_ISAACS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O'Haver, Miller, come with me.

EXT. ROAD - MAINTENANCE TRUCK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Headlights pierce the darkness as the maintenance truck rolls to a stop. Jasmine climbs down out of the truck, her face ashen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks past a sign reading: El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. Tears begin to roll from her eyes. We follow her gaze to see...
</DIRECTION>

General Grey and Nimziki are in a heated argument.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL_GREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were the head of the National Intelligence Agency! You knew all about this. When were you planning on informing the rest of us!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_GREY>
<NIMZIKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It had been deemed classified.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIMZIKI>
<GENERAL_GREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ, why didn't you say anything about this when they first arrived? You could have warned us before we launched a counter attack that cost us hundreds of American pilots!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_GREY>
<DIRECTION>
Just then the President enters along with Constance and some other ADVISORS. He examines a paper map of the United States, tacked to the wall, each major city circled in black.
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Atlanta, Chicago and Philadelphia, destroyed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT>
<GENERAL_GREY>

The President and his team take seats at the large conference table.
</DIRECTION>
<GENERAL_GREY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've learned that NATO and western allied installations were the firs to be taken out. We were next. They knew exactly where and how to hit us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_GREY>
<DIRECTION>
Grey sneaks an accusatory glare at Nimziki.
</DIRECTION>
<PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And our forces?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT>
<GENERAL_GREY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're down to approximately fifteen percent, Sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you calculate the time it takes them to destroy a city and move on, we're looking at world wide destruction of every major city within the next thirty six hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENERAL_GREY>
<PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're being exterminated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
The room is quiet. Constance runs her fingers through her hair. The door to the room opens and Lt. Mitchell enters with Steve.
</DIRECTION>
<MITCHELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. President, this is Lt. Colonel Steven Hill.
	</DIALOGUE>

</PRESIDENT>
<MITCHELL>

As Margaret tries to move, she winces in pain. Jasmine rushes to her aid. The color from her face drained, Margaret looks like she's taking a turn for the worse.

INT. CONTAINMENT LAB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Okun and two Medical assistants examine the alien creature. His arms and chest have been strapped down to the examining table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For the first time we get a good look at the head of this creature, long tentacled-type cords interlocked, covering the face. The doctors attach clamps to each of the cords.
</DIRECTION>
<OKUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OKUN>
<DIRECTION>
The doctors exchange nervous glances, nod to each other. At the same moment all they pull on the clamps, unraveling the interlocked cords. As the cords unravel, we SEE that this is in fact a bio-mechanical SUIT as we REVEAL...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ALIEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beneath the cords lay the unconscious face of the alien, his skin translucent, his body fluids, capillaries, muscle tissue, alien's skin.
</DIRECTION>
<OKUN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do we have life support monitors recording?
	</DIALOGUE>

Instantly everyone's attention is riveted to the arm of the alien as it moves beneath the sheet. Unseen by the others the alien creature's EYES OPEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another SHARP PAIN hits Okun who SCREAMS, stumbling backwards grabbing his head. The others turn in surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ALIEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly SPRINGS up, the restraining straps SNAPPING. Before Med #2 can react, one of the alien's tentacles SMASHES her across the face. She is sent sprawling backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOW ANGLE - THE ALIEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing before her. In a wink of an eye, he ATTACKS, leaping on her.

Together they TUMBLE back into a formaldehyde tank. Hoses are ripped from their sides and STEAM pours out. We get quick glimpse of their struggle as the steam engulfs them.

The group slows as they enter the room. They see the containment room through the glass is covered with white steam. Nothing can be seen. It's eerily quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cautiously they approach. Suddenly Okun is SLAMMED AGAINST the glass partition, the creature's tentacles wrapped around him. Pressed firmly to the glass, his eyes are shut, his expression pained, but when he speaks the voice is angry.

They follow the tentacles with their eyes, up to the ceiling of the containment tank. Suddenly the alien LEAPS DOWN, startling them, landing before them behind the glass.
</DIRECTION>

We see he's holding Okun against the glass, speaking THROUGH HIM. This is the first real good look we get at the this bizarre creature. Everyone in the room is repulsed and compelled by it at the same time.
