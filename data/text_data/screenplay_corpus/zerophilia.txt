EXT. WILDERNESS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mist. Dark trees. Dripping vines. An ENGINE RUMBLES in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The full moon shimmers on a puddle. A FROG SPLATS IN, splashing a one man pup tent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE TENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LUKE's eyes pop open, disoriented, realizing he's fallen asleep reading by flashlight. He's nineteen, still slightly awkward and unaware he's growing handsome.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He listens as the ENGINE RUMBLES LOUDER, closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He peers out through the tent flap. Glaring head lamps ROAR toward him. Scrambling out of his sleeping bag, he HURLS himself against the side of the tent, as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
an RV CAMPER nearly plows down the tent, skidding to a stop in the mud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stillness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke extricates himself from the tent. He runs to the driver- side window of the RV.

Luke stands at the RV's tiny kitchen counter, wolfing pastry off a paper plate.

	So, this "Survival Quest" is your vacation?

She smiles, grateful, eyeing his torn t-shirt and shorts.

EXT. LANGFORD UNIVERSITY - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Students crisscross on bikes in front of the quadrangle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The huge round headlights and muscular front grill of an old SEMI-TRUCK RUMBLES up to the curb. It's the cab only, like the sliced-off front of a train engine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke hops down, startling his friends, KEENAN and JANINE, passionately making out on the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Twenty, brainy and athletic, Janine adjusts her glasses, the only remnant of a bookish past, as she thoughtfully considers Luke's massive truck.
</DIRECTION>
<JANINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's remarkable. Sort of retro. I thought you were gettin' a pickup?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANINE>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I changed my mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Hoping for a more enthusiastic response, he turns to Keenan, who climbs up and peeks inside the cab. He's rugged, streetwise, perpetually bemused, -maybe Ed Norton and Bill Murray had a son...
</DIRECTION>
<KEENAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's awesome. It's pleather.

Janine sneers. At a loss, Keenan grabs her and kisses her passionately.

She walks off rolling her eyes, but secretly loves it.

Keenan climbs up into the cab.

	<DIALOGUE>
	So this is gonna' be like your car?

	Look, I know it's dopey. But don't you recognize it? It's painted and the muffler's switched out, -but this was my dad's.

</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Keenan looks around with fresh eyes. He reaches an arm way up under the glove box and GRINS, pulling out a small stash of weed.

Keenan looks over warily, then busts out LAUGHING, then realizes Luke's serious.

INT. ROAD RAGE GARAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small, run-down service garage, crammed with tires, tools and discarded car parts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke's truck idles in the service bay, billowing smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAX, nineteen, lean, in overalls, with shoulder-length hair and edgy eyes, wipes his greasy hands on a rag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dripping with masculinity, he swaggers around the truck, chewing gum, wielding a pneumatic torque-wrench, which he occasionally REVS for emphasis.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can do the gasket for twenty bucks. But new T-sprocks, for this thing? Two, three hundred, maybe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit. Can I hold off on that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No skin off my ass. But a few days, weeks, your whole transmission could blow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, Jeez. I shouldn't got this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Max considers, sets his baseball cap on the truck fender and SIGHS.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four hundred seventy-five horsepower. Twenty-eight inch wheels. It's a classic. Let me dig around out back. Maybe we got a used set.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<LUKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That'd be great. Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUKE>
<DIRECTION>
Max disappears through a squeaky door at the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke picks up a rag and wipes fingerprints off the fender.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits, impatient for Max to return.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He examines Max's cap, tries it on. He picks up the torque- wrench, swaggers about, trying to look macho, in the manner of Max.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He spins around and REVS the wrench, catching sight of MICHELLE, twenty, watching him from out front in jeans and T- shirt, with warm, confident eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Luke swallows, wide-eyed, a deer in headlights. He sets down the torque-wrench.
</DIRECTION>
<LUKE>

</MICHELLE>
<LUKE>

	You have to watch my brother, Max. He's sellin' you "T-sprocks?"

	Yeah?

An SUV pulls up at the gas pump, stuffed with Keenan and OTHER GUYS. CHAD, exuding supreme self-confidence, calls over to Luke as he pumps gas.

<DIRECTION>
Luke's eyes open, dilated, disoriented. He's lying on the ground, shirtless among bits of garbage.

He watches bleary-eyed, as a MOUSE peers at him from inside an empty milk carton. The mouse runs over and sniffs at a canteloupe, which triggers Luke's memory:

A glimpse of what might be an ORGY of BODIES intertwined.

<SYDNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why in the world do guys say "it sucks" as if it were a bad thing? I mean, every guy's dying to get a blow job, right? So, you think they'd treat those words with profound respect, like holy scripture. "What an unbelievable sunset, honey: doesn't it just SUCK?,"... "You won an Olympic Gold Medal?!, that BLOWS!"

	I guess you're right.

Before Keenan has lifted the wooden triangle rack,

Michelle HAMMERS the cue ball.

It CRACKS off the rack,

ROCKETS off the table,...

and CANNONBALLS Luke in the CROTCH.

Keenan, Michelle, and Janine ALL GASP.

Michelle lines up the cue ball again, as Luke considers,...

Max gets the upper hand, and pins Luke down to the ground.

Luke's surprised and embarrassed by his own words.

MINI-MART - LATER

Luke kneels in the aisle, stocking shelves, distracted, fidgety, distressed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He glances up at the magazine rack. A Female Fitness magazine catches his attention. The BEAUTIFUL COVER model seems to MOVE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at it: no movement.

<DIRECTION>
Luke approaches the rack, and flips over the magazine cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he steps away, he glances back at the rack,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CELEBRITY MAGAZINE COVER

The ADONIS on the cover comes to life. He rips off his shirt as he moves off one magazine cover and into another, where he passionately kisses the BIKINI-CLAD COVER MODEL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAGAZINE RACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MODELS AND OTHERS on half a dozen covers begin stripping down, moving to other magazines and making out with each other all across the rack.

	I don't know. But I believe there may be thousands of Z's out there, millions for all we know, go their whole lives without even knowing they are one. Nothing ever happens. You couldn't keep it from happening.

	Maybe for me too.

	Right now, you're Morphescent. The key is to have sex with another Z. You become Adulmorphic. Your gender locks. You can't just change anytime you want.

Luca demonstrates hockey technique, expertly guiding a hockey puck through an obstacle course of broken equipment, timber, and sawdust piles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the while, she dodges Max's attempts to steal the puck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max finally gets it, which riles Luca. She hip checks Max. They swerve to avoid a pipe, crash-landing on top of each other on a sawdust pile.

then as she grows more confident,...

her face REDDENS, she GASPS.

Luca pulls back, self-conscious, confused. She brushes sawdust off her dress, stands.
