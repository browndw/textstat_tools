INT. MIAMI UNIVERSITY - OXFORD OHIO - AUDITORIUM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stephen Meyers, Press Secretary to Governor Morris is standing at a podium on a stage...there is a single spotlight on him. The rest of the stage is dark. Stephen is talking into a mic with no emotion...just matter of factly.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am neither Christian...nor atheist. I am not Jewish or Muslim. What I believe...my religion is called the constitution...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. Stephen snaps his fingers in the mic. We hear the distinct sound of feedback getting louder until it stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the director speak over the loud speaker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang on...let me open these up....
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
We wait as Stephen looks around. He looks at stage hands who are busy working. No one pays any attention to him as he stands there. This isn't awkward for Stephen, THIS IS ROUTINE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Lights come up on another podium revealing a debate stage. Stephen continues.
</DIRECTION>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will defend till my dying breath your right to worship whatever god you believe in...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTION>
The lights on Stephen's podium go out, he's in the dark. He keeps going.
</DIRECTION>

His podium light comes back on. No answer from the Director, Stephen continues.

	<DIALOGUE>
	If I'm not experienced enough don't vote for me. If I'm not...

</STEPHEN>
<DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay got it, thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIRECTOR>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. We'll need these monitors turned up a bit...it's a big space and he wants to be able to hear.
	</DIALOGUE>
<STAGE_MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Also we'll need these podiums put on a riser as we agreed to in the pre-conditions. You're a few inches short and it makes it harder for the Governor to read his notes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<STAGE_MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No I know, we just got those specs last night and they're building a piece to go under...

<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great, thanks. See you guys in a few hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>

We see we're in an auditorium of a college. Stephen meets up with BEN HARPEN his staffer.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't know the Governor had trouble reading his notes. Why doesn't he wear...

<STEPHEN>

EXT. MIAMI UNIVERSITY - OXFORD OHIO - DAY ROB BRAUN, a local Cincinnati anchor, talks to camera as we see STEPHEN and BEN exit the building. Under this we hear Rachel Maddow reporting.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL_MADDOW>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well it all comes down to this...We are one week away from the Ohio primary...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Camera now moves past ROB to another news truck where an MSNBC REPORTER stands in front of a camera waiting to go live. There is a monitor in front of him. The camera keeps moving into the monitor where RACHEL MADDOW does the lead in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As RACHEL's audio continues we see the following images.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. MIDDLE AMERICA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We cruise along a snow-covered rural landscape - flat, gray, desolate. In the distance we see a barn with huge red-white- and-blue letters painted on the side. They read "OHIO FOR MORRIS".
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two democrats are left standing. Senator Pullman of Arkansas who is trailing Governor Morris from Pennsylvania.

Moments later we roll past another farm with a large billboard staked into the ground beside the road: "PULLMAN - AMERICA'S FUTURE BEGINS ON MARCH 15th".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We cut to canvassers - bundled to the hilt against the cold - knocking on doors in a suburban neighborhood. Yard signs for both candidates line the street.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL_MADDOW>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Governor Morris has mounted a sizable lead with 2047 delegates, winning New Hampshire, California, New York and Michigan...But Senator Pullman with 1302 delegates is still in the hunt having won Florida, Tennessee, Virginia and Missouri...

EXT. CITY INTERSECTION

<DIRECTION>
Supporters at an intersection waving hand-made signs to cars: "HONK FOR MORRIS". A passing car lays on the horn and the supporters cheer.

	<DIALOGUE>
	So one week from Tuesday the all important hundred and eighty one Ohio delegates could be the deciding factor..

We see Satellite trucks, press vehicles, police cars, etc. At a catering truck, MOLLY STEARNS, a 19 year old intern grabs a tray of coffees and a box of doughnuts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We stay on her as she runs across the street and through a door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: INT. MIAMI UNIVERSITY - RAPID RESPONSE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOLLY enters and we follow her through the campaign war room, it's the size of a coffin, jammed to the hilt with twenty- something staffers manning laptops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're in the hustle and bustle of a live telecast. We see multiple angles of the telecast...

</SENATOR_PULLMAN>
<GOV_MORRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then let me try and clarify...I was raised Catholic, I am not a practicing Catholic...I have no idea what happens when you die and if the Senator does, then perhaps he should be President. I'll even vote for him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOV_MORRIS>
<DIRECTION>
The audience laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<SENATOR_PULLMAN>

MOLLY passes out coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: INT. MIAMI UNIVERSITY - AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS We're now live inside the debate.
</DIRECTION>
<GOV_MORRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me be more specific. I am neither a Christian, nor an atheist, I'm not Jewish or Muslim...what I believe...my religion is written on a piece of parchment called the Constitution. Meaning I will defend, till my dying breath, your right to worship, in whatever God or lack thereof you believe in, as long as it doesn't hurt others. I believe we should be judged as a government by how we take care of those who can't take care of themselves. That's my religion. If you feel that I'm not religious enough, then don't vote for me. If you feel I'm not experienced enough or tall enough then don't vote for me. Because I'm not going to change those to get elected.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOV_MORRIS>
<SENATOR_PULLMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just wanted you to say out loud if you believed in the teachings of the Bible.

<DIRECTION>
(ON MONITOR)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well Governor, whoever wins this contest will be running for President...and if you don't think that these questions won't be central in a general election then you are living in fantasy land. I applaud your honesty Governor, I do...I'm simply pointing to what is obvious...we are running for President of the United States...not for student council president.

INT. MIAMI UNIVERSITY - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS PAUL ZARA - Morris's campaign manager - is waiting in the wings off stage. STEPHEN sidles up next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the background we can see the candidates shaking hands. There is applause.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAUL is pushing fifty with the grizzled look of a hardened campaign veteran. He's Stephen's boss, the only guy between him and Governor Morris.

Arms crossed, they watch their man on stage.

We hear the announcer thanking everyone for attending the debate. TOM DUFFY - campaign manager of the rival Pullman Campaign - is also watching from the wings. Duffy's smooth, calculated and icy. He walks over to Stephen and Paul.
</DIRECTION>
<DUFFY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm trying to remember if the democrats ever nominated an atheist before...

<IDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's gonna happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Us by nine.

<IDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nine? There's no way you'll win by nine.

	At least. Maybe more.

	Certain? No. Confident? Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEPHEN>
<IDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just said you'll win by nine.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I think we will, but I won't tell you it's a sure thing. Fucking Saint Gabriel can blow his horn on election day and get his four horseman to rig the ballot boxes for Pullman and it wouldn't surprise me. Don't get me wrong. Six presidentials I've done and I've never felt this good. But am I gonna sit here and say "Yes -we will definitely win Ohio"? Not a chance. In the last thirty years seventy-three Democrats have run for president. How many have won? Three. That means seventy guys ran who thought they had a chance, and they all lost.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IDA>
<IDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're saying there's a good chance you won't win.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IDA>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't twist my words. What I'm saying is that I'm not going to promise we'll win. But he's decorated by Bush Senior from the first Gulf war and protested the second. He left his state with a balanced budget and the fourth highest education rate. The Republicans have nobody out there that can touch this guy...so for this moment, this election, this primary is the presidential. And that Ida, is the state of the union. And on that note, I'm gonna take a shit.

I don't care whether he leads in the polls...I don't care whether he has all the tools...Because the truth is, he's the only one that's going to make a difference in peoples lives...Even the people that hate him. If Mike Morris is President it says more about us than it does about him. I don't give a fuck if he can win. He has to win.

	Or what? The world will fall apart? It won't matter...Not one bit to the everyday lives of everyday fuckers who work and eat and sleep and get up and go back to work again. If your boy wins...You get a job in the white house...If he loses you're back at a consulting firm on K Street...That's it. You used to know that before you got all goosebumpy about this guy.

	That Pullman's negatives are high...mid forties. Senator we have an open seat in the White House and the Republicans don't have dick. They're disorganized and they can't find a nominee that isn't a world class fuck up. They look like Democrats. No Republican is gonna show up to vote for their guy. But if Pullman gets the Democratic nod they'll show up to vote against him.

You play them all like they're pieces on a chess board. And you make it look effortless. We both know how much work it takes, constantly being on guard, weighing every word so carefully, every move. But from the outside, you make it look easy. People are scared of you because they don't understand how you do it, and they love you for it.

CHARLIE ROSE and GOV. MORRIS mid-interview...

<GOV_MORRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it a difficult decision? I would have to believe that it is... would I do it? No... but I can't see myself... or anyone... certainly not a government, telling a woman what she can do with her body.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOV_MORRIS>
<CHARLIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you would appoint a judge to...
	</DIALOGUE>
<GOV_MORRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I would consider it arrogant to judge someone until I've walked in their shoes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHARLIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you're against the death penalty?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GOV_MORRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Because of what it says about us as a society.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE_ROSE>
<CHARLIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suppose Governor it was your wife...

	And she was murdered, what would I do.

	It gets more complicated when it's personal.

</GOV_MORRIS>
<GOV_MORRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure...well if I could get to him I'd find a way to kill him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOV_MORRIS>
<CHARLIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you, you Governor would impose the death penalty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE_ROSE>
<GOV_MORRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I would commit a crime for which I would happily go to jail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GOV_MORRIS>
<CHARLIE_ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why not let society do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GOV_MORRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because society has to be better than the individual. If I were to do that I would be wrong.

</STEPHEN>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No Stephen. You didn't make a mistake. You made a choice. You called me and left a message to call back...that it was important. But when I did...you said to forget about it. You chose not to tell me. Why did you make that choice?
	</DIALOGUE>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't think it was important.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAUL>
<PAUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure you did. But you went because you were curious, because you were flattered. Because it made you feel special to think Duffy wanted to speak to you instead of me. Because you thought to yourself: maybe I can get something out of this. Because it made you feel big. First campaign I ran tiny little race in Kentucky -state senate seat. Workin for redneck nobody named McGuthrie. Had no money, no staff, no fuckin office. Everyone thought we didn't stand a chance. There's no way we can compete. And about this time, a guy running a congressional campaign a few districts over gives me a call. Says, "I really like what you were able to do for poor ole' Sam. But let's face it, he's a goner, so why don't you come work for me?" What do I do? Well Stephen -this is where you and I are different. I told Sam about the call. And Sam says to me, "Paul, you think this other's guy's got a shot at winning, and he can pay you more than anything I can afford, so if it's what you feel you need to do, then I won't get in your way." So I say, "Sam -you took a chance and hired me when I was even more of nobody than you are, and I'd be damned if I'm gonna jump ship just because the shit hit the fan." We lost the race, but three years later, when Sam decided to run for Governor -who do you think he called? We won that race. And twenty years later I'm where I am now.

	Put yourself in my shoes Steve. Your opponent has the best media mind in the country working on his team. What do you try to do? You either try to hire him yourself, or work it so if you can't have him, the other team can't either. This was a win-win situation for me. You work for us -great. Paul doesn't have you. Then again, if Paul fires you and I don't take you -fine - Paul still doesn't have you. Either way I win. The moment I got you to sit down in that chair, I knew I'd won.

As these questions continue, the Governor's cell phone vibrates. He pulls it from his pocket and reads the name of the caller. It reads "Molly." He looks up. Panic starts to set in - the only sounds we hear are his heart beating and the phone vibrating. The Governor looks at each of his staff members. Then he scans around the room looking through the press corps up to the back doorway where he locks eyes with Stephen.

THEN:

<GOV_MORRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why would she leave a note that could only do that?

<GOV_MORRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
<STEPHEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul's gone today. I set a meeting with you and Thompson where you promise him the ticket. You get three hundred and fifty-six pledged delegates, you get North Carolina, and then you take office and make right what so many have made wrong. All the things we both believe in.

<GOV_MORRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay let's play this out. You're not wearing a wire because everything you've suggested is illegal...and you wouldn't fare well in federal prison. You were fucking her and she told you about her situation. There are no records or conversations between us. And since she's had an abortion, no DNA evidence. So if there's no note, then it's your word against mine. Your word. A fired, disgruntled, employee, or a sitting governor...There's no note.

	Senator Thompson I am honored to stand here today with you. I am humbled by your kind words, thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, today marks the beginning of a fight between two sets of ideals. Either we're going to move forward or were going to live in the past... Either we're going to lead the world in technology, or we are going to bury our heads in the sand... the sands of Saudi Arabia...the sands of Iraq! Either we're going to let greed and corruption ruin our industries and our shorelines or we are going to take back our country! We are not a nation used to coming in second or third...

The CAMERAMAN makes adjustments.

A MAN sweeping the gym floor in the distance. They all seem to be staring at him. They probably aren't - but he feels it. The enthusiasm and excitement of Stephen has given over to emptiness. The price of winning at all cost.

We stay on Stephen's face.

We now hear the Governor's speech through Stephen's earwig.

<GOV_MORRIS>
