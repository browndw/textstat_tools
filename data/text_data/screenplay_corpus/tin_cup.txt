TINNY CHEATIN' HEART MUSIC, the dull GROAN of a TRACTOR, CRICKETS CHIRPIN' love songs, sporadic ZAPS from BUG LIGHTS, and an occasional random THWOCK as we --

FADE IN:

<DIRECTION>
EXT. TEXAS - DRAMATIC ANGLE - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>

Out west where the sun descends gloriously over desolate mountains. A sense of timeless and incorruptible beauty if you ignore the TWANG of the MUSIC, the SPUTTER of the TRACTOR, the ZAPS, the THWACKS... and something else...

EXT. DRIVING RANGE - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man, JOSE, is on the roof, wrestling with a rickety satellite dish, stringing wire, trying to get it to work. (We get glimpses of him throughout the scene as he struggles with what is assuredly a pirate operation.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Four of six floodlights nailed to the roof cast pools of yellow into the gathering darkness. ROY "TIN CUP" McAVOY stands under the swarm of moths crowding the brightest light, hitting golf balls. THWOCK...! Launching them, really, into the deepening night. There's a beer between his legs. Behind him:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of men forms a semicircle, facing away from Tin Cup. These men are the range regulars: CURT, CLINT, EARL, and DEWEY. Each man has money in one hand and his preferred libation in the other. They're all looking back and forth between the bug lights hung on the back wall, and muttering what sounds like bets to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROMEO POSAR -- a smaller man, he stands at the center of the group with a handful of cash. Romeo is a part-time bookie and full-time driving range man. Born across the river in Mexico, Romeo is Tin Cup's caddie, confidante, best friend.
</DIRECTION>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, all bets are down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes rivet on the bug lights, edgy, hopeful, until... ZAP! A BUG is ELECTROCUTED. And Dewey cheers triumphantly while the other regulars mutter curses about how they woulda, coulda, shoulda bet.
</DIRECTION>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Number one is the winner! Dewey has the winner. Pays five to two!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMEO>
<DIRECTION>
Romeo quickly pays Dewey and more quickly takes money from the losers. It's fast-paced, inane, time-killing gambling. Tin Cup looks over.
</DIRECTION>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you shitheels ever get bored?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>

The regulars flap dismissive palms and mutter in the negative as they turn back to Romeo and the action at the bug lights.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Dewey. I'm the one asking the riddle. I already know the answer. I don't getta guess. Although... We could say if I get to five hundred bounces and no one gets the riddle, I get the pot. And I know what you're thinking. It's an impossible riddle. Well, It's not. It's an easy riddle. And if somehow by the grace of fluke luck I win, and you all don't agree it was an easy riddle, hell, I'll refund your money.

	Okay, a man's driving down the road with his son and they get in a crash. Two ambulances come and take the man and his son to different hospitals. Son goes into the operating room, the doctor looks at him and says, 'I can't operate on this boy. He's my son.' How's that possible?

Tin Cup begins bouncing a ball on the face of his wedge.

	Father didn't sneak back in, right? He's still at the other hospital?

That eliminates the most plausible theory in their minds. The men think harder.

The regulars puzzle some more.

	Give us a little hint.

</CLINT>
<MOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The doctor's a woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
All heads turn to take in the arrival of:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOLLY GRISWOLD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing just inside the door -- she's a fresh-faced beauty in her early thirties, and she's got all new everything the sport of golf requires: new bag, new clubs, new shoes, new clothes, new visor... she looks like she stepped out of an ad in Golf Digest. And all the men are asking themselves the same question: what's she doing here? The silence invites Molly to supply the riddle's answer.
</DIRECTION>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The doctor is the son's mother. Feminists pose the riddle to reveal how deeply our sexual stereotypes run.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(directly to Tin Cup)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I take it you're a feminist?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
Tin Cup misses the ball he's been bouncing, breaking the spell. The regulars wait for Tin Cup's response.
</DIRECTION>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ma'am, I've been called a lot of things -- but no one's ever saddled me with that one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You might try being saddled sometime -- the smell of leather, the sting of a whip...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
The regulars snicker, enjoying her one-upmanship.
</DIRECTION>
<TIN_CUP>
<DIRECTION>
(slightly taken aback)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just a humble golf pro...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're Roy McAvoy the golf pro? I pictured something... different. I have a seven o'clock lesson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought I had a Doctor Griswold at seven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<DIRECTION>
They hurry out to the range, Tin Cup oblivious to his gaffe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the regulars gather to look out the window --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR POV - THROUGH WINDOW

To the range, where Molly is stretching and Tin Cup is discreetly waving to the regulars to get lost.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
EXT. DRIVING RANGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lesson begins. Tin Cup can be slightly condescending in these situations, though she's got him a little wary.
</DIRECTION>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The first thing you gotta learn about this game, Doc, is it ain't about hitting a little white ball into some yonder hole. It's about inner demons and self-doubt and human frailty and overcoming all that crap. So... what kinda doctor'd you say you were?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a psychologist -- in layman's terms call me a neo-Jungian, post- modern Freudian, holistic secularist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<DIRECTION>
She begins unpacking one of her bags, pulling out every golf gimmick on the market -- swing aid straps to pull your elbows together, a ball pendulum that hangs from your hat, a metal contraption for your feet, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Inner demons and human frailty are my life's work. I used to practice in El Paso but I've moved here now...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're those?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ordered these from the Golf Channel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
He stares in disbelief as she tries to wriggle into some of this stuff. He's enchanted and dismayed.
</DIRECTION>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That stuff's a waste of money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure there are excesses and repetitions here, but I believe in the gathering of knowledge and I figured, well, there must be some truths about the golf swing illustrated by these devices -- and that you'd help me sort through it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
She stands there with contraptions coming from every limb.
</DIRECTION>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have dozens of golf videotapes, too... And a golf watch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<TIN_CUP>
<DIRECTION>
(irritated, impatient)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it off. All of it. Now! You're a smart woman, for Chrissakes -- don't you know the work of charlatans when you see it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<DIRECTION>
She deposits all the golf gimmick devices in a pile.
</DIRECTION>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I can always tell when someone is lying to himself, but I'm quite susceptible and frequently wrong when that person lies to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to the pile of devices)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That stuff cost me over 200 dollars --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then it's 200 dollars of shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<DIRECTION>
He tees a ball, hands Molly her driver and steps back.
</DIRECTION>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead. Take a swing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<DIRECTION>
Molly takes a pitty-pat swing and whiffs, and mutters under her breath with the ease of a longshoreman.
</DIRECTION>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw, fuck...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you talk like a golfer --
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<DIRECTION>
Molly unloads a mighty second swing. The club head bounces off the mat. The ball sits untouched.
</DIRECTION>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Fuck...' 'Shit...' these are highly technical golf terms and you're using them on your first lesson -- this is promising.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Awright, wise ass, show me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
Tin Cup takes the club from Molly, motions for her to step back, tees up a ball, and rockets a drive into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<DIRECTION>
He hands her back the club and tees up another ball. Molly just looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Impressive. Y'know, I tend to process things verbally. Can you break down into words how you did that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
Tin Cup takes a deep breath -- this is his speech.
</DIRECTION>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'What is the golf swing?' -- by Roy McAvoy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The golf swing is a poem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<TIN_CUP>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes a love sonnet and sometimes a Homerian epic -- it is organic and of a piece, yet it breaks down into elegant stanzas and quatrains. The critical opening phrase of this song is the grip, in which the hands unite to form a single unit by the simple overlap of the smallest finger...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(displays grip)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... held lightly, a conductor's baton.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(starts swing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lowly and slowly the clubhead is pulled back, led into position not by the hands but the body which turns away from the target, shifting to the right side without shifting balance. Tempo is everything, perfection unobtainable, as the body coils, now to the top of the swing, in profound equilibrium. And then a slight hesitation, a nod to the gods...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A nod to the gods?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To the gods, yes... that he is fallible. As the weight shifts back to the left pulled now by powers inside the earth -- it's alive, this swing, a living sculpture -- and down through contact, always down, into terra firma, striking the ball crisply -- with character -- a tuning fork goes off in your heart, your balls -- such a pure feeling is the well-struck golf shot -- And then the follow through to finish, always on line -- The reverse 'C' of the Golden Bear, the steelworker's power and brawn of Carl Sandburg's Arnold Palmer, the da Vinci of Hogan, the unfinished symphony of Roy McAvoy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? What's unfinished?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a short follow through -- my swing can look unfinished.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some say it's because that's the best way to play through the winds of West Texas... and some say it's because I never finish anything. You can decide. The point is every finishing position is unique as if that is the signature left to the artist, the warrior athlete who, finally and thereby, has asserted his oneness with and power over the universe by willing a golf ball to go where he wants and how and when, because that is what the golf swing is about...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(finally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is about gaining control of your life, and letting go at the same time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<DIRECTION>
Molly stares back, exhausted and intrigued.
</DIRECTION>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jeez Louise...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is only one other acceptable theory of how to hit a golf ball.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid to ask. What's the other theory?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grip it and rip it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	While I appreciate your poetic sensibility, Mr. McAvoy --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call me Roy, Molly...

	Call me Dr. Griswold...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<MOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roy... but at this point I think I'm more of the 'grip it and rip it' school. Hand me the driver.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
Tin Cup does. She tees it up.
</DIRECTION>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Waggle it, Doc, don't forget to waggle.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as she stares at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Waggle... the club head...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shows her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... it's a little relaxing ritual...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<DIRECTION>
She waggles the club head, then takes the club back.
</DIRECTION>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let the Big Dog eat!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<DIRECTION>
She stops, lets the club fall.
</DIRECTION>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What Big Dog?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The driver, the number one wood --
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's metal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, woods are metal -- don't worry about it -- and the driver's known as the Big Dog and I'm just saying to turn him loose, let 'er rip, let the Big Dog eat!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<DIRECTION>
She swings. Tops the ball. It goes ten feet.
</DIRECTION>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is, without a doubt, the stupidest, silliest, most idiotic grotesquery masquerading as a game that has ever been invented.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<TIN_CUP>

(cheerfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, ma'am, that's why I love it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if you hit one good shot -- if that tuning fork rings in your loin -- you can't wait to get back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<DIRECTION>
She cracks one dead solid perfect out into the night. It felt great and she knows it.
</DIRECTION>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think the Big Dog ate something.

<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did the tuning fork ring in your loin?

</TIN_CUP>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't go that far.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Always quit on a good shot. We'll call that lesson number one...

	... and if ya wouldn't mind paying me in cash -- there's a little I.R.S. situation I'm dealing with --
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<MOLLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you're such a legendary striker of the golf ball as everyone says, then why are you, at your age, out here in the middle of nowhere operating a barely solvent establishment, ducking the I.R.S., collecting a few pathetic dollars to buy your next sixpack -- when you're capable of so much more?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOLLY>

Her speech is delivered without judgement or rancor, so matter of factly that he's disarmed.

<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps I'm chocked full of inner demons?

enter this holy of holies with complete familiarity. And there she is -- DOREEN, 35, at least, the classic chesty, hippie, big-wigged Texas goddess. She's older than the other girls, and more experienced in every way. She's smoking a cigarette and finishing up the touches on her stripper's outfit.

	Cut the horseshit, guys. So... the one and two dogs always run wide and the three dog always breaks slow, so I figure there's gonna be a big ol' pile of fur at the turn and the three dog's gonna tiptoe around it and walk on home... I was right.

Tin Cup finally digs into his coat pocket and produces some official-looking papers. He hands them to her.

Doreen leans forward to examine the papers. She looks at Tin Cup with surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<DOREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is how you think you can settle up? By deeding me your driving range?

<TIN_CUP>

Simms removes Tin Cup's hand from the seven iron and grabs the club, stepping up to address the ball. Tin Cup mutters to the gallery.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Two-fifteen to carry, and the tour star's laying up.

if reconsidering.

<DIRECTION>
Tin Cup steps up to hit the shot. McCord lowers his voice.

<McCORD>

Tin Cup swings, and:

But on the other side of the river's a million dollars, and on this side of the river there's a rowboat. I guess my question's this: What would possess the guy on shore to swim for it?

	Tight par five, out of bounds left... you don't want to hit driver.

Romeo pulls out the driver and he snaps it in half over his knee. He tosses the two halves on the ground near Tin Cup.
</DIRECTION>
<ROMEO>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ROMEO>
<DIRECTION>
Tin Cup looks at the two halves of his driver, curbing his anger, not giving Romeo the satisfaction of a reaction.

<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I changed my mind. Gimme the three wood.

Romeo pulls out the three wood, snaps it over his knee, and tosses the halves on the ground next to the driver halves. Tin Cup turns with amusement to his playing partners, lest they think management has lost the upper hand with labor.
</DIRECTION>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess I'm going with the safe shot, boys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIN_CUP>
<DIRECTION>
Tin Cup reaches for the two iron, studies it a moment, frowns, and then:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He snaps it over his knee. He dumps these halves on the ground with the halves of the driver and three wood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Romeo stares, aghast. Tin Cup merely shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes I fan that two iron. Better gimme the three.

Romeo warily hands Tin Cup the three iron. Tin Cup looks at it, frowns, then:

He snaps it over his knee and tosses it on the ground.

</TIN_CUP>
<DIRECTION>
He drops the three iron halves with the other halves, and steps past Romeo and sequentially yanks all but the seven iron from his bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He snaps them over his knee, one by one, citing the crimes of each club with mounting absurdity and ire.
</DIRECTION>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I've hooked my four iron...

<DIRECTION>
He snaps the putter in half and dumps it in the pile of
</DIRECTION>

broken clubs at his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, he reaches for the last club in his bag, the seven iron. The regulars hold their breath, thinking this is the end of Tin Cup's Open bid. But...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tin Cup smiles and caresses the seven iron affectionately.
</DIRECTION>
<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the seven iron, I never miss the seven iron. It's the only truly safe club in my bag.

He moves to the tee, drops a ball, and hits it down the middle with the seven iron.

Roy "Tin Cup" McAvoy is wearing every gimmick that Molly first arrived with -- plus many more. He wears a pendulum cap, his arms are strapped together, a curious triangular coat hanger type contraption connects his elbows, there's a neck brace, an ankle anchor, an arrow attachment to his left hand, a bucket for right foot, he swings a collapsible club... and a BEGINNERS GOLF VIDEO PROJECTS loudly from his VCR, so loudly that he never heard her knocking.

Tin Cup limbers up, trying not to be in awe of the real legends who line the practice range, hitting beautiful shot after beautiful shot with graceful ease.

Tin Cup tries to get warm quickly, taking a few hurried practice swings. The early tee times are strictly for the longest of long shots, and almost nobody is around.

	If anyone was ever to make a run at what is the most storied number in Open history, Miller's sixty- three, it would be today when the rain has softened the greens, enabling the players to take dead aim at the flags. Still, the unswerving courage of an unknown driving range pro from Salome has raised that humble journeyman from the ashes of an ignominious eighty-three to wave a mighty fist at the pantheon of golf's immortals. This man, this Roy McAvoy has laid siege to the record book by birdieing the first seven holes. A brave par from the water at eight, and a glorious birdie three at the daunting twelfth, another at thirteen...

	It's not difficult to talk... it's difficult to explain... I coulda laid up and still won. I made a twelve on the last hole of the U.S. Open. You know how much money that cost me?

He looks up and there's Molly -- He stops short. They embrace.

<TIN_CUP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Molly, I'm an idiot. I gave away the Open. The one time in my life I know the play is to hit the lay up -- my whole life and future and career on the line, and I still can't make myself do it. I am a twisted human being and a cautionary tale. And I guess I'm a fool?
