THE OPENING MUZAK STRAINS OF A "KARAOKE SONG TO BE DETERMINED"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KARAOKE BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: KATE HANNAH -- late-20s, pretty and wholesome and, oh yeah, piss drunk. She stands on a tiny
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KARAOKE STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in the far corner of a half-empty dive bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate holds a MICROPHONE and dances as she SINGS a bad karaoke version of "SONG TO BE DETERMINED." What Kate lacks in talent she more than makes up for with charm and enthusiasm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At a table near the stage is --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- CHARLIE HANNAH: Kate's husband, late-20's, scruffy but handsome, also pretty damn drunk. He enthusiastically claps and points to Kate, making up a cheering section along with --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- OWEN HANNAH -- Charlie's younger brother, early-20's -- who sings along with --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the small but energetic CROWD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate begins to ramble between verses -- and gleefully points to Charlie and Owen. For the moment, this drunk girl is the Queen of Karaoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate finishes the song and drunkenly tumbles off the stage to join Charlie and Owen.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was so good, baby!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bullshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm serious. You sing like an angel -- a drunk angel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Owen and Kate LAUGH.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you were writing about my performance for your blog, what would you say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd say that, uh...my wife is the sexiest, most amazing woman alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That would be such a shitty article -- nobody would read it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate and Charlie laugh and kiss -- and then Kate glances at Owen and makes a puppy dog face.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (to Owen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw...we need to find you a lady, Owen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<OWEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah -- I've been trying to flirt with the bartender, but...I can't tell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWEN>
<DIRECTION>
Owen motions to the --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- FEMALE BARTENDER, early 20's.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's hot! What can't you tell?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<OWEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She looks like she could kick my ass. No way would she go for a guy like me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWEN>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're being a little girl -- just go talk to her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<OWEN>
<DIRECTION>
(clearly shy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know...forget about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWEN>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(not going to take "no" for an answer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take point -- follow me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate stumbles to the bar. Charlie and Owen follow. Kate puts her arms around Owen and gets the attention of the bartender.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to buy a gimlet for me and a double-shot of whiskey for my brother-in-law `cause he's had a hard week.

The bartender quickly pours the drinks.

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's fifteen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEMALE_BARTENDER>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait -- don't you wanna know what happened to him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
The bartender rolls her eyes and checks around the bar to see if there are other customers. It's pretty dead -- so she listens.
</DIRECTION>
<FEMALE_BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
(unenthused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEMALE_BARTENDER>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He just got back from England -- because he went there for a girl! A preppy, bitchy girl. Diane Court...that was her name. He loved her so much that he went with her because she had a fellowship or something. He gave up being a kickboxer. A kickboxer!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sad)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And she dumped him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
The bartender sizes up Owen. The trio waits with anticipation to hear her response, which is --
</DIRECTION>
<FEMALE_BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Owen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You kickbox?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEMALE_BARTENDER>
<OWEN>
<DIRECTION>
(caught in the headlights)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWEN>
<DIRECTION>
And...that's all Owen's got.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(jumping in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he teaches kids at the kickboxing studio. Oh, they're so cute!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
The bartender glances back to Owen.
</DIRECTION>
<OWEN>
<DIRECTION>
(finally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A lot of `em don't have parents -- so...it's kinda more than just a teacher/student thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know it sounds silly, but I feel responsible for them -- like...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(emotional)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I could be their parent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWEN>
<DIRECTION>
Kate slides down the bar to Charlie.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(hushed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I got him laid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She seems totally game.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure she just didn't want to get into your pants?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate rolls her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'm done for the night.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?

<DIRECTION>
Owen wanders over, dejected.
</DIRECTION>
<OWEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's seen "Say Anything."

<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eh, well...what're you gonna do, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wanna drive us home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- he needs to keep working it! You guys stay here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to watch my brother not score. I want to go to bed with you and...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(whispered into Kate's ear)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be home when you get there. We can "you know" then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<OWEN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Charlie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, man -- you don't have a job to wake up for in the morning or anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWEN>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Writing is a job! Not having to report to an office only makes work harder.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Kate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baby, you drank a lot. I think Owen should take us home -- you're too drunk to drive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So's Owen.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly focused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not that drunk. Besides, you know I focus when I drive -- it sobers me up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell that to the cops.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate kisses Charlie and hugs Owen.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Charlie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you, baby. I'll be waiting for you in a nice warm bed. You have exactly one mission: get your brother laid -- and don't talk to any other women.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That sounds like two missions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's just one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Owen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It kinda sounded like two, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<OWEN>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWEN>

Kate grins and slowly backs away towards the door.

EXT. KARAOKE BAR - PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate stumbles out of the bar and hears a GROAN. She glances over and sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A drunk woman -- FREDA, 30s -- sitting on the curb. She MOANS again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate glances around the parking lot. Nobody else but her and Freda.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FREDA>
<DIRECTION>
(quick)

	Um...sure.

<FREDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good.

(whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I'm not really okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDA>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FREDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My bitch sister just took off and left me here so she could hook up with some asshole. Now what am I supposed to do? Huh? I don't have a car here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDA>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess I could...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FREDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll give me a ride? Oh my god! Thank you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDA>
<DIRECTION>
Freda gets up quickly -- and almost falls over.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was gonna say "call you a cab," `cause, you know -- I don't even know you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FREDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not far. Please? Pretty please...?
	</DIALOGUE>

Kate looks dismayed. Not sure what to do.
</DIRECTION>

CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. SUBARU (MOVING) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car passes through Chinatown on its way downtown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate drives with Freda in the passenger seat. Freda glances down at the floor and notices a FLASK.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, you shouldn't drink and drive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDA>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FREDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just kidding. Can I have a sip?

</FREDA>

Kate's speechless.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm really thirsty.

</FREDA>
<KATE>

	It's, uh...whiskey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FREDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck yeah, it's whiskey! I love whiskey. You're the real thing, huh? A hardcore drinking bitch like me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDA>
<DIRECTION>
Freda takes a swig from Kate's flask.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FREDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I smoke in your car?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDA>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(slightly annoyed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, fine -- go ahead. Can you just roll down the window?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FREDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course -- I'm not uncivilized.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDA>
<DIRECTION>
Freda takes out a --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- CRACK PIPE and lights it, deeply inhaling crack smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(in disbelief)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHOA!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate immediately pulls the car over.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not what I thought you meant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FREDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want a hit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDA>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I...is that pot?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FREDA>
<DIRECTION>
(as though it's a ridiculous question)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course not! What do I look like? A stoner? It's crack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDA>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, shit! No...no thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FREDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon -- it's good crack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDA>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't, um...I've never smoked crack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FREDA>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? This stuff is the truth -- and it'll sober you up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDA>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh...I think you should go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FREDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not getting out in the middle of nowhere. Do you know what could happen to me all alone out here at night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDA>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know -- people might offer you crack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FREDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seriously? It's not a big deal -- just take a little hit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDA>
<DIRECTION>
Kate and Freda stare at each other. A stand-off.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<FREDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One hit won't hurt you. It'll sober you up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDA>
<DIRECTION>
Kate glances at the pipe, which Freda wiggles in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<FREDA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (high-pitched cartoon voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smoke me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FREDA>
<DIRECTION>
Kate LAUGHS.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One puff. Then we are both going home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Freda nods. Long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Freda puts the pipe into Kate's lips and lights it. Kate sucks in crack smoke. Her eyelids flutter.

</FREDA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOWNTOWN - STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Near some TENTS, CARDBOARD BOXES, and SHOPPING CARTS --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Kate smokes crack with FREDA and TWO OLDER MEN. They pass around TWO PIPES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freda is passed out on a SLEEPING BAG on the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate is animatedly telling a story to the two guys -- who're still smoking crack.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(mile-a-minute fast)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...'cause I feel like I understand what it's like to be homeless, ya know? I mean, if you didn't know me, if we hadn't connected tonight, you might think: "There's some upper-middle-class, NPR listening, self-congratulatory, insulated, lazy liberal bitch. Probably never had to worry about anything." But that's not true at all! I grew up poor, man. Single mother. McDonald's used to have one day a week where they sold 29 cent hamburgers, and another day where they had 39 cent cheeseburgers. My mom and me would go there and she'd get twenty burgers -- that was the limit, probably set up for folks just like us -- and then she'd put `em in the freezer and we'd microwave `em for dinner throughout the week. I was kinda overweight until high school, to be perfectly honest. Eating used to be my thing. When I started drinking, though, I kinda stopped eating so much.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(back on track)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But anyway, the point is: You and me, we're not so different.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
The two guys aren't paying much attention to Kate. They're more concerned with their crack pipe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOWNTOWN - SIDEWALK - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate is asleep on the curb. She looks awful. Suddenly, Kate's eyes widen. She looks around at her surroundings, confused, then jumps to her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOWNTOWN - STREETS - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate runs through the streets.

We TRACK along with Kate as she dashes past various buildings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOWNTOWN - STREET - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We stare down a long, empty street, the downtown SKYSCRAPERS towering in the distance. From out of nowhere --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Kate appears at the end of the street and sprints towards the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LEGEND APPEARS OVER THE IMAGE OF KATE RUNNING:
</DIRECTION>

INT./EXT. SUBARU (MOVING) - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate drives -- a paranoid expression on her face and her hands tightly gripping the steering wheel. She glances down at --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- her CELL PHONE in the passenger seat. 21 missed calls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She passes various sites on her way from downtown to Highland Park.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate takes a right on a STREET and then pulls into the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PARKING LOT AT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's about to get out, but then notices...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...the FLASK on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FEW MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate chugs what's left in the flask.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS THE PARKING LOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. DAVIES -- the assistant principal, early-40's, slightly nerdy but not bad looking, watches --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Kate drink in her car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHILDREN pass by in the distance.

Mr. Davies takes a beat, but instead of saying anything he walks away through the parking lot.

Kate doesn't notice she's been seen.

On the chalkboard are the letters: "AN"

Kate stops suddenly and raises her hand to her mouth. She quickly runs behind her desk, leans over, and discretely --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- VOMITS on the floor!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ramon -- who's just inches from the pool of vomit -- looks horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate glances up from behind her desk to see --

INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate walks down the hall and comes to the door of her classroom. Through the glass she sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Mr. Davies. He notices Kate and smiles (the concerned smile you give someone right after they've publicly embarrassed themselves).
</DIRECTION>

Kate mouths the words --
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(silent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
-- and gestures "come here."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Davies gestures to the class that he'll be right back -- before he walks out to talk to Kate. He's got a slightly nervous demeanor -- somewhere between "I never became comfortable talking to women" and Asperger's.
</DIRECTION>

<KATE>

<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit! And we answered "yes" to like every question and at the end it was like, "If you answered `yes' to any of these you're an alcoholic!"
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(nostalgic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...that was fun, wasn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>

Kate smiles and nods.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey --

<DIRECTION>
Charlie gestures to the street.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- look out for that crack!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate looks down but sees nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What crack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, sorry -- I thought there was a crack there...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(grins)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...but you must have smoked it last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate rolls her eyes -- and then jokingly swerves towards Charlie, trying to knock him over. He LAUGHS and speeds away. Kate chases after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While an old 70's R & B song plays on a RECORD PLAYER, which is next to STACKS AND STACKS OF RECORDS --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Kate and Charlie drunkenly slow dance, drink WINE, and LAUGH at an AA PAMPHLET.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Have you missed days of work or school because of drinking?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Do you envy people who can drink without getting into trouble?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Envy isn't exactly the right word...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Do you have `blackouts'?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but who doesn't?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Has your drinking caused trouble at home?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! We're great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Definitely. But we still had a lot of "yes" answers.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(refers to pamphlet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yep...we still qualify as drunks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna go!

</KATE>
<CHARLIE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, right.

</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- I'm serious! I'm gonna go. What time is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate gets up.

<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See ya.

<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(doesn't believe her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate takes a big sip of wine.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(quite serious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is me: going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie LAUGHS -- he doesn't buy it.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been boozing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So? You should come too!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie LAUGHS.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, right. You can't go to AA wasted. It's like a rule or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah? Watch me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MEETING HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An AA meeting is in progress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An OLDER WOMAN stands at the podium sharing her story.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is filled with --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- different groups of PEOPLE, all of whom sit with their "own group," like a high school lunch room -- but the people are adults. There are distinct groups of --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- "PRETTY WOMEN" --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- "OBSESSIVELY TATTOOED PEOPLE" --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- "BUSINESSMEN" --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and "HIPSTERS."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Kate -- who's slightly confused -- enters the building, a hip looking man -- DONOVAN, 30's -- stops her, extending his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I'm Donovan. Welcome.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi Donovan -- I'm Kate!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Donovan "shushes" Kate.
</DIRECTION>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must be a newcomer, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um, I'm not really allowed to talk to new chicks, but there are lots of women here who can help you out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I just sit wherever?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DONOVAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The meeting already started so just try to find a spot anywhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONOVAN>
<DIRECTION>
Kate drunkenly stumbles to the back of the room, saying things like "sorry" and "I like that jacket" as she takes a seat next to two very CLEAN CUT WOMEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the woman at the podium continues to speak, the women next to Kate quietly try to welcome her.
</DIRECTION>
<LILY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you new?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILY>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To this? Yeah. Why's everyone whispering?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<SHANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's hard, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANA>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<LILY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything's going to be fine. You're home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILY>
<DIRECTION>
Kate doesn't respond -- just looks around with the fear anyone would have if they felt they had just accidentally joined Jim Jones' church.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is COMPLETELY FULL -- with over ONE-HUNDRED PEOPLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tattooed man stands at the podium.
</DIRECTION>
<TATTOO_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not to embarrass anyone, but so that we may get to know you better - - is there anybody here in their first thirty days of recovery?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TATTOO_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Several PEOPLE scattered throughout the room stand up and introduce themselves as alcoholics.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Kate. I...I'm...I guess I'm a little drunk right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
People burst into LAUGHTER.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want me to talk about my childhood or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<TATTOO_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(painfully polite)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, Kate, we actually ask that you don't share if you've had a drink or any mind-altering substance in the past 24 hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TATTOO_MAN>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(not listening)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can -- I kinda hate my dad and don't talk to him. And my mom...oh, man...I don't even know where to start. She's, like, stuck in the 80's and kind of a metalhead. Her last boyfriend called himself a drummer but really just gave drum lessons to little kids and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<TATTOO_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(tries to shut Kate up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome, Kate.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(forces a smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It gets better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TATTOO_MAN>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(not picking up the hint)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like drinking is the thing. I mean, I don't want to say you guys are wrong or anything...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate nervously LAUGHS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some of the PEOPLE in the crowd look embarrassed for Kate.
</DIRECTION>
<TATTOO_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you -- we're all here to help. We do have to move on, though.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TATTOO_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The woman next to Kate gets her to sit back down.
</DIRECTION>
<LILY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, sweetie -- there'll be plenty of time to tell your story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LILY>
<DIRECTION>
A young woman -- AMBER, 22 -- approaches the podium.
</DIRECTION>
<AMBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I'm Amber, alcoholic. I can't really believe that it's been five years. I mean, my life was a mess back then. Now I'm back in school, I have an amazing man, I love my parents -- it's crazy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMBER>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(way too loud)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How old is that girl?! Can she even go to bars?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Amber)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How old are you, Amber?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<SHANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be respectful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHANA>
<DIRECTION>
Kate seems surprised at being chastised.
</DIRECTION>
<AMBER>
<DIRECTION>
(gaining intensity)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um...okay? It's because I did the work. I got down on my knees and prayed every night! I went to a meeting everyday!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMBER>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyday?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<AMBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't easy, but I've gotta say, I owe everything to AA. Well, AA -- and God, of course!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMBER>
<DIRECTION>
The whole room APPLAUDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone is standing, holding hands, and saying the SERENITY PRAYER.
</DIRECTION>
<EVERYONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change -- courage to change the things I can - - and wisdom to know the difference.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVERYONE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	AMEN!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone turns and looks at Kate.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (embarrassed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay...I think I'm good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate quickly leaves the meeting as clumsily as she arrived.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate chugs frozen Margarita straight from a PITCHER.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So much for that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate and Charlie stand in their backyard, which is criss- crossed by WHITE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS and has some old LAWN FURNITURE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They drunkenly play CROQUET.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was it a bunch of old biker guys?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it was...I don't know. Enthusiastic people. A lot of really ENTHUSIASTIC PEOPLE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yuck -- I hate enthusiasm. I'm sorry it wasn't cool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie thinks for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't really imagine never drinking. I guess I don't have to, though --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- you're the one with the problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate nods in agreement.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey -- I love you. I don't want you to have to drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have to drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just really like to drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(sincere)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good -- `cause you're my favorite person to drink with in the whole damn world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie leans in to kiss Kate. They make out for a moment, and then Kate...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...BITES Charlie's lip. Charlie pulls back, shocked. Kate grins mischievously.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no you didn't!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie lunges at Kate, who dodges him and LAUGHS. Charlie dives and playfully tackles Kate. They begin to wrestle in the grass -- it's cute and loving but perhaps a little too intense.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate and Charlie are making out on the bed. Kate starts to unbutton Charlie's shirt. As it turns out, Charlie's extremely drunk (and it's apparent in his movements and voice).
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you trying to have some sex?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate removes Charlie's pants and takes off her clothing. She climbs on top of him and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- they start having sloppy, drunk sex.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a few beats, Kate notices that Charlie isn't moving. She looks down to discover that --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- he's passed out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate pauses for a moment...then continues to ride her unconscious husband.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate drinks what's left in the TEQUILA BOTTLE as she drunkenly searches the fridge, counter, and cupboard for more booze. She finds a few sips here and there at the bottom of a couple BEER BOTTLES -- but she seems frustrated that there isn't more alcohol in the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FEW MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate puts on her slippers, robe and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate drunkenly rides a BICYCLE down the street (still in her robe and slippers).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate tries to open the LOCKED glass fridge where the BEER is kept. After several attempts, she gives up and grabs TWO BOTTLES OF WINE from a shelf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate sets the bottles on the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CLERK -- a tired looking man in his 30's -- looks at Kate with pity.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I can't sell you this, Kate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
An ELDERLY MAN -- shopping for frozen food -- glances over at Kate.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? You can't tell I'm 21? Come on -- I'm in here all the time. You know me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I do, Kate. And I know you're old enough -- but it's too late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
The clerk holds up his WATCH (which reads 2:45).
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon -- we can just pretend it's before two...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate reaches down and tries to rewind the clerk's watch.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
(not amused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just a little wine. I'm not driving or anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so. Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
Kate gives him a big, flirty smile.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, dude -- I'll let you have a sip if you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate tries to do a "sexy" dance.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the law. I can't sell alcohol after 2 a.m. You know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you give it to me, then? That wouldn't hurt anything. A gift -- because we're friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could lose my job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
Kate doesn't have anything to say back -- so she glances at the Elderly Man in the frozen food section.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the elderly man; meant
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	to be a whisper, but way
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
too loud)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You distract him, okay?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
The elderly man puts up his hands, not wanting any part of it.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look -- why don't you get a bottle of water or a coffee or something instead?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Water or coffee? Fuck you. What -- just cause I won't suck your dick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
(had enough)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my god. Okay, enough -- you gotta go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
Kate doesn't budge.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seriously, Kate. You should go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate is hysterical and her eyes are starting to fill with tears.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is bullshit!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to pee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate runs down the aisle and tries to open the bathroom door - - but it's locked. She hides from view, and then squats down and begins to pull up her robe.
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck are you doing?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(caught)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't mean to! Sometimes I just have to pee really, really bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
(frustrated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get outta here NOW!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(pleads)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon...can't we drink together?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
The clerk clearly isn't going to budge. Kate nods, resigned, and then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...grabs a BOTTLE OF WINE and dashes out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. L.A. RIVER - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate is passed out on the concrete bank of the Los Angeles River. The empty bottle of (screw top) wine is next to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate's bicycle lays in some weeds nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bird SQUAWKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate slowly wakes up, confused, and in a zombie-like state she gets up and trudges home, wheeling along her bike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate is awakened by the deafeningly loud ALARM CLOCK and the sound of a news radio ANNOUNCER. She looks at the clock and realizes that --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- it's 7:30.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She jumps out of bed in a panic.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate pauses when she realizes her back is wet. She looks down at the bed, which is --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- COMPLETELY SOAKED.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (mumbled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Half-asleep, Charlie rolls over onto the pee-soaked part of the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come back to bed, baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to go to work. You snoozed my alarm again. I'm gonna be late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you peed on me so I guess we're even.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a weak bladder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...I can't go to work like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You work from our kitchen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but changing the sheets is my real job.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey -- where were you last night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I woke up at like 4 a.m. and you were gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where would I go at 4 a.m. alone? You must've been dreaming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate then glances down and notices --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- that HER FEET ARE COVERED IN DIRT AND GRASS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pauses, slightly alarmed, but continues getting ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - BATHROOM - STALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate's on her knees, puking into a toilet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FEW MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate exits the stall to find --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Principal Barnes standing by the door.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Kate and Charlie wander around Santa's Village --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- an abandoned Christmas-themed amusement park (with giant ginger bread houses, plastic Christmas trees, etc.) in the middle of the woods. Creepy and nostalgic at the same time. Looks like the set of a Christmas horror film.

Kate holds Charlie's hand as she leads him around.

Kate rolls her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So -- you dating anyone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(taken aback)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie seems relieved.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me either. Owen keeps trying to get me to be his "wing-man" and it's ridiculous and these girls in bars are so lame and I just keep thinking how I wish I was meeting you in a bar for the first time and I didn't come with any baggage and I could buy you a drink and flirt with you all night and ask for your number.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wanna go out sometime?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think it's a good idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie nods. Long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I fucked up, didn't I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate looks down, doesn't speak.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I did. I know I did. I had a beautiful woman who used to love me and now when I see her she doesn't even want to look me in the eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie, please don't do this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I miss you. I miss the way you taste and smell and...I miss things about you that used to drive me nuts! I miss you liking shitty 80's music and fake punk-rock from the 90's...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like shitty 80's music.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like good 80's music.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and all I want to do is touch you one more time to just, remember -- to make sure it was real.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Kate looks Charlie in the eyes and gives him a slight smile.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (changing course)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or...maybe I'm a just a delusional fucking idiot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM/KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate and Charlie walk in -- it looks sort of the same, but a number of items are missing, and it's messier. In general, the room looks more "dude."
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look really thin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When did you last eat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dunno -- like...I'm not sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(seems slightly concerned that he can't remember)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think, um...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should we order something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, yeah -- or I could make a bacon and egg sandwich...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I haven't really been doing the meat thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus. It starts with alcohol. Then meat.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you given up fun, too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate looks at Charlie -- he's half-smiling, not sure if she finds him funny.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (off Kate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. Bad joke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate cracks a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. Bacon and egg sandwiches. But I'm gonna make them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie raises his eyebrows.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate's at the stove, cooking bacon and eggs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie goes to the FRIDGE and gets a BOTTLE OF BEER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate glances at him.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie puts the beer back in the fridge.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care if you drink a beer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Whatever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(thinks about it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...I'm good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate stands by the stove and watches as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Charlie -- who sits at the kitchen table -- wolfs down the bacon and egg sandwich.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate seems pleased that Charlie enjoys it so much.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KATE & CHARLIE'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kate and Charlie play croquet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look a little tired -- like they've been playing a while. Kate seems to be much better than Charlie.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you been playing a lot?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't played in over a year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then how're you beating me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Innate talent?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
They keep playing.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't met anyone even vaguely interesting since we separated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um...stick to the game, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been masturbating like crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I miss you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could've been killed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Riding your bike -- drunk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I wasn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But is that really the point?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are trying to say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I worry about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I can understand that. I used to worry about you. But now I know you're okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That makes me happy...I mean, it fucking sucks that you're better off without me but I'm glad you're doing well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
No reply from Kate.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you move back in if I came to meetings?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should go for yourself, not to make me happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, would you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not moving back in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
That wasn't the response Charlie wanted to hear.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, I should go. It's gonna get dark soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can always turn the lights on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, would you at least...let me take you out on a date?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie seems hurt -- but still determined.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay...fine. 0 for 2.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(new direction)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last question: can we just...play one more game?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate doesn't answer.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon...you keep kicking my ass. It's embarrassing. You've gotta give me a chance to redeem myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(soft)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Kate thinks about it for a long beat, and doesn't say yes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...but she also doesn't say no.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a look of hope in Charlie's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
