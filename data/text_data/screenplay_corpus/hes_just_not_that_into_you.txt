EXT. PARK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We float down through a serene, leafy park to the children's play area. There, in the sandbox, a BEAUTIFUL FIVE YEAR OLD GIRL plays among a group of kids.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a theory about how this all started...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
A SIX YEAR OLD BOY approaches. He watches the little girl for a moment as she gently shapes her sand castle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then - out of nowhere - THE LITTLE BOY PUSHES THE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LITTLE GIRL DOWN.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_GIRL>
<LITTLE_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because you smell like dog poo.

Some of the other kids SNICKER at this brilliant one- liner. Our little girl's face turns red.

	You're so stupid just like dog poo! You're made of poo!

And then, just to punctuate, he JUMPS ON THE SANDCASTLE, smashing it. Finally, our little girl starts to CRY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

We see our little girl take this in, like she is just now beginning to understand the ways of the world.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you understand what this means? We are all encouraged to believe that if a guy acts like a total jerk -- that means he likes you. Sure, that's a lesson that might serve us as five year olds, but many of us keep believing this advice well into adulthood.

	I'm sure he forgot your hut number. Or didn't get enough approval from his father. Or was eaten by a giraffe.

This last part seems to cheer up the pretty woman.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do we say this stuff to each other? Why do we tell each other these lies? Is it possible that it's because we're too scared, and it's too hard, to say the one obvious truth that's staring everyone in the face?

	Only if you do. But I mean, if you have to get going I totally ...

Gigi trails off. Conor considers this for a LONG MOMENT. We can see on Gigi's face that she knows that the outcome of this date hangs in the balance. It's an eternity.

<CONOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Umm. OK. Sure. One more.

<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You set me up with him.

</GIGI>
<JANINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No - you asked if I knew any guys and I gave Conor your number. That's not a set up. When I do a set up - I weigh pros and cons. I do my due diligence. All I know about Conor is he sold us this house.

FADE TO CHAPTER CARD: ...IF HE'S NOT CALLING YOU
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AMBER, pretty if a little thick in the middle, sits in the courtyard of an office park in her work clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<AMBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Caller ID was the worst thing that's ever happened to me. Total invasion of my personal freedom. When a guy doesn't call me, it is my right - my duty even - to call him and hang up several thousand times. Or at least until his mother shouts at me in Albanian and blows a police whistle into the phone. I mean, calling and hanging up is an age old expression of love and frustration and too many wine coolers - and who is AT& f'ing T to take that away from me? Next thing you know, someone is going to ban me from sitting in my car in front of a guy's house, blaring "Where Is Your Heart" by Kelly Clarkson until his new stupid girlfriend comes outside and threatens to scratch my eyes out with her acrylics. I mean, a girl deserves freedom of expression, right?

	End. Why - does it matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<JANINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. "Nice meeting you" at the beginning of the date is normal. "Nice meeting you" at the end could be a blow off.

</JANINE>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it was at the beginning.

</GIGI>
<JANINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then that's fine. He's gonna call.

</JANINE>
<GIGI>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit. I can't remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>

Beth looks at Gigi, more sympathetic friend than boss.

Gigi laughs, but as she looks back to the notes, she seems confused. She turns to Janine, panicked, mouthing - "What does this say?". Janine looks - she's no help.

Gigi stares at the PHONE. Then she feigns disinterest in the phone. It still doesn't ring. Finally, she picks up the receiver to listen for a dial tone. And PANICS.

Alex stops what he's doing, looks up at her.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>

	Look, Kelli Ann - what happened between us the other night was - fun. But we're way understaffed tonight - I even have to man the bar - and that's why I scheduled you. To work. So...

In the back doorway leading to the alley, Alex stands chatting with TYRONE, 18, a busboy, who smokes a cigarette he holds just outside the doorway.

Kelli Ann approaches, trying to squeeze through, and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACCIDENTALLY (ON PURPOSE) SHOULDER BLOCKS ALEX. HARD. He has to take a step to catch his balance.

He turns around to see what happened, but Kelli Ann keeps walking eyes front. He and Tyrone share a look.

	See when I said "meeting someone" I guess that was kind of a broad term, kind of a wide interpretation of the word "meeting"-

Alex reaches for the phone.

</ALEX>
<GIGI>

<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or maybe he just didn't call because he has no interest in seeing you again.

	Yeah but my friend Terri once went out with this guy who never called and she totally wrote him off - then like a year later she ran into him --

	OK. But what if I'm the exception?

</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Always?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>

Gigi thinks this over.

I was so delusional about our relationship that I referred to him as my husband to random people like my dental hygenist. And all my friends would tell me stories about how things might work out with these dipshits because they knew someone who knew someone who dated a dipshit just like mine, and that girl ended up getting married and living happily ever after. But that's the exception. And we're not the exception - we're the rule.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
Gigi sits down, spent. But Beth has been listening.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK. So let me see if I understand. What you're saying is that when people tell me about some girl they know who dated a guy for thirteen years, and then he finally married her -- that's the exception. And the rule is that guys - like Neil - who are with girls - like me - for seven years without getting married - are never getting married.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
Beth is serious. Gigi freezes, tries to backtrack.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No, no, no. That's not what I'm saying. This has absolutely nothing to do with you. I was just talking, you know, about me. Specifically.

Off Beth, knowing it's about her, too.

<DIRECTION>
Anna and MARY, beautiful but doesn't know it, sit in side by side pedicure chairs. Anna holds a BUSINESS CARD.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is impossible not to like this guy. I'm pretty sure he was heavily flirting with me outside Eddie's, and then he tells me he's married. You'd think I'd be pissed, but I literally could not stop myself from liking him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he's married.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I realize that. I keep trying to force myself to picture him in some church saying vows to some woman, and even that doesn't cool it off. What is my problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK. There was this guy who worked in my dad's printing business. Married for fifteen years to a nice lady. And then he meets this woman at some church event. And he told my dad he just had never felt anything like it before. I mean, he had finally met the love of his life. So, he divorced his wife, and he's been with this other woman for 22 years and they are blissfully happy. I mean, what if you meet the love of your life - but you already married someone else? Are you supposed to pass them by?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<ANNA>

	You're right. I'm calling him.

Anna waits for a response. On the other end she hears some rustling, some silence, definitely awkwardness.

	Look, I just...I can't Anna. You seem great. It's just - I don't know. I should go. Take care.

Anna takes this in - STUNNED. She hangs up. Her eyes sting. She can't face Mary so she just stares at weird, bleached out photos of nails and HOLDS BACK THE TEARS.

Finally, she looks at her cell phone and dials again.

She bangs him on the head with a pillow.

	Well, I sound like a jackass if I say you're all four. But you're so obviously all four. Especially sexy.

</NEIL>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, you can't keep being nice to me and I can't keep pretending like this is something that it's not. We've been together over seven years. You know me. You either want to marry me or you don't.

</NEIL>
<BETH>

AMY sits with a sleeping baby in her arms.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was with Damon for six years. He asked me to marry him on the phone, because he's just so different and cool like that. Said he'd eventually get me a ring, which he didn't, but he did buy himself a ring because isn't that so hilarious and cool that the guy is wearing the ring? Then, my favorite part is, I stayed with him even after he took back his proposal, and introduced the idea of a "relation vacation." Isn't that a cute name? Let me explain the concept: it involves dating a girl from the time she's thirty two to the time she's thirty nine, possibly robbing her of the ability to bear children, and then, after all that, wanting to take a year off. And giving it a fun name that you can put on t-shirts.

<ALEX>

	Lemme guess - he said the only thing happy about this hour is you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He may have used some derivative of that. So, he says he's going to call, but then gave me his card and --

<ALEX>

	He's not interested.

<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. But the thing is, I honestly think he's expecting my call. He said "Look forward to hearing from you" and not "Look forward to talking to you." I mean, do you hear the connotations?

	He took mine first, but then he --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Wow. That's - unbelievable.

Conor looks down at the picture, then back up to Anna.

TRENT, early 30s, talks to the camera as he drives his Ford Explorer. He's cute - but trying a smidge too hard - - goatee, leather cord necklace he bought in Cancun, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<TRENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If a girl is into you, she's sleeping with you. And if after a month - two months at the very outside - she's not sleeping with you, she does not like you. I guess the trick is, how to spot this girl early - so you don't waste the one to seven weeks waiting to find out that it's never gonna happen. So, I've got some signs about how to spot this girl - gleaned from my own experience, of course. A girl will never sleep with you if: she calls you cuddly or dependable, she pops a zit in front of you, her name is Amber or Christine, she takes a dump in your bathroom or she takes home leftovers in dates 1-3. I know it's not scientific - but I'm just saying - you were warned.

	<DIALOGUE>
	So, now what? I'm just supposed to run from every guy who doesn't like me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uhh - yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's not going to be anyone left.

</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
Alex LAUGHS.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK, I don't know why I'm saying this - but I actually think I know a nice guy who you might like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. He's a friend of my brother's. Bill. We'll all meet for a drink - it'll be good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
Gigi smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, I'm in his bathroom right now. What do I now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gotta come out eventually. But I'd really take my time. Let him sweat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up. Gigi finds some Crest Whitestrips and - with determination - decides to APPLY THEM.

INT. GYM - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's rolling up mats, etc. as a sweaty Ben approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, we ran into each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You came to my class.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't know it was your class.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You called and asked me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you didn't call me back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because you said not to call back if it was my class. Which it was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Ben recommits.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We ran into each other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Anna LAUGHS.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Totally. A couple of innocent folks - by happenstance - doing their daily workout near one another.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
As Anna picks up her bag and walks past him -
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wanna swim?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Ben watches her go, not sure she's serious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GYM POOL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Big indoor pool. Clearly closed, lights off. Anna opens the door with a KEY, Ben follows.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was just thinking - why can't we be friends? Am I not allowed to make friends anymore? Am I not allowed to be friends with hot people? What kind of reverse prejudice is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hear you. Am I supposed to not be friends with a guy just because he's married, and happens to have this insane smile and this ass that makes me want to dry hump?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I just fell in love. A girl who talks about a dry hump.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Classy, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Classy is lame.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Anna sits at the edge of the pool.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, friends, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Totally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
And with that, Anna pulls off her top. And then her sweats. And, totally naked, slides into the pool.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanna come in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I don't trust myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK. You can just watch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
He does.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You may be the best friend I've ever had.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Anna LAUGHS, and then dunks her head under the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben comes in the front door, drops his gym bag. Janine sits on the couch flipping through a magazine. He leans in to kiss her on the cheek. She does not look happy.
</DIRECTION>
<JANINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey - you smell different.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANINE>
<DIRECTION>
Ben pulls back smoothly.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Different how?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<JANINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANINE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well that's an odd thing to say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him. He tries to coolly meet her gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<JANINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it's the ashtray and cigarettes I found. In the side yard. What part of "my dad died of lung cancer" is hard for you to wrap your brain around?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANINE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<JANINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do not lie to me, Ben. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANINE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you serious? We have like eight thousand undocumented workers in this house daily. You find cigarettes, and you automatically assume they're mine?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<JANINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANINE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, I'm not lying. And you are really freaking out. I think the renovation is getting to you because nothing is going on. Just please - relax.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Ben walks away. Off Janine, wanting to believe him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BALTIMORE YACHT CLUB - DOCK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben walks to a boat at the end of the dock. He stands, unsure, before deciding to KNOCK on the side of the boat. NEIL emerges - unshaven, possibly unshowered.
</DIRECTION>
<NEIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah. My first visitor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEIL>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This boat is sick. How come you never invited me out before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<NEIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, this was supposed to be just for Beth and I - for our retirement. Leave our jobs. Sell the house. Take off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEIL>
<DIRECTION>
Neil is clearly having a tough time. Ben doesn't know what to say. They're silent for a second.
</DIRECTION>
<NEIL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. Where are my manners? Permission to board granted. I'll show you around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEIL>
<DIRECTION>
Ben smiles, steps on to the boat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. INNER HARBOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: A cigarette being lit. WIDEN to reveal Neil smoking on the upper deck of his boat, steering it out into the bay. Ben stands across from him, looking on.
</DIRECTION>
<NEIL>
<DIRECTION>
(re: cigarette)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEIL>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's OK.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Neil switches to his left hand, away from Ben.
</DIRECTION>
<NEIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So Janine sent you to check on me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEIL>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Pretty much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<NEIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any message from Beth?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEIL>
<DIRECTION>
Ben shakes his head no. Neil seems disappointed.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think she's been busy getting ready for her sister's funeral though, so...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<NEIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her sister's what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEIL>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wedding. Her sister's wedding. What did I say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Neil is now LAUGHING HARD.
</DIRECTION>
<NEIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said funeral.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEIL>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I didn't. Shit, did I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Neil LAUGHS HARDER. Even Ben sees the humor.
</DIRECTION>
<NEIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The marriage thing is weird, man. I never thought Beth would give me an ultimatum.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEIL>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Why not? That's what women do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<NEIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. I forgot. That's how Janine got you to bite the bullet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEIL>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yup.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Neil looks at Ben, curious.
</DIRECTION>
<NEIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you regret it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEIL>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<NEIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're happy? You'd say you're happily married?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEIL>
<DIRECTION>
Ben looks at Neil as if he's crazy.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love Janine.

Neil takes a drag and looks out over the harbor.

INT. BO BROOKS CRAB HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We PAN down one of the long tables to find Beth, SMACKING a crab with a mallet. HARD. AND LOUD. The others at the table turn to look at her, annoyed. And that's when we see - there seems to be a party and SPEECH underway.
</DIRECTION>
<COUSIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, I know when my cousin Paige says those vows tomorrow, there are going to be hearts breaking all over the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUSIN>
<DIRECTION>
Beth's sister, Paige, smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<COUSIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, keep in mind, her sister Beth is still on the market.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUSIN>
<DIRECTION>
The cousin WINKS at Beth. Beth goes white.
</DIRECTION>
<COUSIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, she's an older model, but she's still got a lot of miles left in her. But don't stay on the lot too long, Bethie, or next year's models will --
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUSIN>
<DIRECTION>
KEN MURPHY, 60s, nearly tramples guests to grab the mic.
</DIRECTION>
<KEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK - that's enough of the speeches. Time to eat. So enjoy the crab. And the yellow stuff is not hot mustard, it's the crab's hepatopancreas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEN>
<DIRECTION>
Mixed reaction from the crowd as Ken puts the mic down. He starts to return to his table - when he sees Beth trying to make a sneaky exit. He catches up to her.
</DIRECTION>
<KEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bethie, your cousin Jay has always been a jackass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEN>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. And even he's married.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<KEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, you'll get married a little bit later than some people. Big deal. You never did anything the way every one else did it, and that's what I've always thought was so great about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEN>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm your oldest daughter, and I'm the only one not married. If this was Fiddler on the Roof you'd have to sacrifice me or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
Ken laughs and puts his arm around Beth.
</DIRECTION>
<KEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, look. When everyone else was just going to camp at the Y, you borrowed my New York Times, found some arts camp in the Berkshires, wrote away for information, then got accepted on your own. You were nine. You never did things the way everyone else did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEN>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<KEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because that's you. That's why you're my favorite daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEN>
<DIRECTION>
Beth's eyes go WIDE.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think you're supposed to say that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<KEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I don't give a shit. I'm retired, and I'll say what I want. I'll say it into the mic if you want --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEN>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's OK.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<KEN>

Gigi sits sipping a drink, alone, when Alex comes in the door and goes directly to her table.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry I'm late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's OK. I like a little time before a blind date - prepare myself mentally, remind myself not to tell the story about my molars --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
Alex motions to the WAITRESS to bring them another round.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't wait to hear that story about the molars, though.

</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can he already not like me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I screwed up. I told Bill it was Thursday, but I meant Tuesday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
Gigi is disappointed. The waitress drops off their drinks. They toast - then observe the SCENE AT THE BAR.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Awesome. I'm stuck here with a guy who can't distinguish Tuesday from Thursday - and meanwhile this girl -
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(motions to GIRL at the bar)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	- she's probably meeting her soul mate as we speak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
The GIRL is standing between TWO GUYS.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See the guy trying to work the Tom Cruise thing. She's interested. He's not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You cannot tell from a cursory glance that he's not interested.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, I can. I manage a restaurant. I see this stuff go down every night. Watch --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
As if on cue, Tom Cruise Guy BANGS his elbow into the GIRL, hard, causing her to spill her drink. Tom Cruise Guy sees, but doesn't acknowledge. Alex looks smug.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, you have a gift.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And check out droopy dawg on her other side. He can buy her drinks all night, and she'll insist there's no "spark."
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe there isn't. You need a spark.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The "spark" thing is bullshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Enlighten me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guys invented the "spark" so they could not call and treat you kind of bad and keep you guessing, and then convince you that the anxiety and fear that it creates in you is actually a "spark." And you all buy it. You love it. You all thrive on it because you all love drama.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? So you don't wait until the last minute on deadlines, or on phone bills, because you love the drama of not knowing whether you'll make it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
She's busted.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And let me guess - when you were stalking Conor that night - were you obsessing about him calling for days, even though the date was just kind of mediocre?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK. Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, you thrive on drama. You gotta be more like me - if a girl likes me great, if not, there are plenty more like her - probably with smaller pores and bigger implants.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
They continue drinking and observing the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you sharing all this inside dating information with me again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dunno. I like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't start doodling my name on your binder. I just mean, I like you, like I like basset hounds. They're kinda pathetic - so you want to cheer them up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Again with the sensitivity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
Alex smiles at her. Gigi can't help but smile back.

<JANINE>

Janine does not hear him, and barrels on -
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, there is no reason for that kind of dishonesty, is there? IS THERE? I mean, we made promises to one another --

Javier looks at her - what the hell is she talking about?
</DIRECTION>
<JANINE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I mean is, we had a contract. Which is like making promises to each other, right?

	Maybe I should just get back to work.

Conor goes in for a HUG, but Anna's not ready for it - so he just ends up grabbing her. It's awkward. She leaves, Conor tries to play it off, looks around the room.

<CONOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just - I have no idea what she's doing. I cannot read her signals - at all. We used to sleep together - all the time. Well, that's not true, I don't know why I said that, it wasn't all the time. But it did happen - I know I'm not making this up. And then, out of nowhere, it stops. But she still calls, she stops by, she sleeps on my couch, she wants a massage, she leaves cute messages - but it never goes ANYWHERE. I mean, what is she doing?

<LARRY>

	Honestly - we may not have the best insight. Gay signals have nothing to do with straight signals.

	But listen - I can tell you this. Gay or straight, you're not going to get anywhere by being inactive. She clearly likes you - maybe she just wants you to be a man and do something. So the next time you're in the position - don't take no for an answer.

</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's the thing - my daughter is happily married with kids and running a tanning salon on Staten Island. But if she wasn't, I'd tell her the same thing I'd like to tell a lot of the girls that come in and out of this building on the arm of a married guy. And here is that advice --- get stocks, cash, annuities, a deed in your name. Don't settle for flowers and a shopping spree at Bendel's. Think to the future. We all know that none of these guys is gonna leave his society wife and let her keep half the money and the classic eight on Park Avenue. So, I wanna tell these young ladies, as long as you only have the guy for a finite period of time -- get something that can last. Because I guarantee you - he won't. And that's the best fatherly advice I can give.

Mary looks at her.

	I don't know. Remember Becca, my sister's friend. Some guy waits on her at Bennigan's - by the end of the night they both knew they had found the one.

	You're totally right. It can happen.

<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what about texter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<MARY>

	Texter has yet to make any verbal contact. I mean, this guy could have had surgery that left him without a voice box, breathing through a stoma, and I'd never know because I never actually hear his voice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I doubt he has a stoma -
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not the point. The point is - I can't text. I'm not charming via text. My sarcasm doesn't come through, I can't type fast enough on the little phone keyboard --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So don't text.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not just texting. It's email and voicemail and snail mail -
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's just mail -
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever. None of it's working. I've had a guy leave a voicemail for me at work, and then I call him back at home, and he emails me to my Blackberry, and then I text him to his cell and then he emails me to my home account from the plane phone -- and it just totally gets out of hand. I miss the days where you had one phone number with one answering machine that housed one cassette tape and either the cassette tape had a message from the guy or it didn't. That's it. Now you have to go around checking all your portals and get rejected by seven different technologies. It's exhausting.

EXT. GRAMERCY MANSION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lush grounds surrounding a beautiful turn-of-the- century mansion. The procession of a wedding has just begun. TWO ADORABLE FLOWER GIRLS start things off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Beth's sister, Laura, processes down the aisle with her husband, STEVEN. Beth's sister Catherine and her husband GEORGE are next. Big smiles all around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Beth appears at the end of the aisle with her escort - BUDDY, a 12 year old CHOCOLATE LAB, wearing a coral bow tie. Beth forces a smile as she processes with Buddy - who stops to piss on a chair leg. Beth is not happy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GRAMERCY MANSION - DAY

A lavish reception. Beth takes her seat next to DAN, 40s. Dan looks over at Beth's place card.

</DAN>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yep.

Beth slaps on a fake smile, and grabs for the wine.

INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PARTY is in full swing. Typical affair for someone in their late 20's - mediocre food but decent alcohol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gigi stands, somewhat uncomfortably, near the Chex Mix. She tries smiling at a TALL GIRL, who ignores her. So Gigi continues absently and compulsively shoving handfuls of Chex Mix into her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It makes your breath stink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
Gigi looks up to see Nathan and Bruce - Mary's gay coworkers who are now decked out in full-on Saturday night gay mode - standing next to her.
</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chex Mix. I learned the hard way. I made out with a guy after eating like a bag of the stuff. He said my breath smelled like trout.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN>
<DIRECTION>
Gigi puts her handful of Chex Mix back.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for the tip.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<NATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. That was rude. And that guy I made out with was a total asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN>
<BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to smell you? I'm sure you don't smell like trout.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUCE>
<DIRECTION>
Gigi LAUGHS.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. I'm good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
She cups her hand and surreptitiously checks her breath.
</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Nathan. This is Bruce.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gigi. How do you guys know Alex?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't. Our friend Mary heard about it from some guy named Conor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUCE>
<DIRECTION>
Gigi smiles in recognition.
</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know Alex?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope - I mean I'm pretty sure - something is about to happen between us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<NATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, you're here as like a guest, or like his date?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN>
<BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate that - when you don't know if you're a date - so you don't know if you should bring a friend, or if you're like co-hosting or if you should stay til the end to have alone time --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUCE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a look of DOUBT sweeps across Gigi's face.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He didn't really say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
She reflexively GRABS FOR THE CHEX MIX and starts gorging on it again. Nathan stops her.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm sure I'm more than just a guest. I mean - there have been signs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<NATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN>
<BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did get a slight waft of trout, though. Take a mint.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUCE>

He reaches in his pocket. Gigi looks at him gratefully.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.

INT. GRAMERCY MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dinner is over. The dance floor is crowded. The bride, Paige, is out there. Beth's dad is dancing with her mom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beth's dad gives Beth a wink as she heads onto to the dance floor with DOMINIC, 50s and fat.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, where's Neil?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINIC>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We actually broke up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DOMINIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way. You guys were together for like ten years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINIC>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seven. But yes, a long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
They continue to dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too bad cousins can't marry, huh? Cuz then we could maybe --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINIC>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eeew Dominic, gross.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
Beth swats Dominic on the arm, and he laughs. And then they are distracted by a COMMOTION ON THE DANCE FLOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone has stopped dancing. They are looking to the floor, near the band. Beth pushes her way through to see-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER DAD. HE HAS FALLEN TO HIS KNEES. HE'S CLUTCHING HIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHEST. AND HIS FACE IS TURNING AN ASHY, TERRIFYING GRAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is packed. Gigi is smashed into a hallway, trying to look relaxed. Alex comes up behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had no idea it would be such a madhouse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
Gigi turns to him and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. Great party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are any guys hitting on you? Do you need me to evaluate their level of interest?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They were gay. Even I know that their level of interest was probably low.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well - too bad Bill couldn't make it. I still think you guys would hit it off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
Gigi smiles knowingly - on to Alex's scam.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh OK. Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(air quotes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Bill".
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
Alex doesn't know how to take that.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway - I'm on my way to put out some more liquor. But it looks like the food could use some refreshing --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at the FOOD TABLE. Everything is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you mind helping? I mean, just refill the chips and stuff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean, kind of like --- co-hosting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
Gigi LOOKS ELATED. Alex looks CONFUSED.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uhh, OK. The chips are on top of the fridge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
He walks away. Gigi smiles BIG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - A LITTLE LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The party is now even more crowded. Gigi weaves her way through the crowd. She's deftly holding SIX DRINKS, passing them off to various people as she walks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stops at the food table, rearranges a few bowls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She CATCHES ALEX'S EYE across the room, he's talking to friends. She smiles and gives a THUMBS UP. He gives an awkward thumbs up back and returns to his conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - A LITTLE LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gigi is in the kitchen, mixing up some DIP. She chats with a couple of PARTY-GOERS, very much at home.
</DIRECTION>
<PARTY_GOER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really great party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARTY_GOER_1>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks. When Alex said he wanted to have a party, I was like "Let's do it."
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<PARTY_GOER_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks so much for having us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARTY_GOER_2>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No problem. Anytime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
An attractive TALL GIRL enters the kitchen, and starts LOOKING IN THE CUPBOARDS. Gigi watches with interest.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I help you find something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
The Tall Girl finds a BOWL in the cabinet, and grabs it.
</DIRECTION>
<TALL_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that's OK. I got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALL_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She brings the bowl over to the counter, and starts emptying Gigi's dip into the bowl. Gigi is THROWN.
</DIRECTION>
<TALL_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for mixing that up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALL_GIRL>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<TALL_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alex asked me to get the dip together. Thanks for getting it started.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALL_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Gigi's face grows red. The Tall Girl tastes the dip.
</DIRECTION>
<TALL_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmmm - could use a little more dill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALL_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Then the Tall Girl deftly grabs the dip, and chips, and heads back out to the party. Gigi looks to the confused party-goers, not pleased.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bruce and Nathan wave to Gigi as they leave. People are getting coats - the crowd is definitely thinning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gigi spots Alex in the kitchen and makes a beeline.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When someone's underwear ends up in your toaster oven - it's been a good party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
Alex looks at the toaster oven and laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess people had fun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
Then, the TALL GIRL emerges.
</DIRECTION>
<TALL_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alex, you want me to start cleaning up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALL_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Gigi STARES DAGGERS AT HER.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's sweet of you. But I thought I'd stick around, so I'll take care of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<TALL_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALL_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
The tall girl shoots Gigi a dirty look as she grabs a trash bag. Gigi grabs one, too. Alex looks mystified.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Knock yourselves out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - STILL LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is really late. Everyone's gone - except the TALL GIRL and ALEX, who sit on the couch playing a NBA LIVE on the XBOX. Gigi enters from the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I've rounded up the last of the beer bottles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
The tall girl and Alex do not look up from the game. Gigi stands there awkwardly.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, umm - what game is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
They ignore her. She looks around. It's awkward.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, maybe I should just -- you know -- I mean it's past three and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<TALL_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YES!! Suck it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALL_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Alex tosses down his controller.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are sensational.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
The tall girl beams. Gigi flinches.
</DIRECTION>
<TALL_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you say it's past three? Man, I gotta go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALL_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Gigi suppresses a SMILE. The Tall Girl gives Alex a hug, and heads out. Gigi, finally alone with Alex, sits next to him on the couch. They're silent for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for staying and helping clean up - but I really gotta get to bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that an invitation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. That was cheesy. I'm not good at this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
But then -- before Alex knows what's happening, Gigi is LUNGING at him. She puts his face in her hands, and starts to KISS HIM. REALLY KISS HIM. Finally, Gigi pulls away. She looks breathless.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
Alex looks a little afraid.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew it. I knew it. The best relationships grow out of friendships.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
She goes in to kiss him again. This time he stops her.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait - what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ummmm....
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you and I are in a relationship?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'd say if we're not at relationship station--ship, we're at least on the track.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
Alex gets up off the couch.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And why would you think that, exactly?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because there were - you know - signs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Like what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ummm - it was good to hear from me. You talked to me even when you were with a girl. I felt something...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
She trails off. Alex is not pleased.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about? What have I been saying since I met you? If a guy wants to date you HE WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HE WILL ASK YOU OUT. DID I ASK YOU OUT?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
(SOFTLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would you do this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you were Watts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
Alex doesn't even hear her.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do women do this? Why do they build this stuff up in their minds, take each little thing a guy does and twist it into something else --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
Gigi stands there, embarrassed, taking Alex's berating.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd rather be like that - than like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I dissect each little thing, and put myself out there too much, and maybe I even thrive on the drama of it all-- but at least that means I still care. You think you've won because women are expendable to you? Sure, you don't get hurt or make an ass of yourself that way, but you don't fall in love that way, either. You haven't won, Alex. You're alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
Gigi grabs her bag.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I may do a lot of stupid shit - but I know I'm a lot closer to finding someone than you are.

Gigi turns and heads out the door.

INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Gigi looks at the phone, and then finally DIALS.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Janine, I'm sorry it's so late, but I just - don't start picking out your bridesmaid dress, OK? I know this isn't the first time this has happened, it's just - this one wasn't about whether he liked me. I just really liked him.

Gigi hangs up, lays on the bed, snaps off the light.

INT. POTOMAC HOUSE - DAY

Ken Murphy, Beth's dad, lies in bed, in a Notre Dame sweatshirt, with papers, and books surrounding him. Beth clears his breakfast dishes off of the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want anything else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<KEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Less of that cardboardy brown stuff. More regular people food.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KEN>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The cardboardy brown stuff is called whole grain bread.

</BETH>
<KEN>

	Maybe you could just fry me up a couple sausage links?

</KEN>
<BETH>

Ken looks at her, with a wry smile.
</DIRECTION>
<KEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I tell you that you're not only my favorite daughter, but you're also the prettiest? So much better looking than those other dogs. Seriously.

</KEN>
<BETH>

</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I finally got mom to lay down in the spare room. All we have left to eat is some old jelly and ramen noodles, so after I tackle some of these dishes, maybe we can go to the store. Our new brother is trying to co-opt dad's property before he's even dead. And Laura, your husband would really like a beer to go with his fifth consecutive hour of the golf channel.

</GIGI>
<JANINE>

<DIRECTION>
MARIEL (50's, highly manicured, upper class type) sits on a yacht in what looks to be the French Riviera.
</DIRECTION>
<MARIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My first husband was unimpressive. I found him in bed with his big breasted secretary when I came home early from the Maldives. So unoriginal, it made me feel sorry for him. My second husband was a pinch more creative. Cheated on me with my sister - but made me believe that I was insane for being suspicious. At last - some intrigue, some mind games - though my sister's two year old eventually gave them up. But my last husband -- he was a gem. A veritable master at covering his tracks. I poured over his phone records, intercepted his credit card bills, had him followed on countless occasions - and never found a single shred of evidence. It wasn't until he died that I found out about the property he owned with his Austrian mistress. But the real master, I have to say -- is me. Three husbands -- countless boyfriends, and I haven't been caught yet.

	This is really good news.

</ANNA>
<BEN>

	Yep. I was sitting right there.

<ANNA>

With that, they start to KISS. It gets heated. CLOTHES START TO COME OFF. MOSTLY ANNA'S. They make their way over to the LEATHER SOFA.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How is it that every time I see your body, I'm shocked at how beautiful it is?
	</DIALOGUE>

<BEN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dana, I need to go over the offering statement. Can I get a few minutes?

BEN FREEZES. Literally freezes on top of Anna.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Ben FRANTICALLY puts his hands over Anna's mouth. Then, working with speed and precision, he GATHERS ALL OF ANNA'S THINGS and shoves her - NAKED - into the CLOSET. There isn't enough room to stand, so she has to sit. She looks up at Ben, he closes the closet door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to the door of the office.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit. I told Dana to get this lock fixed. One sec.

</BEN>
<JANINE>

Ben goes to sit behind his desk, confused.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OK.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Janine, clearly a little nervous, goes to straddle Ben at his desk chair. Her skirt is way too long to do this, so she has to regroup, and hike up the skirt. Ben glances over at the closet.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Janine, what are you doing?

Ben picks up some papers, but Janine is not giving up.

Kelli Ann starts to turn away as she sees Alex grab his cell phone, look at it, then put it down. He grabs a beer, takes a swig - then grabs his cell phone again - staring at it, willing it to ring. He puts it down again. A HUGE SMILE grows on Kelli Ann's face.

Anna looks confused.

<ANNA>

	Because we always call each other that.

Anna doesn't have an answer for that.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to say something, OK? I mean, we call each other sweetie, and we fall asleep on the phone after talking for hours and I washed your hair for you after you had that shoulder surgery and everything - it's like we're together.

</CONOR>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know that I -
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<CONOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me finish. Maybe it's my fault. Maybe I haven't been clear about what I want. So let me be clear. I love hanging out, but I am so attracted to you, and I just - I want both. I want to make love to you. I know that sounds kind of embarrassing coming out of my mouth - I just freaked myself out, too - but it's true. And I'm not sure what happened, or why we stopped - but I don't really care. I just --

INT. POTOMAC HOUSE - DEN - DAY

All of Beth's sister's spouses - Steven, Devon and George - sit on the couch watching basketball.

</GEORGE>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't mean for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
Beth, annoyed, goes into the kitchen. She puts down the dishes in shock. The kitchen is SPOTLESS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks to the sink and sees the back of a man, doing the last of the dishes. He turns around. It's NEIL.
</DIRECTION>
<NEIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The dishes are all put away. There's a load of laundry still drying, but the other one is folded on top of the washer.

EXT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Janine pulls up in her Land Rover and gets out. As she approaches the house, she stops in her tracks. ALL THE SCAFFOLDING IS GONE. THE HOUSE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL. She whips out her cell phone and dials.
</DIRECTION>
<JANINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Javier - does this mean what I think it means? So when you say "done" - you don't mean "we still need plumbing in the upstairs bathrooms done" - you mean "done done"?...Wow - you're amazing...OK...I'll call when I see it...Bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANINE>
<DIRECTION>
She hangs up the phone, steels herself, and walks inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Janine enters - she can't believe her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VARIOUS SHOTS as Janine walks from room to room - amazed. Where there once were plastic sheets there are now walls with vintage wall paper. All the floors are immaculate, the chandeliers sparkle - it's all perfect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks down halls and up staircases, past end tables and mantles - ALL COVERED WITH PICTURES OF HER AND BEN. Nice and tasteful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She ends her tour in the master suite - it's HUGE. And though full of furniture, the longer she stands there, the more empty it begins to seem. Her face transitions, from delight to loneliness, within a matter of seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes out her cell phone, hesitates, then dials...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MEADOW MILL ATHLETIC CLUB - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: A LIT CIGARETTE. A LONG DRAG IS TAKEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT WIDE TO REVEAL: Ben sitting on a ledge in front of the gym, smoking a cigarette, watching the passersby. He's clearly waiting for Anna to arrive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His PHONE RINGS. He looks at it - JANINE CALLING. He IGNORES the call, takes another drag of his cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - BEDROOM - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With Janine as the call goes to voice mail. She hangs up, confused. She sits on the edge of the bed, looking around the room, not sure what to do with herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She notices a pair of pants and jacket thrown over a chair - goes to tidy it up. She picks up the jacket, checks the pockets, they're empty. She grabs the pants, takes them both to the walk-in closet. She hangs up the jacket. And as she folds the pants over - she HEARS SOMETHING HIT THE GROUND. She looks down to find -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PACK OF CIGARETTES. Her face pales. She stares at it - immobile. Her face tightens, her eyes well up.
</DIRECTION>
<JANINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YOU LYING SACK OF SHIT!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
- as she grabs two armfuls of his clothes off the racks and flies out of the closet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STAIRCASE - She hurtles down the stairs, throwing armfuls of clothes into the foyer. Then, she surveys the scene and, not satisfied, rushes back up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HALLWAY - As she flies back into the bedroom, she sees herself in the ANTIQUE MIRROR hanging in the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without even thinking she grabs it from the wall and SMASHES IT on the ground. She stands over it, breathing heavily, looking at the shattered glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She EXITS FRAME and we hear her walk down the stairs, the camera HOLDING ON THE EMPTY WALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a beat we hear her walking back up the stairs - she ENTERS FRAME AGAIN holding a DUSTPAN AND BROOM. She kneels over and begins sweeping up her mess.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOAT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neil lies on the bed, reading. The room is pretty messy - a lot of clothes strewn around. There is a KNOCK at the door. Neil gets up to answer it. It's Beth.
</DIRECTION>
<NEIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEIL>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been a while since I've been here. Turns out - that boat in the next mooring, looks like yours -- not yours.

	Oh no.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted to thank you. For coming by my folks' house.

</NEIL>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're what I want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
Neil looks at her - unsure of her meaning.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our life together is what I want. Your love is what I want. Did you see those guys my sisters are married to? You are a better husband to me - without being married - than any of those real husbands will ever be. And that's enough for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<NEIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you'd really be OK if we take the marriage thing off the table?

She points to his pants - a RAGGEDY pair of CARGO PANTS.
</DIRECTION>
<NEIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? You're just mad at me, and you're taking it out on the pants.
	</DIALOGUE>

	OK. We're not getting married, but I'm chucking the pants.

Conor and Anna climb the stairs of a three story row house. A "FOR SALE" sign is outside.

Anna turns to face Conor, trying to put this together.

Anna looks at him for a long time, not knowing how to say this. Conor looks at her, struggling, and suddenly sees it in her face. The answer he's been looking for. It all dawns on him in an instant.
</DIRECTION>
<CONOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't want it with me.

Anna LAUGHS, and it breaks the tension. Conor smiles.

A speakeasy from the 1900s that hasn't changed much. A PIANO starts to play on a tiny stage - empty. And then - a terrified but determined Anna takes her place in front of the mic. And begins to SING.

It's a "THE LAST GOODBYE" by JEFF BUCKLEY - barely recognizable - more of a torch song. As she sings, she begins to gain confidence. We hear the song over:

Alex looks at Gigi for a long moment. He looks nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I can't stop thinking about you. I drive by your place. I call and hang up. I'm turning into -
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
He LAUGHS.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, a wise person once told me that if a guy wants to be with a girl, he will make it happen. No matter what.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	True.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmmm. Because when I was hurling my body onto yours - you did not seem to want to "make it happen."
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's the thing about that. You were right. I've gotten so used to keeping myself at a safe distance from these women, having the power - that I didn't know what it felt like when I actually - fell - for one of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
Gigi considers this.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I've just been out with your friend Bill. And it just might be exactly what I need. No drama. He calls. He does what he says.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could do that stuff too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<GIGI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you didn't. And that same wise person told me that I am the rule. That I have to stop thinking that every guy will change - stop thinking that I will be the --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
But before she can finish her sentence, Alex KISSES HER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LONG, SLOW, PASSIONATE KISS.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	- that I will be the exception.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
Alex looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are my exception.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEX>
<DIRECTION>
They continue to KISS.

EXT. GAY PRIDE PARADE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A staple of summer in Baltimore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rickety Baltimore Blade float comes by. It's a very phallic "blade" with a A BUNCH OF YOUNG SHIRTLESS MEN dancing and waving. Mary rides the float, too, waving to the crowd with Nathan, Joshua and Bruce.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Conor, with a NATTILY DRESSED GAY COUPLE, stands on the street watching. Nathan calls down from the float.
</DIRECTION>
<NATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jonathan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN>
<NATTILY_DRESSED_GAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you guys doing up there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATTILY_DRESSED_GAY>
<NATHAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dancing. Get your asses up here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATHAN>
<DIRECTION>
With that, the two Nattily Dressed Gays grab Conor, and climb up onto the float. They SHOUT over the music.
</DIRECTION>
<NATTILY_DRESSED_GAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Conor. He just sold us on the most amazing duplex in Mt. Vernon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NATTILY_DRESSED_GAY>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Conor. I'm Mary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Conor looks at Mary and SMILES. All of the gay men around them start to DANCE. LIKE REALLY, REALLY DANCE.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's so great to finally meet you in person.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<CONOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONOR>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other. Is there a connection?
</DIRECTION>
<CONOR>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like to dance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONOR>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd love to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Conor takes her hand - and the two of them do an old fashioned slow dance on the float. As everyone freaks around them, they smile and dance in each others' arms.

EXT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben walks into the house and looks around - no Janine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he heads to the stairs, he stops in his tracks. At the bottom of the stairs - ALL OF HIS CLOTHES are stacked, neatly folded into piles. He approaches, then sees a CARTON OF CIGARETTES on top of one pile -
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
- and a NOTE taped onto the carton: BEN - KNOCK YOURSELF

DISSOLVE TO:

EXT. HARBOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beautiful sunny day on the harbor. Anna's song fades out, and the sound of Gigi's voice fades up.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Girls are taught a lot of stuff growing up. If a guy punches you, he likes you. Never try to trim your own bangs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOAT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out on the sparkling water, Neil's boat. As we get closer, we see garlands on the rails, on the bough. Even closer and we see - Beth on the arm of her father. He escorts her down a mini aisle. On the bough of the boat - is a TINY WEDDING. About six guests. And Neil, waiting for Beth at the altar.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	And someday you will meet a wonderful guy and get your very own happy ending.

INT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Mary sits at her desk, typing on her laptop. ON THE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCREEN: MARY'S MYSPACE PROFILE.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Every movie we see, every story we're told, implores us to wait for it. The third act twist...the man who couldn't get it together finally figuring it out...the unexpected declaration of love...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
Mary hits a button and a box comes up, which reads: ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO DELETE THIS MYSPACE PROFILE? Mary clicks "YES". MYSPACE PROFILE DELETED appears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Mary gets up, grabs her little purse, and opens the door. IT'S CONOR. Mary smiles, her face barely able to contain her happiness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gigi and Alex sit close on her couch, watching a movie.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...the exception to the rule.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
We PAN over to the TV to find that they are watching: SOME KIND OF WONDERFUL. Watts and Keith finally KISS. Gigi can't suppress her smile as Alex pulls her close.

INT. EDDIE'S OF ROLAND PARK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ben heads to the checkout line - holding a six pack of beer and a bag of chips. As he's about to put his stuff down, a PRETTY GIRL gets in line behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How to tell the ones who want us from the ones who don't. The one's who'll stay from the one's who'll leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
He lets her go ahead of him. She smiles, takes him up on it. The cashier rings her up, she pays for her stuff, without giving Ben so much as a look. Ben gives his stuff to the cashier, along with a weak smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUTCHER'S HILL BROWNSTONE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the outside looking in a ground floor window - we can see the living room of the lower apartment. Boxes fill the room - clearly a new tenant moving in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Janine enters, carrying two boxes. She opens one, and pulls out the ANTIQUE MIRROR (now with new glass).
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And ultimately, we're not taught the one thing that could save ourselves, our friends, our families countless hours of confusion, despair, and speculation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIGI>
<DIRECTION>
She hangs the mirror, straightening it slightly. She steps back, seems pleased. Then, IN FRONT OF CAMERA walk two people - the CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM down the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see it's Anna, walking with a NEW GUY - it's clear it's a first date. They stop at the corner, exchange an awkward hug. As they turn to go their separate ways -
</DIRECTION>
<NEW_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was nice meeting you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEW_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Anna smiles - the New Guy turns and heads off. Anna watches him go, and then turns and walks away from us.
</DIRECTION>
<GIGI>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	That sometimes the happy ending...is just moving on.

Anna walks down the hill, the skyline of Baltimore in front of her.
