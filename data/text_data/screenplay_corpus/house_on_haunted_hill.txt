FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And in the darkness, a TICKING sound is heard. Soft and steady -- soothing -- and then a BANG!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH UP ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL - BASEMENT NURSE'S STATION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HAND punching a CARD into the huge, ticking TIME CLOCK on the wall: 7:00 a.m.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK TO REVEAL - A bleary-eyed MALE NURSE beginning his day. Alone inside a small wood and glass cubicle, he rips off yesterday's day-at-a-time calendar page, revealing today's date: October 11, 1931.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Goes to the Victrola inside the cubicle. Cranks the turntable up to speed. Puts the huge needle down on a spinning 78: we hear the song crackling through the empty halls of the hospital -- depression-era Muzak: Horace Heidt & His Musical Knight's "Keep Your Sunny Side Up"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Nurse sharpens the last of a half-dozen pencils to needle- points, sits down at his desk, and begins the tedium of jotting entries into a tall stack of Patient Records.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. And then he hears a soft, almost paw-like tapping on the glass. He looks up: a PATIENT with a heavily bandaged head is standing there, his eyes as dull and lifeless as marbles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Nurse waves the Patient away. Goes back to his work. Beat. And then the tapping is heard again. The Nurse snaps his head up, about to bark at the man -- but the words stop dead on his tongue:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing on the other side of the glass are now two dozen patients. Likewise bandaged, staring silent and dead-eyed at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unnerved, the Nurse's finger slowly stretches towards a buzzer-button just below the desk-top. It never makes it. Because --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HAND - lashes into frame and grabs the Nurse's fingers. The Nurse looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In addition to the mass of Patients outside the cubicle, there are now six of them inside it, surrounding him. The Nurse's eyes shoot to the still-locked doors of the cubicle, and he utters one confused word --
</DIRECTION>
<MALE_NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- how -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALE_NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
-- and then someone rams all six of his needle-sharp pencils eraser-deep into his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Nurse gurgles and staggers -- falls back against the Victrola, hitting the turntable crank as he goes down, causing it to start spinning like a pinwheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Keep Your Sunny Side Up" now blares through the halls triple- time, sounding like a thousand manic chipmunks. And to the beat of that tune, the Patients smash the CONTROL PANEL inside the cubicle until it shorts-out and explodes! Which pops open
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PATIENT CELLS -

-- fling open a set of double doors marked "Cerebral Hygiene," shouting: "Vannacutt!" And we see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CEREBRAL HYGIENE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- two people in surgical scrubs: the moustached Doctor named VANNACUTT and a FEMALE NURSE wielding a 16mm camera. As the two whip around, startled by the shouts, we see the object of their ministrations: A PATIENT on a gurney being filmed as his internal organs are slowly and methodically extracted -- while still alive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then all hell breaks loose as the WOLF PACK descends:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DR. VANNACUTT manages to yank down a LEVER on the wall labeled "Lockdown" before he's swallowed by the Mob;
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From somewhere in the house, we hear heavy gear, cables and doors loudly shutting down the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The NURSE is clubbed to the floor with her own camera. And amidst all the vengeful shouts and wails, a curious thing happens:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As one of the Patients picks up the Nurse's blood-spattered camera and puts it to his eye, the image on screen abruptly
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASHES TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CEREBRAL HYGIENE ROOM - CONTINUED - GRAINY BLACK & WHITE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and dead silence -- and we find ourselves watching old soundless 16mm footage of what happened next: a blur of scalpels and saws as the Patients viciously vivisect Vannacutt and Nurse, who've been crammed together on that same gurney. The B&W CAMERA PUSHES IN TIGHT on Vannacutt's screaming maw -- and suddenly we hear SOUND AGAIN --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- but, for some reason, it's not a human cry, but the CROWING OF A ROOSTER -- and when we PULL BACK OUT we see that what we're now watching is the Crowing Rooster and four blazing camera lenses that was the logo of the old PATHE NEWSREEL. The stentorian VOICE OF PATHE booms OVER:

	But our story doesn't end there. For, some years later, the gutted interior of the Institute was refurbished as a private residence. It has yet to be inhabited. Many say because the spirits of the vile Vannacutt and his Victims still walk the long corridors inside this place now known, simply, as: "The House On Haunted Hill."

-- and she stops herself in mid-word as, suddenly: the top of the Cube pops open like a jack-in-the-box! And, slowly, like it's on some mini-hydraulic lift, ANOTHER CUBE, identical to this one, starts to inch up into view --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- which has its own tiny SILVER CRANK in its side. But etched beneath this one is a warning:
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do Not Rotate Under Any Circumstances!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Without a nanosecond's hesitation, Jenzen reaches out her hand --
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I wouldn't --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
-- and turns the smaller crank. Beat. Nothing happens.
</DIRECTION>
<JENZEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- no kidding: that's why you're making ten bucks an hour and I'm --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENZEN>
<DIRECTION>
-- and BANG! A SKELETAL ARM comes FLASHING OUT from the smaller cube and SLASHES HER FINGER with a RAZOR!
</DIRECTION>
<JENZEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENZEN>
<DIRECTION>
-- it's no more than a paper cut, but it's bleeding and it hurts -- and then they both see written on the tiny razor:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Learn To Follow Instructions!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara can't help herself -- lets loose a little snort of laughter. Jenzen goes ballistic, smashes the lid shut on the Cube.
</DIRECTION>
<JENZEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think this is fucking funny??
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENZEN>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, it's just --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<JENZEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- well, here's a better one: you're fired.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENZEN>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<JENZEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And here's your goddamn severance!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENZEN>
<DIRECTION>
She slams the Cube hard into Sara's hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SARA'S CUBICLE - JUST AFTER (WE NEED TO RE-WORK THIS SCENE FOR LOCATION)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cube sits in a wastebasket next to the desk that Sara's angrily cleaning out. She's SLAMS her entire blotter into the trash -- which hits the Cube's crank and starts the music playing again. Sara, startled, looks over -- and sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN ORNATE IVORY-COLORED CARD - begin to ascend from the Cube. It starts with the words:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Try And Follow These:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then all we see are Sara's wide, growing-wider, eyes as she reads the rest.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...wow....WOW! Hey, Ms. Jenzen -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<JENZEN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you still fucking here??
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENZEN>
<DIRECTION>
Sara starts to flush with anger again -- and then stops, a small smile coming to her lips as she continues to stare at the card.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On my way out. Thanks for the valuable parting gift.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
She snatches the ivory card and stuffs it in her purse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HEARSE #1 - MOVING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where Sara Wolfe sits, decked out in near-dead-ringers clothes and hair-do as we last saw on Jennifer Jenzen: black silk suit, stiletco heels and an up-sweep -- holding that same ivory-colored card in her hand:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steven K. Price COMMANDS YOU TO ATTEND A Very Unique Birthday Celebration For Mrs. Evelyn Stockard-Price.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then the CAMERA WHIPLASH CRANES BACK from Sara and the vehicle in which she's sitting, to reveal the grand vista of:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WINDING ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
which snakes crazily up the Pacific Palisades, the crashing waves of the ocean seen in the background. We see that the vehicle Sara is riding in is the lead car of a MOTORCADE comprised of four '50's vintage HEARSES.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The man's insane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
And we whip back towards the source of this voice:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HEARSE #2 - MOVING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where we see this Man's well-tanned hand holding the same ivory card, which continues:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terror, Humiliation, Perhaps Even MURDER Will Be The Entertainment.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't get much better than that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HEARSE #3 - MOVING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where we see the well-manicured hands of this Woman, her left holding an 8mm Camcorder; her right, the same card:
</DIRECTION>
<With_ONE_MILLION_DOLLARS_Paid>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To Those That Survive The Entire Night
	</DIALOGUE>
</With_ONE_MILLION_DOLLARS_Paid>
<YOUNG_MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terrific: what's the catch?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HEARSE #4 - MOVING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where we see hands of a Man barely out of his teens, his muscular right hand holding that same card as well:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the Walls Of THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the screech of brakes is heard -- Hearse #4 jolts to a halt. The invitation flies from the Young Man's hand and to the floor, the rest of its text unread.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. "THE HOUSE" - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the reason for the sudden stop of the cortege. An ancient CHRYSLER K CAR is parked clear across the road, barring the entrance to the gate of a razor-wire security fence that encircles the premises. Beat. And then a short, slight MAN steps out of the vehicle. In the glare of the Hearses' headlights his features look cadaverous. Between that and the fact he's jittering like a hummingbird on speed, he makes a pretty unsettling presence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Man walks slowly towards the hearses, beckoning the riders out.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(PRITCHETT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the end...by car anyway. What with the '94 quake and El Nino, the driveway's been pretty much destroyed. 'Shame. Have to hoof it from here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The well-tanned Man from Hearse #2 steps out: DR. DONALD W. BLACKBURN -- he could be anywhere from 19 to 90. The only thing that's clear is all the cosmetic surgery he's had makes him look like George Hamilton, circa 1962. He asks the obvious:
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you don't mind me asking... Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Name's Pritchett. Watson Pritchett. I own the house, my father built it. And now I just need to get you into it. So...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
The Camcorder Woman steps out of Hearse #3: a Jenny Jones- clone named MELISSA MARR, 27.
</DIRECTION>
<MELISSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Steven Price and his huge, throbbing checkbook?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELISSA>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not with you, is he? Well, I'm sure he'll turn up any second now... If you'll just come along...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
The Muscular Young Man from Hearse #4 steps out: a good- looking specimen named EDDIE MOSES, 23.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanna know first: to what do I owe this honor? I mean, I never even heard of this guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just the Greeter -- and in that capacity, I now urge you all strongly to --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
And then Sara-as-Jenzen regally alights from Hearse #1.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the million bucks each, that's for real?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
(a forced chuckle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It better be -- he still owes me $25 grand for renting the place for the night! Here, let's get you some illumination so you can make your way safely!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs a flashlight from his car and shoves it in Sara's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just point and walk, sis -- the place is right up --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
-- and as if on cue, a battery of magnesium floods suddenly light up the night like high noon, revealing the House in all its glory.
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
(startled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting high atop a bluff over the Pacific, a sprawling grey-stone structure. One-third Eames, to one-third Wright, to one-third Bauhaus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It might look innocuous in the daylight, but right now it looks like Albert Speer's Playhouse. And underscoring the creepy ambience is MUSIC now blaring from speakers perched atop the gate: Marilyn Manson's screeching Goth-metal cover of "Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of These)".
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice touch, Pritchett: subtle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As a tumor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wish I could take the credit, but --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- guess we know where Mr. Price is now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He must've beaten us all here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Less the place really is haunted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nonsense! Just bad press. All the deaths that occurred inside -- my own father's included -- all perfectly normal fatal accidents.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<MELISSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You better be wrong. I didn't come all this way for "normal."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELISSA>
<DIRECTION>
She starts making her way up the disaster of a driveway. Dr. Blackburn and Sara look at each other and shrug.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They start likewise walking towards the house. The only one left is Eddie. He stares at the little man.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're totally full of shit, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
(brightly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll never know 'til you walk through that door!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie dismisses him with a flap of his hand and sprints to catch up with the others. Pritchett yells after him:
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wouldn't consider getting my check and running it back down here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
No response. Beat. Pritchett gets out of his car.
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't think so. Asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
He starts jittering his way up the drive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GRAND FOYER - SOON AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cold. Flinty. Two stories high and domed, with a stained glass skylight topping it. Despite their varied states of confusion, the four Guests stop in their tracks as they enter, struck dumb with awe.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Jesus H. Christ.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<MELISSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So where's the party?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELISSA>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like we're it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More to the point. Where's our host?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<MELISSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More to the point: what in the name of fuck is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELISSA>
<DIRECTION>
She's pointing up at the stained glass skylight. It seems to depict a Man with dozens of hideous creatures hovering round his head. And above them all looms a huge something with wings and flaming claws.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More of Price's spook-house bullshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at all!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
They turn to see Pritchett's head poking through the doorway -- putting as little of himself as possible inside the house proper.
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Part of the original structure. When it was still an asylum. Guy who ran the place -- Dr. Vannacutt -- found it "inspirational." From some German cathedral a million years ago: "Driving the Demons From the Mind."
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm moved beyond words.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<MELISSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The hint of still weirder shit to come, I can only hope.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELISSA>
<DIRECTION>
She whips the Camcorder to her eye and starts recording every detail of the skylight. Dr. Blackburn rolls his eyes. Pritchett starts calling loudly:
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Price? Mrs. Price? Somebody? Hello??
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pritchett, take it down a couple hundred decibels, what is your problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Problem? No problem -- just want to get my money and get on home -- you know, things to see, people to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs weakly; starts shouting again:
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Price?? Mrs. Price??
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
Melissa Marr continues to shoot up a storm of tape in the room, as overexcited as a five-year-old who's lost her Ritalin.
</DIRECTION>
<MELISSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew this whole place'd be pure gold! Pritchett, point me in the direction of the goddamn ghosts! If I can get something bizarre enough on tape, I think I can parlay it into getting me some kind'a Robert Stack "Unsolved Most- Wacked-Out Home Videos" gig. No more five afternoons a week of sex-change- Nazis-and-the-lesbos-that-love-'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELISSA>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got your own TV show?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<MELISSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The guy whose hair I do has his own TV show. All I've got is a blow-dryer and a dream.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELISSA>
<DIRECTION>
Sara's staring at something that's making her more nervous by the second:
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, excuse me -- but does anybody know any logical reason why those little demons would be moving?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
She's pointing to the skylight.
</DIRECTION>
<MELISSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELISSA>
<DIRECTION>
She whips her camera up at the stained glass. Zooms in. Tense beat. And then lowers the camera, sighing in disappointment:
</DIRECTION>
<MELISSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...birds. Just seagulls or something walking on the glass, goddammit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELISSA>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cheer up: before the night's through, I'm sure one of us'll get hacked to pieces by somebody or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I may start right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
All heads turn again -- standing in the open front doorway, dressed absolutely to kill is a not-terribly-pleased-looking EVELYN STOCKARD-PRICE.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the fuck are all of you??
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
-- and right on that beat: the huge dome of STAINED GLASS above them all EXPLODES!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All heads whip up -- as time seems to stand still -- and it begins raining COLORED SHARDS in the foyer.
</DIRECTION>
<MELISSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh...my...God....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELISSA>
<DIRECTION>
IN SLOW MOTION -- We see the rest of the Guests instinctively start to duck and cover against the deluge -- all except EVELYN who's staring up at the descending projectiles with a profound look of annoyance on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDDIE - notices that a huge DEMON-HEADED GLASS SHARD is hurtling, razor-point-down, for Evelyn's head! With an athlete's reflexes, he hurls his body at hers --
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Jesus, lady! --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
-- tackling her to the floor, the giant SHARD missing her skull by literally a hair. It plunges six inches deep into the parquet, THWANGS like an arrow into a target.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat of absolute sheer STUNNED SILENCE. And then:
</DIRECTION>
<MELISSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELISSA>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone else stares at Evelyn, who's not moving.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is she...alright?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought she was dead. For sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not even fucking close.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(seething; to Eddie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get...off...of...me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
It's like being spit at by a cobra; Eddie doesn't have to be told twice. Leaps off her, and Evelyn slowly, angrily gets to her feet, a trickle of blood coming down her cheek from a small cut there. A VOICE is heard from somewhere O.S.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not dead now, but soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
All eyes look up to see: STEVEN PRICE perched on the balcony rail above them in formal wear, legs crossed, cigar in hand, blowing out smoke through highly bemused lips.
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's been marked for it. The House does that. Happened to Pritchett's father. Likely happen to you all. Isn't that what you told me, Mr. Pritchett?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
(looking away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't remember at the moment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
Blackburn applies his handkerchief to Evelyn's bleeding cheek. She recoils:
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't touch me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm impressed: I don't think Evelyn's ever said those words to anything with genitalia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not laughing, Steven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shouldn't be -- you were nearly just killed, sweetheart.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the guests)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now that our birthday girl is finally here, let the games begin!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Haven't they already?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Price just smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure is a funky old house, ain't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<DIRECTION>
She glares back at him, steaming.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could we have a word?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I think we're going to have several.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn doesn't have to be invited, she's already stomping halfway up the stairs. Price smiles down at the Guests:
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This'll just take a moment -- you'll find food and booze in the main salon, knock yourselves out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn grabs him hard by the arm and yanks him back into the shadows; they disappear from sight. The Guests just stand there.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what? The thing with the glass? Price did that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<MELISSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELISSA>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course he did, for God's sake.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't he, Mr. Pritchett?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't comment until I get paid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm surrounded by idiots.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<DIRECTION>
Blackburn walks off into the Main Salon near the Foyer. The others shrug and follow him, except for Pritchett, who shouts upstairs:
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Price???
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
No response from anyone. Pritchett's eyes jitterbug all around him -- he sees he's standing there alone. As nonchalantly as he can, he quick -- steps towards the Salon and the others -- passing right by a barely perceptible black dot in the wall, no larger than a dime --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRAVELING THROUGH WALLS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and we PUSH IN on this DOT, until we're inside it, on the OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL and see that's it's connected to a COAXIAL CABLE, which we FOLLOW past ancient, decaying beams and mortar, past VERMIN -- rodent and insect, both -- that skitter maniacally right in our faces -- and then right into the innards of the multi-wired CABLE itself -- emerging out near...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A VIDEO MONITOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- that's atop a table with several other monitors and a literal Circuit City's worth of electronic and computer equipment, all of it inside a --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SMALL GRIMY ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- in which sits Steven Price's engineer SCHECTER, in his coveralls, eating a sandwich, as he mans Haunted House Central Control. He hits a combination of keys on the computer. On one of the Monitors we see a door somewhere inside the House rapidly open-and-shut, open-and-shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nods with satisfaction, then YELPS! as he spots a MILLIPEDE wriggling out of his tuna salad, straight into his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHECTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHECTER>
<DIRECTION>
He flicks the insect away, nearly gagging. It lands on another VIDEO MONITOR that is trained on a room on the upper floor of the place. Some space that looks like it was going to be a bedroom, once upon a time: a lot of strange, ultra- modern furniture: all of it metal and of bizarre angles and shapes. And then into that room storms Evelyn and Price.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUSH IN on that video screen and suddenly we're there:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EVELYN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Evelyn slams the door behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gave you a goddamn guest list two pages long -- where the hell are they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shredded. Sorry. Decided to whip up one of my own: a group so hungry for money that they'd be willing to do anything. I thought you'd be more comfortable with your peers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess it was stupid of me not to expect something this twisted from you. Well, congratu-fucking-lations, Steven: Round One, you win.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, not quite. See, those people down there: they aren't the ones I invited.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then who are they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You tell me. I don't know how you managed to hack into my Mac, but: bravo.

Just off the foyer. The furniture, though dust-caked and rotting is antique Deco and sumptuous. Liquor and a lavish buffet have been set out on a sideboard that looks like one of Dali's limp pocket-watches. As Price enters the room grimly, he's descended upon by an angry Pritchett:

Blackburn takes the liquor and begins cleaning/disinfecting Pritchett's wounds.

	A mechanism. From the old Asylum. For Emergencies. Sealed the whole place shut. Top to bottom. That's how come they all burned to death in '31. Dr. Vannacutt threw the switch. If he was gonna die, they all were gonna die, and so they were toast.

Sara glares at her, but does as she's told: goes to the large ebony casket that supports Evelyn's BIRTHDAY CAKE. Sara looks back at Evelyn suspiciously... then sets the cake aside and lifts the lid.
</DIRECTION>

Inside that, seemingly free floating in space, are SIX MINI- COFFINS -- no more than eight inches long, their doors likewise propped open, revealing inside each a gleaming new GLOCK 9mm AUTOMATIC. Each pistol black gunmetal in color, of course.

-- a flurry of crackling SPARKS showers Watson Pritchett as he twists the '20's vintage knob light switch. He leaps back with a frightened yelp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a brief BURST OF LIGHT from the ancient sconces on the walls, revealing a series of moldy, cobwebbed and rubble- strewn basement gallery, and a series of five glass cases filled with the mummified remains of human bodies... One very odd human figure rides upon a mummified horse.

INT. BASEMENT GALLERY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An odd multi-walled gallery from which five corridors lead out, extending like the spokes of a wagon wheel --

-- and then every LIGHT down there SHORTS OUT with one loud SIZZLING POP! Total darkness. Beat.

Suddenly, a terrible cracking sound is heard above Sara's head. She aims her light at the large beam overhead. Just then, the beam gives way. Eddie pulls her away just in time.

</SARA>
<PRITCHETT>

	I said we shouldn't come down here. Very treacherous -- physical and metaphysical levels, both. There've been no refurbishments to this part of the house -- it's exactly as it was in 1931.

ANGLE ON THE DOOR

The light glints on a HUGE STEEL DOOR. A grime-covered WINDOW is set at eye-level. A black mold corrodes away the edges.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing? That seems like quite a door to hold back "nothing".

	The Soul of the House. Everything that's corrupt about it... My father trapped it in there just before he died. You see, he purchased the house to restore it... We were going to live here... Nothing can live here. I was just a kid... The first time I saw it, I thought it was beautiful... It was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room... then it started to move... then death started to happen... First the workers.. six in all... then my father...

Pritchett's oblivious: he's shining his light back down the corridor -- at its terminus it splits into four new corridors.
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we go down there and take a right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>

The trio follow Pritchett. WE remain staring at the STEEL DOOR. Almost imperceptibly -- or is it the darkness playing tricks on us? One of the streaks of mold seems to have grown longer.

INT. ELECTRO-SHOCK ROOM

<DIRECTION>
a small room containing a large leather table with a myriad of mildewed buckle-straps attached. Behind the table: a monolithic brass and wood DYNAMO that looks powerful enough to keep Orange County lit for a year.
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Electro-shock therapy. There's several of them hooked together... Dr. Vannacutt liked to zap his patients in multiples of ten. More enerqy-efficient or something. Let's try a left.

EDDIE and SARA linger, staring at the big, cast-iron capsule- shaped contraption. We hear Pritchett's Voice in the distance, explaining:
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	New wrinkle on an old theory for treating schizophrenia. 19th Century, I think: what would drive a sane man mad should make a madman sane. The Vannacutt version was: bombard the patient with aural and visual stimuli far more frightening than any hallucination they could ever produce, it'd traumatize 'em back to "normalcy."

PULL BACK -- And we see, simultaneously, Pritchett, Price and flashlight walking down the corridor that was to their left -- Eddie and Sara walking down the one that was to their left: a long, snaking passage going in the completely opposite direction.

INT. HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS

<DIRECTION>
VIDEO IMAGE: A DARKENED HALLWAY rife with grainy shadows. The image cruises down the corridor, peering into the twisting passageways that intersect our path as we drift like some Flying Dutchman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and we see that we've been watching from the POV of Melissa Marr's CAMCORDER. She's gliding up and down the hallway, eye glued to the viewfinder, taking in every square inch of the place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV CAMCORDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bumps and pits in the carved-stone CORRIDOR walls are becoming more vivid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Melissa seen taking a left into ANOTHER HALLWAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV CAMCORDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
an ODD SHADOW plays in the corner at the end of this new hallway. The CORRIDOR appears to grow smaller, more claustrophobic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Melissa letting loose a half-uneasy, half-exhilarated gulp. She stops walking. Slowly lowers the Camcorder, scans the end of the hall with her naked eye:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Other than having the creepy ambience as the rest of the house, the hall appears normal again: large and long without a trace of anything extraordinary. She returns her eye to the viewfinder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV CAMCORDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the SHIFTING SHADOW she saw before disappears into an OPEN DOOR at the end of the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<MELISSA>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Curiouser and curiouser. We're talking a fifty share, minimum.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELISSA>
<DIRECTION>
-- just then: a murmur of MANY VOICES heard around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Melissa lowers the CAMCORDER, eyes darting everywhere, scared -- but she sees nothing. CAMERA back up to her eye. She moves to the doorway. As she turns the corner, we see the PATTERN ON THE WALL. It is really a painting done in ANAMORPHOSIS - it has now become a terrible Gothic demon, ready to strike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV CAMCORDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We reach the vault-like door and peer down the steps that disappear into a pool of darkness. The VOICES heard again. Indistinct basso. Emanating from somewhere below. We descend down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MELISSA comes to a stop at the bottom of the stairs: her eyes go wide at the sight before her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILD IMAGES painted by some long-dead madman, start on the floor, sweep up across the wall and onto the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHE PEERS CLOSER, sees: that they're images of torture and death painted in blood. MELISSA stares at them, wide-eyed. She puts the camera back up to her eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV CAMCORDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the IMAGES come alive: WRITHING in AGONY, what passes for their mouths open wide in silent screams. Melissa is awe- struck:
</DIRECTION>
<MELISSA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck me bald.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELISSA>
<DIRECTION>
She moves down the corridor to a room at the end. A sign proclaims "CEREBRAL HYGIENE". As she nears, the voices grow louder. And now mixed in with them are terrible MOANS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CEREBRAL HYGIENE ROOM -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Melissa enters --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV CAMCORDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A strange room filled with odd devices is laid out before us. Clearly left over from another era, quack electric machines and bizarre instruments line the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the middle of the room, a small group of PEOPLE in white stand huddling urgently around something, their backs to us. A MAN in white, off to the side, is filming whatever it is going on with a spring-wound 16mm CAMERA.
</DIRECTION>
<MELISSA>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELISSA>
<DIRECTION>
And then the Huddled Group whips around, revealing the objects of their-activity:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO HUMANS -- crammed together on one gurney: a Woman in a savaged Nurse's uniform; a Man, in what little is left of his surgical scrubs, a name plate pinned right into his flesh: "Vannacutt."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both SCREAMING like banshees as they're being VIVISECTED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is the identical image we saw on the B&W footage from 1931 at the beginning of the movie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a GASP, MELISSA pulls the camera from her eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at the room: the equipment is all there but the room is completely EMPTY of anything living.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lets out a small sigh of relief and TURNS to leave --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and suddenly in front of her is... THE PATIENT... that Vannacutt and Nurse had originally been dissecting. He's jittering so fast he's a blur. And then he lunges at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIN SALON - SIMULTANEOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SCREAMS of Melissa Marr echo wildly in the room -- long, agonized HOWLS that just grow louder and louder. Everyone looks up in alarm -- with the exception of Evelyn, whose sole focus is on pouring herself a new drink.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could be old Melissa found what she was looking for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
As the SCREAMS grow even more hideous, Price and Guests dash out of the room. Pritchett downs the rest of his huge tumbler of Scotch, then proceeds very halfheartedly after them -- and then the SCREAMS stop. Pritchett sits back down in his chair, pours another drink.

</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Sara holds up her finger: it's drenched with fresh blood. And with it, she points into the empty room. On the tile is a wide, red and glistening DRAG MARK leading from the doorway to the foot of the half-rotted... OPERATING TABLE.
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus.

Price and Blackburn run into the room. Blackburn kneels down, examines the drag mark. Utterly baffled and not a little unnerved:
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It just...stops here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<DIRECTION>
Sara sticks her head in the door, nervously:
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe....maybe she went up on the table.

Price runs a finger along the table bed; he's able to dig a trench the entire length of it through the three-inches-deep worth of dust.
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody, nothing's been on this in...67 years.

Eddie stomps into the room, frightened and frustrated, trying to make sense of it all:

	Well, she went somewhere! She didn't just up and disappear into thin air!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...not air --

</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
The three men turn to look at her -- Sara's staring at something above them: a spot on the... CEILING directly over the Operating Table, where the bloody DRAG MARKS resume, continuing all the way to the point where concrete ceiling meets equally solid wall, and then vanish altogether.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>

Everyone present, Pritchett included, starts gravitating towards Sara and the desk. She hits the STOP button on the Camcorder.

She punches PLAY. And we see on the

soundless: a vision of free flight -- the lens capturing what it saw as it dropped to the ground: a wild, herky- jerky, ass-over-teakettle melange of --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WALL/CEILING/MARY'S HAIR -- and, finally: FLOOR as the lens smacks TILE, fractures into a starburst of cracks, topples onto its side. And through this veil of JAGGED, SPIDERY LINES, we see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARY'S HAND drop into frame -- lie still for a moment -- and then start VIOLENTLY SPASMING, as a BLOODSTORM starts spattering it from O.S. Until the color of her flesh can no longer be seen --

A METAL CRUNCH is heard from inside the CAMCORDER, and the image on the screen goes to BLACK.

No one moves -- they're all frozen there, staring at the dead screen. Beat. And then: the sound of light APPLAUSE is heard.

Heads turn towards its source, and we see:

He whips Schecter around in his swivel chair -- and comes literally face-to-face with -- a Man who no longer has a face! It's like someone took a giant melon-baller to Schecter's head, scooping out everything -- just leaving the rind that's the interior wall of his skull. Well, mostly everything: there's still bits of bloody brain pulp hanging from the bone. Needless to say: he's dead.

Pritchett on his hands and knees going through a large cabinet, tossing books and papers over his shoulder in a frenzy of frustration.

INT. CORRIDOR - MAIN FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie and Sara drop their arms from the window, exhausted. But there is now a space about two inches wide between IRON GRATE and OPEN WINDOW.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can do it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, with three days and a blowtorch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a thousand years old -- we just need a crowbar or something to get leverage -- the sucker'll pop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No prob: I'll just hop down the hardware store --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- no. The basement -- the room with all the controls to this thing: big long iron levers just lying there --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- not a chance -- there's too much weirdness down there I don't think even bullets are gonna stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're starting to sound like Pritchett.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
-- and then the LIGHTS zap to BLACK and Sara SHRIEKS --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Pritchett shrieks as the LIGHTS ZAP BACK ON -- blinding -- then OFF AGAIN -- then ON --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the lights in the wall sconces are strobing like an epileptic's worst nightmare. The sheer schizo-psychedelia of it all has Dr. Blackburn frozen in his tracks --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- as is Price.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- then the SOUND starts. Price is first to hear it -- it puts an expression on his face like someone is ramming both eardrums with icepicks over and over again:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LOUD CRACKLING ELECTRIC SURGE -- on-again, off-again, in direct sync with the dimming of the lights. What makes it so especially unsettling is the noise that accompanies each Sledgehammer Surge: a straining, strangulating CRY. A noise like a calf would make as its throat is slit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light-show be damned, Price leaps down the stairs, sprinting towards the Noise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- likewise Dr. Blackburn --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

INT. BASEMENT GALLERY - CONTINUOUS

Price spies Blackburn at the other end of a Corridor, shouts over the Noise to him:
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is it??
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<DIRECTION>
Sara and Eddie appear, spot them; Sara shouts:
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it??
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something with the power, I don't know!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<DIRECTION>
And then Pritchett is seen at the far end of another Corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's down there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
He's pointing to a long corridor - a light strobes at the end.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's down there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
(awe-struck)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The...Fourth of July.

</PRITCHETT>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you babbling, you lunatic??

And then clarity comes to Price's eyes.

	Electro-shock.

INT. HALLWAY/ELECTRO-SHOCK THERAPY ROOM - BASEMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and the Noise suddenly stops. The lights stop pulsing. Pitch dark and dead quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie squints and points at something deeper in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's something --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
-- MOVING inside the Room. Blackburn lashes his arm out, stopping anyone from going any further into the room. He whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move, don't make a sound...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<DIRECTION>
In the darkness, in the distance, they can make out
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN ANIMATE PRESENCE at waist level. Pale. With something flowing from its sides, almost wing-like. And it's squirming, undulating like a snake -- and then, softly this time, that calf-like cry. High-pitched, almost female- sounding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Price ducks under Blackburn's arm and starts walking slowly into the room, towards it. No one tries to stop him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON PRICE as he gets closer, and can see that whatever it is, it's perched atop one of the TABLES --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the CRY -- and Price steps closer, and he can make out to the side of the table, something that looks like....a hand?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the CRY -- closer now: a hand discerned -- human -- with rings on the fingers, polish on the nails --
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Ms. Marr...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<DIRECTION>
-- no response -- just the CRY -- Price reaches out to touch that hand --
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it Melissa??
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
-- a look of horror comes to Price's face:
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OH JESUS NO!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<DIRECTION>
-- and then lights flash BLINDING WHITE -- and the bug-eyed face of EVELYN STOCKARD-PRICE is seen -- screaming that CRY through the RUBBER BITE-DOWN that's been taped tight to her teeth --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- her head, her torso, her limbs BUCKING like they're jet- propelled against the leather straps restraining her --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- as the MASSIVE VOLTS of electricity from the DYNAMO she's wired to punch into her like ten thousand razors at once --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and Price reaches for her instinctively --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- only to have Blackburn lunge in and yank his hand away --
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- are you crazy!?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<DIRECTION>
-- and for a moment all anyone can do is watch as Evelyn gets jolted and slammed again and again and again -- and sparks fly from the electrodes on her head and smoke starts to billow --
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn it off!! Somebody turn the damn thing off!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<DIRECTION>
En masse, the Guests charge into the room, scrabbling everywhere around the DYNAMO, looking for a wire, anything they can use to stop the current ripping through her body --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and Price is near-insane, smashing buttons, yanking switches off their moorings as he watches the pupils disappear from the eyes of his bucking, jerking wife --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and Sara pulls a cord from a socket in the wall and nothing happens --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and Blackburn spies something running down the table leg --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and Price is literally SCREAMING --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and Blackburn yanks the table-leg wire with all his might --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and everything stops. The light show. The screaming. The smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and Evelyn, too. Her body drops back down on the table with a horrible THUD. Her eyes stare sightlessly. Blackburn leans over her. Head to her chest, a finger to her neck. Beat. And then he stands back up straight.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- she's not dead! Just have to get her heart pumping aqain!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mouth-to-mouth!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Price yanks the bite-piece from Evelyn's mouth -- a plume of purple ARTERIAL BLOOD spews from her lips and cascades all over her face.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Jesus....
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Adrenaline -- in your bag, Blackburn, you must have --

<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- even it we were in the E.R., Price: it's too late -- her heart's burst!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<DIRECTION>
Price puts his ear on Evelyn's chest -- listens -- his face falls.
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<DIRECTION>
Sara puts two fingers to Evelyn's wrist pulse. Feels.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Even Pritchett gets into the act, taking the flashlight and shining it into Evelyn's fixed pupils.
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They don't get any deader.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
Price strokes his wife's hair, tears begin to form in his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<DIRECTION>
With his other hand, Price begins to unbuckle the restraints.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I...don't think...anybody should be touching the body.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'll do what I damn well please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's right, Price. It's a matter for the police.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<DIRECTION>
He takes Price's hands firmly and removes them from Evelyn.
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is in-fucking-deed. At the risk of stating the obvious: this wasn't exactly a goddamn suicide.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<DIRECTION>
He smacks the now-loose steel-and-leather restraint with his hand -- in the tense silence of the room, the buckle BANGS like a GUNSHOT against the table, over and over again.
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	House 2, Guests 0.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think, Pritchett, we've got a situation here that even you can't explain away as "ghosts." This is ice- cold homicide by person -- or persons --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<DIRECTION>
He glares furiously at his Guests.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- not entirely unknown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
She cocks her pistol and aims it at Price.
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Convenient place to point blame, hon', but this time, the only wrong one: for all I know, somebody should be pointing that gun at you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head and keeps the gun where it is.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was upstairs with Eddie --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- that's the fact, bud --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- where the hell were you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Upstairs, too. Come with me, I'll show you another body, a friend of mine named Schecter --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- what was he doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Running all the bells and whistles we set up to scare hell out of everybody --

</EDDIE>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- yeah, we did that --

</PRICE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- the window and door grates --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- no -- that's when everything went ragtime -- whoever else is in this house has been doing everything since -- I thought it was Evelyn --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- which is why you killed her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<DIRECTION>
And now he takes his pistol and cocks it at Price.
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was upstairs!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never saw you --

</SARA>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I did: down here.

</BLACKBURN>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Pritchett, you're not joining this necktie party?

</PRICE>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was upstairs looking for... well, uh... moral support. I don't know what's going on down here, but I like you, and if you say the house didn't kill your wife --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
Pritchett fumbles out his pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- then I guess then it had to be you. Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God -- I was afraid I'd be lynched without a quorum.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you've got a gun on you, Price, I'd hand it over now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not just yet. Would any of you be interested in knowing exactly why I ended up here in the basement?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fascinated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was chasing after somebody I saw in the salon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, really: who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't catch his or her name, just followed them down here. Somebody all in white surgical gown.

(suddenly terrified)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vannacutt!!

</PRITCHETT>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or somebody wanting me to believe that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then just wait -- maybe this whoever's got you next on the Asylum's equipment- test list. Maybe a literal mind-blow inside the "Saturation Chamber."
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take my chances.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I can't, sweetheart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<DIRECTION>
And now Price produces his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If there really is someone else in this house, I think the four of us can handle the situation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think one of you has been part and parcel of making this situation!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The gun, Price; hand it over: now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Price cocks his pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't test me, I'm real prepared to use this to stay alive --

<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- you lose either way, Price --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- listen to the man --

</SARA>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- listen to me, goddamnit --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- no more --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- she reaches for his gun --
	</DIALOGUE>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- no!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<DIRECTION>
And Price pulls the trigger right in her face!
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NO!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Only...there's no explosive report, no whine of bullets -- just this CLICK! CLICK! CLICK! from Price's gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room freezes for a moment -- wide-eyed shock all around. Price looks down at his Glock: the weld on the clip's been broken.
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who fucked with my gun??
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<DIRECTION>
Freeze broken: Eddie lunges for him.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sonovabitch!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
And he tackles Price to the floor, punching the gun from Price's grasp and nailing him in the face a few times for good measure. Price is down for the count.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pritchett walks towards the stairs. Blackburn looks to Sara:
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what do we do? We've got to hold him somewhere 'til the police --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- the "Saturation Chamber." Where he wanted to put me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Pritchett stops in his tracks on the stairs, alarmed.
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would drive a madman sane would drive a sane man mad.

	I need a drink. Anyone wants me, I'll either be upstairs or dismembered.

<DIRECTION>
INT. SATURATION CHAMBER ROOM - JUST AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Price lets out a scream as Eddie SLAMS the door to the "Saturation Chamber". Price's face appears in the small porthole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara twists the WHEEL that seals tight the cast-iron, capsule- shaped device. Asks Blackburn:
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty old and rusted out -- you sure this thing'll hold him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Through the single small window on the side, we can see a furious, panicked Price slam his full weight against the inside of the door. It doesn't budge a millimeter.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't think it'll be a problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(to Eddie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Through the Chamber window, we see Price make another futile CRASH against the door.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shouldn't somebody like, stand guard or something -- just in case?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll stay, if it'll ease your mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure? You'll be alright by yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Blackburn pats the gun in his jacket pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not worried.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<DIRECTION>
Sara nods, takes Eddie's hand and disappears up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blackburn and Price stare at each other on opposite sides of the tiny window. Price is screeching something at him, but we can't hear a word through all that iron.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't quite make that out -- what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<DIRECTION>
Price silently bellows.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to see how this thing works? Weird request, but okay...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<DIRECTION>
Blackburn leans over and starts twisting dials and flipping every switch he can find on the CONTROL PANEL of the capsule.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Price look up in alarm: a CIRCLE OF PULSING LIGHTS is dappling down on him. It looks almost quaint: like a Victorian carousel at night.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got to let me know how it all turns out. Professional courtesy and all that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<DIRECTION>
And with Price seen yelling and pounding through the window, BLACKBURN walks away and disappears into the dark of the basement. He passes right by the huge, sealed STEEL DOOR where Vannacutt stashed his corpses. The tendrils of mold on the metal have expanded to the length of a man's arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SATURATION CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Price is down on the floor of the capsule, a look both of fear and an engineer's curiosity on his face, as he stares up at the CIRCLE OF LIGHT that has begun to spin faster and faster --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and then whatever anxiety he has abruptly drops from his face. Aside from a little eye-strain, absolutely nothing's happening to him. He stands and examines the source of the light. Sees on the ceiling of the capsule: it's nothing more than a spinning mirror ball-like apparatus flecked with colored glass. He's unimpressed:

INT. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where we view Price from outside the Capsule. Through its tiny window we see him silently jerk, spasm and scream -- all while standing inside the utterly empty Saturation Chamber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OVER we hear almost bestial-sounding grunts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - SIMULTANEOUS

<DIRECTION>
Sara and Eddie move through the corridor - stopping at every junction. They're hopelessly lost.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>

</EDDIE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>

</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
They scan the maze of interconnecting passageways behind them.

<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good point.

<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to another hallway)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's try down here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
They move in that direction, turning a corner and passing several doorways. Eddie glances at the door they're about to pass and stops.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, check it out.

</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Sara stops and looks at the wire glass door. A nameplate reads: DR. RICHARD B. VANNACUTT
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>

Inside is an amazing collection of debris, partially ransacked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
File cabinets are open and the floor is littered with papers. On shelves are bottles of specimens of body parts and dead sea life, floating in formaldehyde.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara moves over to Vannacutt's desk and begins going through the drawers. Eddie stares at the specimens.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you looking for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe there are notes or drawings of this place, showing how those plates work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie pulls a picture from the wall... The glass is cracked. Sara looks back at Eddie and moves to him.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What've you got?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Class of 1931.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
ECU - THE PICTURE shows the various doctors and nurses in resident. The banner above the corroding image states: THE VANNACUTT INSTITUTE STAFF FOR 1931. Below each face is a name and position.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cheery looking bunch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better living through electricity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Sara notices something about the photo.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit! Now we know how the guest list was made up. Look, these names... Head Nurse, Ruth-Ann Stockard... Bjorn Jensen, Electro Therapy... Jasper Marr, Thomas Steven Price... They're all here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute... What are you saying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone that was invited is related to one of the staff who was here when the place burned. There are five of us...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, another voice is heard...
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And five that didn't die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
Sara and Eddie just about jump out of their skins! Pritchett is standing in the doorway in his usual sloshed condition.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, Pritchett!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Price didn't make the guest list... The house did. It wants vengeance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's a goddamn building gonna send out invitations?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's life, anyway? Waves...? Sound...? Light...? Electricity...? I don't know... Phone lines...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or an on-line computer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's crazy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about that other guy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Schechter? Wrong place at the wrong time... like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie stares at the photo.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't see Blackburn's name on here...

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELECTRO-SHOCK ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Blackburn opens the door to the room and walks grimly into it, staring at Evelyn's dead body, still strapped to the table.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The late Mrs. Steven Price.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<DIRECTION>
From his medical-bag, he removes a scalpel.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tragic, tortured Mrs. Steven Price.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<DIRECTION>
With a blur of quick slashes, he cuts her limbs and torso free of their moldy restraints.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lovely Mrs. Steven Price.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<DIRECTION>
Now accessible, he parts the top of her nightgown. Runs a finger slowwwwly from the tip of her chin down to her bare breasts.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Creamy, cool...and now very cooperative Mrs. Steven Price.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<DIRECTION>
His tongue darts from his lips and he begins planting long, lingering kisses all over her neck --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- FLASH: of a hypodermic being pulled from Blackburn's bag --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Blackburn kissing everywhere around her breasts --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- FLASH: of the air bubbles in the needle being plunged out of the tip: squirt! --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- bubbles of Blackburn's saliva dampening her nipples, his tongue swabbing concentric circles within her aureole --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- FLASH: the needle into the crook of Evelyn's elbow --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Blackburn's mouth dancing down to her belly -- he's begun to hyperventilate with excitement -- and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HAND comes languidly into frame, begins stroking his lush dyed locks --
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've missed you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've missed this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<DIRECTION>
And Dr. Blackburn tosses the hypo away and hoists himself to meet the eager, waiting mouth of the now very alive EVELYN STOCKARD-PRICE -- who starts to vigorously respond to Blackburn's touch. He reluctantly pulls himself away.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what's Steven's status?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- "oh, no, Officer, I'm very much alive -- just a joke to beat my husband at his own clever game -- What? What do you mean he's dead? It's all my fault, I may as well have killed him myself!"
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"But you didn't, Ma'am. We have all these witnesses that saw..." well, whoever it ends up being that finally shoots him --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your "demise."
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what stopped her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's complicated. But don't worry --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- bullshit --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- the whole thing is falling apart!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Blackburn starts stroking her, trying to calm her.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<BLACKBURN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And how the hell are we going to do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLACKBURN>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
-- and in one savage blur of motion, Evelyn drives Blackburn's scalpel right into his chest!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blackburn just stands there motionless, looking at her confused. She clears up any gray areas: thrusting deep and yanking down, gutting him like he's a trout.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIN SALON - UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie trots into the room, carrying the thick base of a wrought-iron floor lamp. To Sara:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the best we're gonna do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll have to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
They start out of the room. Watson Pritchett remains morosely sitting in his chair.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blackburn's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He would have been back by now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Eddie and Sara look at each other: nahhhh. And then:
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey: Dr. Blackburn...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing in response. Sara grabs Pritchett and they head for the basement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT - CORRIDOR - SIMULTANEOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the beautiful blood-caked FEET of Evelyn Stockard-Price seen walking across the concrete.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her gore-sopped HAND seen, traveling upwards -- we follow it --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- as it undoes the lock on the door of the now pitch-dark --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SATURATION CHAMBER ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. And then the inert body of STEVEN PRICE slumps out. Evelyn walks out of frame. Beat. Then a WHIMPER is heard. It seems to be coming from the throat of Steven Price.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT - CORRIDORS - SIMULTANEOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights have begun strobing again. Sara, Eddie and Pritchett move quickly down corridor after corridor --
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Blackburn??
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
-- finally stumbling into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SATURATION CHAMBER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- where the circle of pulsing lights inside the Chamber itself are as bold and blinding as looking into the sun. Lighting up the entire room, they can barely make out a thing -- except:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FACE -- frozen in a scream that's pressed against the capsule's window.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, at least Price is still under wraps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Sara squints. And then her eyes grow wide --
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Blackburn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
-- the FACE in the window comes into focus:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DR. DONALD W. BLACKBURN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trio moves to the Chamber amidst the blinding lights, shield their eyes and throw the door open -- A BODY -- comes tumbling out, the door closing shut behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three of them are in shock. Blackburn's face is still pressed against the window. And then Sara re-opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And they see: there's nothing attached to Blackburn's head, it's just propped in the small sill of the window. And the body on the floor just happens to be missing same.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then Sara sets her teeth, and pulls out her gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT - CORRIDORS - JUST AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara and Eddie on a mission, Glocks in hand and ready, stalking like cats through the maze of corridors.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Price!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's gotta still be down here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Pritchett is less enthused.
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, that crowbar, that window? Maybe we should just call it a --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<SARA_EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Pritchett, shut the fuck up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA_EDDIE>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, dear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Price!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, dear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pritchett -- !
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
And then he sees that Pritchett's staring slack-jawed into the:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MORGUE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the table where the body of Evelyn Stockard-Price once lay is now empty and blood-soaked.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Price, what the fuck did you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie turns, enraged, to Sara. She's nowhere to be seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT CORRIDOR - SIMULTANEOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara is wending her way down a passage, gun now lowered slightly. For what she's in pursuit of is something that seems not only non-threatening, but familiar: a soft, high- pitched VOICE that sounds in pain, crying:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please.....anyone....help me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Melissa...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the love of God....please...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Melissa, it's Sara -- is that you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sara...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep talking, I'll find you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something....happened --
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I'm coming --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- something horrible...I don't understand --
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The Voice is somewhere close now -- within just a few feet of her -- but Sara can see no one.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you can stand, if you can just raise your arm --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
-- and then, from behind a tall pile of stone and mortar rubble, rises a bloody and absolutely terrified
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STEVEN PRICE -- so freaked-out his Voice is just a squeak.
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I woke up on the floor....there was Dr. Blackburn...I don't know what happened!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<DIRECTION>
Sara's surprise quickly fades -- replaced by cold, stone anger.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Price rises and starts to slowly approach her, hands in front of him, stretched in supplication.
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then tell me, please -- help me...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't think so. Stay the fuck back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please! I need your help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not even for a million dollars, Mr. Price.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
-- and Sara squeezes the trigger --
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- no!! --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<DIRECTION>
-- the first shot splits a brick right next to his ear -- pieces flying everywhere --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the next six are all right on torso-target. .45 caliber slugs that make a nice round black hole as they hit him -- huge ragged explosions of blood and meat as they exit. Hideous. Bonnie and Clyde died in their sleep in comparison. Pritchett and Eddie enter on the run.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are you shooting --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
-- and then he sees the riddled Price on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Jesus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor Mr. Price --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- fuck Mr. Price! --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the shaking, wild-eyed Sara in his arms. She doesn't weep, just stands there spasming with shock.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay, everything's okay now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's dead...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie takes one more look at the carnage...
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't think it's even an issue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're safe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uhhhh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay -- I'll admit it: I'm totally, clinically insane. But I'm still the only one who actually got a check tonight. It's yours -- if you just get me the hell out of here now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<EDDIE_SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got yourself a deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE_SARA>
<DIRECTION>
They exit the room, heading for the stairs, not looking back at Price's corpse for a second. Beat. And then, emerging from the shadows, strolls EVELYN who walks over to her husband's body, talking to it:
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Steven, you poor, absolutely clueless geek. All it would've taken was a simple divorce -- and ripping our pre-nup to little pieces.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
She kneels down next to the bioody corpse, whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But no matter how it ended, please know just one thing: from that first moment I set eyes on you, I've always loved... your money. You, personally -- well, frankly just the sight of you has always turned my stomach.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
A HAND suddenly lashes out and grabs her hard by the throat.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that a fact, Princess?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
EVELYN'S EYES widen in horror as she chokes out a GASP: The hand belongs to STEVEN PRICE, and he literally picks her up by her neck and brings her to her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you could have saved us all a great deal of time, not to mention money, if you'd just let me in on it years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<DIRECTION>
With his free hand, he rips off his shirt -- and the blood- squibbed Kevlar vest underneath it.
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This kind of special effects crap doesn't come cheap -- and I had to pay out of pocket! No write-offs here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<DIRECTION>
He begins moving toward her. She instinctively backs away, slowly being cornered in an alcove.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
In the alcove is a door -- a very familiar door -- the sealed steel portal leading to Vannacutt's body dump. The metal is so corroded its surface is misshapen with rust.
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- you must be kidding. You're talking to Steven Price -- every place you've gone, every person you've seen, every word you and Blackburn ever said to each other: bugged, taped, seen and heard as it happened!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<DIRECTION>
He squeezes tighter, now with both hands; she can barely breathe.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Steven --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- anything, sweetheart, you need only speak --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- what...are...you...going...to --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- just what you wanted everyone here to believe in the first place: I'm going to murder you, Evelyn, with the greatest of pleasure --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- wit...nesses --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- witnesses to what? You're already dead, Evelyn! Happy Birthday, baby --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<DIRECTION>
-- and before Evelyn can even let out a gasp, he's SLAMS her up against a door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her body smacks against the rusted metal with a rotted CRACK! The "solid" door EXPLODES inward in a shower of rust. The rest of the door drops with a thud from its moldy hinges, sending Price and Evelyn hurtling down with it, into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DECAYING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stunned for a moment Evelyn and Price suddenly become aware that there is another presence in the room:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
something DARK -- CHURNING -- TERRIBLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EVELYN'S EYES look across the floorboards: the DUST on the floor stands up on end and starts to move like metal filings being pulled by a magnet.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Steven...? Are you doing that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
A dazed Price pulls himself to his feet, he can only hold the cut that the fall has opened on his forehead and stare at the movement on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. OhmyGod, Pritchett was right -- The house IS haunted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
EVELYN tries to right herself. Price's EYES fix on the wall behind her, trembling.
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Evelyn... Get up... NOW!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Steven??
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and follows his gaze:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CREEPING DARKNESS is gathering on the wall behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the Patients -- the Evil -- we've released it --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<DIRECTION>
Price tries to move, but he can't -- just stands there, paralyzed with the surreal horror of it all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EVELYN scrambles to her feet. Price backs up in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<EVELYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NO -- !!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVELYN>
<DIRECTION>
Evelyn BOLTS for the door. She doesn't get far. Because, suddenly THE CHURNING SHADOWY MASS springs forward! Grabbing Evelyn and SLAMMING her back against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to cry out -- but the dark shape on the wall has begun to ENGULF her, literally corroding her flesh!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK TENDRILS like acid-tipped vines, scuttle all over her, eating every inch of her body: Her TEETH drop from their gums, her EYES rot out of their sockets, her RIBS sizzle from her chest -- until she no longer has solid human form --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's just a flat, silent-screaming image burnt/etched flush into the wall -- just like the gruesome images Melissa Marr saw through her Camcorder, "painted" on the corridor walls outside Vannacutt's operating room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Price, every limb shaking, backs out of the room into the --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- his eyes shooting every which way in fear of God-knows- what new nightmare -- it doesn't take long. Subtle at first -- glimpses caught out of the corner of his eye -- of SHADOWS in the room seeming to move:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- PHFT! -- on the ceiling -- Price whips his head up --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- PHFT! -- did he see something on the rear wall -- ?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- PHFT! -- motion from a corner of the floor --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEN all the SHADOWS IN THE ROOM - begin to move together toward the center of the room -- coalescing into one huge MASS OF DARKNESS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Price doesn't hang around to see what happens next -- he bolts from the room -- only to smack right into: AN OLD RUSTED MEDICAL CABINET that swings open to reveal inside one of its doors: a 1920's vintage ANATOMICAL CHART with all the human organs and parts cut up and re-arranged so that they are displayed alphabetically, viewing top-to-bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then Price's whole face goes fright-white: on the inside of THE OTHER DOOR are the organs and parts of MELISSA MARR likewise cut up and alphabetized -- her decapitated head near the bottom, labeled "skull."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Price GASPS and dashes back down the corridor to find that the Mass of Darkness has evolved into a HUGE, constantly morphing THREE-DIHENSIONAL BEING that lets out a nails-on- blackboard SCREECH and charges right for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UPSTAIRS - HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where Sara, Eddie and Pritchett are trying with all their might to pry open the slightly-ajar window -- when they hear:
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was right! Pritchett was right!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
Sara and Eddie dash further down the...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UPSTAIRS KALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... where Price staggers into the doorway that leads to the basement stairs -- frenzied, nearly all his strength gone:
</DIRECTION>
<PRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's...the House!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRICE>
<DIRECTION>
And then the MASS OF DARKNESS swirls into sight from below -- envelops Price -- and sucks him back downstairs, screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door slams shut!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. The three of them just stand there speechless. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- was that??
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something...that should probably be...avoided --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
-- they turn tail and tear from the room, back to
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where they rush toward the partially pried-open window.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The opening's still too small, we'll never get through!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For chrissake give me a hand!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Three pairs of HANDS grab onto the pry-bar and throw all their weight behind it. As they strain and the metal shrieks:
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pritchett: what is going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He must've unsealed the room!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How, he's supposed to be dead!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
A POWERFUL GROAN reverberates through the house: the sound of timbers bending and twisting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDDIE'S HEAD whips right - out of the corner of his eye, something seen MOVING:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DOOR TO THE BASEMENT - it's turning BLACK -- GANGRENOUS -- it's PUTREFYING before their eyes -- bowing in and collapsing as it ROTS.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think...it's time...to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
They whip around and run down the hall toward the living room. As they near the end they are stopped dead in their track.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR POV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WALL nearby TWISTS and BENDS into a new and different WALL -- one with DOORS that now swing open -- leading to some dark oblivion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stare at the sight before them.
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hail Mary, full of grace -- the house is growing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not going to let us out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<SARA>
<DIRECTION>
(sensing something)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It's just trying to frighten us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's succeeding!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All the plates sealing the windows and doors -- there's got to be some way of raising them manually. They didn't just appear out of thin air -- there's got to be pulleys, cables or something, that make them go up and down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the attic?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
The WALL at the end of the corridor is bending and twisting, taking on a new, hideous shape.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you know where it is, get there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me? You've gotta be kidding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
The SHADOW THING rounds the bend at the end of the corridor -- it's enveloped the entire CEILING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pritchett looks at Sara and Eddie plaintively --
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Move!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
-- then BOLTS reluctantly down the hall. Just as THE THING OF SHADOWS drops down from the ceiling; begins spreading out across the floor and sinking into the floorboards. Disappearing. And then a terrible SILENCE.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did it go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
-- and then the FLOORBOARDS of the corridor start EXPLODING in a path toward Sara and Eddie.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said run!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
They race down the corridor. Behind them the floor is ripping up, sending debris into the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara and Eddie dash into another corridor. Shit! A cul-de- sac, terminating with nothing but solid wall. They whip back around, only to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE EXPLODING FLOOR banging a hard right and hurtling straight down the cul-de-sac right for them!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trapped, they just stare terrified and helpless - and then Eddie looks up and spots:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ORNATE CHANDELIER hanging above them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The EXPLODING FLOORBOARDS are nearly upon them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDDIE LEAPS up grabbing the bottom on the fixture. He begins pulling himself up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FLOORBOARD next to Sara's foot detonates -- she screams:
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	EDDIE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs her and pulls her up -- just as every floorboard she's standing on ERUPTS AND GOES FLYING, opening a HUGE CHASM below them!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two of them exchange a glance that is simultaneously I'm okay/you're okay/are we both going nuts? That's when they hear a METALLIC SCREECH above them:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CHANDELIER is ripping out of the ceiling. PING! BAM! Two of the three remaining screws pop free and go flying -- the chandelier's mount takes a 90-degree screech'n'jolt - and Sara's already tenuous grip is lost. She crashes helplessly down into the CHASM, disappearing into the black void below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DECAYING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara lands with a THUD, buried knee-deep in the rotted floor of the room below. The Room -- where Evelyn met her demise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie manages to swing the chandelier over to the side where the floor is still intact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DECAYING ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara's just about cleared her head from the fall -- when her eyes go wide. Looks down: she's SINKING INTO THE FLOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She cries out -- and suddenly everything beneath her just lets go. And she's hurtling like a rock down into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBTERRANEAN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARA lands on her face in some pitch-black space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When her eyes adjust, she sees she's in a vault-like room that is filled with stalaqmite-like MOUNDS OF DIRT AND ROCK. Bizarre geological formations, each one unique in its own skewed way, it appears for a moment as though Sara has fallen across time and space and onto the surface of a planet we don't even have a name for yet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE HOUSE - VARIOUS ROOMS - SIMULTANEOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The full ANGER of this place is now manifesting:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- WALLS writhe and twist in fury, forming
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- STAIRWAYS that shake themselves into splinters of frenzy;
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- CARVINGS in the wainscotted paneling that become animate and turn upon themselves, cannibalizing the writhing, screaming walls that spawned them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDDIE PEERS into the hole in the floor: there is only darkness that seems to go on forever.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sara...? Sara...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBTERRANEAN CHAMBER - SIMULTANEOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Sara tries to pull herself to her feet she sees: DIRT and ROCK beginning to FALL from the strange FORMATIONS surrounding her. And then all becomes clear as to where and who she's with:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beneath all that effluence are the REMAINS of Vannacutt's VICTIMS. Some are missing body parts. Some are only body parts. Some are bound with leather straps as if they were just dumped there after dying on the electro-shock or dissection table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARA, lets out the SCREAM of her life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie hears her and bolts madly down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sara!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
He races toward the stairwell leading to the basement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBTERRANEAN CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara leaps to her feet and tries to reach for the hole in the ceiling - it's just out of reach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she senses something else in there with her. Reluctantly, she turns around:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Shadow Thing appears, festering on the wall. It quickly splits into parts and disappears into the rotted corpses. AND THEY START TO MOVE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rising to life, foul breath bellowing into them, slowly starting to come towards her in a dance macabre --
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (a whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sara.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Sara looks up to see EDDIE in the opening above.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grab my hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
He bends down to grab for her, but she's just out of reach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DECAYING HANDS AND ARMS are suddenly grabbing at Sara, tearing at her clothes, shredding the flesh beneath them bloody with their long, post-mortem nails.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddie!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie takes his jacket off and lowers it down to Sara. She grabs hold, and Eddie begins pulling her up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ATTIC - SIMULTANEOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pritchett finds himself in the cavernous attic, standing before the massive pulley and counterweight system that's the upper half of the lockdown mechanism.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the grooved channel that one of the iron plates slides up and down on, Pritchett can look down and see the Foyer and the plate blocking the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a hand crank attached to a series of block-and- tackles that ultimately connect to the massive counterweight to the front door's plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With all his effort, he turns the crank, but can only manage a half revolution --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- creak-crunch -- but something moved down there! You can hear it! How much, how high, he can't see, but maybe it's enough.
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If there is a God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his full weight behind him and grabs the crank again -- pushes down -- and the thing breaks off in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No-no-no!!!! Why me, why me, you sonovabitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
In hysterical frustration, he throws the broken flange of metal as hard as he can at the wall. He misses the wall entirely and the crank just pinballs impotently between cables and counter-weights with a series of mocking CLANKS! and PINGS!
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whyyyyyyy??????
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
As he tears at his hair, screeching, suddenly he notices light on his hands. He turns, and the:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DIM GLOW from a soon-to-rise sun falls on his face. He SEES:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
that, somehow, all that caroming that his errant crank did has caused one of the IRON PLATES to raise slightly. There is now a THREE FOOT OPENING in the attic dormer window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRITCHETT'S EYES glance nervously upward.
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it too late to take back a couple of things I said?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DECAYING ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie pulls Sara all the way up and out of the subterranean chamber. They slump back on the fetid floor, exhausted.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. And under other abnormal circumstances, I think this would be the time to seriously jump your bones.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better put it on hold 'til we find Pritchett.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't do groups.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie laughs -- and then his mouth stays open with no sound coming out. He's staring as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The area around the hole in the floor begins to turn a familiar black. And is creeping fast towards Sara's shoe.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
She rips her shoes off.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pritchett??
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
They both bolt and head for the basement stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ATTIC - SIMULTANEOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pritchett moves to the window and freedom. He is about to make it outside when he stops.
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, c'mon -- don't grow a conscience now, f'chrissake!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
He continues out the window -- stops again. Looks heavenward, angry and guilty at the same time. Yells to his deity:
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, alright! I won't leave 'em here to die!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
He crabs himself back into the attic, runs over to the grooved channel that the front door's iron plate slides on. Shouts down through the slit to the Foyer:
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I found the way out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIN SALON - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara and Eddie hear the Voice coming from the Foyer:
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anybody still alive? I'm giving you ten seconds! Two-four-six-eight --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
Sara and Eddie dash into the Foyer.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- hey! --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (slightly disappointed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- ten.

</PRITCHETT>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pritchett, is that you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Up here --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ATTIC - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A metallic POP! and PING! is heard. Pritchett's eyes dart to the machinery: a strand of the rusted cable holding the window open has snapped free, and the rest are in an advanced state of fray.
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I think you better hurry -- there's something of a time issue here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GRAND FOYER - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara and Eddie start up the stairs - behind them the hallway is turning black with decay.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Move!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
They race up the stairs --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ATTIC - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- arriving in another part of the attic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara looks around, trying to get her bearings.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pritchett!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
A DISTANT VOICE
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Over here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
The attic is a labyrinth of dangling cables, counterweights and their often neck-high metal moorings. Sara moves toward the sound of his voice, Eddie hangs back, sensing something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARA slowly wends her way through all the mishigas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNSEEN by her, down by her carefully treading feet, the Shadow Mass is filtering up through the slits in the attic's floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARA edges her way around a tall iron fly-rail --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and something grabs at her hand. She's had enough, she reaches back to slug it -- then stops:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Pritchett.
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. It's been a bad enough day --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
-- and now the SHADOW MASS has re-assembled to its new, full enormity. It begins to barrel across the attic towards Pritchett and Sara, who don't have a clue -- Eddie does...
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out ot the way!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Sara turns back toward him. Eddie rushes and pushes her to the side as the Shadow Mass is just about to envelop her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And EDDIE is STRUCK full-force -- he instantaneously turns to a blackened mass.
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddie!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
And then the wind from outside kicks up, blowing EDDIE AWAY like so much powder. And Sara just crumples.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the other end of the attic, the Shadow Mass is TURNING back toward them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pritchett rushes in -- GRABS SARA -- and pulls her towards the small dormer window -- the CABLE holding the plate snaps three of its last four strands --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Pritchett pushes Sara through the window -- just as the CABLE holding the plate finally breaks, trapping Pritchett inside!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's now back to near pitch-black again in there. Pritchett turns to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FACES of all of Vannacutt's VICTIMS taking form in the immense Shadow Mass -- all with that revenge-on-the-living look in their empty-socket eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly from the swirling dark center of the mass... THE FLAMING HEAD OF DR. RICHARD VANNACUTT appears... BLASTING a HOT BREATH at Pritchett, who is freaking out.
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just the contractor's son! I had nothing to do with your current condition!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
The words seem to have little impact on the steadily approaching Mass of Faces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and then suddenly SUNLIGHT POURS in behind him. Sara has pried the plate up with a LIGHTNING ROD -- one that's in the process of bending in two under all the weigh
</DIRECTION>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think if you're coming, Mr. Pritchett, it's now or never.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARA>
<DIRECTION>
The Mass of Faces starts to creep up Pritchett's shoe. With a screech, he flings himself backwards, literally diving through the open window --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- as the LIGHTNING ROD SNAPS -- and the IRON PLATE comes guillotine-slamming back down -- right onto Pritchett's foot!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He screams and hysterically yanks at his ankle --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- his foot emerging safe-and-sound and whole, the shredded remnants of a white sock blowing in the morning sea-breeze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sara and Pritchett exchange looks. They're both missing shoes. They shrug. The sunliqht warms their faces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And in the darkness, we hear a familiar Voice:
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTOPHER_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Police and Coroner arrived at the House on Haunted Hill at 7:30 a.m. Pacific Standard Time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTOPHER_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
FADE BACK UP ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. "HOUSE" - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fleet of milling Cops, Paramedics, Fire Officials, Ambulances, the works. Sara seen getting her legs treated. A blank-faced Pritchett being grilled by L.A. Sheriffs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gurneys toting very full body bags from the house. One gurney carrying a half dozen vary small bags: Melissa Marr, most likely.
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTOPHER_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watson Pritchett told the Police that they need a Sherman tank to get into the house. But when the first officer on the scene tried the front door knob, it opened without so much as a squeak.

We see that what he's saying is true: there's no evidence that anything ever happened here. Even the basement -- the Electro-shock and Saturation Chamber -- appear exactly as when we first saw them. Even the restraints that were cut have been made whole aqain.

	And not one sign of the party's hosts, Steven and Evelyn Price. The only person not surprised by this was Watson Pritchett.

ON THE SCREEN BEHIND HIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE - MORNING

<DIRECTION>
A close-up of Pritchett seen, talking:

<PRITCHETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're part ot the House now. That's the way it works.

BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<CHRISTOPHER_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The truth will likely be never known. Unless on some strange whim, you decide to spend the evening inside the House on Haunted Hill.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night.

And walks O.S. The TV CAMERA pans back to the projection screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the "Terrifying, But True" credits crawl, underneath them we see the old silent black & white footage we've seen before:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CEREBRAL HYGIENE ROOM (B&W)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1931. The "Cerebral Hygiene Room." The rampaging Patients huddling around an operating table. A blur of scalpels and saws as they viciously vivisect Dr. Vannacutt and his Nurse, crammed together on the same gurney.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE IMAGE FREEZES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the TV show credits end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But before it fades out, we see that something has changed in this footage:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two Humans being vivisected on that gurney are different:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Doctor in surgical scrubs has Steven Price's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His nurse is Evelyn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pritchett's Voice heard as the image starts to fade:
</DIRECTION>
<PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It won't stop until it's got every one --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRITCHETT>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
