INT. LIMBO RADIO

He is 20, normal looking, not too nebbish, punkish, bookish, or stylish. He is a high-strung guy, enjoying a rare moment of un-self-consciousness.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's an old joke. It comes from "The Iliad," but I think it was popularized by Oscar Wilde. It goes like this: ...A bear's taking a shit, like, out in the woods one day. And he sees this rabbit, also taking a shit. The rabbit, wait, I mean, the bear, he's shitting up a storm, cuz he's been eating Mexican. The wiping's taking forever, and his shit keeps sticking to his fur. Wait, what happens next? Oh, right-- he asks the rabbit if he ever has trouble wiping. The rabbit says no, shit just slides right off him. So the bear picks the rabbit up and wipes his ass with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause, as if for applause)

	Well, I never said it was a good joke. And see, that makes it perfect, because it's pretty much the story of my life.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Growing up, my parents were huge Woody Allen fans. Still are. Personally, I hate him. Same thing with the Beatles, such a part of my background that I must have been about 16 by the time I realized how useless it was to rebel by ignoring the Beatles or any other cultural artifact of their generation. Even if I did spend my childhood hearing my father go on and on about how, like, Nirvana would never mean anything because they're not the Beatles, blah-blah. I don't know, this is all starting to sound a little bit too angsty, you know, and that's about the last thing I'm going for here... Shit, I really got off track there, didn't I?

As Max shakes his head, a hanging RADIO MIKE comes into view. It has the call letters of a college radio station on it.

INT. MAX'S CHILDHOOD HOME ­ FLASHBACK ­ DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YOUNG MAX, about five, sits on the floor and watches BANANAS with his FATHER, a large, relaxed man with a mustache who reclines in a tacky 80's chair and smokes a cigar.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, like the Beatles thing­ and this is the point of that whole long-winded example­ I was force-fed Woody Allen from a young age. I remember watching Bananas when I was about five. Of course, I hated it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Young Max is laughing hysterically at the screen.

Max stands to the side, watching his younger self and his father. The radio mike hangs in front of him.

INT. MAX'S SECOND HOME ­ FLASHBACK

In pajamas, ADOLESCENT MAX, 16, watches a newer TV in an identical family room. This time, ANNIE HALL is playing.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah. This wasn't the first time I saw Annie Hall, but it was the first time I actually appreciated it. I was flipping channels on a Saturday afternoon, and there it was, and I was stunned to find I loved it, more stunned to find that my parents may have had a point all along. Although, they were definitely wrong about Bananas.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God, high school. I hated this place. I was a Junior when I gave up trying to fit in. Fortunately, being a social outcast is a lot easier when your school is filled with idiots.

Adolescent Max gets hit in the face with a volleyball. Everyone laughs at him, including the COACH.

Max stands to the side and winces.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was something in Annie Hall I identified with. Maybe it was the style of humor, or the defeatist attitude, I don't know. All I know is, I kept going back. Different people are inspired by different things, and my source of inspiration became a 20-year-old movie about a failed relationship.

INT. RADIO STATION -- PRESENT

From behind Max, we see the station as it really is: small, dark, cramped, and totally filled with crap. Max wears headphones, sits before a large console and audio gear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He now holds a volleyball.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So after high school I ended up here. There was never really any choice, not going to college was not an option. Of course, I brought Annie with me. Good thing, too. Watching it quickly became about the only thing I could count on to go right.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jeez, this must have been the very first time. What's Amy doing here? I'm pretty sure Amy wasn't here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
AMY is attractive, bookish, and sitting on Max's bed. CHARLES, a skinny guy in a large chair, tries to get her attention by wiggling his eyebrows seductively.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max puts the tape in the VCR, hits rewind, and moves to sit on his bed. He pauses when he sees how close he'll come to Amy. Finally, he climbs over her and awkwardly sits at the far end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amy watches, rolls her eyes, and looks at BETH, who shakes her head sadly. Beth is pretty in an earthy way, spunky and sad at the same time. She looks sympathetically at Max, who is trying not to act nervous (and failing).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The couple is SAM, who's short and charismatic, with a cool, slightly punkish personal style; and JEN, same height, cute and serious, conservative dress. They lie on the floor together.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (TO CAMERA)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Sam and Jen. Sam was the alpha- male of our group, which tends to consist mostly of zeta-males. He had been going out with Jen a couple weeks and we were all waiting to see if she would change him...

Sam slides a pillow under her.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you comfortable, honey?

</SAM>
<JEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine, Sam. I was worried about you. Sure you don't want me to move over?

</JEN>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no, no, Jen, if you're happy, I'm happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Max and Charles exchange a look-- there they go again. Max makes a show of putting a pillow under a large Darth Vader doll. Beth laughs, Amy is amused. Sam looks back and is embarrassed. Jen rolls her eyes and gives Sam a look.

	Uh, thanks, I guess. Does that mean you liked it?

</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Max and Amy stand and face each other as the lights fade to black around everyone else.
</DIRECTION>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't say I liked it, I said it reminded me of you. It reminded me of what I didn't like about you, the cynicism, the neurotic insecurity, and oh yeah, when you started calling me every day. All the reasons we were never more than friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMY>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, at least you're being honest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<AMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I'm being honest. This is a fantasy extrapolated from a flashback. How could I lie to you?

The movie is Annie Hall. The theater is emptying. Suddenly, ERICA bursts through the crowd. Erica is mad. Max follows behind her, placating.

<ERICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	AND WHAT IS IT WITH JEWISH MEN AND THEIR PENIS ISSUES?!

Max freezes in place. The entire crowd of students turns to look at him. He manages a weak smile and turns back to Erica, but she's gone, out the doors into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max turns back to the crowd and shrugs, but the crowd turns away. Max suddenly sees someone: Beth, looking at him. He blushes, self-conscious, and hurries away.

<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or incredibly sad. I'm amazed I'm the only one who can tell. Take any couple. If it's not incompatible lifestyles, it's conflicting priorities. If it's not that, it's usually clashing levels of self- esteem. It's always something.

	This morning, we were skipping class.

</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Max and Charles walk across the quad towards us. At first, they are only specks in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Max, you're insane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's ridiculous that even at a liberal school like this, I have to put up with anti-Semitism.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you got a C minus! Don't you think you're getting carried away?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He couldn't just fail me, think about it. The paper was about my grandparents' experience in the Holocaust.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your paranoia has always been out of control, but this is absurd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't understand, you're not Jewish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neither are you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the professor probably thinks I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And wasn't that the paper that you handed in two weeks late?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what else? I think he might be German.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Professor Wang? Will you stop it...

</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
We can now see that Charles has a fedora cocked back on his head, and is wearing incongruous "Vegas" clothes.
</DIRECTION>

They walk past and into the University Center.

INT. UNIVERSITY CENTER -- CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a low-traffic time of day.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what do you want to do tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not sure. It is the beginning of the semester, it's time for our Annie Hall night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever noticed that the more Annie Hall you watch, the less successful you are romantically? I think we'd do much better if we watched, say, Ocean's 11.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about? If you're sick of Annie Hall, that's one thing, but don't blame our sad little lives on it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GENERAL STORE -- CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charles picks out breath mints.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm telling you, I was thinking about this over break. Ever since we started watching it, what has your love life been like? And mine? Every semester, we watch this movie, and then spend the semester alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alone? Last semester you hooked up with like a dozen women.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know actresses don't count.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(POIGNANTLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm looking for a meaningful, sophisticated relationship. Like Frank and Ava. No more shallow dames for this cat.

</CHARLES>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(AGITATED)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did you get this grudge against my favorite film?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just kidding around, Max. We'll watch it tomorrow. Tonight, there's a party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And anyway, your theory fails to account for our collective dorkiness and bad haircuts. Plus, look at Sam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam hasn't seen Annie Hall since freshman year, and he's in his third year with Jen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So look at what not watching can do to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ouch. Why are you still on this? I said I was kidding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>

INT. RADIO STATION -- PRESENT
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>

INT. COMMON ROOM -- MAX'S SUITE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max's dormitory suite: four bedrooms off a common room, which has three battered couches, a coffee table, and in a corner, several small fridges and two televisions in a pile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christmas lights are still up. A neon `Guinness' sign dwarfs it all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max and Charles are here, standing, while Sam and Jen sit on one couch and SCOTT and AMANDA sit on the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charles puts on his gloves and coat.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Max, you're coming and that's the end of it. When's the last time you went to a party?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who cares? It's unnatural. If I went into a stranger's house and ate their food under any other circumstance, I'd be arrested.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not taking no. With Sam on board, it's gonna be like old times.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
He gestures at Sam, who stands. Unlike the hipster from freshman year, Sam now resembles a middle-aged accountant. There are bags under his eyes and square clothes on his back.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I haven't been out with you guys in ages.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Jen looks up from her magazine with disapproval.
</DIRECTION>
<JEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEN>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw, honey, just for a little while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<JEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I have to work until midnight. It's not my fault the supervisor won't let me out of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEN>
<DIRECTION>
She glares. He teeters between his friends and his girlfriend. His girlfriend wins. He sits back down, trying to hide his disappointment.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She has a point, guys. I should catch up on my chemistry reading anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
The guys roll their eyes, let down but unsurprised.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the room are SCOTT, perpetually poker-faced and reserved, and AMANDA, understated, with the subdued manner of a long-suffering wallflower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sits off to the side, sneaking looks at Scott. He's watching a golf-related infomercial.
</DIRECTION>
<AMANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So Scott... How come you're not going out with Charles and Max?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMANDA>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't go. Graphic design work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<AMANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh really? I have work, too, but it's okay, I got a lot done today. What do you have to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMANDA>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Graphic design work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
TOMMY enters. He's preppier than anyone else, conservative clothes capped off by a goofy smile and thick glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's up, all?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tommy, at last. Save me from this lounge lizard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, what are you doing tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Physics lab. Fortunately, the semester's just begun, so before the work piles up, I can party. That's why the beginning of the semester rules.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great, so come party with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't, I have physics work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
He disappears into his room. Charles takes Max's hat from a hook, jams it on his head, and shoves him towards the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COLLEGE APARTMENT ­ LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A typically lame college party, still early in the night. The furniture is "student budget modern" type. A jazz record plays quietly, while pretentiously-dressed PARTY-GOERS sip wine and eat cheese and crackers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max and Charles survey the room, drinks in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cheers to a new semester, full of potential that will surely go to waste.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
They toast.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is it, I'm telling you. This is the semester I pass all my classes and meet the dame of my dreams.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good luck, and may she have a sister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More importantly, may she grant us our occasional freedom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, forget about Sam. I don't like it any more than you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's become a total non-entity. Freshman year, we were like Frank and Deano. Now it's like Frank and freakin' Peter Lawford.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, he was one of my best friends. Now we share a room and he's like a stranger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hottie at 3 o'clock. Keep an eye on her for me so it doesn't look like I'm interested.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, right, then if you fail to sodomize her, you'll blame me. Me, or Annie Hall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, all I said was, it would explain our lives.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The problem is, every crazy theory explains something. I took a class last semester with a professor who claimed that the planet is being destroyed by white, male, meat-eating capitalists.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So? Everybody knows that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But she had a theory that explained how: apparently racism, sexism, socialism, environmentalism, and vegetarianism are all inherently linked. I brought a Big Mac to the first class, and I thought I was going to be the victim of a vegan- socialist uprising.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Sam walks in and makes a beeline for the guys. Excitement.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! I made it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow, the laws of nature have stopped working. Maybe I should try to meet some chicks after all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd you get away?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told her I was going to the lab. She doesn't mind if I'm working while she is. How's the party?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sucks. Who are they trying to be, with this wine and cheese? What kind of party doesn't even have beer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can get into this. It's better than those frat parties. Check out the fox in the beret.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, it's so good to be out. Between Jen, homework, and labs, I hardly have time for anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could always change your major. You'd have a lot more free time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel the same way about science that I do about Jen. It's a lot of work, but it's worth it. I have doubts about both, actually. But still, what could be dumber than changing your major for a girl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Changing your girl for a major.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you do it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wouldn't be an issue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course not, when has studying ever interfered with what's important, like video hockey or your radio show that nobody listens to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I meant, I'd have to have a girl first. And lay off the radio show. There's a reason I took the 3am slot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And every time I see you doing homework, you're taking a break. You're the best I've ever seen when it comes to procrastinating.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should be, procrastination is one of my favorite hobbies. Isn't it funny that my two favorite hobbies rhyme?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>

Charles' expression turns sour as he looks across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, shit, Sara's here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
SARA, good-looking and excitable, arrives with a theatrical flourish. Her age and manner indicate, among other things, that she is a freshman.

Sara sleeps on a couch. Charles, wearing only boxers, hung over and mostly asleep, passes through the living room. He stubs his toe and crashes into the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ow! Shit! Ow!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>

He continues into the bathroom. Sara wakes up and looks around groggily. A FLUSH. Charles walks out of the bathroom and blinks at Sara with surprise.

</SARA>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just that, I mean, I'm just surprised to see you here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<SARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm, yeah, I must have shown up after you came back, or something. I was planning to go home, but I guess I fell asleep.

She waits for something from Charles. He doesn't respond. She reluctantly gets to her feet.

<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>

	No, I mean, I thought I heard you fall or something.

</CHARLES>

<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The toe's the least of it.

</CHARLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is funny, in a way. Yesterday you were complaining about not having any girls. Now you're complaining because you have one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. It's a shame. And I was attracted to her once, too. What happened?

</CHARLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want me to tell you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! I think I've heard enough from the Nostradamus of failed relationships to last a lifetime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Speaking of failed relationships, I was thinking about your Annie Hall theory. Specifically, I was thinking that you're insane.

<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said I was joking, so why do you keep bringing it up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MAX>

<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your attitude's too dour. You've gotta be more fun.

</CHARLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not my fault Annie Hall's honest about the futility of romance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're just a wuss. The very thought of not seeing that movie scares you. You're like a junkie, you need movie methadone. Like, from now on you can only see Manhattan.

A COUPLE exit, the guy holds the door for them. They hesitate. Suddenly, from inside:

<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Max! Beth! Come sit with us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MAX>

Everyone scoots over to make room. Max is still stunned but has no choice. He sits.

	How did we ever fall out of touch? We shouldn't let that happen again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEN>
<BETH>

</JEN>
<MAX>

	Do you have to get eggs? I'm allergic.

</MAX>
<JEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So don't get the eggs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEN>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>

This would put Beth next to Charles. She looks at him and he smiles. Unable to help herself, she smiles back.

	What about people at other tables? Should we ask the management to stop serving egg- products to people upwind of you?

<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I'll get up. But I'm ordering an omelet.

Max walks down the street toward an ATM, where a long line of college students has formed. Next to the ATM is an arthouse theater. The marquee reads "Thru Valentine's Day: ANNIE HALL and CASABLANCA."

He joins the ATM line. A moment later, Julie walks by. She notices him and stops.

</JULIE>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd be honest. Oh, wait. Media Studies. This week, I'm majoring in Media Studies. I used to be a double-major, Renaissance Footwear and Neurosurgery, but, ya know, it was just too hard to get course credit for watching movies.
	</DIALOGUE>

	You have to keep yourself open to possibilities in life. I'm the first one in my family to go to college. Sometimes I can't believe I'm here, at a semi- prestigious university getting a halfway- decent education-- this has always been my dream. How did you end up here?

	I had a coupon.

</MAX>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what you mean, financial aid is a bitch. And the university experience itself is kind of disappointing. All those rich students with no idea how lucky they are. But I don't think about them. I think about me, I think about where I want to be someday: a world traveler, running some huge company, or, you know, doing some fantastically important work. And when the day comes that I can relax, I'm going to charter a boat, sail around the world, and see the Seven Wonders.

	Even when Beth was part of the group, she didn't fit in. Like, she never just lets things be. She always has to know exactly what I'm thinking. It was sort of cute when we were friends, but now it's like a proctology exam.

	Yeah. This is a real change of pace. Staying away from Annie Hall is like some kind of magic trick.

	A non-denial denial. I invented that. She's learned from the best.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Six pages? That's nothing. Triple spaced, in 14 point type, that's only like 500 words. If a picture's worth a thousand words, that's like a bad photocopy.

<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I've spent my life learning how to be a student, and at the end of the semester it will all be useless. Everybody already wants to know what I'm going to do, and I have no idea. I started making up stories to tell people. An aunt asked me if I'm excited about Chicago, and I couldn't remember if I'd said I was moving to the city or going to see the band.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My parents are divorced.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, bad example. But why think ahead? We're here, now. Can't we just enjoy our time together?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Max, I did, believe me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was all this, I mean, was any of it­
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what I was doing. I didn't think about where this might lead until it was too late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it might lead to... happiness.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Tommy walks in, half asleep, in his pajamas. He turns on the TV and sits down. Max stares at him. Tommy suddenly realizes he isn't alone.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, re-run.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
He turns it off and quickly exits. Max tries to pull himself together.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say something. Are you okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew that damn film was cursed! Why did I listen to Charles instead of Annie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, Max. It's not an anti-relationship movie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about? It's a fucking textbook.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
She stands.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not listening to me, Max. Just like you're not listening to Annie. No matter what you think right now, this was worth it. Because I got to meet you, and got to be close to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. I don't know. I mean... Good-bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Julie leaves. The VCR whirs to a stop and Annie Hall ejects. Max stares at it, upset and thoughtful.

INT. COMMON ROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAN left to right across people's chests: an X-Files shirt, a lounge shirt with a wide collar, a Stephen Hawking shirt, an Ani DiFranco shirt...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK to reveal, l to r, Sam, Charles, Tommy and Amanda, sprawled on the couches, from Max's POV in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're drinking vodka out of coffee mugs. The TV is on but the sound is off. Everyone looks tired and sad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Max sits. Sam thumbs a copy of Scientific American.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are humans smarter than chimps if we have 99% of the same genetic material?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who says we're smarter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look who I'm asking. You think a red blood cell is a prison for a gang member.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very funny, Mr. Wizard. If I learned anything useful in my classes, I'd be rubbing it in your face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
In Scott's usual spot is Amanda and Tommy.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So Amanda. Have a good weekend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<AMANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMANDA>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mine was good too. Get any good birthday presents?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<AMANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMANDA>
<DIRECTION>
She gets up and leaves the room.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By the way, Max, what ever happened with that girl you were seeing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She just ended a long relationship and she doesn't want anything serious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't you have something that's not so serious?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's dead. And the thing I don't get is, it was all going so well. There was a moment when we kissed, when it was more than a kiss...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
His openness is making the other guys uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was like we broke through all our layers, you know, all the manners and defense mechanisms and daily crap, and I saw a flash of something, a glimmer of hope or happiness or whatever, something I inspired in her. But now it's over and I'll never see that part of her again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you're upset about not seeing some other parts of her again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
The joke is half-hearted-- Max has made everyone reflective.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's a girl, Max. They'll always be a mystery. You'll never know why they love you and you'll never know why they don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relationships are incredibly complicated. Like polypeptide strings. There's an attraction at first, but if the bonds don't form right away, nothing can make the connection work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a metaphor we can all relate to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was like with Jen and I. But I know it was for the best.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I finally dropped out of the play I was directing, just to get rid of Sara. God, my career is in shambles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tough week all around, huh? How about some video hockey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Max gets up and puts on his coat.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I prefer Goldeneye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
He leaves. Sam sighs and picks up the remote.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wanna watch Sports Center?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<CHARLES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah. I think I'm gonna call Sara...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLES>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up and leaves as Sam registers this news. He puts the remote down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMPUS GREEN ­ DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is moist and foggy as Max trudges across the deserted campus.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Max!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
Max stops in the middle of a path as Beth walks up.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi there. Happy Valentine's Day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oo, witty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I hate Valentine's Day, too. If you're in love, you're in love. And if you're not, who wants to think about it? I want to be in love so badly, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, there's this joke...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, forget it, Max.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know the joke?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does a bear shit in the woods?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that's the one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You told it the night of our date. I hate that joke, Max. It's not a philosophy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I think I know what it means now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, and it's dreary and depressing, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not this time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(INTIMATELY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beth, I just want to say, before it's all over and I don't have the chance, that I'm sorry. For everything. Last semester and last year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Beth is speechless; she never though she'd ever hear that.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean the world to me, and I was an idiot to throw it away. You were right: if I can't be a friend to you, how could I be a boyfriend? I've done a lot of things wrong, and I've been confused as hell, but I think it's time for a change.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Beth looks him over, as if for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then allow me to recommend a movie that you've never seen before. It's called Annie Hall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was going to see it tonight. Do you want to join me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would love to, but I think you need to do this alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you're right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'll see you later?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. After the movie, I'm doing my last radio show. It's going to be all requests. You should tune in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The end of an era.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<MAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The start of a new one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles and walks away. The fog begins to obscure him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beth opens her backpack and removes a Walkman. She hits POWER and the LED changes from TAPE to RADIO.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's how I let go of her. Although, it's probably more honest to say that she let go of me. Julie, Beth, and Annie. Three women in my life and I was desperate for one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE. Beth stands alone, watching him go. She snaps the headphones over her ears.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, I saw her again. It's a small campus. The last time was at a film festival. We're better friends now then ever, and there's always a chance we can have some kind of future together. So far, so good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Beth turns and walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO: Max still walking, getting smaller and smaller. Soon all we see is fog.
</DIRECTION>
<MAX>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She'll always mean a lot to me, and it's nice to run into her and reminisce about what we, ya know, went through. It was a weird period of my life. I mean, shit, I really got off track there, didn't I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAX>
