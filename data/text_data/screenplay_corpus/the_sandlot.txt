SCOTTY SMALLS, studious-looking; ALAN "YEAH-YEAH" McCLENNAN, little, hyper; HAMILTON "HAM" PORTER, tubby with a huge smile; KENNY DeNUNEZ, handsome bean pole; TOMMY "REPEAT" TIMMONS and his brother TIMMY; BERTRAM GROVER WEEKS, wearing inch- thick horn rims; JEFF "SQUINTS" PALLEDOROUS, a transistor radio plug wedged in his ear; and BENNY RODRIGUEZ, leaning on Scotty's shoulder, sporting the world's all-time hottest sneakers... P.F. Flyers.

	Everyone's got that one summer when they were a kid... a summer so perfect, that it stays with them forever. It stays caught in time, like Camelot. pause That summer is like a book with a million blank pages that you get to fill with the greatest story you could ever dream up.

SCOTTY

whips a look up and sees

<DIRECTION>
THE FLY BALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
coming right at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCOTTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
tracks it, frozen stiff. Scared shitless. At the past possible moment, he throws his arms over his face and ducks... social suicide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
beans him at the glove covering his noggin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCOTTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hits his butt. The ball rolls a bit. Comes to an "I-dare- you" stop: right up against the diseased fiberglass panels of that preternatural fence. Scotty pulls his arms away from his face.

He reaches the fence and the ball and stops. It's hard to move. The force emanating from the backyard has got him:

DUST THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE FIBERGLASS
</DIRECTION>

keeps perfect time with the monster-breathing.

The room is dark. Benny's in bed. He clicks on a "baseball- bat" flashlight. Shines the beam toward his footboard... illuminating the photo of The Babe.

Suddenly, a RACKET from inside Benny's closet. A bright LIGHT GOES ON in there. Then, smoke comes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Benny jumps up on his bed - flattens against the wall. Hasn't done this in years:

The Babe turns to go back to wherever he came from. Benny grabs his arm - shocked that he actually feels something "real."

<BENNY>

	Wait! I can't.

	A giant gorilla-dog-thing that ate one kid already.

</BENNY>
<THE_BABE>

A RACKET in the closet matching:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCOTTY'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KNUCKLES on glass. Scotty hurries sleepy-eyed to the window and opens it. Benny stands outside, holding a shoe box.
</DIRECTION>
<BENNY>
<DIRECTION>
(WITH PURPOSE)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had a dream. Get dressed. We're goin' to the sandlot.

</BENNY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE SANDLOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guys march toward the rising sun - across the sandlot behind Benny. Toward destiny.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GREEN FIBERGLASS FENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stop here. Benny steps forward. He opens the shoe box. Laces on brand new P.F. Flyers. Moves for the fence. Scotty grabs his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Benny - wait. It's okay, it was my fault. I'll just take whatever I get. You don't have to do this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTY>
<DIRECTION>
A look in Benny's eyes. Kismet.
</DIRECTION>
<BENNY>
<DIRECTION>
(PREDESTINED)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah I do, Smalls. I have to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Benny turns from him - swallows hard. Swings himself onto THE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOP OF THE FENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and balances - deciding.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_BABE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(in Benny's head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Follow your heart, kid, and you'll never go wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_BABE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Benny turns back one last time. Gives Scotty "Thumbs Up." With a pearl diver's breath - he plunges into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BADLANDS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...here. He stands fixed, staring hard 'neath the lean-to.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DUST RISES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
from thereunder. ORGANIC EXHAUST. The LAZY CLINKS of heavy chain links... The Beast is rising to its feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IT MATERIALIZES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
piece by piece: fore feet the size of a catcher's mitt, bulking head and shoulders, hulking flank and haunches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BENNY'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
mouth hangs open. He's frozen, staring at
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and it's worse than Squints recounted... because it's real. This is the biggest dog that ever lived! 300 lbs. 4 1/2 feet tall. And ugly. This was a bad idea. The Beast lingers 8 feet away with slack in the chain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THWOOOP! It spits something out, which rolls in the dirt... STOPS EXACTLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BETWEEN THEM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A goo-slobbered ball. Dirty Beast-foam drips off, revealing the smeared signature, B A B E R U T H. "G'head kid, I dare you!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PICKLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Benny measures The Beast. Times its ballooning chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Beast's eyes glue to Benny. Flopping, hot-water-bottle tongue PANTS. Licks chops. Leather'd nose twitches - smelling for movement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TOE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
of Benny's P.F. Flyer digs into the cracked earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLINK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the Beast leans forward - one chain link lifts from the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHTHUFT!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Benny spits, blowing his tanks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
bristles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BENNY'S EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
widen, focusing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WAR BREAKS OUT!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Benny goes for the ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
knotted muscles quaver and UNCOIL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BENNY'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
P.F. Flyers leave behind tiny dust roosters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
claws dig deep furrows. FOG BANKS of dust spread out behind it. Forelegs gallop at flared, over-anxious angles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BENNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
leaves scrambling footprints. He slides - grabs the ball - "Pops-Up" Maury Wills fashion - heads back for the fence. The ball slips from Benny's fingers. Re-grabs it - shoves the ball in his teeth, freeing his hands for the leap up the fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
gains. SHNAPP! Jaws SHUT like a tripped bear trap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BENNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
springs off the ground. He's on the fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reaches chain's end - it goes taught. Breaks! The two foot length still attached to The Beast's neck bullwhips - the chain catches Benny in the butt.
</DIRECTION>
<BENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YOWWWWW!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENNY>
<DIRECTION>
He vaults over the fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SANDLOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gang looks up. A great shadow envelopes them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST IS LOOSE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guys turn to stone. Benny takes off.
</DIRECTION>
<BENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OOOOH SSSSHIT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENNY>
<DIRECTION>
The Beast tears by the guys after Benny. The two vanish out of the sandlot.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTY>

	What're we waitin' for?! Let's go after 'em!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDEWALK - NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Benny runs. The Beast is gaining. In its wake: dichondra lawns RIPPED to shreds. Scotty and the guys make tracks a block behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIVE & DIME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On display: Pinwheels, Mailbox Propellers and Puddle-Jumpers. Benny flies by. The Beast follows. As they pass, contact: the whirly-gigs take off!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR - TRAVELING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MOTHER drives. In the passenger seat, her TODDLER fingers a "scooter-pie" in marshmallowy strings.

<DIRECTION>
ON THE SIDEWALK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Benny and The Beast run even. Then pull ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. "SNELGROVE'S" ICE CREAM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gag per storyboards - t.b.d.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEYWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Benny's cookin'. The Beast follows - TRASHCANS SCATTER like bowling pins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scotty and the guys follow. All slow to check out the garbage bins... so many crushed beer cans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Benny darts in the rear entrance to a "random" building. The Beast tears after him - KNOCKING the door off its hinges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOYS CLUB AUDITORIUM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE MOVIE SCREEN Kong does battle with T Rex.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BENNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
comes sliding AT US across the waxed stage floor - from under the movie screen. He slides off the stage - into midair - lands on his feet. Splits up the aisle between the rows of folding chairs and blasts out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KIDS' HEADS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
turn to watch him. KONG ROARS! They look back at
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MOVIE SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where, just as Kong proclaims himself king over the dead T Rex,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leaps through the center of the silver screen - leaves a 6 foot hole - lands 20 feet down the aisle - CRASHES through the doors and disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moments pass. Our guys follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hot-rubber SQUEAKS from Benny's P.F. Flyers. The Beast's claws leave jagged scars in the concrete.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CATS HISS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in terror and faint.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PUBLIC POOL DECK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POOL HONEYS lounge, all bedecked with rock-hard, Annette Funicello hairdo's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Benny blasts out of the pool building, "tire stepping" over
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the Honeys. They're up and RANTING at him. Until, The Beast comes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...sliding across the water-slippy deck like an out-of-control anvil. He "bowling pins" the Pool Honeys. The Honeys HIT THE WATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Benny cuts back through the pool building. The Beast follows - parting our guys and the other Kids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Game in progress. From outta nowhere, Benny jams across the diamond. The game stops... EVERYONE gapes at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some huge dog-beast charging after a kid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CITY PARK - PICNIC AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Big banner: "FOUNDER'S DAY!" Perfectly arranged picnic blankets covered with wonderful spreads of goodies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BENNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
zips under the banner - runs through - grabs a Coke like a long distance runner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rages after him, through:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DEADEND! MIDWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
of neatly arranged display booths. (This is pie n' cake booth gag per storyboards - allow 2 pages.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOWN SQUARE - NEARBY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Founder's Day parade (et al).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BENNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
rips into the square. He rubba-leg zigzags, nimbly avoiding everything and everyone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is a runaway freight train. He PLOWS through CLOWNS. CHILDREN are snatched from the dog's path by terrified parents. The Beast tears through the concession stands:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VATS & DISPENSERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXPLODE! The VOLUNTEERS dash out SCREAMING - "tar n' featherd" with baked beans and potato chips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BENNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
zips through the MARCHING BAND - ducking trombone slides - leaping glockenspiels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ain't so graceful. He "barn-doors" the band. CRASH! An instrument tangled heap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ONLOOKERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pour into the street, knocking the MAYOR from his convertible, and the FOUNDER'S DAY QUEEN from her float.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM THIS HEIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
this all looks like the end of a "Dr. Suess" book!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCOTTY AND THE GANG

search through the confusion. _They've lost Benny_! Suddenly, doubling back on them

BENNY

SHOOTS BY:

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gang's GASPING for BREATH. And then, unbelievably
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BENNY & THE BEAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Are coming right at them! They race across the sandlot. Kill- anxious beast-drool splashes the seat of Benny's pants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
muscles flex.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BENNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
just runs. He runs as if a big dog was chasing him. He lurches a step - RIP! A pants pocket flaps from an incisor.
</DIRECTION>
<BENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	LOOK OUT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENNY>
<DIRECTION>
He lays down the world's all-time most perfect SLIDE. He careens toward the bottom of

MR. MERTLE'S FENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hits it and, defying gravity, RUNS STRAIGHT UP THE GREEN FIBERGLASS PANELS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BENNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
jets upward, leaving smashed green fiberglass footsteps - standing out from the fence 90 degrees - the Donald O'Connor "Singin' In The Rain" trick!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sucks air - ROARS - EXPLODES from the ground - soars, gaping maw first, right for
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BENNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who pushes off the top of the fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GNASHES up at Benny's heels - misses by an inch. He plummets toward the Badlands. Then, the unspeakable happens,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BENNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DROPS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BABE RUTH AUTOGRAPH
</DIRECTION>

The gang climbs the fence. They look down into

<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE BADLANDS - DAY

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BENNY

FENCETOP

His shirt snagged:

<SCOTTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help him! I'm stuck! I'm stuck! Help him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTY>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST

is hanging from the fence. His chain has caught. He struggles - choking to death - right below Scotty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GANG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
petrifies where they stand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCOTTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
tears his shirt loose. Scrambles to where The Beast hangs. Tries to lift the tow chain free - too heavy! He'll die in seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pick him up! Scoot him up so I can let him off!

</SCOTTY>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
whimpers. Scotty balances atop the fence. Grabs the tow chain. Lifts with all his might... his fingers bleed. The Beast goes limp. An inch. That did it! The beast falls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCOTTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
goes with him - 8 feet to the dirt. The FENCE COMES DOWN - breaking the barrier to the sandlot. He lands on the ground
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOSE TO NOSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
with The Beast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCOTTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
leaps to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST
</DIRECTION>

rises with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCOTTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
freezes solid.

<DIRECTION>
THE GANG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watches in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
scans them instinctively - He might kill them all where they stand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCOTTY'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
about to load up his fruit o' da looms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sticks his mammoth head right in Scotty's face. SNIFFS. That's it! The kid is lunch! His jowls part - hot BEAST-BREATH BLOWS Scotty's hair back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCOTTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
closes his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GANG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLAP their hands to their eyesockets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
leans closer. Mouth opens. Cold-leather nose presses against Scotty's forehead. Then... He licks Scotty's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCOTTY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
wipes away the Beast slob. He doesn't even have to kneel down to read the name on The Beast's "doggy tag." It says...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Hercules.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This time Scotty gives Benny "Thumbs Up."
</DIRECTION>
