</STARLING>
<VERGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because?

<VERGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Cavalcanti replied publicly to Dante's first sonnet. Do you know it, Professor Sogliato? I believe it's worth your time: Listen to the way he makes an instrument of the Italian vernacular, which he called the vulgari eloquentia-- the eloquent voice of the people: Allegro me sembrava amor tenedo/Meo core in mano, e ne la braccia avea/Madonna involta in un drappa dormedo/Poi la svegliava a d'esto ardeno/Lei paventosa umilmente pascea/Appreso gir lo ne vedea paingendo. If Dante had written to a Cavalcanti, it would, of course, have been to Andrea, the most literary of his brothers....

	You've sought out The Institution all your life, as you with it to replace your Father. This is obvious. Less obvious is this: that you require the institution not to support you, but to FAIL. FOR THIS KEEPS YOUR FATHER ALIVE.

	<DIALOGUE>
	So many civilizations eat their slain enemies... what do you think...? How much better to devour a person physically, than to devour his spirit. Which is, of course, the purpose of the institution.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no. Oh, NO. They've put a beeper on you. How careless of me. How finally careless, Do you think? Have I erred on Purpose? Eh? Or am I just unlucky? Could one not say that's the essential question of Philosophy...?
