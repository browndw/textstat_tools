Fujiwara even said that his boss, Ikeda, would have him killed if he knew he was calling. So I asked him why he was talking to me and he said-- he said-- he wants 10 million dollars. 10 million and he'll tell us who the saboteur is and give us a new lysine bug that's immune to the virus.

	There are so many really nice people in the world. People who want to help out. Good neighbors. Good listeners. Like when they have these floods out on the Mississippi and people lose everything and are sleeping in a school gym, someone always shows up with a warm coat for the old people and a home made pot roast. That's why Ginger and I bought that girl in town a special computer after she had the spine injury. That kind of thing really makes a difference. Jim here strikes me as that kind of guy, you can tell he's the one-in-a- hundred guy who when you come into the emergency room, you thank your lucky stars that it's his watch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITACRE>
<WHITACRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are over 200 tapes. I carried a tape recorder almost everyday to work once I signed a cooperating witness agreement, and then they gave me a special brief case that I took to meetings that had a hidden recorder in it-- they even sewed a small one they just developed into my suit and I'd ride around on the plane and tape Mick and the guys talking about price fixing or stealing technology and illegal campaign contributions, just whatever we'd talk about. We made over a hundred tapes-- and Brian and Bob and I would get together a couple times a week and work on the investigation until we briefed the lawyers at the Department of Justice and they raided the place.

Whitacre's kids come out of the house and stand clustered at a distance confused and terrified. Helpless in the face of a fallen parent.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd also like to take this opportunity to apologize to Special Agent Brian Shepard on behalf of myself and my wife Ginger, he never hit me with a brief case or told me to destroy tapes. The idea to sue him wasn't mine-- it came from someone at ADM and I shouldn't have listened. I can't remember who. when I was at ADM, I lived so many lives, I wasn't sure who I was. Today, I know more who I am and what I really want out of life. I've completed three post-graduate degrees while in detention. A J.D. which is, of course, a law degree and another advanced degree in the psychology of jury selection. I sleep better in prison than I have in years. My wife has forgiven me and believes that the ordeal with ADM has brought us closer together in a marriage of over 20 years. I hope you will allow me to leave here, so that I can re-join my life with my family and three kids. . .Two of whom are adopted... Especially when you consider that thanks in large part to my testimony the US government has been able to collect over a billion dollars in price- fixing fines from big business. That's it. Thanks.
