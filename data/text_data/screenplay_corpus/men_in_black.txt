EXT. ROAD -- TEXAS/MEXICO BORDER -- NIGHT A million stars wink in the night desert sky. Down here on earth, an insect, one of those big, beautiful, multicolored four-winged jobs, glides effortlessly on the breeze, wafting along through the crisp Texas air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The insect dips, it banks, it does loop-the-loops -- and then SPLATS unceremoniously against the windshield of a white van that's tearing down the road.

He squirts some wiper fluid onto the glass, which clears it up a bit, but now he sees something worse up ahead. It's a grouping of headlights, eight of them, all pointed at him, sealing off the road.

He bites his lip and calls over his shoulder, to the back of the van. He speaks in Spanish, which is subtitled.

The van slows to a stop in front of the parked cars, all government-issue four doors with "INS" stenciled on the sides. Seven or eight INS AGENTS stand in front of the cars imposingly. Their apparent leader steps forward and comes to the window.

The DRIVER rolls it down. AGENT JANUS, blonde-haired, blue-eyed, also government issue, looks at him and sighs.

He stops in the middle of his sentence, as another car is approaching, fast, its engine WHINING as it barrels down the road toward them. Several Agents pull their weapons.

The new car pulls a hard right, goes off the road, spins around the INS cars, and SQUEALS to a sideways halt, silhouetted in front of their headlights. It's a boxy, black 1986 Ford LTD.

TWO MEN get out, dressed in plain black suits, crisp white shirts, simple black ties, shiny black shoes. KAY, fiftyish, is the apotheosis of world-weary; his partner, DEE, mid-sixties, is just weary. They approach the INS agents.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM -- LATER -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A woman sneaks into the room. DOCTOR LAUREL WEAVER, thirtyish, dark-haired, dark-eyed, general aura of darkness around her, stands above him. Laurel looks like she was just dragged out of bed (which she was) and saw a spaceman (which she did). She looks over her shoulder once, then whispers to him.
</DIRECTION>
<LAUREL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Laurel Weaver. Deputy Medical Examiner. I believe you. I opened him up. Find me at the morgue. On 26th. I'll tell you what I found.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Weaver, from the coroner's office? Working on the John Doe?

Edwards stretches even further in his seat, when there is a blinding FLASH from the corridor. Really curious now, he starts to get up --

Edwards looks at it, puzzled. He turns the card over and looks at the other side. There's not much there, no name, no phone or fax number, no e-mail address. Just three little letters, dead in the middle of the card:

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

A lonely farmhouse stands amid the fields of upstate New York farm country. Several lights are on and through a window we can see the silhouette of a MAN sitting at the kitchen table, the silhouette of a WOMAN hovering over him, bringing things to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Man (EDGAR) waves his arms, ranting.
</DIRECTION>
<EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I go out, I work my butt off to make a living, all I want is to come home to a nice clean house with a nice fat steak on the table, but instead I get this -- this -- I don't even know what you call this!

</EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
In the sky above, it's one of those brilliant star fields. But something strange is happening with one of those stars -- it's getting bigger.
</DIRECTION>
<EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you what it looks like, it looks like poison. Don't you take that away, I'm eating that, damn it! It is poison, isn't it?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
No, that star isn't getting bigger, it's moving. Toward us. Fast. It goes from a pinpoint to a dime, to a nickel, to a quarter, and works its way into fruit metaphors.
</DIRECTION>
<EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I swear to God, I would not be surprised if it was, the way you skulk around here like a dog been hit too much -- or ain't been hit enough, I can't make up my mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
Okay, we're way past watermelon now, that thing is huge, and it's starting to glow hot red as it enters the earth's atmosphere, headed straight toward us, coming here, to Beatrice and Edgar's place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blazing fireball barrels through the sky, SNAPS off a couple trees --
</DIRECTION>
<EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're useless, Beatrice! The only thing that pulls its weight around here is my goddamn truck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>

-- and SLAMS right through a pickup truck parked in the driveway. A concussive BLAST follows, then a geyser of smoke and flame erupts.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
The silhouette of Edgar leaps to its feet, races to the door, and throws it open. Edgar is everything his voice led us to expect -- a nasty, bug-eyed redneck carrying a twelve-gauge shotgun. His mouth agape, he walks across the yard and stares at the hulking shell that was his truck. The skeleton of the truck is still there, but there's a huge, smoldering hole in it, a hole that goes at least ten feet down into the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Figures.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
He walks to the truck and touches the door handle. Hot. Using his shirt tail, he opens the door and peers down into the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE HOLE, he sees a smooth curve of metal and a few blinking lights. Embedded into the ground is, indeed, a spaceship, maybe eight feet across.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEATRICE calls from behind him, standing in the doorway fearfully.
</DIRECTION>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it, Edgar?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
(turns to her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get your big butt back in that house!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
Beatrice does as she's told, closing the door behind her. Edgar turns back to the smoldering rock, raising his shotgun in defense. AN OTHERWORLDLY VOICE comes from deep in the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Place projectile weapon on ground.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Edgar staggers back a step, terrified. But then he regains himself, raises the weapon, and steps forward, pointing it menacingly down into the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can have my gun when you pry it from my cold, dead fingers!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
There is a pause while the voice thinks about this offer. Finally, it responds, in a voice and cadence remarkably similar to Edgar's.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your proposal is acceptable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
A long, hairy pincer flashes out of the hole, grabs Edgar by the head, and pulls him down into the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From deep in the hole, we hear a terrible RIPPING sound, like a bedsheet being torn in half. There are some disgusting GUSHY sounds, then a moment later, something flies out of the hole and FLOPS onto the ground next to the truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Edgar. Well, sort of. His body parts still hang together -- face, arms, legs, even clothes -- but everything inside has been removed and now he just lies there, flat and empty, like a tuxedo on the floor after the prom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shotgun flies out and lands beside him.

INT. FARMHOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEATRICE sits at the kitchen table, terrified, still wiping away tears from Edgar's diatribe. The door opens and EDGAR comes back into the kitchen, seemingly fleshed out again, leaving the door hanging open behind him. He carries the shotgun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up at him, anxious. But his face is a blank.
</DIRECTION>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What on earth was it?!

He looks at her strangely. When he speaks, his voice is different than before. More refined.

	Sugar.

</EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. She looks out the window, at the smoking truck.
</DIRECTION>
<BEATRICE>

</BEATRICE>
<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>

Puzzled, Beatrice gets up, goes to the cabinet, and grabs a bag of sugar. She holds it out to him.

	In water.

</EDGAR>

Frightened, she takes a glass of water from the table. She dumps some of the sugar into it.
</DIRECTION>
<EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDGAR>
<DIRECTION>
She puts more, till the glass is brimming. She stirs it quickly with a knife and hands it to him, her hand trembling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edgar takes it and downs it in a single gulp. Beatrice stares at Edgar, no idea what to think. She notices something odd about the skin on his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<BEATRICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Edgar, your skin! It's -- it's -- just hanging off your bones!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEATRICE>
<DIRECTION>
Edgar drops the glass and looks in a window, to catch his reflection. He reaches up --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and twists his whole face, as if adjusting a ski mask, then tucks the skin of his neck back into his shirt collar. He looks at her.

	That better?

Beatrice faints.

EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stillness. Silence. A loud SCRAPING sound comes from the pit left by the spaceship.

The nose of the ship itself rises up out of the pit, wavers, keeps moving, and finally CRUNCHES to the ground outside the pit.

EDGAR climbs out of the pit, breathing heavily. He dusts himself off and continues pushing the ship, along the ground, off into the darkness.

EXT. MIB BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The next morning. EDWARDS, holding the small MIB business card in his hand, compares the address written down by Kay to the address on the utterly nondescript building in front of him. It's seven stories high, gray, windowless, perfectly square, squatting on a bridge over a road like a fat guy on the john. "504 Battery Drive."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MIB BUILDING - TUNNEL VENT ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDWARDS steps through a heavily barred metal door and into long, bizarre room. One wall is entirely dominated by the enormous blades of a tunnel vent air intake. There is an elevator at the far end of the room and an OLD SECURITY GUARD, the rent-a-cop kind, reading a comic book on a folding metal chair halfway across.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edwards walks across the room, his footsteps ECHOING. The Guard looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<EDWARDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe, I'm not sure, see, I got this card --

</EDWARDS>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elevator. Push the "call" button.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
And he goes back to his comic book. Edwards, maybe out of nothing more than curiosity at this point, walks across the room, toward the elevator. As he draws close, the elevator doors WHOOSH open, expecting him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MIB BUILDING - ENTRANCE ELEVATOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edwards steps inside and turns around. The doors close. He pushes the "call" button and waits, but the elevator doesn't move. Instead, doors on the other side of the elevator slide open silently behind him. Edwards waits, unaware.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From behind him, somebody clears their throat. Edwards turns around, and finds himself standing in --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MIB BUILDING - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This back room is every bit as mysterious and unfamiliar as the entryway. Standing at the front of the room is ZED, a wire-haired career G-man, an old school bureaucrat, wearing the exact same kind of suit Kay had on last night. SIX OTHER HOT RECRUITS sit in egg-shaped chairs, staring at Edwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One chair is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're late. Sit down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<DIRECTION>
Edwards takes the remaining chair. The elevator doors slide shut. Zed continues addressing the Recruits.
</DIRECTION>
<ZED>

	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Zed. You're all here because you're the best of the best. Marines, Navy SEALS, Army Rangers...NYPD.

<DIRECTION>
They all turn and regard Edwards a little smugly. He gives it back.
</DIRECTION>
<ZED>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And we're looking for one of you. Just one. What will follow is a series of simple tests designed to quantify motor skills, hand-eye coordination, concentration, stamina -- I see we have a question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<DIRECTION>
Edwards's hand is, indeed, up.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, uh -- I'm sorry, it's just no one really asked this, but -- why, exactly, are we doing this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARDS>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Then one of the young recruits eagerly raises his hand. Zed calls on him.

<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son?

	What's so funny, Edwards?

<EDWARDS>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Humorous. Sir.

Short pause. Then Zed continues.

	Okay. Let's get going.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MIB BUILDING - INTERVIEW ROOM - LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The recruits scribble away at the written test. It's a thick document -- reasoning skills, general knowledge, diagrams. The RECRUITS seem to be really powering through it, filling in answer after answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But no desks have been provided for them, and they're all still in their chairs, writing uncomfortably on their thighs or knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDWARDS is really struggling. He writes two words on one answer, then decides to erase it. The lack of a writing surface is driving him crazy; his pencil even TEARS through the page.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up. In the middle of the tile floor, there is an unused table. Edwards gets up, goes to it, grabs hold --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and drags it, SCREECHING DEAFENINGLY, back to his chair. Everybody looks up, wincing at the horrible sound that fills the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edwards sits back down, now writing on the table. That's better.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zed raises an eyebrow. He stares at Edwards, then looks up, toward a smoked glass window. Behind the dark glass, a FIGURE stands, staring, unemotional.
</DIRECTION>

INT. MIB BUILDING -- SHOOTING GALLERY -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEVEN WEAPONS rest on a table in the middle of an otherwise empty, triangular room. The SEVEN RECRUITS stand in front of the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's an odd moment -- where everyone sort of looks around: at each other, at the blank walls...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyone, uh...any of you guys know what we're doing here?

<DIRECTION>
(can't help but smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, yeah, I know, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARDS>
<DIRECTION>
And then .. suddenly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two far walls pull apart. The whole room pulsates and the air is suddenly filled with a bewildering swirl of stroboscopic images, both human and alien. Everywhere is color, light and movement -- a holographic mass of strange shapes and characters moving simultaneously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Recruits lunge for the weapons, snapping them up and taking aim. SIX SHOTS are fired at once. And then, a second later, a SEVENTH SHOT is fired. Everyone sort of looks at Edwards, who puts his gun down last.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's an awkward silence. Then the door opens. Light pours in, and ZED with it. Even the highly competitive cadets can't help but feel some sympathy as Zed walks straight to Edwards.
</DIRECTION>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The hell happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<EDWARDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hesitated, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARDS>
<DIRECTION>
Zed looks into the gallery. Most obvious in the frozen tableau of creatures is a lunging, snarling beast, which has three bullet holes in its chest. Next to it is a massively deformed humanoid creature with a large hook for a head, which also has three holes in it. In the back corner of the gallery, there is a single bullet hole in a pretty eight-year-old girl.
</DIRECTION>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I ask why you felt little Tiffany deserved to die?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<EDWARDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was the only one who actually seemed dangerous. At the time.

</EDWARDS>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And how did you come to that conclusion?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<EDWARDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hook-head guy. You explain to me how he can think with a hook for a head. Answer; it's not his head. His head is that butt-ugly bean-bag thing over there. 'Cause if you look at the snarling beast-guy, he's not snarling, he's sneezing -- he's got tissues in his hand. No threat there, and anyhow, the girl's books were way too advanced for an eight-year-old's. And besides, from where I'm looking, she was the only one who appeared to have a motive. And I don't appreciate your jumping down my throat about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARDS>
<DIRECTION>
Sideways glances from the other recruits. Zed sighs.

ZED and KAY stand behind smoked glass, staring at the RECRUITS, who are still in the shooting gallery, waiting for a decision.

	He's got a real problem with authority.

Zed turns and walks away. Kay stares through the glass, at EDWARDS, who stands alone on one side of the room, apart from the rest of the group.

Zed reappears on the other side of the glass, coming through a door and into the shooting gallery. As he talks, Kay turns and walks off.

</ZED>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MIB BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The RECRUITS follow ZED out of the shooting gallery and into a long hallway. Zed motions them off to the left. EDWARDS is the last one out of the room, but he stops as he steps into the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAY is outside the door, waiting for him. Edwards recognizes him from last night.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You! Hey, what's goin' on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARDS>
<DIRECTION>
The other recruits continue down the hall with Zed. Kay doesn't answer, just gestures to Edwards to follow him down the hall, which he does.
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back in the mid-fifties, the government started a little underfunded agency with the simple and laughable purpose of making contact with a race not of this planet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<DIRECTION>
As they pass an alcove, Edwards notices the six other Recruits, who have been herded into a corner. Zed, addressing them, pulls a neuralyzer from his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<ZED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, if you'll look directly at the end of this device.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZED>
<DIRECTION>
He holds a neuralyzer up in front of them, and the Recruits stare obediently at it as Zed slips on a pair of black sunglasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edwards stares, fascinated, but Kay's hand reaches in and yanks him away, just as Zed's neuralyzer FLASHES WHITE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MIB BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As KAY leads EDWARDS down an impossibly long corridor, he hands him a file folder stuffed thick with eight by ten photographs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hands Jay the first picture, a shot of eight or nine MEN in plain black suits standing around a fifties-style office with metal desks and fluorescent lights. DEE and ZED are there, much younger.

Another picture, this one of the 1964 World's Fair grounds, still under construction. Giant models of rockets mark the Fair's theme of space travel; most prominent in the construction are two tall towers, with the flying saucers now mounted at the top of each.

As Kay walks into the kitchenette, Edwards' jaw drops, his eyes widen, and he stares in wonderment --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- at THREE WORM-LIKE ALIENS standing around a water cooler. Tall, impossibly thin, most certainly not from New York, the aliens hold an animated conversation in a language that seems like a combination of Esperanto and microphone feedback.

It's unlike anything we've ever seen -- huge, multileveled, of sixties design, polished steel and glass. The workplaces are sleek and uncluttered, manned by both HUMANS and ALIENS. Most of the Aliens stay in the background, like the UPSIDE-DOWN GUY who walks on the ceiling, shuffling papers.

KAY and EDWARDS step off the elevator and onto a platform that looks out over the whole place.

Kay leads him down into the complex. First, they walk past a sort of passport control center, where a human BUREAUCRAT at a desk is checking the documents of a line of ALIENS who've just arrived. There are a dozen bizarre life forms in that line, CHATTING in half a dozen different alien tongues.

ROSENBERG, the jewelry store owner, steps out of a cab in the meat-packing district, still carrying the ornate box and his beloved cat. He heads into Leshko's, a Russian diner.

A moment later, the Orkin van pulls to a stop across the street.

INT. LESHKO'S DINER - DAY

<DIRECTION>
ROSENBERG comes into the tiny restaurant, squinting in the relative darkness. At a table in the middle, he sees a man eating alone -- an enormous, dignified, yet profoundly strange-looking man in his mid fifties.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rosenberg walks carefully over to the table, but does not sit down. The man (an ARQUILLIAN, and if we're eagle-eyed, we recognize him as the alien on a "diplomatic mission" from passport control) rises from his chair. He steps forward, to face Rosenberg, who sets the ornate box on the table. Immediately, ROSENBERG'S CAT jumps on top of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rosenberg and the Arquillian stare at each other for a long moment --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and then embrace each other. The embrace has an odd, formal quality to it, like mafiosi coming to a sitdown. They hold on, long and hard, and both seemed choked with emotion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, they break apart and take their seats. They speak in a bizarre alien tongue, which is subtitled. Rosenberg wipes away tears.

A HAND reaches in, takes the plates, and sets them on a tray. We follow the tray, but see only the right arm and aproned midsection of the waiter carrying it. He carries the tray along the counter toward a pair of swinging doors that lead out into the restaurant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors swing in as another WAITER sweeps into the kitchen, and our waiter heads out into the dining area. As the doors swing closed behind him, they reveal storage shelves crammed with bags of rice, cans of stewed tomatoes --

They CLINK glasses and drink, just as the Waiter arrives. Still, we see only his arms and midsection as he sets the tray on a stand and lifts the plates of pirogi. He carries them to the table and sets them down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rosenberg, setting his glass down next to the plate, catches a glimpse of the Waiter's hand --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- just as an enormous silverfish bug slithers out of the waiter's sleeve and scurries across the table. The glass slips out of Rosenberg's hand, dumping wine all over the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up, slowly, and sees the Waiter's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's EDGAR. Another half dozen insects of all variety tumble out of Edgar's sleeves and scurry across the table. Rosenberg and the Arquillian freeze, paralyzed with fear. They seem to know what dire implications Edgar's presence holds.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSENBERG>

Edgar smiles.

<EDGAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right about one thing.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a long STINGER whips out from under the back of Edgar's apron and zips under the table. First Rosenberg and then the Arquillian lurch forward their chairs, their faces contorting in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They both pitch forward, their faces slogging into fresh pirogi.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stinger SNAPS out from under the table and whips back under Edgar's apron. He moves quickly, searching their pockets, but he doesn't find what he's looking for. The cat, still perched on top of the ornate box, HISSES at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edgar reaches out and BATS the cat away with one vicious swipe of his hand. The animal HOWLS and flies across the room, landing in a WOMAN's lunch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Woman SCREAMS. Now other DINERS' attention is drawn to Edgar's table, where two obviously dead men are being robbed by a waiter. There are SHOUTS of outrage, a few MEN rise out of their seats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edgar grabs the ornate box and tries to open it, but finds it locked. With the furor rising around him, he shoves the box under one arm and bolts for the door.

ACROSS THE MORGUE, Laurel is still examining Rosenberg, now bent down next to his head, carefully studying his left ear. She notices something strange, turns, and calls over her shoulder to Jay.

<LAUREL>

</LAUREL>
<DIRECTION>
Jay leans down. There is strange stitching around the base of Rosenberg's ear.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches out, touches the ear, then he actually turns it. With a soft CLICK --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- it pulls away from the head. Like a latch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jay and Laurel look at each other, astonished. Jay pulls again, and Rosenberg's entire face PUSHES OUT with a mechanical HUM, then HINGES OPEN, the whole face rotating out away from the rest of the artificial skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TINY LITTLE GREEN MAN SITS INSIDE ROSENBERG'S HEAD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Though not quite dead, the Tiny Little Green Man is gravely wounded. He staggers up out of a small control room inside Rosenberg's head, with gearshifts and viewing screens all around the inside of the skull.
</DIRECTION>
<LAUREL>
	<DIALOGUE>

The Orkin van is parked in an alleyway somewhere downtown. From inside, throaty WAILS of frustration can be heard. Two PASSERSBY hear the racket and hesitate, wondering if they should get involved.

But an inhuman GROWL rattles the whole van and they wise up, hurrying on their way.

INT. ORKIN VAN - NEW YORK ALLEY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the van, the ornate rosewood box is now battered and scarred, its various locks holding tight against EDGAR's repeated attempts to claw his way into it. Crammed into the back of the van along with his spaceship, Edgar wedges a screwdriver into the thin opening between the top and the rest of the box and SMACKS it with his right fist. Nothing doing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He BELLOWS in rage and hurls the box against the side of the van, where it finally CRACKS a hinge. Edgar snaps it up, pries the rest of the hinge off with the screwdriver, and wrenches the top off the box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside, there are dozens of precious, glittering diamonds, which he promptly tosses aside as worthless. But the rest of the box is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<EDGAR>

INT. MIB BUILDING - HEADQUARTERS - EARLY MORNING

<DIRECTION>
Despite the early hour, the headquarters is going full-blast. The large screen displays the familiar grouping of stars that is the CONSTELLATION ORION.
</DIRECTION>

Jay and Kay hurry in -- Kay peels off to one of the monitors; Jay heads for Zed.

Jay starts to cross over to ANOTHER MONITOR, where Kay is sitting alone, tie loosened, slightly disheveled. On the screen, the word "SEARCHING" blinks, encouraging patience. The image changes to a satellite view of North America, which quickly zooms in on the Southwest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On screen, the satellite view zooms down to Arizona, then a city, then a neighborhood, then a block, then a back yard. The printout changes to "SUBJECT ACQUIRED."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The image comes into sharp focus on one back yard in particular, where we get a good look at a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN. SUBJECT: ELIZABETH ANN RESTON. PRESENT LOCATION: RESIDENCE. 553 FAIRFIELD AVE./TEMPE/AZ. Whoever Elizabeth Ann Reston is, she's lovely. She's setting a picnic table in her back yard at the moment, unaware that she's being watched by an eye in the sky -- just as Kay is unaware that Jay is standing behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jay notices the monitor with the Middle-aged Woman on it. He looks at Kay's expression, then back at the monitor.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>

Kay doesn't answer, just stares at the screen. Elizabeth looks up, as if she knows she's being watched, but she's just looking at the sky, wondering how many stars'll be out tonight.

<DIRECTION>
It's more than Kay can bear. He reaches out and flicks a switch. The monitor goes blank, except for a data screen: SUBJECT LOST. Kay sits back in the chair and eats a potato chip morosely. Jay looks at him: "Is this me in thirty years?" A moment goes by. Finally:

SMASH! The window in the front door of Rosenberg's jewelry shop collapses in a shower of glass. EDGAR reaches in and fumbles with the locks, undoing them one by one. He gets them all and steps inside. Out the window behind him, we can see his Orkin van, double parked in the street in front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the gems and jewels are under glass counters. Edgar starts SMASHING the glass, grabbing great handfuls of jewels and tossing them aside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside, a New York City tow truck pulls up to the front of the Orkin van and starts to hitch up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edgar, in his rage, starts to smash anything breakable, even the framed pictures on the walls. He stops at one particular picture, staring intently at it. It's a glamor shot of Rosenberg's cat, provocatively posed on a satin pillow. There are a half dozen more pictures of the cat, some posed with Rosenberg, some by itself. This animal was important to Rosenberg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From outside, the ROAR of an engine distracts Edgar. He turns around, in time to see the Orkin van lurch as the tow lifts its front wheels off the ground.

There is also a pile of BEJEWELED CAT COLLARS. Jay picks up one of the COLLARS, inspects it closely, shaking his head.

Jay's attention is broken by something through the window. Outside, lumbering straight for the store, is EDGAR.

Jay thinks for a moment -- where does he know that face?

Suddenly, Edgar raises his arms, pointing both the farmer's rifle and the driver's shotgun. Before Edgar can shoot, Jay YELLS...

<JAY>

And then Jay FIRES, shattering the storefront window, and BLOWING UP A CAR on the street. The blast hurls him up and back a good ten feet, SLAMMING him into the wall with tremendous force. Edgar turns and rushes away down the street as Jay picks himself up.

Edgar doesn't bother sticking around to continue his fight. He jumps behind the wheel of the tow truck, starts it up, and hits the gas. The engine ROARS.

<DIRECTION>
Jay sprints after him, FIRING his noisy cricket. He is thrown back into some pedestrians, while his SHOT...
</DIRECTION>

Hits the rigging between the Orkin Van and the town truck, separating the two. Jay pulls himself up and sprints after the tow truck, but it accelerates too quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edgar is just about to turn the corner when Jay leaps onto a parked CAR to try and get some height. As Jay prepares to shoot, EDGAR DISAPPEARS AROUND THE CORNER, and a HUGH TRUCK backs into his line of fire.
</DIRECTION>

JAY FIRES, the TRUCK EXPLODES and Jay flies BACKWARDS, hurtling through the air and CRASHING through the window of a car, his rear end right in the woman driver's face.

Edgar reaches through the passenger side and pulls the Cabbie out the door (cigarette and wooden seat-beads and all).

Edgar just cranks the car into gear -- opening his mouth and swallowing the icon -- and in so doing revealing a TRIPLE ROW OF SERRATED BUG-TEETH, he SLAMS HIS FOOT on the gas pedal.

Laurel's head snaps back as the car rocks forward. She has no choice, but to grab the wheel and start steering as --

The car screeches out into traffic, swerving wildly as Laurel is forced to make a 90-degree turn. The car fishtails wildly, swiping an oncoming car as it straightens and heads into the traffic.

The furious Cab Driver runs off after it, still yelling as he disappears around the corner.

A second later, KAY and JAY rush out into the street. The cab is nowhere to be seen. Jay runs into the street, noticing the wooden beads, the ripped pine-scented green deodorizer, and the still-burning cigarette.

They follow his gaze, up, over the computer terminals. There, on the wall in front of them, where it has loomed for the entire movie, is the enormous mural of the 1964 World's Fair grounds. Most prominent in the mural are two tall towers that rise dramatically from the ground, topped by --

Kay's car hurtles toward certain death in the traffic jam, but at the last possible moment it swerves off to the side, a SUCKING SOUND coming from underneath it.

Instead of banging off the wall of the tunnel, the LTD actually clings to it. It swerves up, onto the wall and hangs there, racing by the traffic below.

Edgar flails, but she is beyond his reach. She falls, tumbling through the air --

Three feet long, triple-barreled, over and under and under, plus a pump action reloader on top of a storage clip for a dozen more shells. The shells themselves are solid, glistening like polished steel. Kay loads up the clip.

All eyes in the house are on the Mets' CENTER FIELDER, except for his eyes, which are on the flying saucer behind home plate. His eyes widen, his jaw drops --

He extends both pincers to the sides, and, my God, his reach must be twelve feet across.

Now the skin and clothes on Edgar's legs begins to CRACK and SHRED. They BURST APART, revealing two hideous, doubled-over insect legs. The bug raises himself aloft on his legs.

He sucks in a deep breath of air, and now the rest of the Edgar suit goes the way of the arms and legs. The torso EXPLODES in great rendering of cloth and skin, and finally
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edgar's head simply BURSTS apart, SPATTERING against the walls. Edgar now reveals himself as he really is: a hairy, bug-like exoskeleton, a scaly tail with a long stinger, a head like a cobra with elliptical eyes and a small nose, and two horse-like feet with three toes each.

He raises his pincers in the air, resting them on his head. The GALAXY hangs on a chain around his neck.

Jay and Kay have only a second to react before --

	I'm talking to you, Bug! You know how many of your kind I've swatted with a newspaper?

The Bug turns toward Kay. Kay steps up to him, the small human facing off against the giant alien hug.

She quietly makes it to the ground -- hurries off to the darkness of the woods.

EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - ON KAY AND THE BUG - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kay has himself in the Bug's face, its dripping fangs inches from Kay's face.
</DIRECTION>
<KAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're just a smear on the sports page to me, you slimy, gut-sucking, intestinal parasite! Eat me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY>
<DIRECTION>
The Bug reacts -- cranks open its massive jaws with a deafening HISS, lunges forward, and sucks Kay into his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bug straightens up to its full height and throws his head back. Kay slides down the Bug's throat, bending it sideways as he kicks and SCREAMS his way down into its abdomen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAY looks on, in stunned horror...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AS THE BUG TURNS TO JAY AND STRETCHES TO ITS FULL HEIGHT and lets loose a HIDEOUS SCREAMING HOWL OF TRIUMPH.

Laurel is still watching.

Jay watches as the Bug continues its HOWL OF TRIUMPH...He feels totally defeated. But...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He can hardly believe his eyes as he looks down at the Bug's stomach...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON BUG'S STOMACH. Through the leathery pouch of the Bug's stomach, we can just make out the distended outline of the two atomizers...and just a few inches from it, a HUMAN HAND is reaching toward the gun... KAY!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUG - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kay, swimming in the Bug's intestinal fluid, tries to make his way to the gun, Holding his breath. Eyes stinging.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jay knows what he has to do. He picks up a good-sized chunk of concrete dislodged by the crashing saucer and hurls it at the Bug.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Come over here and try that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DIRECTION>
The concrete THUNKS off the Bug's shell -- he doesn't seem to notice; just keeps moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jay picks up a twisted metal pole and runs at the Bug.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop right there, or I'll start wailing on your waxy, pointed ass!

</JAY>

Jay starts pounding on the Bug with the metal pole.

Kay almost has his fingers around the stock of the gun -- The POUNDING on the outside distracts him and he turns -- the gun shifts away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bug grabs the metal pole and yanks it out of Jay's hands. He swings at Jay -- Jay dodges the blow and falls to the grass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bug slices down with razor-sharp claws at Jay --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Jay rolls out of the way, just as the mean-looking claws dig into the grass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jay rolls right underneath the Bug's legs. His hand falls on something in the grass -- another piece of debris, a sharp metal spike, gleaming like a dagger. He grabs the metal spike and looks up at the Bug's apparently vulnerable underbelly, right above him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs the spike with both hands and is about to thrust the spike up, into the Bug's gut, when;
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bug bends its head down between its legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BUG'S POV of Jay there, upside-down from this perspective, lurking between the Bug's legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WORLD'S FAIR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bug opens its jaws and SNAPS at Jay -- who propels himself backward out of harm's way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bug starts climbing the tower. Jay howls in frustration.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you, afraid of me? Come on! Stand and fight like an arthropod!

In frustration, Jay screams and throws himself on the Bug, hanging onto its back, trying to drag it down.

	You want a piece of this, huh?! Maybe you're a badass in your hive, but this is New York City. You're just another tourist here!

</JAY>
<DIRECTION>
The Bug flicks him off with his tail -- sending him SAILING twenty feet through the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jay CRASHES into the dumpster, landing on a heap in front of the garbage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But, scratched and beat-up, Jay still doesn't quit -- he stands to yell at the Bug, extending his arm at the creature.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're messing with the wrong species, Bug --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DIRECTION>
He notices something on his arm...a cockroach running down his sleeve. He flicks it off...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looks down at the ground...sees another roach...looks over to the dumpster behind him...there are more of them...a whole mob, in fact...fifty or sixty of the critters, climbing out of a rusted hole in the dumpster...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jay has one last desperate idea...He kicks at the dumpster -- part of the side is rusted paper thin and it kicks apart and crumbles to pieces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF ROACHES pouring forth from the dumpster, crawling like a black glittering river, away from the garbage...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jay leaps to his feet and moves to the glistening mob of insects...
</DIRECTION>

CLOSE ON JAY'S FOOT as he steps on the roach. CRUNCH.

ON JAY. He smiles.

	<DIALOGUE>
	If I'm not mistaken, that was a cousin of yours.

He knows he's getting to him. He steps toward the Bug -- moving his foot over another roach.

<DIRECTION>
CRUNCH! He crushes another one.

Jay keeps moving toward the Bug, finding new roaches to tread on -- holds his foot over another one.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that? Can you hear what he's saying? 'Help me! Help me!'
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>
<DIRECTION>
CRUNCH. [ON] THE BUG as he starts climbing down the tower and moving toward Jay.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON JAY. They are moving toward each other in a show down -- Jay moves on, poising his foot over another roach.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ooh! There's a pretty one. That one looks kinda familiar, don't you think? I know who that is!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAY>

The Bug is right over Jay now, jaws dripping ready to gobble him up.
</DIRECTION>
<BUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUG>
<DIRECTION>
Jay stares right back at the Bug. Inside, he sees Kay's hand, closing around the trigger of the shotgun. He brings it around, pointing up, straight at the Bug's head.
</DIRECTION>
<JAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's your Momma!
	</DIALOGUE>

He moves to CRUNCH the roach -- The Bug moves to chomp Jay -- Jay stares up at him, unflinching...

	Didn't she ever teach you not to bite off more than you can chew?

</JAY>
<DIRECTION>
and at that very moment...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kay BLASTS a hole right in the middle of the Bug's midsection. The front of the Bug's thorax EXPLODES in a shower of bug juice all over Jay.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bug flies into two pieces -- the butt end sailing one way; the head flying behind Jay.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kay falls out of the Bug, in a mess of goo, gasping for breath, dropping the atomizer from his slippery fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other gun sails off into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ICON drops to the ground, rolls over to Jay's feet, and CLATTERS to rest like a silver dollar on a barroom floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He calmly bends down and picks it up. Jay is pissed and starts in on Kay.

HISSS! The Bug attacks, swinging its head down on them. They turn to see it, and just before the jaws snap down on their heads...

BOOM! The Bug's head explodes into a million bits. Bug juice showers down everywhere, bucketsful of goo drenching Kay and Jay even further.

They turn to see...

LAUREL standing behind the dead Bug, the other atomizer in her hands, the barrel smoking, the weapon and Laurel dripping the Bug innards.

There seems to be an edge to what we see, a curved border that seems to close in on things around the perimeters, until everything that exists seems to be contained in one tiny ball --

<DIRECTION>
-- which is actually a marble resting on a strange-looking patch of red dirt.

An ALIEN HAND reaches down and flicks the marble, sending it skittering and bouncing across the dirt, where it CLICKS into a dozen other big blue balls just like it.

FADE OUT.
