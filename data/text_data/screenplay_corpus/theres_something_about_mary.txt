</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ted is seated inside a small cubicle across the desk from PATRICK HEALY, a shaggy-looking guy in a mis-matched three-piece suit. Healy looks more like a used-car salesman than an insurance investigator.
</DIRECTION>
<HEALY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEALY>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<HEALY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any idea where I might start looking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEALY>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.

</TED>
<HEALY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't play games with me, Ted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEALY>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<HEALY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't buy it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEALY>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't buy what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Healy is in his face.
</DIRECTION>
<HEALY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up?

(indignant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

	You want her dead, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEALY>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't be serious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<HEALY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEALY>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not a stalker ! She's a friend of mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<HEALY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEALY>
<TED>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.

</TED>
<HEALY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEALY>
<TED>

(LAUGHS at Healy's nerve)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Healy thinks about it.
</DIRECTION>
<HEALY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Ted, I'll do it. But if this chick turns up with a toe tag, I'm rolling over on you.

EXT. COLLINS AVENUE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Healy waits alone on a corner carrying one bag and a RACK OF BEERS. Suddenly a '89 Chrysler Lebaron convertible with a GREAT DANE in the back SCREECHES to a halt in front of him. The driver, SULLY, is a muscular, well-groomed man in his thirties.

The dog is catching wind in the backseat and Sully hands Healy a packet.

<SULLY>

	Here's the info you asked for.

</SULLY>
<HEALY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.

</HEALY>
<SULLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should thank me--that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SULLY>
<HEALY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.

INT. SULLY'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This place is modest and clean but it has a direct view of South Beach. Healy puts his bags down and looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<HEALY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very nice.

</HEALY>
<SULLY>

(checks watch)

	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta get ready for work.

</SULLY>

Sully ducks into the bedroom and Healy looks around the apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<HEALY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEALY>
<SULLY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SULLY>
<HEALY>

	Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.

Healy pops open one of his beers and hands it to Sully.

	Healy, what I just tell you?

</SULLY>
<HEALY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?

</HEALY>
<SULLY>

	No I can't.

</SULLY>

Healy stares at him, baffled.

<HEALY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sully, it's one fuckin' beer for Christ sakes.

(holds up beer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ooh, the big bad beer's gonna get ya.

Sully stares at the beer, weakening.
</DIRECTION>
<HEALY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.

	Am I?

</SULLY>
<HEALY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bet your ass you are. Now I don't want to hear anymore of your happy horseshit. You gotta learn how to bend a little or believe me...you're gonna break.

</HEALY>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Sully takes the beer. He stares at it a moment and then sips.
</DIRECTION>
<SULLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.

INT. CHRYSLER LEBARON - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Healy is on a stakeout. He's dozing. He's been here for hours, food wrappers litter Sully's car. He's wearing Walkman-type HEADPHONES which are connected to a RADIO SURVEILLANCE MICROPHONE attached to a pair of BINOCULARS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly MUSIC explodes through his headphones--Healy's jolted awake. Who threw the grenade? Recovering, Healy aims the binoculars toward...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEALY'S POV - MARY'S APARTMENT ACROSS THE STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Healy has a clear, unobstructed view into Mary's apartment. The music is coming from Mary's clock radio. MARY sits up in bed and shakes herself awake, like someone's just poured cold water over her. She cranks the music even LOUDER. Mary hops out of bed, wearing only her panties, and though she's a little older now, she still looks well cast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP - ON HEALY - he's become extremely interested in his work. As much as Healy's enjoying the show, he's got a job to do--he speaks into a MICRO-CASSETTE RECORDER:
</DIRECTION>
<HEALY>
<DIRECTION>
(into recorder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Ted, I found your Mary. Her current address, two-niner-eight Euclid Avenue, Miami Beach. Husband, negative. Children and Labrador, negative. Extremely nice ass, affirmative.

INT. MARY'S APT. - DAY

Mary walks into the living room where we see an old woman, MAGDA, sitting on the couch LISTENING to a stack of RADIO SCANNERS.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you been up all night again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<MAGDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGDA>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<MAGDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGDA>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Meaning?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<MAGDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGDA>
<MARY>
<DIRECTION>
(feigning shock)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<MAGDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGDA>

Magda pats her little dog PUFFY on the head.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<MAGDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing--he was a fucking asswipe--but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGDA>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, you win. Now try to get some sleep, huh.

EXT. EUCLID AVENUE - MORNING

BRENDA You mean creative, but not poor.

	<DIALOGUE>
	After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder--a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid-twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on.

Ted has a newspaper splayed out on the counter (open to the bra ads) as he furiously FLOGS THE DOLPHIN (chest-high side view.) We see some balled-up tissue nearby. After several frantic strokes, he takes a deep breath and slowly and loudly EXHALES, clearly having COMPLETED HIS MISSION.

He draws a few more breaths, picks up a face cloth, and goes to clean up.

The Load IS MISSING!!!!

<DIRECTION>
Ted ENTERS and immediately reacts to the STENCH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE reveals that the place is a fucking PIG-STY. DOG SHIT is everywhere, FLIES fill the room, a MOUSE scampers across the carpet.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>

No answer. Suddenly he HEARS SOMEONE out in the hall, so he ducks behind the door.

<DIRECTION>
Healy and Tucker ENTER the apartment and stop in their tracks when they see the MESS.

Tucker goes into the kitchen.

<HEALY>

</TED>
<HEALY>
<DIRECTION>
(getting emotional)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, hot shot! My turn. What's the matter with me, huh? Why can't I ever get the great girl? Give the big pig with the B.O. to Healy, right? Well I was sick of it, man! No more--it was my turn. It was time for me...time for me...to be happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEALY>
<DIRECTION>
This is so pathetic that it actually gets to Ted. He sits down, runs his fingers through his hair.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<HEALY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what you're talking about.

	</DIALOGUE>
</HEALY>
<DIRECTION>
Ted stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<HEALY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.

The guys stare at one another, then Tucker comes out the kitchen with a drink. They turn their attention to him.

</TUCKER>
<HEALY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fucking prick, we had a deal--you said you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(moves in on Tucker)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You crossed the line, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEALY>
<DIRECTION>
Tucker backs away nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<TUCKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa, whoa, you're getting crazy now. Why would I cross the line--what do you think I got no pride?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TUCKER>
<DIRECTION>
Healy grabs Tucker by the neck.
</DIRECTION>
<TUCKER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TUCKER>
<HEALY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEALY>
<TUCKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
	</DIALOGUE>
</TUCKER>
<HEALY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were following us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEALY>
<TUCKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't flatter yourself--I was following her, I always do. How the hell you think I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TUCKER>
<DIRECTION>
This gets Ted's attention.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean...Steve didn't say all that stuff about Warren?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<TUCKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you shitting me--Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes? He was like a fucking eagle scout. You two should be kissing my balls--if it wasn't for me, she might've married that schmuck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TUCKER>
<DIRECTION>
Ted thinks about this.
</DIRECTION>
<TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The hell with you both--I'm out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TED>
<DIRECTION>
Ted walks out the door leaving Healy and Tucker to stare each other down. Just then Hal the Great Dane walks out of the bedroom with a CEREAL BOX stuck on his head. Healy does a double-take, then looks back at the snake.

	Mary....Oh Mary, I love you.

Mary's smile is as bright as the light from heaven.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you too, Ted.

(beat)

	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I always have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
As the two lovebirds kiss, a LADY CALLS OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<LADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Over here! I found his foot! It was in the storm drain!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LADY>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE LADY as she holds up a SEVERED FOOT in a cloth.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, everyone, let's fan out and look for the penis!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
As Ted REACTS to this, we pull UP, UP, UP, and
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT. THE END
