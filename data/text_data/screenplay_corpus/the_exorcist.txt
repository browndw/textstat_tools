Pickaxes and shovels weld into the air as hundreds of excavators tear at the desert. The camera pans around the area where hundreds of Iraqi workmen dig for ancient finds. The caption Northern Iraq appears at the bottom of the screen as the digging continues. The camera then follows a young boy running bare foot over the rocky mounds. He comes to a stop and the camera is positioned in between the boys legs looking at and aging man also digging.

The man takes a dust brush from the man's pocket and brushes some dust from the sculpted rock. As the dust is swept we see that it is a face. The old man recognises it and looks worried. He brakes the sculpted rock away from the ordinary rock and takes a good look at it.

The old man arrives back at that dig site in a small jeep. As he pulls up two armed guards rush out. When they see who it is the old man gives them a wave and they slowly walk back to there quarters. The old man walks up the rocky mound and sees a huge statue of the demon Pazuzu, which has the head of the small rock he earlier found. He climbs to a higher point to get a closer look. When he reaches the highest point he looks at the statue dead on. He then turns his head as we hear rocks falling and sees a guard standing behind him. He then turns again when he hears two dogs savagely attacking each other. The noise is something of an evil nature. He looks again at the statue and we are then presented with a classic stand off side view of the old man and the statue as the noises rage on. We then fade to the sun slowly setting as the noises lower in volume.

She walks round to the entrance of the attic and pulls the steps down with a pole. She pushes the light switch but nothing happens, so she lights a candle and climbs the steps as Regan looks on from Chris' bed. When Chris reaches the attic, she walks around in the darkness, knocking things over and looking for what is making the crash. She looks for the rat traps to see if any rats have been caught but all of them remain in tact with the lumps of cheese still in place. Chris hears the crash again and follows the sound, as she walks through the junk her candle blows up ans she hears a voice.

	Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.

There is falling medallion, a swing pendulum in a clock and a running dog. He then sees his mother ascending a subway tunnel to the street, Karras is on the other side of the street and although there is no sound, we can see that Damien is calling "Momma" and Mrs. Karras is calling "Damien". A white demonic face flashes a split second as Karras starts to run across the street to his mother, but we see her once again descend to the subway.

The doctor places the needle into the hole he made with the syringe. Regan is quietly yelping in pain, and Chris is in pain watching her daughter suffer. The doctor takes the tiny cap from the needle, Regan's clothing is squirted with blood and places a tube into the needle's head. We see the blood rush from Regan's neck through the tube. The male nurse then tapes Regan's chin down to prevent her from moving. The nurses then move in a huge machine, two pieces either side of Regan's head and a piece above. The lights fade out in the theatre and all we can see is Regan's face illuminated by this huge machince above her.

Chris and Sharon sit in the hallway with their heads in hands. Klein and Tanney exit Regan's room and approach them. Chris stands.

	She's heavily sedated. She'll probably sleep through tomorrow.

</DR_KLEIN>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was going on in there, how could she jump off the bed like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DR_TANNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pathological states can induce abnormal strength, accelerated motor performance. For example, a ninety-pound women sees her child pinned under the wheel of a truck, runs out and lifts the wheels half a foot up off the ground. You know the story, same thing here. Same principle, I mean.
	</DIALOGUE>

<CHRIS>

	We still think the temporal lobe...

</DR_KLEIN>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. What are you talking about for Christ sake! Did you see her or not? She's acting like a fucking out of her mind psychotic or a split personality or...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DR_TANNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There haven't been more than a hundred authenticated cases of so- called split personality, Mrs. MacNeil. Now I know the temptation is to leap to psychiatry, but any reasonable psychiatrist would exhaust the somatic possibilities first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_TANNEY>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's next?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DR_TANNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A pneumoencephelogram, I would think, pin down that lesion. It will involve another spinal.

<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Christ.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DR_TANNEY>

Angle from driver's seat- 'M' Street and 36th. Through the windshield, dead ahead, a crowd has gathered by the base of the steep steps beside the house, and an ambulance is pulling out into traffic.

<DIRECTION>
She breaks off, staring with horror at something descending the stairs. It's Regan on all fours. She's gliding, spiderlike, noiselessly and swiftly, down the staircase. She halts directly at the bottom. Staring at Sharon. Sharon is shocked and eyes fixed on Regan. Regan's tongue begins to flicker rapidly in and out of her mouth. She crawls very speedly toward Sharon with her tongue sticking out. Sharon screams and runs toward the door, Chris falls on Regan trying to hold her back.

</KINDERMAN>
<KARRAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unlikely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KARRAS>
<KINDERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. So on the one hand we've got a witchcraft type of murder and a Black Mass style of desecration in the church.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KINDERMAN>
<KARRAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think the killer and the desecrator are the same?

	Maybe somebody crazy, someone with a spite against the church, some unconscious rebellion, perhaps.

	Sick priest, is that it?

	Look, Father this is hard for you- please. But for priests on the campus here, you're the psychiatrist; you'd know who was sick at the time, who wasn't. I mean this kind of sickness. You'd know that.

Chris looks at him baffled.

<CLINIC_DIRECTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a stylized ritual in which rabbis or priests try to drive out the so-called invading spirit. It's pretty much discarded these days, except by the Catholics who keep it in the closet as a sort of embarrassment. It has worked, in fact, although not for the reason they think, of course. It was purely the force of suggestion. The victim's belief in possession helped cause it; and just in the same way this belief in the power of exorcism can make it disappear.

</DIRECTION>
<KINDERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?

	<DIALOGUE>
	But how?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<KARRAS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well before the church approves an exorcism, it conducts an investigation to see if it's warranted. That takes time. In the meantime...

<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could do it yourself...

Her face is puffy, scratched and bruised from self- mutilation. There is a sustagen flask used for a naso-gastric feeding, the tube is placed up her left nostril. Karras is momentarily taken aback. Then, reining in his revulsion, he slowly and warily closes the door behind him, and walks around the other side of the bed.

	There are no experts. You probably know as much about possession than most priests. Look your daughter doesn't say she's a demon, she says she's the devil himself and if you've seen as many psychotics as I have, you'd know it's like saying you're Napoleon Bonaparte. You ask me what I think is best for your daughter. Six months, under observation in the best hospital you can find.

And I want you to tell me that you know for a fact that there's nothing wrong with my daughter except in her mind! You tell me you know for a fact that an exorcism wouldn't do any good! You tell me that!
