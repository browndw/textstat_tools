	I was just fourteen years of age when a coward by the name of Tom Chaney shot my father down in Fort Smith, Arkansas, and robbed him of his life and his horse and two California gold pieces that he carried in his trouser band.

	Papa was a Cumberland Presbyterian and a Mason. He'd hired Chaney--for paid wages, not on shares--when Chaney was "down on his luck." If Papa had a failing it was his kindly disposition; I did not get my mean streak from him.

	He had taken Chaney up to Fort Smith to help lead back a string of mustang ponies he'd just bought from a stock trader named Stonehill. In town, Chaney had fallen to drink and cards, and lost all his money. He got it into his head he'd been cheated and went back to the boarding house for his Henry rifle. Papa remonstrated, and Chaney shot him in the breast.

	I see. Well. Nothing prevents you from offering a reward, or from so informing a marshal. It would have to be real money, though, to be persuasive. Chaney is across the river in the Choctaw Nation--lawless country. It will not be a daisy-picking expedition. Upwards of three-score US marshals have been slaughtered in the Territory.

<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will see to the money. Who's the best marshal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Sheriff>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would have to weigh that proposition. I reckon William Waters is the best tracker. He is half Comanche and it is something to see him cut for sign. The meanest one is Rooster Cogburn. He is a pitiless man, double tough and fear don't enter into his thinking. He loves to pull a cork. The best is probably L.T. Quinn, he brings his prisoners in alive. He may let one get by now and again but he believes even the worst of men is entitled to a fair shake. Quinn is a good peace officer and a lay preacher to boot. He will not plant evidence or abuse a prisoner. He is as straight as string. Yes, I will say Quinn is about the best they have.

:SC: DARK ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear wind whistling through cracks in the floorboards and walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear snoring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is one bed, not large, with two shapes in it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We cut in closer to find Mattie lying on her back, staring. She shivers, shoulders hunched. The thin blanket barely covers her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls the blanket gently, slowly, so that it covers her exposed side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat of snoring, a snorfle, and then, as we hold on Mattie, the crackle of mattress ticking under a shifting body--and the blanket is pulled away toward the unseen snorer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: COURT HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Voices echo from inside the courtroom. Mattie cracks a heavy oak door and slips in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: COURTROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gallery is crowded. Mattie is at the back of a press of standees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her point-of-view, semi-obstructed: on the witness stand is Rooster Cogburn, a rough- hewn man going to middle-aged fat. He has a patch over one eye.
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The woman was out in the yard dead with blowflies on her face and the old man was inside with his breast blowed open by a scatter-gun and his feet burned. He was still alive but just was. He said them two Wharton boys had done it, rode up drunk--
	</DIALOGUE>
</Cogburn>
<Mr_Goudy>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Objection. Hearsay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mr_Goudy>
<Mr_Barlow>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dying declaration, your honor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mr_Barlow>
<Judge>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Overruled. Procede, Mr. Cogburn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Judge>
<Cogburn>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Them two Wharton boys--that'd be Odus and C.C.-- throwed down on him, asked him where his money was, when he wouldn't talk lit pine knots and held 'em to his feet. He told 'em in a fruit jar under a gray rock at one corner of the smokehouse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Cogburn>
<Mr_Barlow>
<DIRECTION>
And then?
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
<DIRECTION>
Well he died on us. Passed away in considerable pain.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Barlow>
<DIRECTION>
What did you do then?
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
<DIRECTION>
Me and Marshal Potter went out to the smokehouse and that rock had been moved and that jar was gone.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Goudy>
<DIRECTION>
Objection. Speculative.
</DIRECTION>
<Judge>
<DIRECTION>
Sustained.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Barlow>
<DIRECTION>
You found a flat gray rock at the corner of the smokehouse with a hollowed-out space under it?
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Goudy>
<DIRECTION>
If the prosecutor is going to give evidence I suggest that he be sworn.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Barlow>
<DIRECTION>
Marshal Cogburn, what did you find, if anything, at the corner of the smokehouse?
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
<DIRECTION>
We found a flat gray rock with a hollowed-out space under it. Nothin there.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Barlow>
<DIRECTION>
And what did--
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
<DIRECTION>
No jar or nothin.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Barlow>
<DIRECTION>
What did you do then?
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
<DIRECTION>
Well we rode up to the Whartons', near where the North Fork strikes the Canadian, branch of the Canadian.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Barlow>
<DIRECTION>
And what did you find?
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
<DIRECTION>
I had my glass and we spotted the two boys and their old daddy, Aaron Wharton, down there on the creek bank with some hogs. They'd killed a shoat and was butchering it. They'd built a fire under a wash pot for scalding water.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Barlow>
<DIRECTION>
What did you do?
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
<DIRECTION>
Crept down. I announced that we was U.S. marshals and hollered to Aaron that we needed to talk to his boys. He picked up a axe and commenced to cussing us and blackguarding this court.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Barlow>
<DIRECTION>
What did you do then?
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
<DIRECTION>
Backed away trying to talk some sense into him. But C.C. edges over by the wash pot and picks up a shotgun. Potter seen him but it was too late. C.C. Wharton pulled down on Potter with one barrel and then turned to do the same for me with the other. I shot him and when the old man swung the axe I shot him. Odus lit out and I shot him. Aaron Wharton and C.C. Wharton was dead when they hit the ground but Odus was just winged.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Barlow>
<DIRECTION>
Did you find the jar with the hundred and twenty dollars in it?
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Goudy>
<DIRECTION>
Leading.
</DIRECTION>
<Judge>
<DIRECTION>
Sustained.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Barlow>
<DIRECTION>
What happened then?
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
<DIRECTION>
I found the jar with a hundred and twenty dollars in it.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Barlow>
<DIRECTION>
And what happened to Marshal Potter?
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
<DIRECTION>
Died. Leaves a wife and six babies.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Goudy>
<DIRECTION>
Objection.
</DIRECTION>
<Judge>
<DIRECTION>
Strike the comment.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Barlow>
<DIRECTION>
And what became of Odus Wharton?
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
<DIRECTION>
There he sets.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Barlow>
<DIRECTION>
Okay. You may ask, Mr. Goudy.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Goudy>
<DIRECTION>
Thank you, Mr. Barlow. In your four years as U.S. marshal, Mr. Cogburn, how many men have you shot?
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Barlow>
<DIRECTION>
Objection.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Goudy>
<DIRECTION>
There is more to this shooting than meets the eye, Judge Parker. I will establish the bias of this witness.
</DIRECTION>
<Judge>
<DIRECTION>
Objection is overruled.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Goudy>
<DIRECTION>
How many, Mr. Cogburn?
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never shot nobody I didn't have to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Cogburn>
<Mr_Goudy>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was not the question. How many?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mr_Goudy>
<Cogburn>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . Shot or killed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Cogburn>
<Mr_Goudy>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let us restrict it to "killed" so that we may have a manageable figure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mr_Goudy>
<Cogburn>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Around twelve or fifteen. Stopping men in flight, defending myself, et cetera.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Cogburn>
<Mr_Goudy>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Around twelve or fifteen. So many that you cannot keep a precise count. Remember, you are under oath. I have examined the records and can supply the accurate figure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mr_Goudy>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe them two Whartons make twenty-three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Cogburn>
<Mr_Goudy>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty-three dead men in four years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mr_Goudy>
<Cogburn>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is a dangerous business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Cogburn>
<Mr_Goudy>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many members of this one family, the Wharton family, have you killed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mr_Goudy>
<Cogburn>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Immediate, or--
	</DIALOGUE>
</Cogburn>
<Mr_Barlow>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your honor, perhaps counsel should be advised that the marshal is not the defendant in this action.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mr_Barlow>
<Mr_Barlow>
<DIRECTION>
The history is relevant your honor. Goes to Cogburn's methods and animosities.
</DIRECTION>
<Judge>
<DIRECTION>
Okay.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Barlow>
<DIRECTION>
Did you also shoot Dub Wharton, brother, and Clete Wharton, half-brother?
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
<DIRECTION>
Clete was selling ardent spirits to the Cherokee. He come at me with a king bolt.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Goudy>
<DIRECTION>
You were armed and he advanced upon you with nothing but a king bolt? From a wagon tongue?
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
<DIRECTION>
I've seen men badly tore up with things no bigger than a king bolt. I defended myself.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Goudy>
<DIRECTION>
And, returning to the encounter with Aaron and his two remaining sons, you sprang from cover with your revolver in hand?
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
<DIRECTION>
I did.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Goudy>
<DIRECTION>
Loaded and cocked?
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
<DIRECTION>
If it ain't loaded and cocked it don't shoot.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Goudy>
<DIRECTION>
And like his son, Aaron Wharton advanced against an armed man?
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
<DIRECTION>
He was armed. He had that axe raised.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Goudy>
<DIRECTION>
Yes. I believe you testified that you backed away from Aaron Wharton?
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
<DIRECTION>
That is right.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Goudy>
<DIRECTION>
Which direction were you going?
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
<DIRECTION>
I always go backwards when I'm backing up.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Goudy>
<DIRECTION>
Very amusing I suppose--for all of us except Aaron Wharton. Now, he advanced upon you much in the manner of Clete Wharton menacing you with that king bolt or rolled- up newspaper or whatever it was.
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
<DIRECTION>
Yes sir. He commenced to cussing and laying about with threats.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Goudy>
<DIRECTION>
And you were backing away? How many steps before the shooting started?
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
<DIRECTION>
Seven, eight steps?
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Goudy>
<DIRECTION>
Aaron Wharton keeping pace, advancing, away from the fire seven eight steps--what would that be, fifteen, twenty feet?
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
<DIRECTION>
I suppose.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Goudy>
<DIRECTION>
Will you explain to the jury, Mr. Cogburn, why Mr. Wharton was found immediately by the wash pot with one arm in the fire, his sleeve and hand smoldering?
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
<DIRECTION>
Well.
</DIRECTION>
<Mr_Goudy>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you move the body after you shot him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mr_Goudy>
<Cogburn>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would I do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Cogburn>
<Mr_Goudy>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did not drag his body over to the fire? Fling his arm in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mr_Goudy>
<Cogburn>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Cogburn>
<Mr_Goudy>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two witnesses who arrived on the scene will testify to the location of the body. You do not remember moving the body? So it was a bushwack, as he tended his campfire?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mr_Goudy>
<Mr_Barlow>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Objection.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mr_Barlow>
<Cogburn>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I, if that was where the body was I might have moved him. I do not remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Cogburn>
<Mr_Goudy>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would you move the body, Mr. Cogburn?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mr_Goudy>
<Cogburn>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Them hogs rooting around might have moved him. I do not remember.

He does not look up from the cigarette he is trying to roll. His hands are shaking.

	I would like to talk with you a minute.

</Mattie>
<Cogburn>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Let me do that.

</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the fixings and rolls, licks, and twists the cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . Your makings are too dry. I am looking for the man who shot and killed my father, Frank Ross, in front of the Monarch boarding house. The man's name is Tom Chaney. They say he is over in Indian Territory and I need somebody to go after him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Cogburn>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is your name, girl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Cogburn>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Mattie Ross. We are located in Yell County. My mother is at home looking after my sister Victoria and my brother Little Frank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Cogburn>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had best go home to them. They will need help with the churning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Cogburn>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is a fugitive warrant out for Chaney. The government will pay you two dollars for bringing him in plus ten cents a mile for each of you. On top of that I will pay you a fifty- dollar reward.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Cogburn gazes at her.
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you?
	</DIALOGUE>

(looks at the flour sack she holds)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What've you got there in your poke?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Cogburn>
<DIRECTION>
She opens it. Cogburn smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<Cogburn>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . By God! A Colt's dragoon! Why, you're no bigger than a corn nubbin, what're you doing with a pistol like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Cogburn>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I intend to kill Tom Chaney with it if the law fails to do so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Cogburn>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that piece will do the job--if you can find a high stump to rest it on and a wall to put behind you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Cogburn>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody here knew my father and I am afraid nothing much is going to be done about Chaney except I do it. My brother is a child and my mother is indecisive and hobbled by grief.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Cogburn>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe you have fifty dollars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Cogburn>
<Mattie>

	I will shortly. I have a contract with Colonel Stonehill which he will make payment on tomorrow or the next day, once a lawyer countersigns.

EVENING--BOARDING HOUSE PORCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie climbs the few steps from the street. Her attention is drawn by:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man sitting on a chair to one side enjoying the quiet of the evening. He is dressed for riding, with perhaps a bit too much panache. It is almost dark and he is hard to see but it seems he is watching Mattie, amused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He raises a pipe to his mouth and pulls at it. The glow from the excited bowl kicks on his eyes, which are indeed tracking her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie, discomfited by his look, turns hastily forward and pushes open the door. A jingling sound prompts one more glance to the side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man's face is now hidden by his hat. Just before Mattie's point of view, now a lateral track, starts to lose him behind the door jamb, he raises a spurred boot to push against the porch rail and tip his chair back. He raises his other foot, spur jingling, and drapes it over the first.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are pushing in on the landlady.
</DIRECTION>
<Landlady>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't your mother expecting you home, dear? I did not think to see you this evening.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Landlady>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My business is not yet finished. Mrs. Floyd, have any rooms opened up? Grandma Turner. . . the bed is quite narrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Landlady>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The second-floor back did open up but the gentleman on the porch has just taken it. But don't worry yourself, dear--you are not disturbing Grandma Turner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Landlady>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: DARK BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As before, unseen Grandma Turner snores loudly as wind whistles and Mattie shivers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fade to black.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Very quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the quiet, a faint crickle-crackle of flame. It is followed by a lip-pop and a deep inhale.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie opens her eyes. She is beaded with sweat. She looks blearily up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is dim. A man sits facing her in a straghtback chair, faintly backlit by the daylight leaking through the curtained window behind him. He exhales pipesmoke.
</DIRECTION>
<Cowboy>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are sleeping the day away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Cowboy>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
The man rises and, spurs jingling, crosses to the window, and throws open the curtain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie squints at him against the daylight:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man has a cowlick and barndoor ears and is once again well-accoutered for riding. He steps away from the window and reseats himself.
</DIRECTION>
<Cowboy>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do not look well. My name is LeBoeuf. I have just come from Yell County.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Cowboy>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have no rodeo clowns in Yell County.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A saucy line will not get you far with me. I saw your mother yesterday morning. She says for you to come right on home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hm. What was your business there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
LeBoeuf takes a small photograph from his coat.
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a man I think you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie looks at the picture through red-rimmed eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . You called him Tom Chaney, I believe. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie declines to contradict. LeBoeuf continues:
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . though in the months I have been tracking him he has used the names Theron Chelmsford, John Todd Andersen, and others. He dallied in Monroe, Louisiana, and Pine Bluff, Arkansas before turning up at your father's place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you not catch him in Monroe, Louisiana or Pine Bluff, Arkansas?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is a crafty one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought him slow-witted myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was his act.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a good one. Are you some kind of law?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
LeBoeuf tips back in his chair and draws back his coat to display a star. A smug look.
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. I am a Texas Ranger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That may make you a big noise in that state; in Arkansas you should mind that your Texas trappings and title do not make you an object of fun. Why have you been ineffectually pursuing Chaney?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
LeBoeuf's smile stays in place with effort.
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He shot and killed a state senator named Bibbs down in Waco, Texas. The Bibbs family have put out a reward.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How came Chaney to shoot a state senator?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My understanding is there was an argument about a dog. Do you know anything about where Chaney has gone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is in the Territory, and I hold out little hope for you earning your bounty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My man will beat you to it. I have hired a deputy marshal, the toughest one they have, and he is familiar with the Lucky Ned Pepper gang that they say Chaney has tied up with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I will throw in with you and your marshal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Marshal Cogburn and I are fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll be to our mutual advantage. Your marshal I presume knows the Territory; I know Chaney. It is at least a two-man job taking him alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When Chaney is taken he is coming back to Fort Smith to hang. I am not having him go to Texas to hang for shooting some senator.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Haw-haw! It is not important where he hangs, is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is to me. Is it to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It means a great deal of money to me. It's been many months' work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry that you are paid piecework not on wages, and that you have been eluded the winter long by a halfwit. Marshal Cogburn and I are fine.

</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
LeBoeuf stands.
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You give out very little sugar with your pronouncements. While I sat there watching you I gave some thought to stealing a kiss, though you are very young and sick and unattractive to boot, but now I have a mind to give you five or six good licks with my belt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie rolls away onto her side.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One would be as unpleasant as the other. If you wet your comb, it might tame that cowlick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyelids droop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spurs jingle and fade away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Distant voices from the street. Clanging church bell. Very close, the clink of bottle against cup.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie looks blearily over. The room is now filled with long shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The landlady has materialized at the side of the bed. She is pouring something from a bottle into a ceramic cup.
</DIRECTION>
<Landlady>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try some Dr. Underwood's. You may feel giddy but do not be alarmed as that is only the medicine working.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Landlady>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie obediently rises to an elbow, drinks, then drops back onto the pillow. A clunk:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The landlady has set the bottle down on the nightstand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie squints at the bottle:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Underwood's Bile Activator. Approved by Physicians and Clergymen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room's shadows grow longer still and crawl up the bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The voice of the unseen landlady echoes and trails away:
</DIRECTION>
<Landlady>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will charge you ten cents. It probably means a loss for me, but it is hard to figure the exact proportion of the bottle. . .

The bareback horseman enters frame and recedes, rifle tied to his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A saddled horse stands in the middle of the street, pointed at the receding Tom Chaney.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chaney disappears down the dark street into the falling snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Small hands reach up and wrap the saddlehorn on the waiting horse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie's face appears over the saddle as she tries to pull herself up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close on her feet rising from the ground, then pedaling, seeking purchase. There are no stirrups.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close on Mattie again. Sweating, she succeeds in chinning and elbowing herself onto the horse's back. The sound of the fleeing horseman has receded almost to nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gets herself arranged in the saddle. She looks down for the reins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The reins hang down from the bit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lies forward onto the horse's neck, a fistful of mane in one hand, reaching with the other. . . reaching down. . . her fingers curl around the reins. . . she pulls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The horse tosses its head and rears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie's legs squeeze the horses flanks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her fingers tighten on the horses mane but she is slipping, falling. . .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the boarding house bedroom Mattie's hands clutch at pillow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A phlegm-hawking sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A woman in a nightgown, face obscured by sleeping bonnet, approaches the bed and disappears around its far side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of the old woman climbing into bed and settling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a beat, the covers are yanked from Mattie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After another beat--snoring.
</DIRECTION>

The door bangs open at the cut and Mattie emerges with an envelope.

It is day.

:SC: STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie walks down the street holding the ripped-open envelope in one hand and some unfolded papers in the other, the topmost of which she reads as she walks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the letter's contents in a gruff male voice-over:
</DIRECTION>
<Letter>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mattie. I wish you would leave these matters entirely to me, or at the very least do me the courtesy of consulting me before entering such agreements. I am not scolding you, but I am saying your headstrong ways will lead you into a tight corner one day. I trust the enclosed document will let you conclude your business and return to Dardanelle. Your mother is in a panic and begging me to fetch you back home. Yours, J. Noble Dagget.

Wider shows that we are once again in the office of Stonehill, the stock trader. He examines the release through bleary eyes, displaying none of his former vinegar.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was as bad yesterday as you look today. I was forced to share a bed with Grandma Turner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
The trader's eyes are still on the paper:
</DIRECTION>
<Stonehill>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not acquainted with Grandma Turner. If she is a resident of this city it does not surprise me that she carries disease. I was told this malarial place was to be the Chicago of the Southwest. Well, my little friend, it is not the Chicago of the Southwest. I cannot rightly say what it is, but it has ruined my health as it has my finances.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Stonehill>
<DIRECTION>
He drops the paper.
</DIRECTION>
<Stonehill>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . I owe you money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Stonehill>
<DIRECTION>
He works a key in a drawer and takes out money and counts during the following.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have not traded poorly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Stonehill>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certainly not. I am paying you for a horse I do not possess and have bought back a string of useless ponies I cannot sell again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Stonehill>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are forgetting the gray horse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Stonehill>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Crowbait.

</Stonehill>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are looking at the thing in the wrong light.

</Mattie>
<Stonehill>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am looking at it in the light of God's eternal truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Stonehill>
<DIRECTION>
He hands the money across and Mattie counts to confirm.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your illness is putting you "down in the dumps." You will soon find a buyer for the ponies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Stonehill>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a tentative offer of ten dollars per head from the Pfitzer Soap Works of Little Rock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Stonehill>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would be a shame to destroy such spirited horseflesh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Stonehill>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it would. I am confident the deal will fall through.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Stonehill>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look here. I need a pony. I will pay ten dollars for one of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Stonehill>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. That was lot price. No no. Wait a minute. Are we trading again? I just handed you twenty dollars each for those ponies and you now propose to buy one back for ten? Little girl: I will give you ten dollars to refrain from doing any more business here. It would be the most astute deal I have struck in Arkansas.

:SC: STABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are tracking along a line of stalls toward a small corral holding a black mustang, among other ponies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie is approaching the horse. A black stablehand has been trailing her, humping her father's saddle.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This one is beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
She rubs the muzzle of the black horse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the saddle from the stablehand and tries to throw it over the horse. She is not tall or strong enough.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stableboy helps, then helps her up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The horse does not move for a long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stableboy is laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<Stableboy>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He don't know they's a person up there. You too light.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Stableboy>
<DIRECTION>
She kicks lightly and the horse abruptly pitches once or twice and then starts prancing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stableboy, still laughing, stands in the middle of a circle defined by the prancing horse.
</DIRECTION>
<Stableboy>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He thinks he got a horsefly on him.

Mattie leans forward to calm the horse, rubbing the muzzle and shushing him.

She straightens.

	He is very spirited. I will call him "Little Blackie."

She reins the horse around and heads for the door, calling back:

<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank Mr. Stonehill for me.

Peering in is Mattie; holding the makeshift curtain open is an elderly Chinese.

Behind them we can see the shelves of a modest grocery store and in the deep background its bright street-facing window.
</DIRECTION>
<Chinese>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See. Sleep.

<DIRECTION>
Reverse: a squalid living area crowded with effects. It is dim. There is snoring. Rooster Cogburn is in a Chinese rope bed, his weight bowing it almost to the ground.

Mattie steps in.

	Into the Indian Territory. In pursuit of Tom Chaney.

</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches over a pouch of tobacco and begins fumbling with cigarette makings.

Mattie takes out some cash.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said fifty dollars to retrieve Chaney. You did not believe me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster is sobered by the sight of the currency.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I did not know. You are a hard one to figure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long for you to make ready to depart?

</Mattie>

Mattie takes the cigarette fixings at which Rooster is fumbling and works on a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well now wait now, sis. I remember your offer but do not remember agreeing to it. If I'm going up against Ned Pepper I will need a hundred dollars. I can tell you that much. Hundred dollars! I am not pursuing his gang through Arkansas, where there is law, and the criminal is out of his element. They are in the Territory, in their element, where there is no law and the marshal stands alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
He spits again.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Hundred dollars is the right amount. I will take those fifty dollars in advance. There will be expenses.

</Rooster>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are trying to take advantage of me.

	I have slept out at night. Papa took me and Little Frank coon hunting last summer on the Petit Jean. We were in the woods all night. We sat around a big fire and Yarnell told ghost stories. We had a good time.

<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is the same idea as a coon hunt. You are just trying to make your work sound harder than it is. Here is the money. I aim to get Tom Chaney and if you are not game I will find somebody who is game. All I have heard out of you so far is talk. I know you can drink whiskey and snore and spit and wallow in filth and bemoan your station. The rest has been braggadocio. They told me you had grit and that is why I came to you. I am not paying for talk. I can get all the talk I need and more at the Monarch Boarding House.

He drops back into the rope bed, which sets it swaying. As he stares up at the ceiling:

Mattie makes early-morning preparations to leave as Grandma Turner snores. She unrolls her father's traps and takes out a big-brimmed fisherman's hat and puts it on: too big. She lines it with newspaper, experimenting with the amount until it fits. She puts on his coat, gives the sleeves a big cuff. She examines the Colt's dragoon. She drops apples into a sack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She finishes by folding a letter she has written and putting it into an envelope. Throughout, we have been hearing its contents in voice-over:
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dearest Mother. I am about to embark on a great adventure. Or dare I call it a mission, for shall any of us rest easy ere Papa's death is avenged?

Tracking toward Rooster's rope bed. A hat is pulled down over the face of the figure reclining in it. Smoke sifts up from somewhere.

Mattie draws up to the figure with mounting concern. She pulls the hat off. It is the elderly Chinese grocer.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is Marshal Cogburn!

</Mattie>

The grocer reaches a pipe and pulls on it. His manner is dreamy.

The grocer pulls an envelope from underneath his robe and hands it to Mattie. He closes his eyes and drifts away.

<DIRECTION>
Mattie pulls a scrap of paper from the envelope and reads:
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here inside is a train ticket for your return home. Use it. By the time you read this I will be across the river in the Indian nation. Pursuit would be futile. I will return with your man Chaney. Leave me to my work. Reuben Cogburn.

Mattie's jaw tightens. She abruptly crumples the paper.

:SC: RIVER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie gallops down an embankment to a river of some width. At the near-side ferry
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
station a raft enclosed by railing waits, its guide rope strung across the river. A pilot idles on the near shore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the far shore two small figures, mounted, ascend the opposite bank. Mattie draws up in front of the ferryman at the edge of the river.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that Marshal Cogburn?

</Mattie>

He reaches for the reins of her horse.
</DIRECTION>
<Ferryman>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're the runaway. Marshal told me you'd show up. I'm to present you to the sheriff.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	That is a story. Let go my horse. I have business across the river.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
The ferryman is leading Little Blackie back up the hill toward the town. Mattie cranes around to look at the two small figures across the river. They have twisted in their saddles to look back.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . Look Slim, if you don't turn around and take me across you may find yourself in court where you don't want to be. I have a good lawyer.

	Name ain't Slim.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Ferryman>

She looks at the dull man's unresponsive back. She twists to look across the river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two mounted figures are breaking their look back and resuming their climb up the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
bank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie draws an apple from the bag slung round the saddlehorn and pegs it, hard as she can, at the ferryman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It hits him square in the back of the head. He reacts, reaching to his head and dropping the reins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie has already leaned forward for the reins and sweeps them back. She saws Little Blackie around and sends him galloping for the river.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run, Little Blackie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Ferryman>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!

<DIRECTION>
She urges the horse, at the gallop, into the river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The splashing and shouts have again drawn the attention of the two men across the river.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the horse goes further into the river its up-and-down gait slows, the water offering resistance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ferryman has run down to the bank. He stoops for a rock and throws it. It misses by a mile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Little Blackie leaves riverbottom and starts swimming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two men across the river, having twisted to look, now rein their horses round to face the action. But they do not advance. They rest forearms on pommels and watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Little Blackie is being carried downstream as he swims against a swift current.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good, Little Blackie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Little Blackie's head dips as he finds his feet again. He slogs laboriously to what is now the nearer shore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two men up the bank impassively watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The horse and Mattie emerge fully from the river, dripping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie taps heels against Little Blackie's flanks and walks him slowly up the bank. She
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stops many yards short of the two men--Rooster and LeBoeuf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A silent standoff as Little Blackie breathes heavily. The two expressionless men still have not stirred.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At length:
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's quite a horse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>

A long pause.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>

</Rooster>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	From the money you stole from me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was not stolen. I'm out for your man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was to accompany you. If I do not, there is no agreement and my money was stolen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster licks his lips, thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marshal, put this child back on the ferry. We have a long road, and time is a-wasting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I go back, it is to the office of the U.S. marshals to report the theft of my money. And futile, Marshal Cogburn-- "Pursuit would be futile"?--is not spelt f-u-d-e-l.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
A heavy silence as Cogburn stares at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LeBoeuf looks between the two, waiting for Rooster to take action. Gathering that he will not, LeBoeuf slides off his horse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie watches as he walks to Little Blackie, holding up a gentling hand for the horse to sniff at and nuzzle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He abruptly swipes the reins with one hand and with the other grabs Mattie's ankle. He pushes momentarily to unstirrup the foot and then pulls hard, tumbling Mattie to the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ground.
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Little sister, it is time for your spanking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
He begins to spank her.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me, Marshal!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster sits impassively on his horse.
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
(still spanking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you do as the grown-ups say! Or I will get myself a birch switch and stripe your leg!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie is struggling and in spite of herself starts to weep. LeBoeuf drags her through the dirt to a mesquite bush and snaps off a switch.
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now we will see what tune you sing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie, wet and filthy, tries vainly to swat back. Rooster still watches without expression as LeBoeuf whips the girl.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you going to let him do this, Marshal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, quietly:
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't believe I will. Put your switch away, LeBoeuf. She has got the best of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
LeBoeuf looks back, for a moment too surprised to speak. He then regains his resolve:
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She has not got the best of me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
He returns to the beating.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
(evenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you not hear me? That will do, I said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I aim to finish what I started.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That will be the biggest mistake you ever made, you Texas brush-popper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of a gun being cocked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LeBoeuf leaves off the beating to stare at Rooster--whose gun is drawn, cocked, and pointed at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LeBoeuf flings the switch aside and stalks to his horse. He mutters, but loud enough to be heard:
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hoorawed by a little girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: CAMPFIRE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie sits looking into the fire, hands clasped around her knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LeBoeuf sits feet to the fire, smoking a pipe that, with his boyish face, makes him look as if he is playing at professor. He gazes into the fire, musing as he pulls at the pipe.
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not accustomed to so large a fire. In Texas, we will make do with a fire of little more than twigs or buffalo chips to heat the night's ration of beans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster enters the circle of light with an armload of wood.
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . And, it is Ranger policy never to make your camp in the same place as your cookfire. Very imprudent to make your presence known in unsettled country.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster gazes at LeBoeuf for a beat, then dumps the wood onto the fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leaves the circle of light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LeBoeuf addresses the darkness that Rooster has disappeared into:
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . How do you know that Bagby will have intelligence?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has a store.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
He reenters with a length of rope, and a robe which he unrolls onto the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A store. That makes him an authority on movements in the Territory?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster plays out one end of the rope to just touch the ground, then starts playing out the rest as he paces.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have entered a wild place. Anyone coming in, wanting any kind of supply, cannot pick and choose his portal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
He has finished making a loop around his sleeping robe. Seeing this, LeBoeuf laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is a piece of foolishness. All the snakes are asleep this time of year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
As he leaves the circle of light:
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They have been known to wake up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me have a rope too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A snake would not bother you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
He reenters with a bottle and settles down on his robe.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . You are too little and bony. Before you sleep you should fetch water for the morning and put it by the fire. The creek'll ice over tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am not going down there again. If you want any more water you can fetch it yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone in my party must do his job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are lucky to be traveling in a place where a spring is so handy. In my country you can ride for days and see no ground water. I have lapped filthy water from a hoofprint and was glad to have it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I ever meet one of you Texas waddies that says he never drank water from a horse track I think I will shake his hand and give him a Daniel Webster cigar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't believe it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believed it the first twenty-five times I heard it. Maybe it is true. Maybe lapping water off the ground is Ranger policy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are getting ready to show your ignorance now, Cogburn. I don't mind a little personal chaffing but I won't hear anything against the Ranger troop from a man like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long have you boys been mounted on sheep down there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
LeBoeuf leaps angrily to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My shaggy horse will be galloping when that big American stud of yours is winded and collapsed. Now make another joke about it. You are only trying to put on a show for this girl Mattie with what you must think is a keen tongue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is like women talking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, that is the way! Make me out foolish in this girl's eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think she has got you pretty well figured.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Crackling fire.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you two like to hear the story of "The Midnight Caller"? One of you will have to be "The Caller." I will tell you what to say. I will do all the other parts myself.

LeBoeuf continues to glare at Rooster, breathing heavily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster, with a loud flap, whips the robe over himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are close on Mattie's upturned face. Snowflakes are drifting down onto it and melting. Mattie's eyes blink open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster is already at his horse, packing it. LeBoeuf is not in evidence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie rises.

<Mattie>

<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is Mr. LeBoeuf?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
A toss of his head:
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Down the hill. Performing his necessaries.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marshal Cogburn, I welcome the chance for a private parley. I gather that you and Mr. LeBoeuf have come to some sort of agreement. As your employer I believe I have a right to know the particulars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The particulars is that we bring Chaney in to the magistrate in San Saba Texas where they have a considerable reward on offer. Which we split.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did not want him brought to Texas, to have Texas punishment administered for a Texas crime. That was not our agreement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster gives a vicious tug on the cinchrope.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you want is to have him caught and punished.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want him to know he is being punished for killing my father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster turns to her.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can let him know that. You can tell him to his face. You can spit on him and make him eat sand out of the road. I will hold him down. If you want I will flay the flesh off the soles of his feet and find you an Indian pepper to rub into the wound. Isn't that a hundred dollars' value?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is not. When I have bought and paid for something I will have my way. Why do you think I am paying you if not to have my way?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is time for you to learn you cannot have your way in every little particular. Other people have their interests.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
We hear spurs jingling.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . I am a free agent. If you find I fail to satisfy your terms I will return your money at the end of this expedition.

</Rooster>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Little Blackie and I are riding back to the U.S. marshals' office. This is fraud.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a business conversation.
	</DIALOGUE>

<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that what you call it. It sounds to me like you are still being hoorawed by a little girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you say hooraw!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was the word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will show you hooraw!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no hoorawing in it. My agreement with the Marshal antedates yours. It has the force of law.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
(amused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The force of law! This man is a notorious thumper! He rode by the light of the moon with Quantrill and Bloody Bill Anderson!

<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those men was patriots, Texas trash!

	They murdered women and children in Lawrence, Kansas.

	I have heard that too. It is a damned lie! What army was you in, mister?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was at Shreveport first with Kirby-Smith--

</LeBoeuf>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What side was you on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was in the army of Northern Virginia, Cogburn, and I don't have to hang my head when I say it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you had served with Captain Quantrill--

<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain Quantrill indeed!

<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had best let this go, LeBoeuf!

</Rooster>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain of what!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good, then! There are not sufficient dollars in the state of Texas to make it worth my while to listen to your opinions, day and night. Our agreement is nullified--it's each man for himself!

</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
LeBoeuf is already mounting his shaggy horse.
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That suits me!

</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
He saws the horse around.
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . Congratulations, Cogburn. You have graduated from marauder to wetnurse. Adios!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
LeBoeuf gallops off with the thunder of hoofs and the jingle of spurs, and Rooster, seething, turns back to his work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the hoofbeats recede, Mattie sounds a note of regret:
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't need him, do we Marshal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Rooster>
<DIRECTION>

:SC: EXTERIOR BAGBY'S STORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mule is pulling back on a cotton rope round his neck that is tied off to the porch of the ramshackle store. The beast is strangling as the rope is too tight, and he is being poked with sticks by two motley-dressed Indian boys up on the porch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster enters and cuts the rope. The mule brays and canters off, shaking its head, rope dangling.
</DIRECTION>
<Indian_Youth>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Indian_Youth>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster is already mounting the steps to the porch.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call that sport, do ya?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
He kicks the first youth hard in the ass, sending him sprawling off the porch into the dirt. The second backs against the railing and Rooster shoves him in the chest so that he flips backward to also land in the dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay here sister. I will see Bagby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie, astride Little Blackie, holds the reins of Cogburn's horse. As he disappears inside the two youths climb back onto the porch. They sit at the lip, feet dangling, and stare sullenly at Mattie. She stares back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The youths have not moved. The door bangs open and Rooster emerges.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Has Chaney been here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
Crossing back he kicks one of the boys off the porch into the dirt again. The other youth scampers out of footreach. Rooster starts down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Coke Hayes was, two days ago. Coke runs with Lucky Ned. He bought supplies, with this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
With a ching he flips a coin to Mattie. She inspects it: gold, square, with a +-shaped cut- out in the middle.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Papa's gold piece! Tom Chaney, here we come!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is not the world's only California gold piece.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They are rare, here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They are rare. But if it is Chaney's, it could just as easily mean that Lucky Ned and his gang fell upon him, as that he fell in with them. Chaney could be a corpse. These are a rough lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That would be a bitter disappointment, Marshal. What do we do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster mounts up.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We pursue. Ned is unfinished business for the marshals anyhow, and when we have him we will also have Chaney --or we can learn the whereabouts of his body. Bagby doesn't know which way they went, but now we know they come through here, they couldn't be going but one of two ways: north toward the Winding Stair Mountains, or pushing on further west. I suspect north. There is more to rob.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
The youth who was kicked into the dirt is dusting himself off. He has been listening without interest.

Rooster and Mattie ride abreast along a barely defined road.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Potter and I served with him at Elkhorn Tavern. Even latterly our activities was by and large martial. We did though, one time, run across a Yankee paymaster and relieve him of four thousand dollars in gold coin. Squealed like it was his own money. Well, since hostilities was officially ended it was technically criminal so Potter rode down to Arkansas and I went to Cairo Illinois with my share, started calling myself Burroughs and opened an eating place called The Green Frog. I married a grass widow but my drinking picked up and my wife did not like the company of my river friends. She decided to go back to her first husband, a clerk in a hardware store. She said, "Goodbye, Reuben, a love for decency does not abide in you." I told her, "Goodbye, Nola, I hope that little nail-selling bastard will make you happy this time." She took my boy with her too. He never did like me anyhow. I guess I did speak awful rough to him but I did not mean nothing by it. You would not want to see a clumsier child than Horace. I bet he broke forty cups. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
He frowns and draws up, looking at something. Mattie follows his look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man is hanging in a tree--very high, perhaps thirty feet off the ground. The body slowly twists. The head seems unnaturally large.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
At Rooster's shout something separates from the head: we have been looking at not just the corpse's silhouette but that of a large carrion-eating bird as well, perched on the corpse's shoulder and feeding at the corpse's face. The bird flaps clumsily off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster gazes at the strung-up body.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it Chaney?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would not recognize the soles of his feet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster gets off his horse, pulls a knife from his gear, and ambles to the tree. Mattie follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she arrives Rooster has started sawing at the rope that ties the body off, wrapped around a chest-high branch stump. Mattie looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is looking mostly at soles of feet as the foreshortened body twists slowly, high above.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Step back now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
She does. Rooster steps back as well as the almost-cut-through rope starts to unravel by itself, crazily twisting under the pressure and gently spinning the body above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rope snaps. It yanks violently upward, slapping branches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The body drops--perhaps four feet--and jerks to a stop, jacknifing and dancing.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God damn it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
They both gaze up at the body.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Snagged. Well you are going to have to clamber on up with this knife. I am too old and too fat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: UP IN THE TREE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie is well up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear Rooster's voice from below:
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It had one billiard table, served ladies and men both but mostly men. I tried to run it myself a while but I couldn't keep good help and I never did learn how to buy meat. I was like a man fighting bees. Finally I give up and solt it and went out to see the country.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie pauses, looking down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are over her. Rooster is foreshortened, a long way down, looking up, smoking a cigarette. He reacts to her look down:
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are doing well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up, down again, and then proceeds. Rooster continues as well:
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . That was when I went out to the staked plains of Texas and shot buffalo with Vernon Shaftoe and a Flathead Indian called Olly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie stretches onto tiptoes, reaches, just gets fingers around a branch. She secures it enough with the one hand to dare to reach with the other. She hauls herself up.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . The Mormons had run Shaftoe out of Great Salt Lake City but don't ask me what it was for. Call it a misunder- standing and let it go at that. There is no use in you asking me questions about it, for I will not answer them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie looks out, at waist-height to the corpse, which twists maybe eight feet away over the void. Rooster notes her look:
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . Is it our man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
The face is half-eaten and eyeless.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
She moves to start back down, but Rooster calls:
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Cut him down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I might know him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
She climbs one more branch to arrive at the hanging branch. She shimmies out onto it and pulls the knife from Rooster's belt now around her waist.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . You see, Olly and me both taken a solemn oath to keep silent. Well sir, the big shaggies is about all gone. It is a damned shame.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie looks down, over the shoulder of the close-by foreshortened corpse to the far foreshortened Rooster.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . I would give three dollars right now for a pickled buffalo tongue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
She calls out as she starts sawing:
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did they hang him so high?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Possibly in the belief it would make him more dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
The sawing continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster takes one step back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rope snaps. At once:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The body drops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The branch, unburdened, bucks with Mattie atop it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gasps, hugging at the branch, getting swung halfway around it but then righting herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The body hits the ground with a smack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie looks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The body is spread out on the ground below, many bones now broken, its posture absurd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster steps forward. He toes the upper body to get a view of the face. Barely audible:
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not know this man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
He reacts to something, looking up the road in the direction of their heading.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie looks out. Partly obscured by intervening foliage, an oncoming rider. His pace is unhurried.

Down on the ground Rooster turns to face the rider--an Indian with a long-bore rifle balanced sideways across the pommel of his saddle. He wears a tattered Union Army jacket, crossed bandoliers of rifle shells and a black homburg hat with a feather in its brim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster drops his hand to his gun as the rider approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie looks down at the foreshortened rider pulling up under the tree. She hears a greeting and a mostly inaudible exchange.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After some back-and-forth the Indian dismounts. The men stoop at either end of the corpse. Rooster grabs wrists, the Indian, ankles. They lift.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie frowns. She starts to move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: A MINUTE LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie finishes climbing down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster is just returning from the road to their two horses by the tree. The Indian, with the corpse slung over the rump of his horse, is resuming his trip in the direction from which Rooster and Mattie came.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He knew the hanged man?

<DIRECTION>
Rooster mounts.

<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He did not. But it is a dead body, possibly worth something in trade.

He looks up at the sky as snowflakes start to sift down.

	She had taken a notion she wanted me to be a lawyer. Bought a heavy book called Daniels on Negotiable Instruments and set me to reading it. Never could get a grip on it and I was happy enough to set it aside and leave Texas. There ain't but about six trees between there and Canada, and nothing else grows but has stickers on it. I went to--
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
A distant gunshot.

<DIRECTION>
Rooster stops. He twists to look behind.

<DIRECTION>
A listening beat. At length:

</Rooster>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Knew what?

</Mattie>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're being followed. I asked the Indian to signal with a shot if there was someone on our trail.

</Rooster>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should we be concerned, Marshal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. It's Mr. LeBoeuf, using us as bird dogs in hopes of cutting in once we've flushed the prey. Our Texas friend has got just enough sense to recognize he can't outtrack me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie thinks.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps we could double back over our tracks, and confuse the trail in a clever way.

<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, we will wait right here and offer our friend a warm hello, and ask him where he is going.

:SC: MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster waits, sitting casually astride his horse in the middle of the road. Snow continues to fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A jingling noise up the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Movement: an advancing rider seen through the foliage that masks a bend in the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster straightens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The oncoming rider rounds the bend.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He approaches: a white man with big whiskers, his horse leading a packhorse loaded with clinking and jangling sundries. Draped on his own horse's rump is the hanged man's body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stranger wears a fierce bear head as hat. The rest of the bearskin trails down his body as robe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He advances unhurriedly towards Rooster. At a few yards' distance he draws up, content to sit his horse and solemnly return Rooster's stare.

Rooster straightens as if to rein his horse around but stops with a thought:

	. . . It is fixing to get cold. Do you know of any place to take shelter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<Bear_Man>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have my bearskin. You might want to head to the Original Greaser Bob's. He notched a dugout into a hollow along the Carrillon River. If you ride the river you won't fail to see it. Greaser Bob--Original Greaser Bob--is hunting north of the picket wire and would not begrudge its use.

The Bear Man tilts his head to indicate the corpse behind him.

:SC: NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A point-of-view looking down on a thrown-together cabin dug into the flanks of a ravine. Its roof meets hillside at the rear. Smoke is coming out of a rough chimney.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster and Mattie have paused at the crest of the rise above the dugout to look. Rooster shrugs out of his coat.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take my jacket. Creep onto the roof. If they are not friendly I will give you a sign to damp the chimney.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
As Mattie descends to where hillside meets structure Rooster takes his rifle and walks around to the front door--crude planking hung on leather-strap hinges. His footsteps crunch in the snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door is yanked open, inches, and a backlit face appears over a hand holding a revolver. Rooster halts.
</DIRECTION>
<Man>

The door slams.

After a moment the light inside goes out.

Mattie, arriving on the roof, looks steeply down on Rooster. He glances up, thinking. He does not sign. He looks back at the door.

Rooster looks up at Mattie. He nods.

She balls the jacket and stuffs it into the chimney.

Rooster takes ten paces to one side of the door and then kneels in the snow, raising his rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Muffled coughs from inside the house--more than one person.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Activity inside--yelling--the hiss of fire being doused. Suddenly:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door flies open and--BANG! BANG!--two shotgun blasts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slightest beat as Mattie peers into the yard, and then--BANG!--shot rips through the roof just at her feet.

<DIRECTION>
A rifle blast--from Rooster. A yelp of pain from inside.

The door opens again. From the smoky black a shotgun and two revolvers are tossed out. Then, orange light: a lamp is lit. Two men emerge, one limping and holding onto the other, who holds high the lamp.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>

Rooster has coaxed the fire back to life. He peers into the large pot hanging over it.

Quincy sounds resentful:

Rooster, continuing to nose around, pushes the canvas cover off a crate of bottles.

	And a good store of whiskey as well. What are you boys up to, outside of cooking banquets? You are way too jumpy.

He travels its length and stops his horse before the cabin and dismounts. We hear the jingle of spurs.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . Damn. It is LeBoeuf.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
Distant, calling toward the cabin:
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
LeBoeuf unholsters a gun. He walks to the cabin, opens the door and peers in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster starts to rise, about to call out, as LeBoeuf enters and closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear hoofbeats. Many horses.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have to warn him, Marshal!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster is looking to the mouth of the ravine.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie follows his look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their high point-of-view: four riders just entering the ravine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look back to the cabin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From inside, faintly:
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and LeBoeuf stumbles out, wide-eyed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees the approaching riders. They see him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They slow, approaching with caution.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LeBoeuf looks at them, glances back over his shoulder, looks forward again.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do we do, Marshal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We sit. What does he do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
The riders stop several paces from LeBoeuf. They spread in a line facing him. Words are exchanged; we cannot make them out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LeBoeuf unholsters a gun and points it at the four men.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is a fine one for not drawing attention to himself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
The four men, slouched astride their horses, are not impressed by LeBoeuf's gun. There is more talking.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Him in the woolly chaps is Lucky Ned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
He refers to the mounted man who does most of the talking. Lucky Ned now speaks to the men on either side and the two corners advance, closing a circle around LeBoeuf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LeBoeuf looks warily from side side, swinging his gun to cover the group. None of the riders bothers to unholster a gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man to LeBoeuf's right lifts a rope off his saddle and casually twirls it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man to his left says something: LeBoeuf looks left and the man to his right drops the rope around LeBoeuf and pulls it tight. LeBoeuf is jerked off his feet, gun dropping. The mounted man backs his horse, taking the play from the rope. He dallies the free end round
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
his saddlehorn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two of the men slide off their horses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of them heads for the cabin door.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
BANG!--the rifleshot, just at Mattie's ear, is deafening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man heading to the cabin drops, shot in the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two horses that are now riderless rear and mill, panicked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The horse towing LeBoeuf also skitters, spooked, as its rider looks wildly about and starts shooting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lucky Ned looks toward our vantage point and also begins firing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster is methodically aiming and firing but in the commotion below his first couple of shots don't tell. His third drops Lucky Ned's horse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other unmounted man is frantically trying to snatch up the reins of one of the loose horses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man towing LeBoeuf spurs his horse toward one of the free horses, trying to grab it. LeBoeuf is dragged past plunging horses' hooves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cacaphony of screaming horses, crackling gunfire from the basin, and the boom of Rooster's rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The unmounted man has managed to grab a halter. He climbs with difficulty aboard the skittish horse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rider towing LeBoeuf cuts loose the towline. He gallops toward Ned Pepper with an arm outstretched to help him aboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster is tracking him with his rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lucky Ned grabs the extended arm. As he begins to swing up there is the BOOM of Rooster's rifle. The rider pitches off the horse but Lucky Ned manages to stay on, and swipes up the reins. He gallops off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The one other surviving horseman follows him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is one dead horse in the basin, a live unmounted horse racing crazy circles, and three still bodies. One is LeBoeuf's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster rises.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well that didn't pan out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: IN THE BASIN
</DIRECTION>

LeBoeuf is moaning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster walks toward him trailed by Mattie, glancing along the way at the two dead men.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You managed to put a kink in my rope, pardner.

</Rooster>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am theverely injured.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
Something is wrong with LeBoeuf's speech. Bloody saliva bubbles copiously from his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes you got drug some.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>

</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster stoops to examine.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is quite possible. The scheme did not develop as I had planned. You have been shot in the shoulder but the ball passed through. It will pain you in the years to come. What happened to your mouth?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe I beh mythelf.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster slaps lightly down at LeBoeuf's chin, signaling that he should open up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LeBoeuf does, and Rooster digs in with two dirty fingers, dipping his head to peer in as he
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pokes this way and that.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Couple of teeth missing and yes, the tongue is bit almost through. Do you want to see if it will knit or should I just yank it free? I know a teamster who bit his tongue off being thrown from a horse. After a time he learned to make himself more or less understood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hngnickh.

Bloody saliva bubbles out with the word. Rooster withdraws his fingers.

</Rooster>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Knit.

	Very well. It is impossible to bind a tongue wound. The shoulder we will kit out.

<DIRECTION>
Mattie goes to inspect the two outlaws' corpses as Rooster pokes back LeBoeuf's shirt to look at the wound.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . It's too bad. We just ran across a doctor of sorts but I do not know where he was headed.

Falling straight down: a windless night.

We hear a murmuring male voice from inside the cabin.

Mattie is finishing rubbing down her horse.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sleep well, Little Blackie. . .
	</DIALOGUE>

She puts up the brush and pulls an apple from her apple bag.

The horse chomps up the apple and she rubs its muzzle as it chews.

The horse huffs and blows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: FRONT OF THE CABIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are raking the four dead men who have been carelessly propped against the outside wall to sit in an irregular row. Mattie passes them, with a brief look, and opens the door, and the murmuring voice from inside fans up louder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Mattie enters. We see LeBoeuf musing before the fire as he cleans his Sharp's carbine --an awkward operation given the injury to his shoulder, now bandaged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All we see of Rooster, seated further from the fire, is a pair of boots, and legs stretching into darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie goes to the pot of food on the fire.
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Azh I understand it, Chaney--or Chelmzhford, azh he called himshelf in Texas--shot the shenator'zh dog. When the shenator remonshtrated Chelmzhford shot him azh well. You could argue that the shooting of the dog wazh merely an inshtansh of malum prohibitum, but the shooting of a shenator izh indubitably an inshtansh of malum in shay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster is a voice in the darkness:
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Malla-men what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Malum in se. The distinction is between an act that is wrong in itself, and an act that is wrong only according to our laws and mores. It is Latin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the pthoonk of a bottle yielding its cork, followed by the pthwa of the cork's being spit out.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am struck that LeBoeuf is shot, trampled, and nearly severs his tongue and not only does not cease to talk but spills the banks of English.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
We hear liquid slosh as the bottle is tipped back.
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I wuzh within three hundred yardzh of Chelmzhford once. The closhesht I have been. With the Sharp'sh carbine, that izh within range. But I wuzh mounted, and had the choish of firing off-hand, or dishmounting to shoot from resht--which would allow Chelmzhford to augment the dishtansh. I fired mounted--and fired wide.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the smack of lips releasing bottleneck, and a wet breath.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . You could not hit a man at three hundred yards if the gun was resting on Gibraltar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<LeBoeuf>

	The Sharp'sh carbine izh an inshtrument of uncanny power and precizhun.

LeBoeuf shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wide: three riders leave the cabin single-file.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jump in: pushing Mattie, who rides last in line. LeBoeuf is in front of her. Rooster leads, head tipping momentarily back to swig from a bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He then half-hums, half-scats a tune.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie twists to look behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her point-of-view: pulling away from the cabin, against the wall of which the four dead men are now semi-drifted over with snow. Rooster's humming has stopped and we hear his voice:
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was "Johnny in the Low Ground." There are very few fiddle tunes I have not heard. Once heard they are locked in my mind forever. It is a sadness to me that I have sausage fingers that cannot crowd onto a fretboard--little fat girls at a cotillion. "Soldier's Joy"!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
He launches into another song, interrupted by the slosh of liquid as he takes a drink. Mattie looks forward again and LeBoeuf turns to look back at her. He keeps his voice low:
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe he shlept.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
Still without looking back, Rooster projects:
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fort Smith is a healthy distance, LeBoeuf, but I would encourage the creature you ride to try to make it in a day. Out here a one-armed man looks like easy prey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And a one-eyed man--who can't shshoodt? Why don't you tshurn back, Khoghburn?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will do fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
He twists around to gaily hector LeBoeuf:
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . I know where the Parmalee's claim is. I am uninjured, I am provisioned--and we agreed to separate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In conscschiensh you cannot shite our agreement. You are the pershon who shshot me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. LeBoeuf has a point, Marshal. It is an unfair leg-up in any competition to shoot your opposite number.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God damn it! I don't accept it as a given that I did shoot LeBoeuf. There was plenty of guns going off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard a rifle and felt the ball. You mishshed your shshodt, Khoghburn, admit it. You are more handicapped without the eye than I without the arm.

</LeBoeuf>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Missed my shot! I can hit a gnat's eye at ninety yards!

He reins his horse up, hastily tips the bottle to his mouth to make sure it is empty, and then hurls it high.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls out a navy six-gun and fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bottle reaches the height of its arc untouched, and drops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster cocks his head at the landed bottle several paces distant. He shoots again and misses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shoots a third time and the bottle shatters.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>

Rooster starts to dismount, finishing in a semi-controlled fall. He dusts one knee and reaches into his saddlebag. He pulls out a corn dodger and heaves it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He fires. The corn dodger is obliterated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches two corn dodgers from the saddlebag.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>

He hurls them and quickly fires twice. Nothing happens; he quickly fires three times at the falling corn dodgers, missing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scowling, he throws a single corn dodger and is just raising his gun when another gun goes off, making him jump.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LeBoeuf has fired with a gun in his left hand, missing.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will chunk one high. Hold fire.

He tips his head up and tilts the bottle all the way back, confirming that this one too is now empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Riding forward, he leans out of the saddle, stretching low to one side, his hand extended with the bottle. Wavering, he places it upon a large rock as he passes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His arm waves for balance as he straightens but he keeps his place on the horse. He half- turns, propping himself with one hand on his saddle-back, to address Mattie and LeBoeuf:

	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That izh not my worry. You have earned your shpurzh, that izh clear enough--you have been a regular "old hand" on the trail. But Cogburn izh right, even if I would not give him the shatishfaction of consheding it. The trail izh cold, and I am conshiderably diminished.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you give up now, after the many months you've dedicated to finding Chaney? You have shown great determination. I misjudged you. I picked the wrong man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would go on in your company if there were clear way to go. But we would be shtriking out blindly. Chelmshford izh gone--we have chaished him right off the map. There izh nothing for it. I am bound for Texash, and it izh time for you to go home too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
He swings himself up onto the horse.
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . The marshal, when he shoberzh, izh your way back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will not go back. Not without Chaney, dead or alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I misjudged you as well. I eckshtend my hand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
He does, dropping a hand gloved in rough suede. She refuses to take it.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. LeBoeuf! Please!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
He remains with hand extended. She hesitates, sees there is no give, and reaches for up for the hand. They shake.
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Adiosh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
He saws the horse around and sets it to a prancing walk, his spurs jingling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound recedes, leaving behind Rooster's snoring from the campfire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: CAMPFIRE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster's snores bump up at the cut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie enters, gazes down for a thinking beat at the passed-out lawman, then lies down on her robe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lies still, gazing up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a long beat she abruptly rises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She recedes toward the horses. As she reaches them we hear Little Blackie snort and blow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie returns with a length of coiled rope. She plays it out in a loop around her robe. She lies down again. She closes her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fade out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EARY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are high and close on Rooster, asleep. Face mottled red, he looks like hell. He emits a symphony of respiratory noises as breath fights through layers of phlegm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reverse on Mattie, looking down at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wider on the forlorn campsite--Mattie standing, Rooster awkwardly sprawled sleeping, LeBoeuf gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close on a bucket: Mattie's hand enters to grab it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EMBANKMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear rushing water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie descends, carefully stiff-legged, down a steep slope thick with trees and brush.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She emerges onto the bank of a fast-flowing stream, shallow at this point and loud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie takes a couple of steps into the water to dip the bucket. Soft, behind her, we see four horses watering at the opposite bank, just downstream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie stoops to fill the bucket. Turning as she straightens, she sees the four horses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Surprised, she drops the bucket and stares.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The horses huff and blow in the water. They are not wild--they wear tack--but there is no rider in sight, until:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man straightens and emerges from behind one of the horses. The first thing we notice about him is the silhouette of the rifle projecting over one shoulder, slung to the man's back with a piece of sash cord.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at something floating by in the stream: Mattie's bucket. He looks up. We jump closer:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man has a black mark on his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing Mattie, who still gapes at him, he hastily swings his rifle round and trains it on her. He takes cautious, splashing steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well now I know you. Your name is Mattie. You are little Mattie the bookkeeper. Isn't this something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<DIRECTION>
He grins, relaxing. He slings the rifle back over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, and I know you, Tom Chaney.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came to fetch water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie pulls the flour sack from her coat pocket and works carefully at the cord that cinches it shut. Chaney watches.
</DIRECTION>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean what are you doing here in these mountains?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have not been formally deputized but I am acting as an agent for Marshal Reuben Cogburn and Judge Parker's court.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie has the cinch loose. She reaches the Colt's Dragoon out of the sack and points it at Chaney.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . I have come to take you back to Fort Smith.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Chaney looks at the gun. He grins and puts hands on hips.
</DIRECTION>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I will not go. How do you like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is a posse of officers up on the hill who will force you to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is interesting news. How many is up there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right around fifty. They are all well armed and they mean business. What I want you to do now is come on across the creek and walk in front of me up the hill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I will oblige the officers to come after me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you refuse to go I will have to shoot you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh? Then you had better cock your piece.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie gives a dismayed look at the gun and tries to pull the hammer back. It has a heavy pull: she struggles, using two thumbs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chaney watches, smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . All the way back til it locks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know how to do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls the hammer back further and we hear it notch. She looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . You will not go with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think not. It is just the other way around. You are going with me. I will--
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chaney, shocked, takes a staggering step back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie stumbles and falls back under the recoil, into the stream but careful to hold the gun high and dry. She awkwardly reclaims her footing and retrains the gun. Chaney is looking down at his bleeding side.
</DIRECTION>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did not think you would do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One of my short ribs is broken. It hurts jiggers every breath I take.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You killed my father when he was trying to help you. I have one of the gold pieces you took from him. Now give me the other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
She is struck by a worrying thought. She hastily recocks the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I regret that shooting. Mr. Ross was decent to me but he ought not to have meddled in my business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<DIRECTION>
Crashing from the brush up the hill, and a voice:
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mattie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am down here! Chaney is taken into custody!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was drinking and I was mad through and through. Nothing has gone right for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<DIRECTION>
There is yelling from the other bank now too.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you are just a piece of trash, that is all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything is against me. Now I am shot by a child.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<DIRECTION>
He sloshes suddenly forward, water kicking up before him.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
She squeezes the trigger, but the gun dry fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chaney grabs the gun and flings it away, then holds on to Mattie and slaps her.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help me! Down here! Hurry up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Two men burst through the brush from Chaney's side of the river. One is in woolly chaps --Lucky Ned Pepper. The other is taller and dressed almost formally in a linen suit and string tie and a bear coat. Both men bear Winchester repeating rifles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chaney is dragging Mattie to their bank, slapping at her along the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster emerges from his side of the riverbank carrying a side arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men exchange fire.
</DIRECTION>
<Lucky_Ned>
<DIRECTION>
(to Chaney)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take them horses you got and move!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs Mattie from Chaney and keeps her between himself and the far bank as he fires again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One hand to his bleeding side, Chaney lunges for the horses' leads.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster has retreated back to the tree cover, as has the well dressed man on our side. Intermittent gunshots and the panicked neighing of horses. Lucky Ned falls back into the trees with Mattie and starts pulling her up the steep hill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chaney follows pulling the string of horses. He is breathing hard and blood stains the front of his shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<Lucky_Ned>
<DIRECTION>
(to Chaney)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get on up that hill! Don't you stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<DIRECTION>
He twists Mattie around to face him and we see him clearly for the first time. Part of his upper lip and three of his front teeth are missing.
</DIRECTION>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . Who all is down there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marshal Cogburn and fifty more officers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Lucky Ned throws Mattie to the ground. He puts a muddy boot on her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me another lie and I will stove your head in!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie manages to choke out:
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just the marshal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cogburn! Do you hear me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . You answer me, Rooster! I will kill this girl! You know I will do it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<Rooster_s_Voice>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The girl is nothing to me! She is a runaway from Arkansas!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster_s_Voice>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is very well! Do you advise me to kill her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<Rooster_s_Voice>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do what you think is best, Ned! She is nothing to me but a lost child!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster_s_Voice>
<DIRECTION>
A short beat, through which we hear only the rush of riverwater. Then, Rooster's voice again:
</DIRECTION>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . Think it over first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have already thought it over! You get mounted double fast! If I see you riding over that bald ridge to the northwest I will spare the girl. You have five minutes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<DIRECTION>
He breaks open his rifle and starts to reload.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will need more than five minutes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will not give you more time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There will be a party of marshals in here soon, Ned! Let me have Chaney and the girl and I will mislead them for six hours!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too thin, Rooster! Too thin! Your five minutes is running! No more talk!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls Mattie to her feet. Rooster's voice trails away:
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster_s_Voice>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am leaving but you must give me time!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster_s_Voice>
<DIRECTION>
Lucky Ned gives Mattie a rough push.
</DIRECTION>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Up that hill!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie advances, Lucky Ned giving periodic shoves from behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A stout young man with a shotgun leaps out from behind a slab of limestone in front of them. He has a round face and idiot eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He makes loud turkey-gobbling noises at Mattie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Though Mattie is startled Lucky Ned does not immediately react, but he does finally tire of the turkey noises:
</DIRECTION>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quiet there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<DIRECTION>
The idiot makes a pig-squealing sound in acknowledgment and then falls quiet, loping alongside Mattie and Lucky Ned.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will not shoot me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Lucky Ned is grim:
</DIRECTION>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will do what I have to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<DIRECTION>
They are ascending out of the trees onto a bare rock ledge not quite at the crest of the mountain. The rock floor is uneven and broken by fissures and holes. A cave-like setback at the far end of the rock shelf is half-curtained with a hide. A rough camp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cookfire burns on the open rock. Two coffeepots warm leaning against the inside of the fire's piled-stone perimeter. A skillet holds bacon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man squats at the fire, holding a piece of bacon, turned to watch Lucky Ned and Mattie's approach. He wears a filthy Union army uniform with officer's boards. His mouth is an 0 of surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I have some of that bacon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help yourself. Have some of the coffee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not drink coffee. I am fourteen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We do not have buttermilk. And we do not have bread. We are poorly supplied. What are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<DIRECTION>
Tom Chaney has reached the rock ledge and he charges Mattie with a yell.
</DIRECTION>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will wring your scrawny neck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<DIRECTION>
Lucky Ned knocks him aside.
</DIRECTION>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let that go! Farrell, see to his wound. What happened? What are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will tell you what and you will see that I am in the right. Tom Chaney there shot my father to death in Fort Smith and robbed him of two gold pieces and stole his mare. Her name is Judy but I did not see her down at the river. I was informed Rooster Cogburn had grit and I hired him out to find the murderer. A few minutes ago I came upon Chaney watering the horses. He would not be taken in charge and I shot him. If I had killed him I would not be now in this fix. My revolver misfired.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They will do it. It will embarrass you every time. Most girls like to play pretties, but you like guns do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not care a thing in the world about guns. If I did I would have one that worked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was shot from ambush, Ned. The horses was blowing and making noise. It was that officer that got me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you sit there and tell such a big story?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Chaney, squatting with his shirt pulled up for the ex-soldier to work on his wound, now rises.
</DIRECTION>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That pit is a hundred feet deep and I will throw you into it and leave you to scream and rot! How do you like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No you won't. This man will not let you have your way. He is your boss and you must do as he tells you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Chaney turns to Lucky Ned who has a spyglass to his eye, scanning a ridge across the river.
</DIRECTION>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five minutes is well up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<DIRECTION>
Lucky Ned speaks quietly, without lowering the glass:
</DIRECTION>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will give him a little more time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<DIRECTION>
From somewhere in the woods below we hear the idiot's gobbling noises.
</DIRECTION>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much more?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Til I think he has had enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<DIRECTION>
The voice of the well dressed man floats up from the woods:
</DIRECTION>
<Well_Dressed_Man>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is gone, Ned! I can see nothing! We had best make a move!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Well_Dressed_Man>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold fast a while there, Doctor!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie looks at Chaney moaning in pain as the ex-soldier works on his side.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why doesn't the Doctor do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Lucky Ned replies absently, still gazing out:
</DIRECTION>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is not a medical doctor. Was that Rooster waylaid us night before last?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was Marshal Cogburn and myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yourself, eh? You and Cogburn, quite the posse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<DIRECTION>
He sees something and hastily raises the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A horseman is ascending the treeless ridge across the river with a riderless horse--Little Blackie--in tow. At the top he pauses and turns, and draws a revolver from his saddle and points it skyward. We see the gun kick and breathe gunsmoke. A second later we hear the shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lucky Ned lowers the glass and takes a gun and shoots skyward. He raises the glass again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The horseman turns away and proceeds on over the crest. He is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lucky Ned turns to Mattie. He comes and squats at the fire.
</DIRECTION>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your friend is gone. You are alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<DIRECTION>
The well dressed man and the idiot trudge up from the woods onto the rock ledge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man in the dirty uniform continues to perform crude field surgery on Chaney, digging into his side with a knife to extract the bullet. As Chaney moans the idiot makes calf- bawling noises in imitation.
</DIRECTION>
<Well_Dressed_Man>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We must move, Ned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Well_Dressed_Man>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are too nervous, Doctor. It will be hours before he is back with help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<DIRECTION>
Lucky Ned turns back to Mattie.
</DIRECTION>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . What happened to Quincy, and The Kid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They are both dead. I was in the very middle of it. It was a terrible thing to see. Do you need a good lawyer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need a good judge. What about Coke Hayes--the old fellow shot off his horse?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dead as well. His depredations have come to an end.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor Coke. He rode back for me. Coke Hayes had spine, and could keep his wits in a tight spot. Dead now, but he should have been dead ten times afore now. Your friend Rooster does not collect many prisoners.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is not my friend. He has abandoned me to a congress of louts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do not varnish your opinions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<Well_Dressed_Man>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are we staying here for chat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Well_Dressed_Man>
<DIRECTION>
The idiot is still bawling. Chaney grabs a stone and flings it at him and the idiot scampers back, making goat noises. Chaney grabs, moaning, at the wound aggravated by this fresh exertion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man in officer's boards laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<Soldier>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do an owl, Harold!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Soldier>
<Idiot>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hoo! Hoo! Hoo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Idiot>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let us cut up the winnings from the Katie Flyer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<DIRECTION>
Lucky Ned straightens from the fire and begins to collect his meager belongings. The other men follow suit.
</DIRECTION>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There will be time for that at The Old Place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will saddle the grey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have other plans for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must I double-mount with the Doctor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<Well_Dressed_Man>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Well_Dressed_Man>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it will be too chancy with two men up if it comes to a race. You will wait here with the girl. When we reach Ma's house I will send Carroll back with a fresh mount. You will be out by dark and we will wait for you at The Old Place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like that. Let me ride with you, Ned, just out of here anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. We are short a horse. It can't be helped.

<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He will do no such thing. Tom, you know the crossing at Cypress Forks, near the log meetinghouse? When you are mounted you will take the girl there and leave her. Do you understand that, Tom? If any harm comes to this child you do not get paid.

	You have no reason to whine. If you act as the bandit chief instructed, and no harm comes to me, you will get your winnings at The Old Place.

<DIRECTION>
We faintly hear the rest of his party mount up and gallop off. Chaney drops heavily before the fire to sit staring.
</DIRECTION>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They will not wait for me at The Old Place. Lucky Ned has left me, knowing I am sure to be caught when I leave on foot.

<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is sending a mount.

<Chaney>

	That was a story. Keep still now. I must think over my position and how I may improve it.

<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>

</Chaney>
<DIRECTION>
More brooding silence.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you thinking about The Old Place? If you will let me go, I will swear to it in an affidavit and once you are brought to justice it may go easier on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Chaney rises, glaring at her.
</DIRECTION>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tell you I can do better than that. I do not intend to be caught. I need no affidavit.

</Chaney>
<DIRECTION>
He is striding toward her. She backs toward the ledge.
</DIRECTION>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . All I need is your silence. And I will have it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<DIRECTION>
Without breaking stride he plows into her, good hand raised to catch her by the throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tumbles backward, Chaney on top of her sweating and snarling.
</DIRECTION>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . Your father was a busybody like you. There are always people who will tell you what's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<DIRECTION>
On her back Mattie struggles, but Chaney, straddling her, has her pinned. His good hand is still on her throat. She claws at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He swats her with his free hand. Her clawing stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chaney is wincing from the swing of his own arm. As he leans over her his opened wound dribbles blood onto Mattie along with his sweat.
</DIRECTION>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . In honesty, I do not regret shooting him. He thought Tom Chaney was small. Lucky Ned thinks the same. And you would give me an affidavit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches back awkwardly toward his calf with his bad hand, groaning with the stretch. We hear the schlick of steel and his hand reappears holding a knife taken from a leg sheath.
</DIRECTION>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . You are all against me. Everything is against me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes against the underside of Mattie's chin, stretching her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes roll down in their sockets to watch as Chaney regrips the knife and lowers it to her throat, his knuckles whitening with tension.
</DIRECTION>
<Chaney>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . But here at least I have matters in hand, and once I have done for you--
	</DIALOGUE>
</Chaney>
<DIRECTION>
Whack--a rifle stock swings into frame, connecting with Chaney's head. His head snaps to one side and then lolls back as he slowly straightens, ropey drool and blood pouring from his mouth. He sways briefly and then collapses onto Mattie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hand enters to pull him off. Mattie blearily props herself on her elbows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LeBoeuf is panting and sweating from his climb. He gazes down at Chaney. Once he has breath:
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sho that ish Chelmthford. Shtrange to be sho closhe at lasht.

</LeBoeuf>
<Mattie>

<DIRECTION>
LeBoeuf's look breaks from Chaney. He pulls his pipe from his pocket and lights it.
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard the shotsh and went down to the river. . .
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses the rock ledge.
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>

<DIRECTION>
(reacts to hole)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that izh a pit there! Mind your footing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
He skirts the large hole and reaches the shelf's far lip and gazes out. Before him is a steep drop-off. We see the very crowns of near pines and then, four hundred yards away, the land flattening to an open meadow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie, also gazing out, comes up beside LeBoeuf.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A plan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
LeBoeuf points with his pipe.
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He returnzh for Lucky Ned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
Lucky Ned, the Parmalees, and the Doctor are just entering the low meadow, riding away. As they do so Rooster enters at the far side, facing. He draws one of his navy sixes as he
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
advances.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One against four. It is ill advised.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Leboeuf shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He would not be dishuaded.

He and Mattie both watch as, below, the parties advance on each other at a walk. Eighty yards separating them, they halt.

Rooster and Lucky Ned eye each other. After a beat:
</DIRECTION>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Rooster, will you give us the road?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<Idiot>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Hello, Ned. How many men are with the girl?

<Lucky_Ned>

	Just Chaney. Our agreement is in force: she was in excellent health when last I saw her.

Rooster nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Farrel, I want you and your brother to stand clear. You as well, Doctor. I have no interest in you today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is your intention, Rooster? Do you think one on four is a dogfall?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Lucky_Ned>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean to kill you in one minute, Ned. Or see you hanged in Fort Smith at Judge Parker's convenience. Which will you have?

He puts the reins in his teeth, grabs his other revolver with the hand now free, and spurs his horse.

Mattie watches him charge.

<DIRECTION>
Over the distant laughter of the idiot, the crackle of gunfire commences.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: THE MEADOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster turns his head to either side as he fires, bringing his good eye into play.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The idiot is gaily waving a revolver over his head, not firing, squawking like a chicken as he charges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shot from Rooster kills him and swipes him neatly off his horse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Farrel Parmalee has a shotgun. It roars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shot peppers Rooster. He returns fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Farrel Parmalee's horse is hit. It stumbles, and Farrel is dashed forward, snapping his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Doctor Indian-rides past, sliding down and hooking an ankle on his saddle so that he may ride in the cover of his horse's body. He makes for the treeline on the far side of the meadow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster and Lucky Ned are charging each other, both firing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pass each other--both still mounted--but Rooster's horse has been hit and it falls, pinning Rooster's leg. His guns are gone, lost in the fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster, bleeding from sprayed shot in neck, face, and shoulder, struggles and unpins his leg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: ROCK LEDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LeBoeuf sits cross-legged and brings the butt of his Sharp's carbine to rest against his injured shoulder. He nudges the gunstock back and forth, looking for the anchor that will cause him the least pain. He cocks his head to sight, puffing pipesmoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: MEADOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lucky Ned is reining his horse around with his left hand. His right arm dangles. He walks his horse toward Rooster, who is getting to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<Lucky_Ned>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well Rooster, I am shot to pieces. It seems neither of us is to see Judge Parker.

He drops the reins to reach out a gun with his one working arm.

:SC: THE MEADOW

<DIRECTION>
Rooster is facing Lucky Ned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lucky Ned raises his gun at Rooster and--is shot in the chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we hear the weakly distant guncrack Ned flops backward, slides halfway down one side of the saddle, and dangles, briefly, foot tangled in a stirrup, horse standing unperturbed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, he drops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: ROCK LEDGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie whoops as LeBoeuf groans.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some bully shot! Four hundred yards, at least!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
LeBoeuf sets the rifle down and gropes at his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<LeBoeuf>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am afraid I have--
	</DIALOGUE>
</LeBoeuf>
<DIRECTION>
A rock is brought down on his head by Tom Chaney.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LeBoeuf has collapsed and is motionless. Chaney drops the rock and stoops for the rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie is already dragging it away. She grabs it up.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stand up, Tom Chaney!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Chaney stands nearly straight--as much as his injuries will allow, and--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Boom!--the blast catches Chaney in the chest and he is blown back off the ledge, looking surprised. He falls to oblivion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the carbine recoil pushes Mattie stumbling back and this, with the bad footing at the lip of the pit behind her, sends her falling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: PIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie is tumbling. She bounces down a very steep slope, disturbed earth tumbling with her, protruding roots and slender upgrowing foliage slapping at her on her descent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she descends more or less feet-first something snags an ankle and her inertia sends her upper body on down past the pinned leg. She jerks to a halt head-downmost on the steep slope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The patter of falling dirt subsides. Silence. Heavy breathing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie, lying face-up, does a painful half sit-up to look around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above her, her left foot is snarled through some roots. Well beyond, very high, weak light defines the mouth of the pit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Using her elbows she pivots, scooting her upper body uphill so that she is no longer below her foot. She reaches the cuff of her pants on the trapped leg and pulls it up to expose the shin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A splinter of broken bone has punctured the skin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls the cuff back down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stretches to slip fingers between her boot and the roots in which it is fouled. She just manages to work in two fingers; in wrenching around, the root has cinched tight. She tugs feebly at the root, which shows no signs of give.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks back up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The small hole of weak daylight, dust drifting up toward it.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. LeBoeuf! Are you alive!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
No answer.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . Mr. LeBoeuf!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Arms tiring, she lays back again against earth. She looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Partway round the pit, just at her level, something difficult to discern in the semi-dark: two mirroring shapes, close to each other: is it the soles of a pair of boots?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie squints. She props herself partway up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Higher view: they are boots--worn by a corpse--stretching away from us, foreshortened. The man's skull has been partly shattered by the protruding rock against which it rests.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie surveys the body. Her attention is caught by something:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The skeletal remains are still clothed and there seems to be something held by a bandolier strapped across the chest, over the body's decomposing blue shirt but beneath a tattered vest. A sheath is just visible high on the strap, near the corpse's shoulder. The butt-end of a knife juts out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie stretches, reaching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She can just get to a boot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man's remains seem to be fairly light. They drag across earth, raising dust, tending to slide away with the grade of the pit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie reels the body in, careful not to let go and lose it down the hill. She pulls shoe, pants cuff, pants knee, belt. The bandolier is close.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her fingers curl around shirt, and pull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shirt's buttons softly pop and fiber dust drifts up as the fabric falls to pieces. Rib cage is exposed beneath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie hastily reaches and curls fingers around ribs. She pulls. She is about to get the knife when--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A glistening something inside the rib cage--guts?--starts to slowly move. But it can't be guts: it is gliding, coiling, under its own power.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A faint rattle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie screams as the ball of waking snakes quickens. One snake starts to slowly emerge, and she bats the body away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pushes and kicks with her free leg, as much as her pinned attitude will allow. The body, coming to pieces, slides dustily down into the dark. It disappears. Fiber and bone dust float up toward us. We hear rattles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie hastily reaches for the root that pins her and in a panic pulls, looking back toward the body. The root holds fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A snake is sluggishly and sinuously weaving up the earth toward her. She muscles her body upward so that once again her pinned leg is bottom-most.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. LeBoeuf!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Another snake is behind the first. . . several more behind that.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the snakes advance to the level of her pinned leg Mattie freezes. The first snake continues climbing, weaving up the slope alongside Mattie's body. She watches it come on, its blunted head with its flicking tongue inches from her face. The head passes, the body goes coiling by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another snake undulates onto her pinned leg.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster_s_Voice>
	<DIALOGUE>

Careful to keep still, eyes on the advancing snakes:

More snakes climb onto her.

<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>

</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
A large snake is winding onto her shoulder. She gingerly places a hand for it to coil onto; it does; she holds it at arms length and gently shakes it off.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>

Rooster appears in the mouth of the pit. He has a rope wrapped round his waist and he starts to descend, half walking, half hopping against the pit wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie winces and looks down at one hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small snake wrapped round her wrist has its fangs in the meat of the hand.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahh!

She flaps her hand and the snake plops off.

<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
BAM!--a burst of orange as Rooster, descended to the level of the lead snakes, starts firing his revolver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAM! BAM! More orange lightning flashes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lively rattling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pit fills with roiling gunsmoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster starts to stomp as well as fire. He kicks the more sluggish specimens toward the bottom of the pit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches Mattie and takes out a knife.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does Mr. LeBoeuf survive?

<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He does--even a blow to the head could silence him for only a few short minutes. Where are you bit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
She shows her hand and he makes two slices in the flesh and squeezes out blood. As he does so:
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . He is in mild distress, having swallowed a good piece of his pipestem. Can you move?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My foot is pinned and leg broken.
	</DIALOGUE>

Rooster stoops with the knife and one slice frees the booted foot. He wraps one arm around Mattie's waist and tips his head back and bellows:
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have her! Up with us!

The rope tautens and starts pulling, Rooster helping with his feet.

Little Blackie, led by a wobbly LeBoeuf, finishes pulling Rooster and Mattie from the pit.

The horse takes to the steep slope reluctantly, with stiff legs, Rooster kicking it on. Tree

branches slap at him and take his hat. His face, already peppered with shot, gets new scratches.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie is flushed and soaked with sweat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The horse is laboring for breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster gives inarticulate curses as he kicks it on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie looks ahead:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barely visible in the moonlight a man mounted bareback rides on ahead. A sash cord holds a rifle to his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He recedes, outpacing us, disappearing into the darkness and the falling snow.
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is getting away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is getting away?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chaney.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on, sis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie is falling. It is unclear why.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her legs squeeze the horses flanks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her hand tightens on the horses mane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster's arm reaches around to hold her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Little Blackie is giving out, going to his knees and then all the way down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster hangs on to Mattie as the horse sinks. He pulls her clear, lays her on the ground, and then steps away from her, taking out a gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The horrible noises coming from the horse end with a gunshot. Rooster reenters to pick up Mattie but she screams at him and claws at his face, opening fresh gashes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He ducks his head as best he can to avoid the claws but that is the extent of his reaction.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put your arms around my neck, I will carry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
He presents his back and she relents, clasping her arms. He rises with a pained wheeze and he starts jogging with Mattie piggie-back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bouncing at his shoulder, she twists to look back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the dark, the darker shape of the dead horse, growing smaller.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie turns forward again, eyes drooping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster is loudly wheezing as he carries Mattie before him now, his jog slowed to an unsteady walk. Her eyes are opening again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are now on a proper dirt road. Rooster staggers around a turn and does a barely controlled stumble to his knees, and then sits heavily back, Mattie in his lap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead is the front porch of Bagby's store, the building dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster sits gasping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie's voice is thick:
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
Rooster takes out his gun, weakly raises his arm, and fires into the air. He sits panting.
</DIRECTION>
<Rooster>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have grown old.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Rooster>
<DIRECTION>
The door of the distant store opens and someone emerges, holding a lamp, peering out into the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: TRAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are looking into the window of a moving train. Looking out past us is a thin forty-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
year-old woman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reflected in the window is a sizable railyard and then, as the train slows, a station. Reading backward in the mirror of the window is the station stop: MEMPHIS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the voice, familiar from the opening of the movie, of the grown Mattie Ross:
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	A quarter of a century is a long time.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: TRAIN DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the train eases to a stop the woman, Mattie, steps down. One sleeve of her dress is pinned up.
</DIRECTION>
<Voice_Over>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had written a letter of thanks to Marshal Cogburn, with an invitation to visit, along with the fifty dollars I owed him. In his reply he promised he would try to call next time he came to Fort Smith with prisoners. Brief though his note was, it was rife with misspellings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Voice_Over>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie goes along the platform, holding a small bag in one hand and, crushed against its handle, a flier.
</DIRECTION>
<Voice_Over>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . The marshal did not visit, nor did he communicate further. I had not been conscious during his leavetaking: by the time Bagby rode us to Fort Smith my hand had turned black. I was not awake when I lost the arm. I later learned that Mr. LeBoeuf recovered fully. When the marshals found him he was searching the pines below the rock ledge for Tom Chaney's body. He found it and took it back to San Saba for the reward. It was well earned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Voice_Over>
<DIRECTION>
In the scene, Mattie calls peremptorily to a young boy on the platform:
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
She shows him the flier:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cole Younger and Frank James Wild West Show. Riding! Shooting! Lariat "Tricks" ! Don't Leave the Ladies and the Little Ones Behind! Also Featuring Rooster Cogburn! He will amaze you with his skill and dash! Memphis Fairgrounds, July 18, 1908.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy looks up and points.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie crosses the platform and further along, descends to the railyard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cars of the Wild West Show are parked along a siding. They display gaudily painted scenes of men on rearing horses firing six-guns, of conestoga wagons, war-bonneted Indians, bandana-wearing bad men. Three featured performers have their own vignetted scenes, each depicted as a youngish man engaged in Wild West hell-raising, each with his name painted beneath: Cole Younger, Frank James, and (unrecognizable but for the eyepatch) Rooster Cogburn. Below Rooster's name is the sublegend "He rode with Quantrill! He rode for Parker!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Around the rail cars cowboys--and some Indians--mill, more wobegone than their painted representations.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie asks someone along the way for directions and is pointed toward the rear of the train.
</DIRECTION>
<Voice_Over>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Little Frank had sent me the flier. He had chaffed me through the years over the fact that I had not married, calling the marshal my "secret sweetheart," and he sent a note with the advertisement: "Skill and dash--it's not too late, Mattie!" Little Frank and Victoria have always liked jokes and they are all right in their place. I have never held it against either one of them for leaving me at home to look after Mama, and they know it, for I have told them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Voice_Over>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie speaks to two men who sit on the rear platform of the rear car. They are old men drinking Coca-Colas. One doffs his hat and rises when Mattie addresses the pair; the other stays seated, slurping from his bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<Standing_Man>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes'm, I am Cole Younger. This is Mr. James. It grieves me to tell you that you have missed Rooster. He passed away, what, three days ago, when the show was in Jonesboro Arkansas. Buried him there in the confederate cemetery. Reuben had a complaint what he referred to as "night hoss" and I believe the warm weather was too much for him. We had some lively times. What was the nature of your acquaintance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Standing_Man>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew the marshal long ago. We too had lively times. Thank you, Mr. Younger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Mattie>
<DIRECTION>
As she turns to go she addresses Frank James, who has been staring at her:
</DIRECTION>
<Mattie>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . Keep your seat, trash.

Elsewhere; later.

Men load in a muddy pine coffin. Chalked on the coffin top:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cogburn, Yell County, Hold at station.
</DIRECTION>
<Voice_Over>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had the marshal's body removed to Dardanelle. The railroads do not like to carry disinterred bodies in the summertime, but I had my way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Voice_Over>
<DIRECTION>
The boxcar door is slammed and the train starts to move off.
</DIRECTION>
<Voice_Over>

	. . . People love to talk. They love to slander you if you have any substance. They said, Well, she hardly knew that man. . .

:SC: CEMETERY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mattie stands with a prayer book. There is a light, lazy fall of snow.
</DIRECTION>
<Voice_Over>
	<DIALOGUE>
	. . . It's just like a cranky old maid to pull a stunt like that, burying him in the family plot. They say I love nothing but money and the Presbyterian Church and that is why I never married. It is true that I love my church and my bank. I will tell you a secret. Those same people talk mighty nice when they come in for a crop loan or a mortgage extension. I care nothing for what they say. I would have married a baboon if I had wanted and fetched it its newspaper and slippers every morning but I never had time to fool with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Voice_Over>
<DIRECTION>
She leaves, striding purposefully past the headstone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We show the headstone and, beyond, her receding figure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reuben Cogburn, 1835-1908. A Resolute Officer Of Parker's Court.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her figure softens as it recedes.
</DIRECTION>
<Voice_Over>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, a woman with brains and a frank tongue and one sleeve pinned up and an invalid mother to care for is not widely sought after. I never did see Mr. LeBoeuf again but if he is yet alive I would be pleased to hear from him. I judge he would be in his seventies now and nearer eighty than seventy. I expect some of the starch has gone out of that cowlick. Time just gets away from us.
