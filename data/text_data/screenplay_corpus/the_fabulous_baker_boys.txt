INT. APARTMENT - DUSK

<DIRECTION>
JACK BAKER is standing before a dirty window, looking out at a dirty city street. He is wearing a tuxedo.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks at the GIRL in the bed, then at the rest of the apartment. Not good.

Jack's brother, FRANK, is standing in front of the mirror, stuffing the collar of his tux with towels while LOUIS, an old black attendant, looks on. Jack enters.

<JACK>

</JACK>
<FRANK>

<FRANK>

Jack picks up a tiny spray can on the sink, reads it.

<JACK>

	"Be the envy of all your friends with Crowning Glory's Miracle Hair"...?

<DIRECTION>
(looking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gotta be kidding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack studies the bald spot on the crown of his brother's head, then shakes the can. A MIXING BALL is heard.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is paint, Frank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not paint.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pointing to the can)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a "magical sheath which simulates a dazzling head of hair."
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank, this is paint.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just help me put it on, okay? You're supposed to spray in a circular motion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
As Frank positions himself, Jack exchanges a glance with Louis. Shrugging, Jack gives the can a shake, steps back, and fires away.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack just stares. There is a dark spot on the back of Frank's head about the size of a scooter pie.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Louis?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Louis looks up. His face could conceal a royal flush.
</DIRECTION>
<LOUIS>

APPLAUSE is heard as we...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
featuring two 8x10 glossies of Frank and Jack (more hair) and in bold letters: "TONIGHT! THE FABULOUS BAKER BOYS!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We HOLD on the stand-up, then RISE above it to reveal a candlelit lounge, where Jack and Frank sit behind matching grand pianos, a poor man's version of Ferrante and Teicher.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(Mr. Smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, thank you. Good evening and welcome to the Starfire Lounge. My name is Frank Baker and eighty-eight keys across from me is my little brother Jack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
The audience -- consisting of middle-aged out-of-towners swilling enormous banana daiquiris -- APPLAUDS.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know. How long has it been, Jack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(lighting cigarette)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thirty-one years, Frank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lotta water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, back then, things were a little different. I was eleven, Jack was seven. and about the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil. We must've shaved three lives off that cat, eh, Jack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
The audience, having the benefit of the daiquiris, LAUGHS. Jack smiles like he's got a mouth full of razor blades.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But seriously. It's been fifteen years since Jack and I first stepped onto the stage as professionals. But even though we've played some of the finest venues in the world... there's one place that's always been, for us, a very special place, and that place is... this place, the Starfire Lounge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack lays in a few soft bass chords.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? Well, I guess you could say it's the...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pregnant moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...people.

At which point, Frank's hands descend onto the keyboard and give birth to the melody of -- what else? -- "People."

INT. STARFIRE KITCHEN - LATER

Jack and Frank pass through the steamy hotel kitchen.

A young GIRL in an apron smiles at Jack.

INT. LLOYD'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank stands across the desk from the hotel's very young, very condescending assistant manager (LLOYD) as he prepares a cash envelope. Jack stays in the doorway, smoking.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terrific, boys. Really. Terrific. Yes, sir... You're just what we needed on a night like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh... thanks, Lloyd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank glances at Jack and realises he should have left him in the kitchen with Jenny and the soup bone.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only Jack, do me a favour, will ya, pal. If you wanna smoke onstage, put on a pair of sunglasses and go play with the niggers on State Street.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
Smoke curls out of Jack's nose. He is utterly still, like a pit bull eyeing a steak.
</DIRECTION>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, boys, that ought to buy you a few more lessons. By the way, Frankie, I'm declaring this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
Lloyd slaps a slender envelope onto the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll call you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<LLOYD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll call you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LLOYD>
<DIRECTION>
Frank bites down and takes the envelope from the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Count it.

</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?

</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>

</JACK>
<FRANK>

	Jack...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Count the fucking money, Frank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Lloyd looks up. Jack is staring right into him. Reluctantly, Frank opens the envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pulling Jack out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be talking to you, Lloyd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Lloyd doesn't answer. He just looks at Jack, smiling with amusement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack comes out onto the street with the wrapped up soup bone. Frank follows with the stand-up.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very nice, Jack. Very nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck him.

</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck him. Great, terrific. Fuck him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
As Frank reaches his car, he opens the trunk for the stand-up, then counts out Jack's share of the night's money.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So we on tomorrow night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe Thursday. I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank slams the trunk closed.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
As Frank turns, Jack tosses him the Miracle Hair can.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't forget your hair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Small, old, sparsely furnished. A piano by the window, an old phonograph, a bookcase full of records. Few photographs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Jack enters, EDDIE, an old black Labrador, walks over and yawns.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try to control your excitement, will ya, Ed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie nuzzles the soup bone.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's see your mouth.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(taking a look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. But go easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
As Eddie retreats with the bone, Jack breaks the collar of his shirt and pauses by the piano. He considers the keys but, instead, flips on the PHONOGRAPH. As Bill Evans' smoky piano solo "Turn Out the Stars" spills quietly into the room, Jack takes off his tie... then stops. He glances to the kitchen: dishes drip-drying in a rack. He touches an ashtray: clean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taking two silent steps backward, Jack peers into the bedroom. Inside, curled up on the bed, is a little girl (NINA). Jack studies her a moment, then, taking the bottle of whiskey from his coat, sits at the piano by the window, staring into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JACK'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING (EARLY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun begins to peek through the buildings of Jack's neighborhood. Suddenly, ringing out over the rooftops is "JINGLE BELLS" -- not the entire song, just the first few bars, over and over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack, on the couch covered with a blanket, his arm draped over the slumbering Eddie, opens his eyes, Across the room, seated at the piano, is Nina, the little girl. She stops playing and turns.
</DIRECTION>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you want some coffee? I made some coffee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks into the sleepy face of Eddie and sits up. He nods to the coffee. Nina goes to the kitchen,
</DIRECTION>
<NINA>
<DIRECTION>
(the piano)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I practiced last night. I think I'm ready for "oh, what fun it is to ride."
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<DIRECTION>
Jack nods. Suddenly the SOUND of heavy footsteps is heard. Jack and Nina glance up at the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds big. What's he do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Ma said it's like a lawyer, only the hours are more regular. All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to the donut king?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Married.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<DIRECTION>
Upstairs, a door slams and heavy feet ECHO in the stairwell. Nina peers out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No breakfast. Maybe they had a fight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<DIRECTION>
Two deep thumps SOUND on the ceiling, a signal.
</DIRECTION>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotta go. Teach me later?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<DIRECTION>
Jack nods. As Nina exits, Jack turns to the couch and gives Eddie a nudge.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.

</JACK>

Decked out in Hawaiian shirts, Jack and Frank bang out "The Girl From Ipanema," while the audience -- three sorry-looking businessmen -- stares glumly at the grass-skirted waitresses yawning by the bar.

	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Vacation? Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself... I've got the pianos for two nights...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't half full out there tonight, Frankie. I got six waiters standing in back listening to baseball. I gotta move the liquor. To move the liquor, I gotta fill the tables. It's a matter of economics. Me, I love you guys, you know that. You're class. But people today. They don't know class if it walks up and grabs 'em by the balls.

INT. CAPRI HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT (MINUTES LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Jack waits, he notices an elegantly dressed woman watching him. She smiles. As Jack considers her, Frank appears, carrying the stand-up.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Charlie's aim getting any better?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank keeps walking. Jack notices the stand-up.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's with the board?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're dark tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dark?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. Charlie stayed true. I'll give you your share this weekend. At the house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
As Frank moves quickly out of the door, the CAMERA PUSHES IN SLOWLY on Jack's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET/FRANK'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A taxi dumps Jack out onto the street of shabby tract houses. In his rumpled city suit, Jack looks like a cheap gangster amid the weedy lawns and overgrown junipers. He stuffs the gift he's carrying into his coat and walks up to the small white house, presses the bell. No response.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The back yard is small, with a short chain link fence surrounding it. Two kids -- a girl (CINDY) and a boy -- wearing party hats and buoyance devices, are splashing around in a build-it-yourself above-ground pool. When they see Jack coming, they hunker down like crocodiles, only their heads visible.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, kids. Dad home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
The two heads say nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What d'ya say? Wanna run and get him for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Still nothing. Jack frowns, takes out a cigarette, pats his pocket for matches. No matches.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
The kids' eyes widen at this profanity. Jack ponders things a moment, then steps over the fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At which point, the tiniest head begins to SCREAM.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, kid. Take it easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
No use. The kid's a world-class screamer. Suddenly Frank comes racing out of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cindy! What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(seeing Jack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your doorbell doesn't work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, it's only Uncle Jack. You remember Uncle Jack.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's probably just the excitement of seeing you again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
As Jack nods slowly, we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRANK'S DINING ROOM - EARLY EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A battered birthday cake, which reads "Happy Birthday Cindy", sits amid crumpled party hats and shreds of gift wrap. Jack stands alone, looking out the window into the back yard. Turning, he glances at the cake, then exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRANK'S HALLWAY - EARLY EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the end of the hallway, shadows cling to the ceiling outside the kitchen and VOICES can be heard -- the sound of family. As Jack moves towards the light, a half-open door catches his eye. Stopping, he pushes the door open, flips on a lamp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BAKER BOYS' ROOM - EARLY EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elvis has Graceland. The Fabulous Baker Boys have this little room in a tract house in the suburbs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Memorabilia is everywhere: music ribbons, newspaper clippings, photographs of Jack and Frank at every age, always dressed alike, smiling identical smiles. The first stand-up is there, carefully mounted and framed. Sheet music, dusty and dog-eared, is everywhere, piled in drunken stacks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But most noticeable are the pianos: two tiny uprights, perfectly matched, their simulated ivory keys yellowed with age.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack enters and surveys all around him. There is a shelf crowded with shot glasses from a hundred hotels, and, next to that, a stack of souvenir coasters from another hundred. Seeing a tiny monkey with "Hula Girl Hideaway" printed on it's belly (lighter), Jack gives one of the little plastic arms a flick and -- snap -- the little tiki torch in the other hand flames up. Jack lights the unlit cigarette in his mouth, replaces the monkey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, Jack's eyes come back to the pianos. He taps a key on the one nearest him and a curious expression falls over his face. He moves to the other piano, taps a key. They're in tune.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Turning, Jack sees that little Cindy is standing behind him, holding a pocket radio. She looks at it, then takes a step forward and holds her arms up to him. Jack looks wary. She shakes her arms impatiently and he bends down. Putting her hands on his neck, she gives him a kiss, then runs out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like you've found yourself a girlfriend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks up, sees Franks' wife, DONNA.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The young ones always break your heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Donna nods, gestures to the pianos.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which one was yours? I can never remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<DIRECTION>
Jack taps the one nearest to him and Donna nods again, then studies a photo on the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Funny... I don't ever seem to come in here... you guys were really something, weren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, Frank always made sure we dressed sharp. Said that was half of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Donna nods. She and Jack obviously don't talk much.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, how's that dog of yours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Losing his teeth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Donna nods slowly, then does a little shiver.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee, it's cold on here, isn't it? Think I need a sweater.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<DIRECTION>
Donna starts to exit, then stops by the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for coming, Jack. The radio, that was nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONNA>
<DIRECTION>
As Donna exits, Jack notices a stack of glossies on a table. As he touches them they fan into a dozen images of himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. FRANK'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Frank drives Jack back to his apartment, Jack taps an unlit cigarette on the dash.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(a shiver)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, it's gonna be mean this year, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack taps the cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened the other night, Frank? With Charlie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank says nothing, just driving.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He paid us off, didn't he? Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He made a deal. There's no shame in it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack stares at Frank, then looks back out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We gotta talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I been thinking maybe we should make some changes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pauses)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I been thinking maybe we should take on a singer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Jack taps the cigarette again.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just an idea. I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't say exactly halfway, would you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We agreed if I took care of the business I'd be entitled to a little extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what we agreed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you're unhappy with the arrange...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not unhappy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank. Fuck it. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much? For the singer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought maybe twenty percent. I figure with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead. The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. We have to stay competitive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack laughs coldly.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack says nothing, just tapping the cigarette again.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks out the window, at the night flickering by.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It never was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WILLIE'S REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A YOUNG WOMAN in a pink sweater and short black skirt stands in a tiny room in the back of Willie's showroom, holding some sheet music. Sammy Davis Jr.s face is on the sheet music. Frank is sitting with a notepad on his lap. Jack is at the piano.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, miss...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<YOUNG_WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(MONICA)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Moran. Monica Moran.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_WOMAN>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, Miss Moran...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, that's my stage name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Moran. Monica. The whole thing. It's my stage name. My real name's Blanche.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blanche...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No romance, right? That's why I came up with Monica. It's what I prefer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But if you call my house and my mother answers, ask for Blanche. If you ask for Monica, she'll think you have the wrong number and hang up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if she asks what it's about, don't tell her. She's opposed to my career.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh huh. Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Candy Man."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(worried)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's one of Jack's favourites.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Monica turns, and, seeing Jack at the piano, gives a little start.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oops. I almost forgot you were there. Here's the instructions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
Monica begins to hand Jack the sheet music.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh... he knows it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Isn't that a coincidence?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Small world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Monica smiles. She likes Jack.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, shall we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Probably not, but Jack begins to play anyway. Swinging her arms and tapping her foot, Monica gets a feel for the rhythm, then launches in -- between beats -- so that Jack has to scramble over a chord to rescue her.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Who can take a sunrise Sprinkle it with dew Toss it in the air and make a groovy lemon pie The Candy Man can The Candy Man can..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
There would appear to be ample evidence as to why the mother of Monica nee Blanch opposes her daughter's career.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Miss Moran, that's enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Monica -- eyes closed, arms flung wide -- is fully caught up in the moment. Frank looks at Jack. Jack shrugs and continues to play.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miss Moran... Miss Moran... BLANCH!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Monica's eyes pop open, her mouth shut.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, sorry. I get so caught up in it sometimes. It's scary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Bye. Boy, you're good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drive carefully.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
As Monica exits, Jack and Frank glance at one another apprehensively and a --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MONTAGE BEGINS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in which a parade of singers come forth to offer their own unique interpretations of:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A) "Feelings,"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
B) "I Gotta Be Me," (sung by twins)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
C) "This Is My Song," and perhaps most appropriately,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
D) "What Kind Of Fool Am I?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When it's all over, Jack and Frank -- ties limp, collars broken -- look like they've been mugged.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This must be statistically impossible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WILLIE'S SHOWROOM - DAY

<DIRECTION>
A YOUNG WOMAN appears in the doorway, heavily BACKLIT. A silhouette in high heels. Willie, eating a corn beef on rye, looks up.

INT. WILLIE'S REHEARSAL ROOM - DAY (SAME TIME)

Frank is counting names on his note pad.

<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thirty-seven. Thirty-seven girls and not one who can carry a tune.

<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brand new Thursday. Believe it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
After today, Jack and Frank are prepared to believe anything.

	This where the auditions are?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Miss. We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.

</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
(touching her lip)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just like that, huh? I come all the way down here, break a heel, and you're not going to give me a chance because I have gum on my lip and I'm a few minutes late?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're an hour and a half late. Do you want me to say it again?

</FRANK>
<SUSIE>

	It's not exactly bewitching me.

	Besides, you're not going anywhere.

</SUSIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I beg your pardon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Intuition, I've had a hunch about this all day. Only I gotta say, in my mind it was a little more glamorous. And anyway, if I'm so late how come you're still here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We ran long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh huh. So where's the winner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Frank looks a little thrown. Susie nods knowingly and makes a little clicking noise as she taps her head.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See? What I tell you? Intuition.

</SUSIE>
<FRANK>

Jack studies the girl, shrugs.

	Terrific. Thirty-eight.

</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that? Thirty-eight? You guys have some kind of code or something?

Jack gestures as if to say, "it's nothing".

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I'm sensing a lot of hostility from you.

Frank ignores this and sits down with the notepad.

<FRANK>

	Susie. Susie Diamond.

Jack and Frank exchange a glance.

<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any RATIONAL reason you think you can sing professionally, Miss Diamond?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I figure if you want to see if you can swim, throw yourself in the water. What's the worst that can happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about drown?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>

Jack nods and begins to play.

Frank slumps in his chair, ready to be tortured again.

<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>

Susie walks out barefoot. Jack's eyes have Frank pinned.

	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think she's got half a voice. That makes her a goddamn diva in this choir. We put one of those other girls onstage, we're gonna get arrested.

	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Low soprano? That girl could make bats cry. Besides, she was sixteen. What're we gonna do, help her with her algebra between sets?

Frank stares glumly at the notepad.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>

</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Susie Diamond. She's probably listed right next to Monica Moran.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of a MATCH STRIKING is heard. There, lighting a cigarette in the doorway, is Susie. She exhales.

The new trio poises for their first rehearsal.

	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack nods.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Susie, sitting on a stool smoking, nods without looking up from her lyric sheet. Frank pauses, then...
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack squints strangely at Frank. Frank turns to Susie.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Frank glares at her.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	READY.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Frank begins to play the opening passage of "Can't Take My Eyes Off of You". Jack joins in, then Susie. Unfortunately, Jack and Frank, accustomed to playing alone, are a tad overwhelming.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fellas, fellas...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack and Frank stop.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this... music. You know what I'm saying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack and Frank look at one another.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean back there it may be hard to notice, but up here I'm having trouble getting a word in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>

Jack and Frank just stare.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<FRANK>

<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - JACK'S APARTMENT - EARLY EVENING (SAME TIME)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tuxedo, freshly pressed, hangs in the shower as Eddie watches Jack soap his face with a shaving brush, then picks up a razor. As NINA CLINKS badly on the final note of "in a one horse open sleigh", Jack almost slices open his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sharp! F Sharp!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(eyeing his throat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

As Nina appears in the doorway, she sees the blood welling on Jack's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're bleeding, Jack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<DIRECTION>
As Jack gives her a "no kidding" look.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hand me a towel, Chopin
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Nina starts to gather up towels, cleaning up, and hands one to Jack. She notes the shaving brush.
</DIRECTION>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shave like a old movie, Jack.
	</DIALOGUE>

</JACK>
<NINA>

<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>

</NINA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He had a toothbrush. And toothpaste.

</NINA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>

Nina exits with an armful of laundry.

As Frank paces, Jack smokes calmly.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She'll get here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just like the day of the auditions, right? Jesus. How's my hair?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Awe inspiring.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, yours isn't. Let me run a comb through it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out of here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not gonna hurt you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll hit you, Frank. I swear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank hesitates, like a basketball player trying to feint an opponent, then takes a flick at Jack's hair. Jack cuffs him on the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hit me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you I was gonna hit you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
He looks capable of hitting him again, too.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, I'm a little wound up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a fucking alarm clock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just wish she'd get here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Susie, wearing a flamboyant dress, is standing across the lobby, staring at the stand-up.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ, look at her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(walking over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening, Miss Diamond. You're late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Susie is still looking at the stand-up, which is unchanged except for a small notation at the bottom: "WITH GUEST VOCALIST."
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guest vocalist? Who's next week? Beverly Sills? And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll talk about it later. Where's your dress?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's he talking about?

</FRANK>
<SUSIE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	He doesn't like the dress, right?

Before Jack can reply, Frank grabs Susie's arm.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>

<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. We don't have much time.

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DRESS DEPARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the trio dashes into Ladies Wear, Frank begins to flip frantically through the dress racks.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you wear? An eight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
(offended)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A six.

<FRANK>

</SUSIE>
<FRANK>

Jack has drifted to lingerie.

<JACK>

	Maybe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, how's this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank holds out an inky black dress. Susie sizes it up.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Close enough. Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank begins to drag Susie into the dressing room.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, pal. I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, but make it quick.

<DIRECTION>
(remembering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shoes! What size do you wear?

</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
(from the dressing room)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nine.

<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about these?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank grabs the shoe out of Jack's handand gestures to a SALESMAN who looks like Jimmy Breslin.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Do these come in black?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SALESMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be with you in a minute,sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALESMAN>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have a minute, pal. Yes or no?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SALESMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(glowering)Yeah. They come in black.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Give me a pair of nines.Pronto.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>

The salesman glances casually at Jack.

<SALESMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does he want a pair, too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALESMAN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - DRESS DEPARTMENT - NIGHT

As Jack and Frank return to Ladies Wear, Frank jettisons the shoe box and tissue paper.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, we got your shoes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, Jack and Frank notice Susie, standing in front of a mirror in the new dress. The dress is open down to the small of her back. It's a nice back.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>

</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Zip me up?

</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
As Jack takes the zipper, he gives Frank a "what did I tell you" glance.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shoes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank puts the shoes down and Susie steps in.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're tight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're nines.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well they're aspiring to be sevens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can buy new ones tomorrow. Don't worry. We'll take these out of your share.

INT. HILTON KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the trio rushes in, Frank hands Jack the Miracle Hair can, then turns to Susie.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, now remember, Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say...

</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Jack sprays Frank's head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
As Susie starts to inquire about Frank's head, RAY, the assistant manager, leans into the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Winding your watch these days, Frankie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We had a little emergency, Ray.

</FRANK>
<RAY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's this, Minnie Pearl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>

All eyes turn to Susie's dress, which still has the tags attached. Frank turns to the kitchen crew.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scissors! We need scissors here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RAY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Good luck, guys. It's a pretty ugly group. They're sending back the cheeseballs.

As Jack and Frank exit, Susie turns and sees a TINY MAN in an apron holding a meat cleaver.
</DIRECTION>
<TINY_MAN_CARLOS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No scissors.

INT . HILTON LOUNGE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
As the Bakers slide quickly behind their pianos, Frank bumps his head on the microphone.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening. Welcome to the Ambassador Lounge. My name's Frank Baker and no, you're not seeing double, it's just my little brother Jack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
The audience peers at Jack as if he were some curious life form they've never seen before. Jack and Frank exchange a wary glance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HILTON KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Susie, sitting on a stool, fits something on her wrist while Carlos looks for a good angle to get at the tags. As the waitress passes by, Susie snares a drink.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a sip. To kill the butterflies.

</SUSIE>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. But no lipstick. Hey, what's that on your wrist?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The next hour and a half of my life.

</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Carlos brings the cleaver down with an ominous chop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HILTON LOUNGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An audience of stone.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is nice. I feel an unspoken warmth here. We may not know each other's names, but over the years we've shared something. A little music. A little laughter. Maybe even... a few tears. But I guess that's what life's about, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dead silence. As Frank glances at Jack, Jack cuts a rueful grin.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, anyway. This is a very special evening for Jack and I, because tonight we have with us a young lady who we think is very exciting...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Smoking nervously offstage, Susie checks her wrists, which is fitted with tiny cards, each containing the lyrics to a song.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As far as I'm concerned, she couldn't have chosen a better place to make her debut.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(solemnly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because, for us, there's one place that's always been a very special place. And that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge. Ladies and gentlemen, please give a warm welcome to a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Absently crushing her cigarette into a container of cocktail napkins, Susie strides to the microphone, which, unfortunately, is not on.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The switch. Hit the switch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Switch?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hitting it, voice booming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What fucking switch?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Susie looks at the audience.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack and Frank glance at one another, then quickly plunge into the opening number.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
The feeling at this point, it would seem, is not mutual. Susie glances at her wrist, finds the song she wants, then grabs the microphone. It's stuck. She gives it a yank, trying to free it, but pulls so hard that the rubber band holding the cards snaps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mystified, Jack and Frank watch as the couple nearest the stage is showered in tiny cards. Then they notice Susie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's frozen. Stiff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks at Frank. Frank looks at Jack. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"I work at the Palace ballroom..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Every head in the lounge, Jack's included, swivels to Frank.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"But gee that place is cheap When I get back to my chilly old room I'm much to tired to sleep..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks at Frank like he's insane. Frank nods earnestly to him as all heads swivel to Jack.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(reluctantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"I'm one of those lady teachers A beautiful hostess you know One that the palace features At exactly a dime a throw..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack's voice -- damning evidence that he and Frank are related -- brings Susie around. She takes the next lines right out of Frank's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Ten cents a dance That's what they pay me Gosh how they weigh me down
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ten cents a dance Pansies and rough guys Tough guys who tear my gown..."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Compared to what preceded her, Susie sounds like Streisand. The audience -- bewildered, but oddly charmed -- applauds spontaneously. The effect on Susie is immediate. Hitting on all cylinders now, she grips the microphone like a trophy.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Seven to midnight I hear drums Loudly the saxophone blows Trumpets are tearing my eardrums Customers crush my toes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Sometimes I think I've found my hero But it's queer romance All that you need is a ticket Come on big boy, ten cents a dance..."

<FRANK>

	I took the right side of the closet like always, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since I have the bed on the right and the drawers on the right, I figured it's easier to remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But if it doesn't work out, let me know. I'm flexible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, Susie enters from the other side of the suite, through the connecting bathroom. She has a piece of fruit in her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like Carmen Miranda had an accident in my room.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(seeing their baskets)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They must get a deal on these things. What do you make of this?

</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Susie holds up the tiny furry fruit in her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kiwi.

63A EXT. HOTEL GROUNDS - INNER COURTYARD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The inner courtyard is a maze of low hedges and small bridges, with a tiny stream running through it all. As Susie and Eddie inspect the menagerie of topiary animals along the way, Jack and Frank follow several yards behind.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm telling you right now, I'm not gonna put up with it. Did you see what she ate at dinner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack, working his mouth with a toothpick, studies Susie's trim figure up ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prime rib, confetti pasta, a festive cheese platter, my potato, and two desserts. Two.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never eat your potato. Besides, we're not paying for it. What do you care?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think they'd don't keep track of these things?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank spots Eddie, up ahead, sniffing a topiary animal.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that's very attractive. Your dog just went to the bathroom on an elephant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's a unicorn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And she has no business talking about my head.

</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank. Relax, will ya. You know what happens when you get tense on the road.

Frank gives Jack a look.

<JACK>

<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not sleepwalk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank. I found you down in the lobby at 3 A.M. sitting by the Christmas tree in your pajamas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I went down for a pack of Chiclets, I saw the tree, I sat down for a few minutes. That is not sleepwalking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then how come you leave the bathroom light on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank, a little thrown, stops.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I leave the light on in case either of us has to get up in the middle of the night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(walking on)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mm hm.

</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JACK AND FRANK'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pitch dark, except for a tiny sliver of light coming from the bathroom. Suddenly, the BLARE of BIG BAND MUSIC is heard coming from Susie's side of the suite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bedside lamp flicks on. Frank.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack squints awake. Eddie, in the chair by the window, looks up groggily.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you hear this? Do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank, wearing boxers, gets out of bed.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is great. Before we play a single note, we're gonna get thrown out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack sits up, takes a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So she's playing a little music.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A little music! She's got the Harry James Orchestra in there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>

	Ellington.

Frank yells through the bathroom.

<FRANK>

</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look a little tense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I'm a little tense. It's two o'clock in the morning. She's gonna wake up everyone in the hotel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly there's a KNOCK on the door.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See? See?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
As Frank opens the door, a hulking FIGURE is there.
</DIRECTION>
<HULK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Massage?

</HULK>
<SUSIE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</SUSIE_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Susie is leaning out her door, "Perdido" is BLASTING into the hallway. She eyes Frank's boxers.

<DIRECTION>
INT. FRANK AND JACK'S ROOM - MORNING (SAME TIME)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack, rubbing a bad night's sleep out of his eyes, glances over at Frank's bed. Eddie is lying there, lost in deep slumber. A light SNORING is heard and Jack looks down between the beds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank. Blissfully asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. "KING'S MANOR" DINING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darkness. Quickly, one chandelier after another burns on, illuminating a grand dining room. At the far end sit two dazzling Steinways.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
The trio, standing by a panel of light switches, stares up at the chandeliers.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, it's the least dusted lighting fixture in the world. Fulla spiders. That's a fact.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack and Frank don't quite know how to respond to this.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guy I met on an escort gig sold 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
As Jack and Frank nod, Susie looks at the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, turn 'em off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Susie dashes to the other end of the room, to the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. Kill 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(doing it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you mind telling us exactly what it is we're doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
(out of the darkness)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I say go, you hit the lights. Okay? Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(sarcastically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay... Go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
As Frank hits the switches, the chandeliers trip on, sending a rolling wave of light towards the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and gentlemen! The Sensational Susie Diamond!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
As the stage bursts to life, Susie is revealed, head thrown back, arms outstretched. Lena Horne couldn't do it better.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Susie breaks her pose. Jack and Frank are staring at her.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. And The Fabulous Baker Boys...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
As Jack and Frank look at each other, MUSIC begins, and we --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. "KING'S MANOR" DINING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sea of elegantly-dressed couples dancing cheek to cheek on the dance floor, while others sit at candlelit tables, sipping wine. As the stage drifts INTO VIEW, Susie steps forwards and begins to croon, "The Look Of Love," while Jack and Frank underscore her voice with lush phrasings. The atmosphere is dreamlike, hypnotic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almost too good to be true.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRANK AND JACK'S TERRACE - NIGHT (LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trio is on the terrace, surrounded by champagne buckets and caviar, radio purring SOFT MUSIC. Frank's hair looks a little wild, as if someone has been rubbing his head.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(euphoric; smashed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why kid ourselves? It's time to set new goals. Cruise ships... it's ours if we want it.

</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fulla rats. I guy I escorted gave me the lowdown.
	</DIALOGUE>

<FRANK>

	<DIALOGUE>
	After that... Europe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Europe?

</SUSIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Music's the international language.

</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought love was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mark my words. From this night forward, our lives will never be the same.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell you what, Frank. You get more pop out of two glasses of champagne that anyone I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a long way from Hula Girl Hideaway, huh, Jack? Remember? Banana trees in the lobby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Takahama's Tahitian.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Takahama's? We play there. I thought we just stopped for teriyaki.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three nights.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(to Susie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's amazing. He can remember every place we ever played. The day, the month, the year, how many shows -- you name it. When was Takahama's, Jack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	August. '74.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See? He's brilliant. Really. Brilliant. Hey, Jack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're brilliant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(to Susie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Same with music. You should've seen him when we were kids. No one could ride the keys like Jack. Miss Simpson would play something once and that was it -- he had it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Susie, intrigued by this, studies Jack.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never won a single blue ribbon until the day Jack showed up drunk at Spring Recital and played "Moon Over Cuba" instead of "Clare de Lune."
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Susie glances at Jack.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The mood just hit me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey... "Moonglow."
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank turns up the VOLUME of the radio and looks at Jack with a smile. Jack shoots him a warning glance.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Moonglow"...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	High school formal. I didn't know how to dance. Jack did the boxstep with me for a week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't a week, it was an afternoon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You two are closer than I thought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He paid me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Worth every penny. It was my first big social with Donna. We fell in love on the dance floor. I have a beautiful wife, two beautiful children... all because of my brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you're overestimating the boxstep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Frank slips into Susie's arms and begins to dance with her, humming to the radio. Susie laughs, then goes with him. Jack takes a sip of champagne, watching.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was just like this on our honeymoon. The moon, the stars... Remember, Jack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, right. My first solo gig. God, she was gorgeous. Couldn't believe she was mine. How come I got so lucky, Jack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a lucky guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am. I am a lucky guy. She could've married anyone, but she chose me...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Susie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I've never kissed my wife on New Year's Eve. Not once. Always onstage somewhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
This seems to make Frank a little melancholy and he almost stops dancing. Finally, he pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'm drunk. You two dance. I gonna go sit with the wallflowers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
As Frank turns Susie toward Jack, they glance at each other awkwardly.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I'm not used to leading.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Jack. Give the girl a glide.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think maybe your little brother prefers to dance alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Susie smiles slightly, offers Jack a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thanks. I never touch French cigarettes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Susie's drunk enough that this tickles her a bit. Jack steps forward and takes her hand and they begin to move.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your brother's a pretty good dancer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Big heartbreaker. Never had to say a word. Couple turns on the dance floor and that was it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
(amused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	REALLY.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(tapping his knees)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got 'em right in the knees. They practically had to carry the girls off the floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How thrilling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank, why don't you have another drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sleepy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you go to sleep then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank grabs a bottle and disappears into the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like I lost my chaperone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you're safe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack presses in closer, moving smoothly to the music.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, where do you keep all your blue ribbons, Baker?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank keeps them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack slides his hand a little lower on Susie's back.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice night, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hm-hm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Susie swallows, melting into the rhythm of Jack's movements, into his body, drifting to the purr of the MUSIC, swirling under the stars. Suddenly, she dips in a little quivering motion and Jack catches her.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Careful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Susie looks a little shocked by her body's betrayal. She separates from Jack and takes a step back.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... I think I've had too much to drink. Champagne goes right to my... head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we should call it a night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Susie nods. A smile flickers on Jack's lips, then he turns away. Susie looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At her knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRANK AND JACK'S ROOM - NEXT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seemingly empty, both beds unmade and unoccupied, a champagne bottle on the carpet, a tuxedo jacket hanging cockeyed on the closet floor, and Frank... fast asleep in the chair by the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. "KING'S MANOR" LOBBY - MORNING (EARLY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Susie steps out of the elevator, THEO, the clerk at the front desk, motions to her.
</DIRECTION>
<THEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Miss Diamond. These just arrived for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEO>

A dozen red roses are sitting on the desk.

Susie takes the roses and turns back to the elevators. As the doors open, Eddie trots out, heading off across the lobby. Susie watches him go by, then we...

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
INT. "KING'S MANOR" CORRIDOR - EDDIE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later, coming toward us down a corridor off the lobby. As he passes out of sight, Susie appears at the opposite end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUSIE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Eddie disappears into the grand dining room. Curious, she follows. As she draws closer, the SOUND of a piano becomes clear. Peering inside, she finds Jack playing alone at one of the grands onstage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. "KING'S MANOR" DINING ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the vast emptiness of the room, the piano resonates powerfully and the music Jack makes is like nothing we've heard him play before. Fluid and unpredictable, it is played with the focused abandon of a jazz hand. Susie watches, transfixed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he finishes, Jack notices Susie, but says nothing, instead pouring himself another glass of whiskey and starting to play again.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Working overtime?

</SUSIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>

Jack doesn't react, just keeps playing. Susie drops the flowers onto a table and walks over to the piano.

	What's this? You're playing?

<JACK>

Susie watches Jack's hand glide deftly over the keys, then looks at his face. He is oblivious to all but the sounds he is making.

Frank nods wearily. He goes to the phone, begins to dial, then hears the SOUND of Jack's piano. Hanging up the phone, he wanders down to the dining room and looks inside.

INT. DINING ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Susie is leaning over the piano, smoking a cigarette, a shoe dangling from her toe as she watches Jack play. There is something intimate in her posture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is something about it Frank doesn't like.

INT. "KING'S MANOR" BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
As Jack smokes calmly, Frank paces tensely. He takes a few steps, glances at Jack, then resumes pacing, stops, looks at Jack again.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I think it's been five years since I saw you without a cigarette in your mouth. Five years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack, a cigarette dangling from his lip, just stares at Frank.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The whole goddamn room upstairs smells like an ashtray. You know that, don't you? The sheets, the carpet, the drapes, the towels, my tux, my shirt. Do you want to smell my shirt? Do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not kidding about this. Do you have any idea what an insidious habit that is? I mean, how many cigarettes do you smoke in one day? It must be hundreds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is just a wild stab, but... is something bothering you, Frank?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave her alone. I mean it.

</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack looks at Frank, puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack. This isn't some hatcheck girl you can leave behind at the Sheraton. You got two shows a night with her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>

As Jack realises what Frank means, his eyes harden.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know what you're talking about.

<FRANK>

Moments later, onstage. Frank is addressing the audience.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, meeting here each night as we do, sharing these few moments, I feel as if we're becoming one big happy family.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack, still burning from Frank's comments backstage, eyes Frank coolly.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The candlelight. The music. You. Everyone of you. Just being yourselves. People being people. What's all this mean? I don't know. Who's to say? All I can tell you is, it makes it very special for us up here to have you out there. Right, Susie?

Frank stares incredulously at Jack. Suddenly the audience breaks into APPLAUSE.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, well, thanks for sharing that with us, Jack.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(moving quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<FRANK>

As Frank stares over at Jack, Jack lights a cigarette and exhales a long plume of smoke.

Eddie watches Jack and Frank undress in heavy silence. Susie, washing up, listens from the bathroom.

</JACK>
<FRANK>

Jack frowns at his brother, then tosses him a kiwi.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eat a kiwi, Frank.

Frank flings the kiwi back at Jack. Jack ducks.

INT. JACK AND FRANK'S ROOM - MORNING

<DIRECTION>
We START on the kiwi, lying in a battered lump on the windowsill, PASS OVER a pack of cigarettes on the night table, then SETTLE on Frank... nestled under Jack's shoulder, dead to the world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack blinks awake. Slowly his eyes slide over...

As Susie strokes her hair before the mirror, the phone RINGS.

<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Phone call, Frank. They say it's... important.

Susie stops, seeing Jack, smoking now, with Frank still slumbering under his shoulder. It's a rather striking tableau.

	We made a deal. Man to man. Training wheels for a month, then we'd see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He ran into a car?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Ramondino's station wagon. It wasn't moving. It was just parked on the street. He barely made it out of the driveway. All right, who's got a pencil?

<DIRECTION>
Jack has lined a row of kiwis on the windowsill and is shooting rubber bands at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUSIE'S ROOM - DAY (SAME TIME)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Susie is smoking a cigarette, staring out the window. She glances at the bathroom once, twice, then takes the newspaper and passes through.
</DIRECTION>

INT. JACK'S ROOM - DAY (SAME TIME)
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any word from Egghead?

</SUSIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Thanks.

</JACK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

This doesn't seem to excite Jack, but he nods anyway.

<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. Happy reading.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Susie retreats, frowns to herself, then notices Jack's shaving cup. Curious, she takes the brush, runs the bristles over her cheek, then spins the cap off a bottle of aftershave, sniffs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JACK'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack, up and pacing, pauses as he passes the bathroom, listening to the strange STIRRINGS inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Susie inspects a few more items, then exits. Seconds later, the door opens tentatively and Jack enters. He eyes his things, adjusts the shaving brush. He glances as the riot of powders and creams crowding Susie's sink. Picking up a tiny perfume vial, he gives it a spray: it packs quite a wallop. Startled, he waves his hand to defuse the odor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUSIE'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside, Susie pauses on her cigarette, sniffs the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack replaces the bottle, accidentally causing a stir among a few other others, then exits. As Susie re-enters, a tiny nail polish bottle wobbles upright. She studies the bottle, sniffs again, then pokes her head into Jack's room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JACK'S ROOM - DAY

</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack nods. Susie nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - DAY

Susie pulls the door closed, frowns again, then turns on the bath. Taking a bottle of Mr. Bubble, she sits on the toilet and sprays pink lazy eights into the tub.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JACK'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack stops, pivots and sends a kiwi towards the waste-basket. SWISH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUSIE'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Susie goes to the bedroom, strips, slips into a robe. There are cigarettes burning in every corner of the room. Oblivious, she lights another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JACK'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie ducks as a plum sails over his head. The carpet around the waste-basket is littered with fruit. Jack grabs a coconut, eyes the basket, then notices a crescent forming on the carpet outside the bathroom. He raps on the door, gets nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack enters just as Mr. Bubble glides over the lip of the tub.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUSIE'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Susie, staring at the ocean like Garbo, hears the BOTTLE tumble, then sees the water. She dashes in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the door pounds Jack, Susie does a little slip-slide-spin on the sudsy floor and tumbles into Jack's arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not exactly "From Here To Eternity", but the room IS pretty steamy and Susie's robe has slipped off one very nice shoulder. Jack looks at the shoulder, then into Susie's eyes. Susie looks back. Swallows.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
They stand like this, sort of like a statue, then the phone RINGS. They disengage. Jack goes to the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... Oh, hi, Frank.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Frank.

Susie nods, pulls her robe closed.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. How's little Frank?... Yeah?... Well, that's a relief, huh?... No, I understand, call me when you have more time... Huh? Oh, nothing. We're taking a bath. Well, Susie's taking a bath, I'm doing the crossword. Huh?... What's that?... Newt?... Yeah, I know what it is. Turns up a lot, huh? okay, I'll remember. Thanks. 'Bye...

Jack hangs up the phone, looks at Susie.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kid's in the pink.

Susie nods, tightens her robe again.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. Thanks for the catch. Coulda got quite a bump.

Susie nods, pulls the door closed.

Susie, wearing a very sexy black silk dress, joins Jack. She hands him a piece of paper.

As Jack stares at the paper, Susie inspects her hair in the reflection of a silver tea tray.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotta give it to ol' Egghead. Never gives the kite too much string.
	</DIALOGUE>

As Susie turns back to Jack, he crumples the paper.

INT. "KING'S MANOR" DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A banner stretched between two chandeliers, proclaims "HAPPY NEW YEAR!" As the CAMERA DESCENDS, Jack can be heard picking out a familiar TUNE, but showering it in blue notes, drawing it out, giving it smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Susie's face drifts up INTO FRAME, her eyes closed, but the CAMERA CONTINUES to drop, moving like syrup down her body, over the silk that clings to her hips and thighs, down her legs to a pair of wicked arch-breaking heels.

She's standing on Jack's Steinway.

Caught somewhere between Ray Charles and Marilyn Monroe, Susie's voice slides silkily from a whisper to a growl, her fingers running like sand over her body.

As Jack knocks hell out of the bridge, Susie melts onto the piano like a kitten, stretching out languorously on her back. On the dance floor, men in tuxedos sneak guilty glances while their wives just stare, mouths agape. In less that a minute, Susie's managed to turn a dignified resort hotel into a sizzling roadhouse.

A blizzard of confetti fills the air as people scramble for that certain someone to kiss in the new year. In this moment, Jack and Susie find themselves oddly distanced from the happiness below them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Susie glances at Jack, then finally goes to him. As their lips touch, they kiss lightly, then pull away awkwardly. As Susie turns away, Jack sounds the first chord of "Auld Lang Syne" and the room rises as one voice.

Dark and lonely now, the tables and floors covered with confetti, like virgin snow. Jack sits on a table, looking out at the moonlit ocean. Susie comes up behind him, carrying a half-empty bottle of champagne.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. Make any resolutions?

<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, they got a convention for everything. This guy was some big roller in suds. At least he was clean. Some of the guys I met through the service, you wouldn't believe. The older ones, they were okay. Nice. Polite. Pulled the chair out for you. But the younger ones...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack watches as Susie takes another hit off the bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't so bad, though. I'd get a nice piece of steak, flowers, sometimes even a gift. Usually whatever the guy was into. Got a set of socket wrenches once. Believe it? The guy looked like he'd just given me four dozen roses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Susie smiles to herself, then her face changes, becomes almost wistful.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I stayed at the Hartford once. You should see the rooms. All satin and velvet. And the bed. Royal blue, trimmed in lace clean as snow. Hard to believe sleeping in a room like that don't change your life. But it don't. The bed may be magic, but the mirror isn't. You wake up the same old Susie.

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never liked the Hartford much myself.

</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Susie's eyes lock into Jack's, then she turns a little and starts to roll her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My neck is so tight. Usually singing relaxes me, but I don't know, tonight...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack watches her a moment, then stands up and sweeps the hair off her shoulder, placing his hands on her neck, massaging the muscles softly. She swallows.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>

Jack hesitates, then unhooks the catch, letting the panels divide a bit.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
As Jack's fingers work down to Susie's shoulders, the dress begins to divide slowly, the fabric pulling silently apart. Susie turns her head a little just as Jack's fingers slip under the silk, skimming down her sides, just below her breasts. He leans in and kisses her neck.

We TRACK him for a moment, then he stops: by a room service tray sitting outside a door. He sniffs finds nothing to his taste, then moves down the hall to the next tray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, after several stops, Eddie returns to the elevator and waits... three T-bones in his mouth.

INT. SUSIE'S ROOM - MORNING

<DIRECTION>
Jack, quiet as a mouse, slips out of bed, gathers his clothes, and in approximately ten seconds, is dressed.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd make a helluva fireman, you know that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack stops, looks over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You practice that at home with a stopwatch?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't want to wake you. Early riser.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Susie glances out the window. It's gotta be about noon.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Listen. I didn't expect you to rush out and buy me a corsage this morning, you know. Your school ring's safe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack nods, slips into the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - DAY (SAME TIME)

111 INT. "KING'S MANOR" LOBBY - DAY

As Jack stands at the front desk, members of the hotel staff pose for photographs with Eddie.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>

</JACK>
<THEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that, Mr Baker?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEO>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ed. He barely touched a thing while he was here, but I don't know... I could swear he's GAINED weight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Theo points his finger to a line on the checkout form.
</DIRECTION>
<THEO>
<DIRECTION>
(as Jack signs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we're sure going to miss him. All of you. It's too bad your brother missed all the excitement last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEO>
<DIRECTION>
Jack glances up.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Too bad. You seen Miss Diamond?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<THEO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe that's her talking to the gentleman in the blue suit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THEO>
<DIRECTION>
Across the lobby, Jack sees Susie talking to a man in the far corner.
</DIRECTION>
<THEO>
	<DIALOGUE>

EXT. THE CITY SKYLINE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Jack and Eddie enter, Jack sets his suitcase on the floor and flicks on a lamp. A string, hanging like a smile from one side of the bedroom door frame to the other, droops with paper letters: "WELCOME HOME."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the kitchen, Jack opens the refrigerator. A container of cottage cheese. Two desperate bananas. One beer. Opting for the beer, he goes to the piano by the window, sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He taps out a skeleton phrase, teases it, then, like the morning Susie found him in the dining room, begins to expand on the idea, filling the room with music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
113A EXT. DINER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the front window, the usual photos of celebrity patrons, including one of Susie placed between those of Jack and Frank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINER - DAY (SAME)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Susie and the brothers sit at a table strews with empty coffee cups and half-eaten food. Frank has several slips of paper before him with names and dates.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That takes care of the week of the fifth. After that, we got the Avedon downtown or the Plaza. Four day turns. What do you think, Jack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack is staring out the window. Bored.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You with me, Jack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Avedon's a dump. No cover. No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller Brush crowd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Susie, as she says this, pours sugar into her Coke.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(watching)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not that bad. Besides, Blackie Carson books the Avedon. He's always been good to us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(drily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's hasn't been that good to us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, we'll take the Plaza. After that, we're locked into the Capri for five days, then we got our choice...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Capri? Oh Christ, not the goddamn Luau Lounge again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter with the Luau Lounge? They don't salt their peanuts?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Singing "Feelings" knee deep in paper orchids and plastic tiki lamps isn't exactly my idea of a fun evening.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fun? Who promised you fun? We get paid, remember?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just saying maybe we should vote on it. Or maybe... we should ask Jack what he thinks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have to ask Jack what he thinks. I know what he thinks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack, hearing this. shifts his eyes coolly to Frank.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's five days. The money's green. We're there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Susie, looking tense, watches Frank go back to his slips. Jack taps an unlit cigarette on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And by the way, speaking of "Feelings," you might think about brushing up on the lyrics. The other night, at the resort, you sang the first verse twice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? That must explain the gasp I heard from the audience.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Let's hear it. We've trashed the Avedon and the Luau Lounge. What's our beef with "Feelings"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Frank nods, starts to go back to the slips.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	EXCEPT... who cares? I mean, does anybody really need to hear "Feelings" again in their lifetime? It's like parsley...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(taking a sprig from her plate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it away and no one would know the difference.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Feelings" is not parsley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To you, "Feelings" may be goddamn filet mignon. To me, it's parsley. Less that parsley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack, mildly amused, settles against the window to listen.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, "Feelings," despite what you may think of it, has always been one of the bright moments in the show and a consistent crowd pleaser. Consequently, we have an obligation to play it. If we didn't the audience would be disappointed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, they weren't exactly crying their eyes out on New Year's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Frank stops shuffling the slips, looks up slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You passed over "Feelings"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. And for your information, "Bali Hai" went out with the bathwater too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Frank looks from Susie to Jack.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I see. The cat goes away for a night and the mice take over the orchestra.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. I ain't no mouse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. You're parsley.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Big silence.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you better calm down, Frank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you better make sure it's your head that's doing the thinking these days, little brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Susie stands up, takes her coat.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This food's been sitting here too long. It's starting to make me feel SICK.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Susie turns and slams out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you loosen the leash.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's not let a whiff of perfume blow off fifteen years. Be reasonable, Jack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I play three hundred nights a years with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JACK'S BUILDING - EARLY EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Susie paces under a street lamp, working on a Paris Opal. She takes a glance up at Jack's window, then drops her cigarette to the sidewalk. There are half-a-dozen others already there. Deciding, she enters the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
115A INT. JACK'S BUILDING - STAIRWELL

Susie arrives at Jack's door, knocks. A moment passes, then it swings open. Nina.

The murmur of MUSIC can be heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT - JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack sits at the bar, sipping a whiskey gingerly, watching a trio perform on the dimly-lit stage. A BLACK MAN in a suit steps up next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(watching the trio)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How you doing, Henry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't complain. What do you think of the kid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
Jack glances at the baby-faced pianist onstage.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When's his mother pick him up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's been playing here a year. You oughta come around more often, Jack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's good. That Tyler on drums?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some old man, huh? Guy'd fall down a fucking staircase and keep the beat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>

As the bartender passes, Henry motions to Jack's drink.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On the house, Tony.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how about Jack Baker? Still stompin' at the Sheraton?

</JACK>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what're you doing here?

EXT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT (LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Susie arrives, glances around. She hesitates, then pushes through the doors to the club.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JAZZ CLUB - NIGHT (SAME TIME)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Susie descends the cement stairs inside, a man with a saxophone rushes past her, heading for the street. Patrons linger in the corridor, drinks in hand, talking animatedly, laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The main room is even darker, full of shadows smoking cigarettes. Susie looks for Jack, doesn't see him, then settles by the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Double vodka.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Across the room, the men's room opens and two black men exit, but no one else. Scanning the tables again, Susie sees only the same unfamiliar shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she hears the PIANO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Turning slowly, Susie discovers Jack, hunched over the piano onstage, playing with the trio. At first, he toys with the melody, finding his way, then seduces the song away from itself entirely. Lost in concentration, he plays more expressively, ending with a passionate cascade of notes as he reconstructs the melody. As the audience APPLAUDS, Susie settles back into the shadows of the bar. Hidden, studies Jack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His face is calm. Peaceful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRWELL - JACK'S BUILDING - NIGHT (LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacks trots up the stairs to his apartment, then stops suddenly. Susie is sitting on the landing, one shoe off, massaging her bare foot.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(uncomfortable)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was in the neighbourhood. Thought I'd drop by.

</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack nods, eyes her foot.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Big feet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack says nothing, starts up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, don't get nervous or anything. I just came over to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Susie's voice falters as Jack hooks her stray shoe on his finger and continues toward his apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack doesn't want to talk.

EXT. JACK'S BUILDING - MORNING

<DIRECTION>
As the sun comes up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JACK'S BEDROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Naked, Susie slips quietly out of bed, gathers her clothes, dresses. Twelve seconds, tops. Only one problem: only one shoe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Limping to the bathroom, Susie catches herself in the mirror, grimaces, then hobbles to the front room...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Just as Nina pushes open the window and enters from the fire escape. Both stop cold, stare at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess you found him, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came to walk Eddie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<DIRECTION>
Susie nods. Nina eyes Susie's footwear situation, then slips off the windowsill and goes to the kitchen, where Eddie's leash is hanging on the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have a toothbrush with you, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<DIRECTION>
Susie, puzzled, shakes her head. Nina nods, then points behind Susie. There, on the bookshelf, is her shoe.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
As Nina exits with Eddie, Susie stares at the door, a little confused, then goes to retrieve her shoe. There, sitting on the shelf, is an old photograph of Jack and Frank. Wearing boyish grins and bad suits, they hold a bottle of liquor out for the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terry's Tap Room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Susie jumps, surprised to see Jack, dressed now. He smiles, nods to the photo.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First gig we ever played. The guy that ran the place gave us the bottle but wouldn't open in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(charming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Told us to save it. Said someday it would soften the edges of the bad times and make the good ones seem even better. The best idea would've been to drink it before we played Terry's Taproom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack watches Susie study the photo.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coffee?

	Yeah... no. I mean...

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see you tonight at the Hilton. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Susie nods, but doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen. The reason I came by last night... I'm thinking about leaving. The act.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Susie looks at Jack, but he says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a... I met this guy over New Year's, at the hotel. He liked my voice. And, well, it's... He thinks I can sell cat food just singing about it. Crazy, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Susie tries to laugh. Jack nods.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, it's nothing big. Mostly local stuff probably.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I haven't decided. I'm just thinking about it...

</SUSIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it.

</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Susie stops, studies Jack's face.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how long you been taking care of the kid upstairs?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't take care of her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't look that way to me...

</SUSIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the difference?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, anyway, like I said, I know Frank's got us booked through March.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry about Frank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that got to do with anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... nothing. I just mean, I don't want to leave you guys with an empty mike...

</SUSIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. There's always another girl.

Susie looks at Jack. His face is unflinching.

<SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
(grabbing her coat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Well... Thanks for the advice. I'll think it over.

	It's just a song. It's a couple times a night. Ten minutes of your life. That's all.

	Yeah. Frank's done great. He's got the wife, the kids, the little house in the suburbs. Meanwhile his brother's sitting in a shitty apartment with a sick dog, Little Orphan Annie, and a chip on his shoulder as big as a Cadillac.

</JACK>
<SUSIE>

	I know one thing. While Frank Baker was home putting the kids to sleep last night, little brother Jack was out dusting off his dreams for a few minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack just stares at her.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was there. I saw it in your face. You're full of shit. You're a fake. Every time you walk into some shitty daiquiri hut, you're selling yourself on the cheap. I know all about that. I used to find myself at the end of the night with some malt ball mogul, then wake up in the morning and tell myself it didn't matter. You kid yourself that you got this empty place inside where you can put it all. But do it long enough and all you are is empty.

</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thirty-one years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
No response. As Frank clears his throat nervously, Jack studies the bored, brutally indifferent faces of the people in the lounge.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, uh, back then it was, uh, a little different. We were just kids. Just about the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil. We must've shaved three lives off old Cecil, huh, Jack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank laughs. His voice, eerily magnified by the microphone, is the only sound in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, anyway. It's nice to be back here at the Ambassador Lounge, because this place has always been a very special place for Jack and I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack watches a woman dribble her drink accidentally and let out a peal of laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? I guess you could say it's just... the people.

As Frank launches into "People," Jack watches the woman wipe her chin, still laughing, and we --

EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT (LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack moves down the block, then starts to slow as he sees Susie up ahead, standing on the corner, talking with a man. She says something to him, laughs, and the man gives her a peck on the cheek and walks away. As she begins to search her purse, Jack approaches. Just as her face comes INTO VIEW, she senses him and turns, startled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not Susie.
</DIRECTION>

For a moment, he just stares at her.

	Sorry.

INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - NIGHT (LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack enters and slams the door. He looks wired up, restless. Lighting a cigarette, he flicks on the TV, gets only haze, adjusts the antenna, still gets nothing, then gives it a pop with his fist... still nothing. Infuriated, he steps back, eyes the TV, then gives it a kick with his foot, sending it tumbling. He studies it, unsatisfied, turns to the bookcase, and clears a shelf with a sweep of his arms. He looks at the debris at his feet, sees the "Terry's Tap Room" photo of he and Frank and picks it up, studying it as he drags on his cigarette. Sliding behind the piano, he props the photo there, and begins to play, searching for something interesting, but he's too distracted. He stops, tries again, loses the groove after a few bars and then begins to pound the keys furiously in frustration. As he stops, his eyes shift to the photograph of he and Frank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two skinny kids, smiling goofily.

INT./EXT. FRANK'S CAR - NIGHT

	<DIALOGUE>

Jack stares at Frank, then takes another drink.

INT. TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Jerry Lewis need not fear. This is strictly a tinfoil and crepe paper operation. In front of a huge tote board, a kid in a wheelchair is doing basketball tricks before the camera.

<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see when we're on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>

As Frank leaves, Jack glances around the studio like he's walked into a nightmare. At the phone bank, a heavyset MAN in a sweatshirt and cap looks over. Both the sweatshirt and the cap have "Earl" printed on them.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, I know a lot of you amateur musicians out there are going to want to rap with these guys -- and don't worry. Right after they finish up here, they're going to be manning the phones. Maybe we can even convince them to raffle off a few piano lessons if we're lucky. What do you think?

</VINCE>
<DIRECTION>
The audience APPLAUDS. Jack glares at Frank.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well all right then. What are we waiting for? Take it away, guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINCE>
<DIRECTION>
As Jack and Frank begin to play. As the music rises, the studio becomes very quiet, almost still. Unfortunately, Jack and Frank are barely though the opening passage when a thunderously loud BELL begins to ring. Suddenly Vince steps out again.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh oh. We know what that means, don't we? It's time to turn the big board over again.

Jack just stares at Frank, as if looking at a stranger.

<JACK>

</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank tosses the bottle into the street, where it SHATTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to explain something to you, little brother. See, there are people in this world who depend on me. I've got a wife, and two kids who expect to wake up every morning with food on the table and heat in the house. I got a mortgage. I got car payments. And, oh yeah, I got you. My little brother Jack who's so cool and so hip and so fucking sure he's better than everyone else. Don't you think I'd like to walk up to one of these assholes and blow smoke in his face? Goddamn right I would. But I can't. I have to be responsible, little brother. I have to make sure the numbers balance out in my favour at the end of each month so everyone can go on living their lives. You don't win medals for it, but you can be damn sure you'd all take notice if I folded up shop. So don't talk to me about dignity, little brother. You're drawing on a weak hand.

<DIRECTION>
Jack stares at Frank through the rain, then turns and begins to walk away.

	Great. Terrific. Walk away. You're good at that, Jack. You never could commit to anything, even a conversation.

Jack stops, glares at Frank.

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, you're a real pro, Frank. You were doing such a bang up job a few months ago, you had 'em paying us NOT to play. That's fucking genius.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Enraged by this, Frank glares at Jack, then suddenly bolts forward, drilling hard with his shoulder, driving Jack into the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, Frank! What the fuck's the matter with you?

</JACK>

Jack twists Frank around and pushes him off, but Frank charges back.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamnit, Frank! Knock it off!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
As they pound off the wall again, Jack's anger suddenly multiplies on itself, as of fuelled by fifteen years of frustration. Flinging Frank against the wall, he becomes the aggressor, pounding, pulling, and slamming him in fitful rage. Frank is suddenly scared.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack!... Jack!...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank slides down the cement wall, trying to protect himself. Unrelenting, Jack comes down with a vicious fist at Frank's face, catching his fingers instead.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My hands! My hands!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>

Jack grabs one of Frank's hands roughly, twisting the fingers back.

Jack twists Frank's fingers harder. A knuckle cracks.

<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack! JACK!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank's voice ECHOES high above the SOUND of the rain. Jack stops, looks at Frank's hand, still clasped in his own. Letting go, he stares at his own hands, the skin split and bleeding. He no longer looks dangerous. He looks hollow, frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm through with it. I can't do it anymore.

Before Frank can say anything, Jack turns away, leaving his brother on the sidewalk, and disappears in the rain.

	Swell. Only it's Blanche here.

</MONICA>

Jack nods, starts to take his coffee, but Monica pushes it away and turns over a fresh cup.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah, don't touch that. That's three hours cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pouring)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I been sitting over there just waiting for you to wake up. Finally, I figured maybe you had an appointment or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking her head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy, it's weird, huh? You meet people, and you think you're never gonna to see them again...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
Jack studies Monica's body and she pulls away with the coffee pot. She notices.
</DIRECTION>
<MONICA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess you got caught in the rain, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MONICA>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I got caught in the rain.

Monica looks at Jack, then laughs a little nervously.

<MONICA>

	God, I still can't get over it. You just walking in here...

	<DIALOGUE>
	You're my last ticket.

</MONICA>
<DIRECTION>
Monica looks a little nervous, but hopeful. Jack studies her -- it would be easy -- but then his eyes shift to the photo of Susie again.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, button up on the way home, Blanche. It's cold out there.

INT. JACK'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING (AN HOUR LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Jack enters, he finds Nina sitting by the piano, trying to master a paddleball toy.
</DIRECTION>
<NINA>
<DIRECTION>
(not looking up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Jack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<DIRECTION>
As Nina whacks the tiny red ball off the paddle, it makes a dull, snapping SOUND. Thwack. Thwack. Finally, she misses, looks up, sees Jack's rain-rumpled tux.
</DIRECTION>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You better take that tux in, Jack. I could drop it off this afternoon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<DIRECTION>
Jack says nothing, takes off the jacket. Nina starts with the paddle again. THWACK. THWACK.
</DIRECTION>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to make some coffee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<DIRECTION>
Jack hangs his jacket on the closet door and pauses by the bookcase. Everything he had knocked off has been carefully replaced. He runs his fingers over an ashtray -- clean.
</DIRECTION>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<DIRECTION>
Jack turns and watches Nina slap the ball. THWACK. THWACK. Missing, she looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Coffee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<DIRECTION>
Jack shakes his head slowly and Nina goes back to the paddle. THWACK. THWACK. THWACK. The sound is driving Jack crazy.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you stop that please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<NINA>
<DIRECTION>
(not hearing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How 'bout eggs? I could make you some eggs if you want...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<DIRECTION>
THWACK. THWACK. THWACK. Suddenly, Jack steps forward and whips the toy out of her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you knock it off with that fucking thing?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Nina looks up, startled.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're driving me nuts.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(mocking her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"You want some eggs, Jack? you want some coffee?" What's the matter with you? You're not my housekeeper and I'm not your fucking father. I can't babysit you every time Mama gets an itch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Nina, flushed with fear and hurt, turns and slips out the window, up the fire escape. Jack stares after her, still seething, then looks at the paddle in his hand, loses his anger. He notices Eddie staring at him.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you looking at?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE FIRE ESCAPE - MORNING (A FEW MINUTES LATER)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack climbs out his window and scales the iron ladder to the roof, where Nina is sitting, dangling her legs over the rain gutter, chin in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacks sits next to her, drops the paddle into her lap.
</DIRECTION>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're having a bad day, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay. My Ma used to have lots of those. Sometimes that's why I came down. Even when there was no one sleeping over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<DIRECTION>
Jack nods, studies the skyline.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you say we go over to Empire and get a couple Coney's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't. I'm going to the zoo with Howard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Howard?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ma says I can't call him Bigfoot anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, from down in the street, the SOUND of a car horn is heard. Nina looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-oh. I think he's early.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<DIRECTION>
Nina gets up, pauses by the ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ever go to the zoo, Jack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<NINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one ever took me to the zoo before. Boy, he must REALLY be serious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NINA>
<DIRECTION>
Jack watches as Nina takes the ladder, starts to descend.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as she stops)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Teach you later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Nina looks at him, a little surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you going to do? Go around playing "Jingle Bells" the rest of your life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Nina smiles, then disappears over the side of the building. Jack picks up the paddle she's left behind, studies it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THWACK. THWACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the SOUND of the paddle ball FADES, it's overtaken by the sound of a bluesy piano and we --

<DIRECTION>
INT. THE TINY JAZZ CLUB - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING INTO IT SLOWLY, hearing the MUSIC long before the CAMERA reveals Jack, at the far end of the room, sitting alone at the piano. It's afternoon and sharp blades of sunlight slice into the ghostly room from street level windows. After a moment, a huge figure appears in the f.g., his back to us. It's Henry, the owner. He watches Jack until he finishes.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got Tuesdays and Thursdays open the rest of the month.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
Jack runs his hands lightly over the keys, just touching them, making no sound.

EXT. SUSIE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Susie steps out of her apartment building, pauses by the mailboxes.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're risking your life, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack is leaning against a car, watching her.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got a gun?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Jack pushes away from the car, comes closer.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</SUSIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how's the cat food business?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terrific. I'm doing vegetables now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack nods.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carrots, peas. None of the important ones.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<DIRECTION>
Jack nods, taps the cigarette on the railing, thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, the other night...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was out of line.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I was out of line.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Susie looks a little surprised by this.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I was a little rough on Egghead. I mean, beats the hell out of me, but... I kinda miss him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, he grows on you after awhile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
As Jack stares off down the street, Susie studies his face.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So... you find another girl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
As Jack looks up, Susie locks into his eyes, vulnerable to him, then glances away.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm gonna be late.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Peas, peas try our peas. Our peas are a deli-ca-see..." From "Strangers In The Night" to that. It's a funny world, huh?

Jack nods.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, 'bye, Baker,

Susie brushes by Jack and heads up the street.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.

She stops, turns.

<JACK>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</SUSIE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I think I'm gonna see you again.

<DIRECTION>
Susie looks at him suspiciously. Jack smiles at her.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Intuition.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Susie just looks at Jack, saying nothing, then she can't stop herself... she smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRANK'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the cab pulls away, Jack is left standing alone in the the street. He glances at the house, then goes to the front door. As he presses the new doorbell, a cacophony of CHIMES resonates inside the house and a moment later, the door swings open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Little Cindy, in a lollipop-print dress. Jack eyes her warily, still not sure he's in her good graces.
</DIRECTION>
<CINDY>

INT. "BAKER BOYS" ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank is taking things off the shelves, putting them into boxes. Coming to the Hula Girl Hideaway monkey, Frank studies it curiously, then gives the arm a flick, igniting the little torch in the other. He tosses it in a box.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't want that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank turns. Jack steps in.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How the hell'd you get in here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cindy. We're pals now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. Have your pal show you the way out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
As Frank turns back to the shelf, Jack just glances around the room, not leaving.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything goes, that the idea?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're just throwing it away?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank turns, a little shocked.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Into the garage. I'm just getting too old for trophy dens, that's all. And, anyway, it's about time Little Frank had his own room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gonna paint?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're gonna paint.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What color?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(turning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Jack. Let's cut the bullshit. You came here to talk business, right? Okay, fine. We'll put the other night behind us and in a couple weeks everything'll be the same again. Okay? Now you can go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank goes back to the boxes.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't come here to talk business.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not coming back, Frank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank stops, looks at Jack.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's there to talk about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're still brothers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm touched, Jack. Really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Jack. If you want to piss away everything we've built over fifteen years, that's fine. Just spare me the ruminations on brotherly love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me, Frank...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to listen to you anymore, Jack. What're you going to tell me? That I wasted your life? That I twisted your arm for fifteen years? Well, forget it, little brother. That's a lie. Hear me? A fucking lie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(with sudden anger)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. Okay? You're right. I don't blame you, Frank. I don't blame anyone. I just can't do it anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm drying up inside, Frank. I've been drying up for years. Do you understand? Somewhere along the way I started to close down. It's like I had this big house and one day I just started painting the windows black, one by one. I mean, I sit in the fucking Hilton or the Sheraton or wherever, practically every night of my life, and from the minute I get onstage, I'm waiting for it to end. We play the same goddamn songs the same goddamn way every night. That isn't enough for me. It just doesn't mean anything to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's dishonest. I can't do that anymore. I've been lying to myself long enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank stares at Jack for a moment, then turns back to the boxes.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you see anything you want, take it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack stands there, staring at his brother's back, defeated. He starts to leave, then something catches his eye. From a dusty shelf, he pulls out a bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay if I take this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
As Frank turns, Jack tosses the bottle to him, hard. Frank scrambles to catch it, then looks at it. It's the bottle from the photograph in Jack's apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Frank. I'm trying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank looks up, reacting to the nakedness of Jack's statement, then looks at the bottle. It seems to hold some special magic for him.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How're your hands?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My hands are fine. Don't worry about my hands. And don't worry about me. I don't need this any more than you do, little brother. We both know I can make just as much teaching "Campdown Races" to these snotty kids in the neighbourhood as being a lounge rat. Don't kid yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack just nods. Frank studies him for a long moment, then looks at the bottle again. Finally, making a decision, he flips it back to Jack.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack just looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open the fucking bottle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
As Jack holds the bottle carefully, he watches Frank grab a handful of souvenir shot glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your pleasure? We got the airport Ramada. We got the Travelodge on 410. And... the Mallory.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take the Mallory.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it. I want the Mallory. You take the Travelodge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack smiles slightly and takes the glass. As he and Frank settle on the tiny piano benches, Frank notices the dust on the glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like these got a few years on them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This'll kill 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank nods. Jack hesitates, then breaks the seal on the bottle, pours. As they swallow, each grimaces, looks at the other.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(in unison)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
It suddenly grows silent, each sitting in his old familiar place, staring into his glass.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come you keep them in tune?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank looks suprised, then shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Habit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank looks at his glass and his mind leads him to something uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe this is horrible. I mean, I know it's like breathing to you... But sometimes, when I was up there with you, playing, it was almost like I had it too. That feeling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack glances at Frank. He looks old, sitting on the tiny bench. Suddenly, Frank lifts his glass, eyes the tiny hotel rendered there.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(thinking)

	<DIALOGUE>
	'78... November.

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daughter. Sweet sixteen.

</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ, that's right. How could I forget. What a nightmare.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She asked for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told Halloran we didn't do vocals, but he said --

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She got it alright.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack and Frank glance at one another, little boy mischief glowing in their faces. Suddenly, they swivel on the pianos and begin to play "You're Sixteen".
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_AND_FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"She comes on like a dream Peaches and cream Lips like strawberry wine She's sixteen, she's beautiful and she's mine...

</JACK_AND_FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ribbons and curls Ooh, what a girl Eyes that sparkle and shine You're sixteen, you're beautiful and you're mine..."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As Jack and Frank finish, they're laughing. After a moment, their voices die and the room is quiet again. Full of ghosts. Each stares at the tiny keyboard before him, awkward with the intimacy of the moment. Is quiet for a very long time. Finally, Frank looks over.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... One more time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack glances up and sees that Frank has his empty glass held out. He picks up the bottle and pours.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One more time...

</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
