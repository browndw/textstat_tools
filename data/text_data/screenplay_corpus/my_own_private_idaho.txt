THE COUNTERMAN is on the phone.

Next to him is a particularly interesting YOUNG MAN on the cover of one of the magazines - a bright yellow background, jeans open two buttons on the top, shirtless wearing a black cowboy hat. This character is named SCOTT.

ACROSS THE AISLE ON ANOTHER SHELF IS ANOTHER COVER OF A MAGAZINE, AND ANOTHER YOUNG MAN ON THE COVER STARTS TO MOVE AND SPEAK, ADDRESSING SCOTT.

The desert in the daytime.

<DIRECTION>
MIKE enters the frame in front of a blue sky filled with white clouds. He has a Texaco gas station attendant's shirt on with a name tag that reads: BILL (not Mike, his name).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The clouds are puffy against a deep blue sky. The road is red. Purple mountains surround Mike on all sides far in the distance, ten miles away. Mike looks in front of him at a long stretch of road that disappears into the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike looks at his wristwatch on his arm. He times how long it takes to walk ten steps down the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ten seconds. He glances back at a duffel bag. The duffel bag falls over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike looks at the picturesque sights surrounding him. A wind sends a tumbleweed into the air. He takes ten steps back to his duffle bag and checks watch again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun is now setting.

<MIKE>

<DIRECTION>
THE ROAD HAS A DEFINITE FACE. TWO DISTANT CACTUS FOR EYES - A CLOUD SHADOW FOR A MOUTH, MOUNTAINS FOR HAIR.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Once you see it, even for a second, you remember it, and you better not forget it, you gotta remember people and who they are, right? Friends and enemies. You gotta remember the road and where it is too...

MIKE SUDDENLY LUNGES AT THE LITTLE RABBIT LISTENING TO HIS CHAT ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD, AND THE RABBIT RUNS FOR HIS LIFE.

<DIRECTION>
Mike thinks about the loneliness of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is nowhere. I'll bet that nobody is ever going to drive down this road. I'll be stuck here forever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Mike looks at the road stressfully. The road looks back. He looks at the road his eyes growing heavy. The road looks back...

Mikes yawns.

Mike looks like a backwoods character who fits into the terrain. Mike makes strange movements, like he is having a sort of epileptic fit, then yawns like he is very tired, again.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes I'll be in one place, and I'll close my eyes...

When Mike opens his eyes, he is in downtown PORTLAND, OREGON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LOUD BUS drives by Mike's view in the city. He is asleep, then wakes enough to see other UNKNOWN KIDS rifling his pockets in a doorway, as Mike sleepily looks on.
</DIRECTION>

	It's kind of like time travel. It's kind of good.

MIKE CLOSES HIS EYES AGAIN, AND WHEN HE OPENS THEM HE IS BACK IN THE COUNTRY. BUT THIS TIME A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TERRAIN. LIKE A LONG TIME HAS PASSED. HE IS ALSO WEARING DIFFERENT CLOTHES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE CHECKS HIS WATCH AGAIN. He looks happy at the passage of time.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. It's kind of good. Passes the time. Unwanted as it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE LEANS AGAINST THE DUFFLE BAG WITH HIM. HE LOOKS INTO THE FIELD next to him. The wind blows a paper cup into the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike watches the cup tumble in the air, and with a few notes, a GUITAR follows. Then an uprooted cactus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The paper cup, cactus and guitar lyrically trade places in the air, and are followed by a large barn, which twists and turns, then crashes directly into the middle of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the, road. Riding in the back of a pickup truck. Mike's shirt ruffles wildly in the wind, traveling at 60 mph.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the truck disappears into the sun, toward a steep mountain range.

Mike is walking down a LONELY ALLEYWAY in the city. ALL OF A SUDDEN he is surrounded by three BLACK BOYS, who are smiling and joking.

</BLACK_1>
<DIRECTION>
Mike fights with the guy for his sack. The Black cuts Mike's hands with his knife but Mike won't let go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In terror he watches his hands get cut, but he won't let go. Mike starts to yawns and does the jitters to the Black's amazement and drops to the ground. Scottie, the older boy on the magazine cover, comes to Mike's aid. He pushes the Black boy over, throws some trash cans in their direction.
</DIRECTION>
<BLACK_1>

We are in the city of Las Vegas in the daytime. (We are aware of this because one character, RAY, is reading the Las Vegas Chronicle.) Mike sleeps, as a shopkeeper washes his windows and three other street kids, Gary, Ray and Scottie, are hanging around on the corner with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary is hitting a public wastebasket with the end of a stick as a MAN in a MERCEDES BENZ drives by them very slowly, and looks at each one of the boys individually. Gary pauses for a moment and poses.

	No, you can't wake him... he...... but, what about me? Don't you want to talk with me?

The man is not interested in talking to Gary. He shakes his head no, bothered by Gary.

</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
VIEW of Mike's sleeping face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE OF MIKE'S thoughts. He is flying over the city streets, above the Mercedes Benz, effortlessly hovering and gilding above it, between the buildings. Like a bird.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike wakes and looks at Scottie, who is talking to Gary.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE_S_THOUGHTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The first time I met Scott, I had a feeling he was a sort of comic book hero. He was always saying the right thing at the right moment, and standing up for me when there was no reason to. Look at his face now, when the sunlight shines off his lower lip, like it is the face of some sort of statue. Strong and soft at the same time. I never could figure out what Scott was doing here with us on the street in the first place, like he was on some sort of crusade, to help the poor. Because he really did come from a rich Portland family. I know because he brought me to his house one day and showed me around. I mean, wow, they were rich I They even had a swimming pool. Scott's the only kid that I had ever met that had a swimming pool. I'd make a bet with anybody right now, that Scott is a saint or a hero, or some such higher placed person.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE_S_THOUGHTS>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile... Gary and Ray are talking. Ray, who is a Chicano street kid, is looking poetically off into the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father was a gaucho. But nobody gonna find him. He killed a guy and split. Nobody gonna find that fuck. I never gonna find him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Ray spits into the gutter and the spit drifts in a small stream made by the shop-owner who was washing his windows, down the street and into drainage grating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
View of MIKE as he closes his eyes, oblivious to what is going on around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music in a DISCO blares, at night, and all we can see is Mike's face, sleeping. The disco MUSIC STOPS, and the lights go up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A broom passes by Mike's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, THE MANAGER'S SHOES appear at his head.
</DIRECTION>
<MANAGER>

<DIRECTION>
Mike wakes up in a WARD ROOM BED in the daytime.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around him. The room has a lot of light, windows practically on all sides of the room. There are other DETOX men and women in other beds. Mike gets up and starts to walk out, but he is wearing a gown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A nurse stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me. Are you all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I'm fine.

<DIRECTION>
(Mike looks around the room.)
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you're going to leave us, it's okay, but we need you to sign out, and you'll need to get your clothes from downstairs.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he pauses and looks around the place.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you live here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why... no. But sometimes I feel like I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
The nurse walks him over to a clipboard on a desk. Mike signs the board, and she gives him a receipt.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Just a receipt. if you don't want it. You can throw it away. That's what most people do with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Then we cut to Mike's face at night. As his eyes open he takes a look around him, a little dazed, trying to figure where he is. We see he is under a store awning. A lot of fog is rolling across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A twenty-eight-year-old woman stops in a Mercedes Benz sedan, similar to the one that the German man was driving. She motions Mike to get inside the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dazed, Mike looks at the car, then responds.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Mike begins to caress her arm.

They watch her go.

</SCOTTIE>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.

Mike looks around the room. Gary leans closer to Mike.

<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, did you get into that Van Halen concert last night?

</GARY>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Interior of the Woman's bedroom. Mike undresses. He waits by the side of the bed and takes a last drag on a cigarette and puts it out. Then the woman arrives. lets down her negligee and approaches Mike like an EARTH MOTHER, slowly, big breasted, warm, comforting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she approaches, Mike begins to see a familiar face. He is upset when he looks into her eyes. And he begins to spasmodically shake then he grows sleepy, and finally, as she is upon him, he passes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside, Gary and Scottie struggle with Mike's body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They plop Mike down on the corner, under a streetlight, fold his arms under his stomach and bend him over so he is sitting up against the light pole.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
(putting money into his pocket)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He always does this! I'm surprised he makes money at all.

</SCOTT>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scared the shit out of her. What causes it. Sex?

</GARY>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>

</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Silence for a second.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are we going to take him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
Scott lifts Mike's body up and carries him to a soft carpet of grass on the edge of a lawn. Scott looks around to see if it is okay. Then he speaks to Mike even though he is asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, little brother. You stay here, and when you wake up, Just come back into town. I'll be there waiting for you. I figure you're going to be safer here in this comfy neighborhood than in the city. I grew up in a neighborhood like this. It'll be safe here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Scottie hides a tear. Then he takes his Jacket off and puts it over Mike, then leaves him there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike's face is lying down with his nose pressed against a leafy ground in the daytime.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wakes up, stands, makes his way up a slope and out to the street. He brushes himself off as the Mercedes Benz shows up again. Mike recognizes it, and walks up to the window of the car. It is the MAN, though, not the lady. The Man speaks with a German accent - and he is about 35 years old. HIS NAME IS HANS.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>

Mike doesn't respond, and walks on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pauses a moment, and looks at the houses in the neighborhood. He looks down the street and can see Hans stopped in his car. The guy gets out, and leans against the car.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This guy is a pervert. I can tell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
To Hans:
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go home!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
THE HOUSES LINE THE STREET, EACH WITH A LITTLE CALIFORNIA STYLE GARDEN. MIKE CAN SEE ALL THE ROOFS OF THE HOUSES LIFT OFF, AND THE FURNITURE INSIDE EACH HOUSE FLY OUT AND CIRCLE IN THE AIR. MIKE GETS THE JITTERS AND PASSES OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MERCEDES BENZ PULLS UP NEXT TO HIS HEAD, WHICH IS NOW ON THE GROUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PORtLAnd
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When Mike wakes up he is in Scottie's arms. They sit under a statue in a park. The statue is of two Indians pointing out across the horizon, and on the base of the statue is written: The Coming of the White Man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike looks at Scott and then at the new surroundings. At the Broadway Cafe Mike bites into a hamburger.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd we get home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That German guy. Hans. He brought you downtown, you were passed out. He said he was heading to Portland, so I asked him for a ride.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't remember any German guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. You were sleeping.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much do you make off me while I'm sleeping?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a ride, Mike. I don't make anything. What, you think that I sell your body while you are asleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Scott sips from a coffee cup.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Mike. I'm on your side.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
He puts down the cup. Mike knows Scottie always tells the truth. Mike is a little embarrassed, that he has maybe offended Scott's honor.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was Just kidding, dude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gary's up here somewhere. He left three days ago, he flew up with some John.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exotic. Have you seen your dad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you kidding?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd visit my dad, if he was here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to take care of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about your mom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That lady. She looked like. My mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that why you passed out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I mean. I don't know. She really looked like my mother. I must have been imagining things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
A pause.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Broadway Cafe is beginning to pick up in business. The table where Scott and Mike sit is in front of a large window, and it is semi-circular in shape. Scottie spies Gary across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He bounds up out of his chair and Mike watches him as he goes to the door, kicks it open and yells to Gary.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HEY' You dick!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Gary sees Scott and runs across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Later in the BROADWAY CAFE, there are other street kids hanging around the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott has his arm around a girl named DENISE, who has a lot of make up on and long stringy hair and who carries a teddy bear. Denise is crying and Scott is consoling her.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE_S_THOUGHTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was almost as if Scott was on some sort of crusade or mission, when you checked him out. He could make you feel good right at the very time that you felt so bad. I remember there were many times that I had been sobbing in Scott's arms and he was helping me out too. He was the great protector of us all, and the great planner. He gave us hope in the future. Even though there was no future. There must have been real trouble at home, though, for Scott not to want to visit his father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE_S_THOUGHTS>
<DIRECTION>
Scott strokes Denise's hair adoringly and gives her a kiss every now and then.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike looks across the table at CARL, a skinny kid with black hair and a large floppy sports cap, and GARY, who is talking with him.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE_S_THOUGHTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Carl. He's always around the Broadway, he didn't run away from home like a lot of these kids did. He had a mom, and no dad, at least they didn't know where he was. And one day, he came home to the apartment where they lived, and there was no mom anymore either. He didn't know where she went. That was sir months ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE_S_THOUGHTS>
<DIRECTION>
MARY, an older, wiser street prostitute who is chain smoking Kool cigarettes.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE_S_THOUGHTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Mary over there. She was a mean old chick. She was maybe thirty now. Old, old. Somebody once told me that in the past, Mary had this enemy, a chick that had turned her in. And Mary had gone off and kicked this chick to death right in the street in front of everybody. I don't know if it's true, but I watched out, Just in case. I was afraid of Mary. And everyone else was too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE_S_THOUGHTS>
<DIRECTION>
Mary takes a drag from her cigarette and blows smoke in Mike's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scott notices this. But he attends to Denise's problems.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE'S THOUGHTS (as he coughs) This was our little round table, a point around which everything else revolved. It was our "center." It was like our home. Our living room. Not everyone was the best of friends, but everyone knew everyone else, and we kind of stuck together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike on the street. He watches as a man carrying a large bag of tin cans, crosses at a crosswalk. Mike steps up to him and begins walking. His name is MARTY.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Marty. What's goin' on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<MARTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that you Mike? Hey, what's new with you? You look pretty good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTY>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many you got so far today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<MARTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I reckon that I picked up about twenty-three bucks so far with these cans, and some I got stashed back in the bushes. You know the old hiding place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTY>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<MARTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tell anybody, though. Just between you and me. You need a place to stay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTY>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I always need a place to stay, dude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<MARTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, I'm under the bridge. You can Join me if you like.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTY>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I think I'll rooftop it tonight. I'm hanging with a friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<MARTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I walking too fast for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTY>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, but I'll see you around. See
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
you under the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Mike.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Mike stops walking with the guy and he splits down the street at a fast clip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the BROADWAY CAFE, Mike smokes a cigarette at the round table and watches Gary and Carl playing keepaway with Denise's teddy bear. Denise is swearing, using profanities that are unusual for a girl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Night. Mike walks through a dark wet troubled inner-city alley and on the other side, there is a parked car. In the car sits a man in his 40's, bestial, good looking but overweight. He beeps his car horn at Mike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike pauses, lights a cigarette coolly and walks to the car and leans in the window.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey - what's up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL, nighttime.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man is naked in the background standing In front of a mirror in a motel bathroom, as Mike sits naked on a bed in front of a t.v. set laughing at the show that is on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see various still compositions of the two making love.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Afield. Day. Two figures cross the field. One is Bob Pigeon, a man in his fifties, and the other, his manservant, Budd. Because of his girth, Bob has problems crossing the field.
</DIRECTION>
<BUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus. ..the things we've seen... do you remember a thing since we moved from graffiti bridge?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDD>
<BOB>

	No more of that, Budd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<BUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha-ha, what a crazy night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDD>
<DIRECTION>
Above the two walking figures, Gary wakes near a heating duct atop a ten story building. He yawns, looks down at the street and spies Bob and Budd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GARY'S VIEW: a tiny Bob and Budd are making their way across a field.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Scottie, here comes that fat pig himself!!! He owes me money!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
Scottie, atop an adjacent building peeks his head over the edge. The two guys are relatively close to one another but far from the street.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, the fat one... Pigeon!

<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He stole my shoes, the dick!
	</DIALOGUE>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, everybody, here comes Bob the chiseler!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He yells to the other buildings and other street kids to wake up. Scottie pours an old paper cup of Coca-Cola over Bob and Budd below.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look out, it's raining Coke!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
Bob hears the show atop the buildings.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, I think my friends can see I am back from Boise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<DIRECTION>
Bob looks worried and happy at the same time, not knowing if they are friend or foe. He shields himself from the Coke sprinkles.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you see any clouds in the sky, Budd?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<BUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>

</BUDD>
<DIRECTION>
The Derelict Hotel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Budd and Bob enter the threshold of a busted up but operating hotel. There is a fire in a trashcan turned upside down, with holes poked in it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Budd looks around the hotel.

<BUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>

<BUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDD>
<DIRECTION>
THE TWO sit at a larger fire deeper into the derelict hotel.
</DIRECTION>
<BUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember her daughter, she died years ago... of old age. She must be old, all right. That was before I came to Clements Inn.

<BUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That we have, that we have... in fact Bob, we have. Jesus... the things that we've seen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDD>
<DIRECTION>
Scott drinks from a beer can inside the derelict hotel, tosses it to a young boy, laughs, wipes his mouth and puts his lit cigarette into the mouth of Gary, making his way to some steps, through a circle of girls, kisses Denise, who we remember from the Broadway Cafe, and charges up the steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the hotel on a staircase landing, Scottie passes a couple of figures, one is asleep and one is awake.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Bob?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<A_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fast asleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</A_BOY>
<BUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he's snoring like a horse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDD>
<DIRECTION>
SCOTTIE OPENS A DOOR AT THE TOP OF THE STEPS AND WALKS INTO A ROOM, INTERRUPTING MIKE, WHO STANDS OVER BOB'S SNORING BODY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike coolly holds up a wad of bills and a folded envelope of cocaine.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I picked his pocket.

</MIKE>
<SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you get, dude?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Scottie takes the cocaine from him, sits down at the foot of the bed and begins to unfold the packet. Bob turns in the bed and the rush of air from the sheets blows the white powder out of the packet.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Mike laughs.

<SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
(climbing in bed with Bob)
</DIRECTION>

</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
Bob, dazed, is looking around himself, like he is being had.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
(amusing Mike)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, you wouldn't even look at a clock, unless hours were lines of coke, dials looked like the signs of gay bars, or time itself was a fair hustler in black leather... isn't that right, dude?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
Bob staggers out of bed retching and spitting. Then back into his waking stupor, feeling something is being put over on him.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no reason to know the time. We are timeless.

</SCOTT>

<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you forgetting, Scottie my boy, [A GOVERNOR'S SON], that we who steal, do so at midnight?

Bob's money and cocaine are gone. Bob turns angry and bellows.

LAUGHTER from the throngs of outcasts. Jane enters a balcony overlook of the main hall. Mike and Scott enter, arms around each other, laughing.

<JANE>

	It's impossible to board a dozen or so men and women who live honestly and have the others live like Junkies.

One of the dwellers listening to the argument is shooting up as they speak. We see a close view of the needle and Bob running around in the background.

Bob makes his way next to Scott.

	Very early tomorrow morning, there will be small time rock and roll promoters coming back from their show. Every night, they walk home with the loot and they stop by the Grotto Bar, one mile away from here, and more often than not they've been drinking already.

	<DIALOGUE>
	When I turn twenty-one, I don't want any more of this life. My mother and father will be surprised at the incredible change. It will impress them more when such a fuck up like me turns good than if I had been a good son all along. All the past years I will think of as one big vacation. At least it wasn't as boring as schoolwork. All my bad behavior I'm going to throw away to pay my debt. I will change when everybody expects it the least.

Scott turns and leaves.

Scott laughs to himself, because he knows Bob is misunderstanding him. Bob is part of the past life that he says he is going to throw away.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! You will be the hatchet man, Bob, that will be your job, and so there will rarely be a job hatcheted. It will be one big endless party, won't it?

Public bathroom. Night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mike empties the contents of his pockets at a bathroom sink. He has in his possession: One condom. One comb with blond hair stuck in it. One nickel. Half a stick of gum. One knife with the letter W stamped on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He arranges these things in a neat order on the surface of the sink while a man flushes a toilet in the background and uses another sink. Mike is quite at home here. He takes his time arranging the articles, and washing his hands. He looks over at the man washing his hands and gives him a friendly smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man leaves. Mike puts all the things on the sink into his pockets. Then he walks over to a urinal, unzips his fly and starts to take a leak. A shadow opens the door in back of him, and without turning around, Mike senses the presence of a man.

	Aha! One move and I'll blow you away, you sully scumbags, up against that wall!

Mike and Scottie, disguised, jump out with large silver baseball bats, swinging them and making as much noise as they can, knocking over a set of garbage cans, flashing flashlights into Bob and the others' eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frightened, Bob drops the lockbox and runs, the others follow, Mike and Scottie hitting them with the bats as they go.

<BOB>

Mike swings the bat at Bob, it grazes the side of a building and sparks fly from it. Bob wheezes from the run.

Scottie chases the others in the same direction.
