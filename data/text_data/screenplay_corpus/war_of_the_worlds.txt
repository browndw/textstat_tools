Beyond him we now see the Martian machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. GULLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Favoring the first machine, filling the SCREEN. Squat- ting on its incandescent beam-legs, the hooded shaft tilted forward. There is a moment -- then a magenta- tinted heat-ray SCREAMS from it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. REVETMENT - EXTREME HEAD CLOSEUP - SYLVIA
</DIRECTION>

She SCREAMS, but her voice is drowned in the unearthly SOUND of the Martian machine. We know, without seeing, what has happened to the Pastor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. GULLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VIEWPOINT from the command post revetment. The first machine rises swiftly to full height, gliding forward. The second clears the gully. The top of a third machine appears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. GULLY & ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The base of the Martian machine's locomotor beam-leg. Featuring, in f.g., the Pastor's cross, partly melted. The glittering foot of the beam moves into SCENE, leaving behind it molten rock and smoke. As it passes, the intense heat it gives off acts like a blowtorch on the terrain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. REVETMENT - MED. CLOSE SHOT
</DIRECTION>

SHOOTING from outside the observation opening. Sylvia is CLOSE in f.g., horrified, unbelieving, supported by Clayton. The Colonel whirls toward the switchboard.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The big guns of the tanks slam shells toward the gully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: SPECIAL EFFECT - MARTIAN MACHINE & SHELL BURSTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shells burst close to the Martian machine. Instantly a beam -- different from the heat-ray -- strikes out with a vicious, high-pitched DRUMMING SOUND. The beam is electric-blue with a greenish tinge. Edges soft, powdery. Fast, projectile-like discharges race down its core, like a succession of balls, a deeper blue- green. Beam and impulses are transparent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. HILLSIDE - TANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beam hits a tank. The tank changes color instan- taneously. It turns bone yellow, then thins into an oyster-white skeleton shape that is an echo of death itself. The beam cuts off and the tank dissolves into fine dust, the color of the beam, and blows away on the breeze. Making pallid streamers in the early morning light.

:SC: QUICK CUTS & FLASHES - BATTLE (1)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The initial phase between man's weapons and the Martian machines. The first Martian is out of the gully on the burned-off field. The second is just clear of the gully. The third has started to follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a. Special Effect - Full Shot - Gully. Increasing shell and rocket fire bursting viciously about the Martians. Short, blue jets are flashing out around the turret heads of the machines. These merge to form an impalpable, electro- magnetic envelope which drops all around to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
b. Special Effect - Close Shot - First Machine. Rays SCREAM from it, lashing in every direction.
</DIRECTION>

c. Recoilless 75's - Close Shot. Muzzles Flash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
d. Rocket-launcher - Close Shot. In rapid suc- cession, rockets roar toward the Martians.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
e. Tank - Med. Shot. It's gun bucks violently slamming an armor-piercing shell at the Mar- tians.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
f. Machine-gun Nest - Close Shot. 50 cal. machine- gun chatters furiously, spitting a stream of tracer shells.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
g. Bazookas - Close Shot. In a sharp volley, a group of bazookas let go with HE charges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
h. Mortars - Close Shot. In rapid succession, Marines drop Napalm charges into the big muz- zles of the mortars. Instantly the charges fly high in the air in the direction of the enemy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
i. Special Effect - Martian Machines. Projectiles burst against their almost invisible protective envelopes. Others ricochet off, exploding harm- lessly in the air beyond. Napalm charges burst around them, obscuring the machines in huge balls of searing, orange fire and black smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
j. Special Effect - First Machine - Close Shot. The flame of the Napalm clears. The machine is undamaged. Rays slash from it, SCREAMING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
k. Special Effect - Second & Third Machines - Close Shot. Flames and smoke clear. They lash rays in every direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
l. Special Effect - Rocket-launcher - Close Shot. Hit by a heat-ray. The launcher and crew glow white hot. Become a pile of ashes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
m. Special Effect - First Machine - Close Shot. DRUMMING horribly, the blue-green disintegrating beam darts forth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
n. Special Effect - Mortars - Med. Close Shot. Hit by the skeletonizing beam. They literally disintegrate - cease to exist. Men and machines become a vapor of blue-green dust.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The destruction of man's weapons by the Martians, and the beginning of man's retreat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a. Special Effect - Ext. Gully & Command Post Revetment - Full Shot. A COMPOSITE SHOT of the entire battle. One Martian machine on a hill slope. The two others below. Rays and beams lashing out. Shells and rockets and Napalm exploding about them. Tanks scuttling about. Rays hit them. Machine-gunners and troops abandon their stations, leaving their weapons. Half-tracks, trucks, weapons-carriers, jeeps pull out. Pandemonium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
b. Special Effect - Martian Machines - Med. Shot. Smoke and fire clearing. Explosions about them diminish. They redouble the activity of their rays and beams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
c. Special Effect - Battlefield - Med. Full Shot. Gray ash on a blackened road - the residue of tanks. Men, jeeps, equipment flee past, es- caping. Rays and beams reach after them.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. REVETMENT - MED FULL SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parked jeeps, General Mann's car, a few Marines, the Red Cross truck. The heat-ray slashes through them, hits the revetment and swings away. Men fall in ashes, jeeps glow and burn, the Red Cross truck and General Mann's car are singed and blazing. The huge tarp stretched over the revetment blazes.

The inclosure is a madhouse - men trying to extinguish burning switchboards - the lieutenant gathering up the scorched maps - the captain shouting uselessly into the field phone - Clayton up by the opening using the field glasses, Sylvia and the Sheriff crouched near him.

He is in EXTREME CLOSEUP, shouting. The red heat-ray seems to envelope him in a blaze of color, SCREAMING. Suddenly the SCREEN explodes into deadly blue-green - the disintegrating beam! The Colonel's shout is frozen on his lips. The skeletal structure of his head glows incandescent -- greenish-white -- through the flesh of his face. In an instant he vanishes into a shred of blue-green vapor which swirls and is lost in the ruddy flames of the ray.

Ducked low, taut, terrified. He sneaks a look over the edge, then flings himself down with Sylvia again. There is the SOUND of the horrible DRUMMING of the disintegrating beam, which quickly flickers out, mark- ing the destruction of the Piper Cub. Their faces are lit blue-green. Then, down into the ditch, the eerie vapor of unglued atom flows, incandescent, swirling in the breeze.
</DIRECTION>

Clayton and Sylvia begin to stir. The CRACKLING of HIGH FREQUENCY ELECTRICITY from the machine's loco- motor mechanism grows louder - it's coming for them! Clayton grabs Sylvia, half-dragging, half-carrying her back along the ditch. He pushes her behind a pile of broken irrigation pipe, falls across her. The CRACKLING swells to a ROAR of SPARKS. Where they had just lain, the glittering, flickering base of a beam-leg dips down into the ditch, moves across and up the other bank, leaving a smoking path of fused rock and debris.

They're thick from Cherbourg across Belgium, Holland. The Italian boot is blacked out near Rome. Dark patches are in Greece, Yugo- slavia.

The mouth of the vehicular tunnel is on the slope of a high ridge, about halfway up to the summit, so that a view from the tunnel itself is one of sky only.

He falls. The car clatters on. Clayton gets up off the road and begins to run again. Two more cars come past CAMERA and race by him, over- loaded, driven recklessly.

Clayton dog-trots into scene. It is beginning to get dark. We see debris from a hasty road-block placed by a mob - chairs, settee, furniture dragged out of a nearby store. To the side of the road is one of the pickups from Pacific-Tech, distinguished by its color, overturned, its load spilled, wheels buckled, jammed between a telephone pole and shop front. Strewn on the road are piles of papers, books, files and instruments thrown off the other Pacific-Tech vehicles. Clayton stares around, sees something and hurries to pick up a yellow board: SCHOOL BUS - Southridge. He holds it, looking around. The road is scattered with baggage thrown off the little bus. A car streaks past, heavily laden and going fast. Three bicyclists follow, pedaling hard, possessions tied all over themselves and their machines. One wobbles, but recovers. Clayton starts forward, hesitates, still holding the yellow board.

The congregation is a scattered gathering of distressed humanity. Those who couldn't run - children, cripples, the sick, aged - and those who felt it was useless to run. They make groups and clusters in the aisles and benches and pews. The church is full of quiet movement - first-aid for the injured, water for the faint, comforting children, soothing babies.

As the words of the ancient hymn swell OVERSCENE from a myriad throats, bells begin to peal through the smoke and ruin of the devastated city.

:SC: EXT. STREET & CHURCH - CROWD (MOVING SHOT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some singing. Some in silent prayer. Some in silent ecstasy. The young husband hugging his kids. An old woman all alone, singing softly with the others, eyes turned to heaven. They start to move toward the church. CAMERA PICKS UP IN CLOSE SHOT, Clayton and Sylvia. She is radiant. He smiles, holding her gaze as he takes off his glasses, folds them and puts them in his pocket, bending to her. She takes his arm, smiling up at him. They move after the crowd. She starts to sing as they go.

:SC: SPECIAL EFFECT - EXT. STREET & CITY BEYOND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA SHOOTING DOWN into the street as the crowd moves toward the church. Almost unconsciously, people have formed a lane, along which the small figures of Clayton and Sylvia walk. CAMERA PANS UP the facade of the church to the belfry, where bells begin to ring out, joining the chorus of SOUND from the VOICES and other belfrys. CAMERA PANS ACROSS burned, smoking buildings to an untouched sector of the city - CROSSING other belfrys with their ringing BELLS. A dawn sun is rising beyond rooftops as the SINGING VOICES end in a great "AMEN."

<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.

THE END
