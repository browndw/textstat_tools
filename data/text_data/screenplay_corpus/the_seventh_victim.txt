:SC: THE SEVENTH VICTIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The RKO TITLE and CREDITS are SUPERIMPOSED over a tall stained glass window as shown from the inside of a building. There are two maidenly figures worked into the stained glass window: one, older and slightly taller, dressed in van colored garments, leads by the hand a younger and smaller girl, dressed in a simple flowing, white robe. Through the lighter colored pieces of glass in the window the branches of a tree can be seen stirring in a light wind.

The last credit FADES from the screen.

The CAMERA HOLDS ON the stained glass window. Beneath the painted figures is a scroll, and on the scroll, a part of the stained glass window, is an inscription:

These classroom sounds, although they can be heard clearly, should not disturb the serenity of the stairway or of the painted figures on which the CAMERA IS LEVELED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, from overhead, a gong rings with a harsh, jarring noise. Doors are heard opening, feet scuffling over the floor and the light, high sound of girls' voices chattering. A moment later a cascade of uniformed schoolgirls of all ages pours down the stairs past the camera. Against this tide one single girl makes her way.

The CAMERA PANS WITH her up the remainder of the short flight of stairs and across the hallway to a door marked, PRINCIPAL. The girl knocks and from inside an over-cultured woman's voice is heard in response,

CLOSE SHOT - Mary Gibson at the door. She hesitates before opening it. She is young and her youth gives her prettiness, but something in the quiet serenity of her face and the clear candor of the eyes show the innate niceness of the girl; a quality of character which will give her real beauty as she grows older. At the moment she is somewhat perplexed by her unexpected summons by the Head Mistress.

MED. CLOSE SHOT of Mary as she opens the door and looks expectantly toward the desk. No one is there.

</MRS_LOW0OD_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
MED. LONG SHOT as Mary walks into the room. It is a large room and every effort has been made to invest it with authority. A large Sheraton desk with side trays stands at one end. On the wall behind this desk hangs a gloomy, dour visaged portrait of the founder of the school. The wall opposite the door is pierced by a large window. There are several bookcases with dull-looking volumes; books of reference and encyclopedia. On top of one of these cases is the white, plaster head of Athena. The walls are covered with enormous framed, sepia-tinted prints of the Acropolis, the Colosseum, Trajan's Column and other celebrated ruins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Lowood, the Principal, a solidly built lady with iron gray hair and her assistant, Miss Gilcrist, a slim, frail lady of indeterminate age, are at a small table at the end of the room. They are cutting out paper hearts. As Mary comes up to them, Mrs. Lowood finishes cutting out a paper heart and lays down the scissors with an air of satisfaction. With Mary close behind her, she starts toward the desk. Miss Gilcrist follows. The CAMERA PANS WITH them as they cross the room.

Mrs. Lowood has reached her desk, while Mary stands wondering what might come next. Mrs. Lowood deliberately seats herself and puts her fingertips together firmly. Over this Gothic arch she speaks to Mary. Miss Gilcrist takes her accustomed place beside her.

Mary smiles. In the distance some young girl's fingers falter awkwardly over the melancholy chords of Traumerei. Mary reaches the bottom of the stairway and passes the big, fumed oak grandfather's clock which stands with majestic infinity of time, reminding all tardy students that it is later than they know. As she passes it, it rings the hour. She looks at its friendly, familiar face, and gives it a little pat of farewell. O.S. we hear a sweeping girl's voice reciting the final verse of "The Chambered Nautilus."

MED. CLOSEUP of a column of white powder falling from an oscillating sifter. The powder falls into a large barrel, but the column of powder and its attendant dust hide from view the three figures behind it. We hear the throaty voice of Mrs. Redi.

<MRS_REDI_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_REDI_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
There is a click as the apparatus is turned off. The powder stops falling. Three people are disclosed. Mary, still in her travelling suit; Mrs. Redi, a neat, businesslike woman, with firm features and a steady eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her hair is extremely well coifed. Not a strand is out of place. Her clothes are covered by a long, white surgeon' s coat of immaculate linen. The third person is a workman, dressed in a white smock and wearing a long, snouted, inhalator mask, which he removes, revealing a benign and smiling face.

Mrs. Redi rubs a bit of the powder on the palm of her hand. She examines it critically.

<MRS_REDI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your sister had many friends - but they were not my friends. I was only the manager of her plant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_REDI>
<DIRECTION>
She sets down the bottle and they move on. The CAMERA GOES WITH them. Mary, embarrassed, looks at her. They have reached a machine which pours luke-warm cleansing cream into great jars. As one of the jars slides out from the machine, Mrs. Redi picks it up, rubs a bit of cream from the top of the jar onto the back of her hand, and judges the rapidity with which the cream dissolves at body temperature. Evidently it meets with her approval, for she passes on and goes toward her office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mary goes with her. At the door they stop a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
8Mary and Mrs. Redi come into the salon. Beauty operators are at work on patrons in several of the booths. The modernistic glass walls, some patterned with stripes, the mirrors, and the gleaming gadgets make of this ordinary room a rather fantastic and distorted place.

It is a narrow, gloomy passage. The two girls come into it from the side door. Frances fishes a package of cigarettes from her pocket, takes one, lights it as she speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>

EXT DISPLAY WINDOW & SIDE ENTRANCE - LA JEUNESSE COSMETICS, INC.- DAY
</DIRECTION>

Mary comes out of the side entrance and passes the display window. She looks up for a moment at the words "La Jeunesse" and at the peculiar trade-mark of the company. It is on this peculiar trade-mark, a geometric figure, that the scene

EXT.STREET CORNER - PEARY STREET - GREENWICH VILLAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is after three o'clock, and the street is alive with children. A covey of them flash past on roller skates, tailed by one poor urchin with only one skate, who strives desperately to keep up with the tail end of the procession. Mary, coming around the corner, has to draw back half a step to got out of his way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A horse-drawn laundry truck stands at the curb on the opposite side of the street, and a man is busily lifting down bundles of soiled wash. On the other side Of the street is the Dante. It is an Italian restaurant, a half-flight below the street level. The name and the word "Restaurant" are written on the glass in gold letters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the lower left hand corner of the window is a cardboard sign, hand-lettered to read "Rooms for Rent". Above the doorway is a poly-chrome bust of Dante. Mary crosses the street to enter the Dante. A young man, Jason Hoag, comes around the corner. He is a man about thirty-five years old, and rather poorly dressed in an ordinary business suit and trench coat Under one arm he carries a load of books. He stops and looks at Mary with interest. She continues on, going down the steps, under the Dante statue, and into the restaurant. Jason looks after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT DINING ROOM - DANTE RESTAURANT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a fairly good-sized room, with benches along the walls and many small tables. Along one wall is a crudely painted mural, a reproduction of the famous painting which shows Dante's first meeting with Beatrice. Dante is passing along the cobbled street, and Beatrice, with two companions, large, flourishing wenches, is casting him a coy look over her shoulder in passing. Directly under the feet of the poet is a small table for one patron. On a back counter stands an enormous, shining metal coffee machine. This is a patented contraption for making coffee. The entire machine is contrived to serve only one small purpose - to make a cup of coffee by driving steam through ground coffee. Near this machine and flanking the door into the kitchen are fake palms in wooden tubs. There is a door leading to the house hallway, and through this door we can see the newel post of the stairway leading to the rooms above. On most of the tables, platters of antipasto have been arranged in readiness for the dinner hour. When Mary enters, the restaurant is empty, but echoes to the sound of a rich female voice singing with great sentimental emphasis the words of "Care Mio Ben." Mary looks around, hesitates a moment, and then starts toward the back of the restaurant, as if following the source of the singing. At the swinging door which separates the restaurant from the kitchen Mary hesitates a moment, then knocks timidly. The singing continues, and realizing that her knock will not be heard above it, Mary shyly pushes open the door.

INT. KITCHEN - DANTE RESTAURANT - DAY

This is a cluttered, busy, steaming kitchen. In one corner at a little table Mr. Romari, the proprietor, in a waiter's uniform, is busily folding napkins. Mrs. Romari herself from whose bosom come the sounds of

<DIRECTION>
"Caro Mio Ben," can be seen through a cloud of steam behind a boiling, kettle of spaghetti. She is a tall, gracious Italian of sentiment and humor. Her pet pigeon in close attendance at her feet. This bird follows her wherever she goes, hopping about the floor at her heels. As Mrs. Romari wants to lift a kettle of spaghetti from the stove and carry it to a center table, she softly kicks the pigeon out on her way with a practiced backward sweep of her slippered foot. Her turn brings her face to face with Mary as she enters. Both the Romaris look at her questioningly.

INT. UPPER HALLWAY - DAUTE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mary and the Romaris. It is a bleak hallway with a narrow strip of worn carpet running down the exact middle of the floor space. A picture of St. Francis of Assisi, surrounded by fluttering white birds, hangs on the wall, a little bit askew. Mrs. Romari and Mary stand near the stairway railing, with the pigeon in close attendance on Mrs. Romari. Romari, with a toolbox at his feet, is at the door, on which is the number "7". He has taken off the bottom hinge and is now striking a last few blows to remove the pin from the top hinge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he works, a girl - Mimi - crosses in the background from one hallway door to another. She is a tall, thin blonde and is wearing a faded bathrobe. She has a handkerchief over her lips, and is coughing dismally. She closes the door behind her.

INT. JACQUELINE'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA IS SHOOTING OVER the shoulders and PAST the half lost profiles of Mary and the Romaris, as they look into the room. It is a room that is empty except for two objects. From a pipe overhead is suspended a hangman's noose and beneath it stands a little gilt chair. There is nothing else.

MED. SHOT of Jason Hoag. He is standing shyly beside the coffee machine while Mr. Romari draws a cup of the coffee. Jason watches Romari while he pulls the various levers, releases the clouds of steam and finally pulls out the little demi-tass and puts it on a little tray. While Jason watches, he listens to conversation going on nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<POLICEMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tell you, young lady, when a thing like this comes up, you've got to go to the police. What do you think people pay taxes for? I ain't just to keep us chasing after crooks and regulating traffic. We're supposed to help everybody. You gotto go to the police about your sister, Miss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLICEMAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Romari starts out of scene with the little cup of coffee. The CAMERA PANS with him as he brings the coffee to Mary who is seated with Mrs. Romari at one of the tables under the mural. A policeman stands beside them. The policeman is in a heavy blue sweater, with his coat over his arm, his uniform cap on the back of his belt and all the metal weight of his impedimenta can be seen hanging from his belt, handcuffs, revolver, billy, etc. Jason comes hesitantly into the scene. He addresses the policeman.

FULL SHOT. A long counter divides the room in half. On one side are the filing cabinets, records, and office equipment used by the policemen who service this heartbreak house. Behind the desk, protected by steel wickets, sit half a dozen policemen taking down dates.
</DIRECTION>

CAMERA DOLLIES SLOWLY FORWARD parallel to the counter. As it moves along, we hear the voice of the petitioners describing their loved ones. The same flat, unemotional professional voice seems to ask the routine questions at each of the different wickets.

<DIRECTION>
Mary starts to sign.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE - on the other side of the wicket. Two men stand in the f.g., but not together. In the b.g. we see Mary's back as she signs the police report. The man in the center is Paul Radeau, a big man with iron-gray hair. He appears entirely oblivious of everything around him. The second man is Irving August, a skip-trace artist. His derby is dulled by the mists of many winters, and his dark eyes are fastened upon Mary. It is obvious that he has been listening as she made out her report. Mary finishes signing the report and turns away from the wicket. She takes scarcely more than a single step when she finds herself confronted by Irving August, who smiles at her.
</DIRECTION>
<AUGUST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Irving August, private investigator. I think I can help you. Here's my card.

	Lady, this kind of work costs money. I got to cover all the hospitals, the morgue - that's the first place you got to go and it ain't pleasant - the morgue -
	</DIALOGUE>
</AUGUST>
<DIRECTION>
He finishes his speech by shaking his head. Mary turns away and goes out of scene. August is standing, staring disgustedly after her when a hand touches him on the shoulder and he turns to face Paul Radeau.
</DIRECTION>
<RADEAU>

	You know who I am, August?

	Okay, Mr. Radeau, it's forgot.

Radeau nods appreciatively and goes ponderously away. Irving August watches him go, his eyes sharp with avarice and suspicion. With quick steps, August crosses to the wicket where Mary had given her report.

EXT. BELLEVUE HOSPITAL MOHMJE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bulwarks and gangplank are in the f.g. The street and wharf at river level. Beyond that there are the sidewalk and the two doors leading into the morgue. The river is not seen, although the sound of tugboat and barge whistles comes o.s. The street and sidewalk are wet, as if a drizzling rain had recently fallen, One of these doors is open and from it comes a procession of dock workers carrying cheap pine coffins. The other door is closed, Above both doors are printed the words:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW YORK CITY MORGUE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over the door from which the pine boxes are being taken is another legend carved into the stone:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HE CALLETH ALL HIS CHILDREN BY THEIR NAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of the second door Mary emerges. Her face is white and drawn. With a shudder she wraps her coat about her and starts walking, bracing herself against the fresh, cold gusts of wind blowing from the river. A barge whistle sounds o.s. dismally.

	People who commit suicide don't talk about it. That room made her happy in some strange way I couldn't understand. She lived in a world of her own fancy. She didn't always tell the truth. In fact - I'm afraid she didn't know what the truth was.

	There were many things about Jacqueline I didn't understand, and yet, without understanding, I had to be with her - to see her - to touch her - in order to be happy. It's hard to explain to a youngster.

Mary and August come across tho street and look in the windows of the cosmetic company. Only the night lights are burning in the salon. August tries the door rather perfunctorily. He shakes his head, and with Mary, moves on to the side door leading into the passageway. From his pocket he takes a bunch of keys and tries one after another. Finally one key works and the door swings open. Mary stops in ahead of August.

TWO SHOT of Mary and August. August softly closes the door behind him. The street light shines through the glass upper ha-if of the door and invades the dark hallway for a short distance.

Realizing the futility of argument, he breaks off what he was going to say, shrugs, and starts down the dark passage.

A night watchman, an old man wearing a worn corduroy Norfolk jacket and a battered hat, with his time clock hanging from a broad strap around his neck, comes out of a neighboring store, a flower shop. He carefully closes the door behind him and goes to the entrance of La Jeunesse. From a key ring hanging from the leather clock strap he selects one key and begins to open the door.

<DIRECTION>
INT. PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mary still stands in the patch of light near the doorway. Abreast of her is the doorway leading from the hall to the salon. Through the glass upper half of the door, she sees a gleam of light in the other room and tiptoes up to the door and looks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SALON LA JEUNESSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From Mary's angle, shooting through the window, can be soon the night watchman, the beam of his flashlight coursing ahead of him as he makes his way to a time clock. Ho rings in his clock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT - Mary, nervous and apprehensive, looks through at the night watchman. She makes a decision and starts off along the hallway to warn August. She disappears in the blackness of the unlit portion of the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE SHOT. At the far end of the hallway the illuminated square of the street door can be seen, and the little patch of light near it Nearer the CAMERA a broad streak of light from a partially open door is between the darkness and the CAMERA. Mary comes out of tho darkness and into this light. At the same moment, August comes out of the partially opened door, blocking out the light for a minute. His shadow goes ahead of him - contorted and strange. He stands a moment before Mary; both of his hands clenched tightly against his stomach. She speaks to him in a whisper.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. August - the night watchman
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
August makes no answer, but starts walking blindly, swaying a little, toward the street door. Mary goes with him, walking at his side, trying to peer into his face.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The night watchman - he is in the salon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Still August pays no attention.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. August, what is it? What's the matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
There is no answer. Ho continues to walk in the same jerky, pain-gripped fashion, slowly and unsteadily, toward the light. They are engulfed in the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT - August and Mary from the street angle, as they come out of the darkness. Mary is very agitated and worried. August still continues to plod blindly forward. Mary reaches out to touch his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. August -
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Her hand touches his shoulder. Almost as if unable to bear this trifling weight, he collapses suddenly at her foot. She looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP of Irving August's arm on the floor. It is sprawled awkwardly out The sleeve is darkly stained, and there is a widening stain of blood upon the floor. Mary's slippered foot step back so that the blood will not touch her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mary screams. The narrow hallway rings, echoes and reechoes with the sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mary runs wildly toward the door, fumbles with the knob and pulls it brusquely open. As she does so, the beam of the night watchman's searchlight comes in from the loft. O.S. a wild bell starts to ring madly as Mary bolts in panic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF LA JEUNESSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mary comes out of tin deer and starts running down the street. Behind her the lights of both the hall and the salon blaze. The bell rings o.s. she looks ever her shoulder and continues running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUBWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mary, still running, comes down the street. She looks back for a moment and then goes down the stairs to the subway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA REMAINS on the subway entrance a moment so that it can be clearly seen that this entrance is marked:

INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is late, and this particular car is almost empty. There is Mary, .sitting huddled in one corner under the map of the route which the I.R.T. so thoughtfully provides. Mary sits, still and white, obviously shaken. Her coat collar is drawn protectively against her throat. Opposite her are a pair of young lovers, their hands clasped, who look blissfully into each others eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The conductor comes shambling into the car. He leeks at Mary and takes a step toward her, teetering on practiced tees, disdaining the overhead strap.
</DIRECTION>
<CONDUCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know where you're going, lady?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONDUCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Mary nods.
</DIRECTION>
<CONDUCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been to the end of the line and back again - hope you enjoyed the ride.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONDUCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He passes on. Mary looks after him, frightened. As he reaches the end of the car, the subway train begins to come to a step. The two lovers get up, their hands still tightly clasped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT A SIGN reading: "14TH STREET"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE. The train comes to a stop. Mary glances up. The subway door glides open. The two lovers sidle crab-wise through it, never relinquishing their clasps on each other's hands, and through this same door come three men, three convivial drunks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GROUP SHOT of the three drunks as they seat themselves opposite Mary. The middle drunk carries the heaviest load. The ether two support him, laughing and rearing as they make him comfortable between them. All three wear top hats and dark overcoats The hat of tin man in the middle is tilted over one eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. CLOSE SHOT of Mary as she looks at the three men across from her. Over this shot comes the sound of the subway train stopping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREE SHOT of the three men. One of them leans across the supposedly drunken man between them to offer a light for the ether's cigarette. The man in the middle lolls awkwardly, swaying- between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP of Mary as she stares at the man in the middle. Some familiar chord of memory is touched in her mind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THREE SHOT of the three men. . The car jolts and the hat slides off the middle man's head. We see that the man is Irving August, and that he is dead. One of the men quickly reaches down, picks up the hat and puts it back on August's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP of Mary. Her fear is confirmed. Looking around her cautiously, she gets up and starts down the aisle. At the end of the car she leeks back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - the three men sitting at the opposite end of the car. One of the men is whispering to the other man pointing to Mary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT of Mary as she quickly opens the door and goes into the next car. She walks down the length of the car. A man is sleeping. She shakes his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please - please -
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
The man only mutters something in his sleep. Mary continues down the car's length to where a drunken girl sits, her head lolling.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want your help, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
The drunken woman merely looks at her blankly. The cars are coming to a stop again. The door opens and the conductor comes through. Mary seizes his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These men in there - don't let them get out.

The conductor looks at her dubiously. The cars have come to a stop. He looks into the next car and then glances down at her.

Mary turns and looks back toward the car she just left.

LONG SHOT of the car as Mary sees it. It is completely deserted.

TWO SHOT - Mary and the conductor. The subway train is starting to move again.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But they were there.

	</DIALOGUE>
</VENDOR>
<DIRECTION>
He is standing directly in front of the revolving doors and behind him, through the glass of the doorway, we can see Mary waiting, her face anxious and strained as she peers out onto the street. A constant stream of passersby goes by the building. Out of this stream Gregory Ward emerges, goes through the revolving doors, and we see him met by Mary, who begins excitedly to talk to him. He shakes his head, takes her arm and walks her off.

INT COFFEE COUNTER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a very small counter and stand with a few tables near the window - the sort of restaurant that is open only for breakfast and lunch and is patronized by office workers who can content themselves with a sandwich and a cup of coffee. The scene opens on the newsboy as he comes into the restaurant and goes up to the counter. The waiter behind the counter buys a paper and brings it with an order of one cup of coffee and a glass of milk to Mary and Ward, who are sitting at a small table. The newsboy goes on outside and over the scene from time to time we hear his voice crying, "Murder! Read all about it!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gregory Ward takes the glass of milk and slides it down the counter in front of Mary. He opens up the paper and scans it carefully. Mary watches him anxiously, and turns to him.

Gregory takes a sip of his coffee and speaks gently, but unable to hide his disbelief.

<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, of course - but the police would say you'd probably had a bad dream.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>
<MARY>

	He was a kind little man in his way - and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.

He takes out his cigarette case, selects a cigarette, but has no matches. Miss Summers gives him her lighter. He lights his cigarette and crosses the room to sit down on the waiting room couch.

Judd silences her by raising his hand.

(sprawling into) (a chair)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't. She came to me a few days ago. To put it delicately her care imposes a financial burden upon me. She thought you might lighten that burden.

<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If Jacqueline wants money she can come to me herself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What sort of danger?

</GREGORY>
<JUDD>

</JUDD>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is nonsense! Unless I know where Jacqueline is, and how she is, I won't give you any money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>
<DR_JUDD>
<DIRECTION>
(almost musingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a curious man. You're willing to jeopardize Jacqueline's life in order to satisfy your own curiosity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_JUDD>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You come to me with some wild story about her being in danger - naturally I want to know what kind of danger. I want to know where she is.

Gregory Ward rises and starts around the desk toward Dr. Judd.
</DIRECTION>
<GREGORY>

Judd looks coolly at Gregory and Gregory nods grudgingly.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, then I can tell you that in addition to other dangers, there is a grave danger of Jacqueline losing her sanity. I would advise against you seeing her.

<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But why? She's been ill - erratic, but I've never heard of anything like that!

	It's not knowing that makes it so hard. This way, whenever I walk along the streets I think I see her. I see some woman, peer into her face and find a stranger. I dream of her at night. It's terrible to say - but if she were dead it would be easier. There would be some certainty about it.

Mary is saying good-bye to the children. They are being called for by their mothers. Most of the women are Italian, Irish, Bohemian or Jewish New York women who collect their offspring and move out with them through the little wicket gate. The children are carrying bits of childish craft which they have manufactured during the day - paper baskets, crayola drawings. Each of the children shows off what he has done during the day to his fond mama.

This is a marble, gilt, and plaster horror of the General Grant rococo period. Glass and gilt iron doors give entrance to the hallway, which is floored with soiled marble slabs. At either side of the hall twin stairs rise to the apartments above, going upward with an accompaniment of gilt iron handrails. Some mail boxes, a worn velvet bench, and moth eaten moose head complete this charming and delicate interior.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A young woman is laboriously getting a baby carriage out from under one of the stairways and stowing her infant safely in its wicker hold. She has tucked him In, steered the carriage out from behind the stairway, and is crossing the hallway when the door opens to admit Judd and Mary.

Mary and Judd come up the stairs. Judd is fumbling for a key. He goes to his door, inserts the key, twists it and swings the door open, allowing Mary to precede him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JUDD'S APT. - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a cheap, furnished apartment. An Aubusson carpet is on the floor. The furniture is Grand Rapids Sheraton and the pictures on the wall are representative of hotel art at its worst, colored prints showing French canals, poplar trees and old towers. An incongruous picture, however, a huge chrome in an ornate fretwork frame dominates one wall. This is the famous picture of the guardian angel which shows a little child, gowned in white, who is about to fall over a precipice wore it not for the benign hand of her guardian angel, a figure complete with white robe and white wings. Under this picture is a bureau. It has been converted to a writer's needs by the simple expedient of removing one drawer and re-inserting it so that the bottom of the drawer can be used as a base for a typewriter. On this overturned drawer stand a portable typewriter, a box full of paper, some loose manuscript and a marmalade jar full of pencils. Between a pair of bookends are about four volumes with the author's name - Louis Judd - plainly evident on the dust jackets. They are the only books in the room. At the end of the room is a small, useless sort of desk. This has been made into a dressing table by putting a fitted toilet case on top and opening it. Through a double doorway, without doors, can be seen a square cubicle containing an unmade bed. Mary comes into this room and looks around anxiously. Judd follows her, carefully bolts the door behind him and puts it on the chain.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's not here. She's gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDD>
<DIRECTION>
Mary looks around her a little apprehensive at the thought of being alone with this stranger. However, his own nervousness at Jacqueline's absence is very genuine. As Mary crosses the room to the desk he continues to talk excitedly.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know why she left. She knows she shouldn't have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDD>
<DIRECTION>
Mary takes a hand mirror out of the fitted case and holds it up. A big swirling monogram on the back is immediately visible. The letters are: "J. G." Mary puts it down. In a little ash tray beside the dressing case a cigarette is smoldering. Mary points to it. Judd looks at it, then quickly crosses the room to a door obviously leading to a bathroom. He knocks, and receiving no answer, opens it and turns back to the room.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's gone. She's left me to meet them alone. I can't.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What makes you so nervous, Dr. Judd. Who are they?

Judd pays no attention to her. He walks quickly to the other end of the room, then turns to face her.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't stay here. I'll have to leave you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDD>
<DIRECTION>
Without any further word he strides quickly to the entrance door, fumbles furiously with the chain and lock; opens it and goes out, closing the door behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mary stands in the center of the room, completely at a loss. She turns back to the desk and snuffs out the cigarette thoughtfully. Again she examines the mirror or some other article in the dressing case, As she stands there, looking at her sister's initials, there is a soft knock at the door. Mary crosses the room quickly and opens it.

Mary re-enters the room. She goes over to the dressing table where she had left her purse and picks it up. As she does this something in the mirror attracts her attention, and a look of terror comes into her face. In the mirror can be seen the back of a large chair near the bureau. Over the top of this chair floats a rising column of cigar smoke. Mary turns.

EXT. STREET WASHINGTON MEWS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason and Ward with Mary between them, cross the street toward the north side of Washington Mews. To their right is the mews, the little houses one next to the other in an orderly row. They stop for a moment at the street corner.

<JASON>

	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the part of New York I love. It is old. It has memories. If you listen, the houses will speak to you. Walt Whitman...Edna St. Vincent Millay... Eugene O'Neill...in their time they've all lived here.

He goes on to the next house and they follow. The CAMERA DOLLIES WITH them.

	Well, that's illuminating.

Even Mary looks concerned and puzzled. They have stopped before the next house and again Jason has taken the attitude of one listening. The sound of a violin can be heard playing Abenlied.

From the next house comes the sound of revelry, laughter and a burst of jazz music from a phonograph which obscures the milder noises of the house in front of which they stand.

INT. NATALIE CORTEZ' HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT of Natalie Cortez. She is seated at a small card table, shuffling a pack of cards with one hand, and surrounded by a small group of her guests in evening clothes. Natalie is a very beautiful woman of early middle age. It is apparent why she uses only one hand to shuffle her cards. She has but one arm. A little cape of gold lame covers her shoulders and hangs down over the missing arm.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDD_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shuffle the cards well, Natalie. This is a trick of telepathy not card manipulation
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDD_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER SHOT of the same group to include Judd, who stands a little distance away with his back purposely turned to the card table. Mrs. Cortez is finishing shuffling the cards. The door knocker sounds.

<DIRECTION>
Gladys takes the cards and crosses to Judd, who still stands with his back to his audience, while Mrs. Cortez turns and walks in the other direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE SHOT - toward the door. For the first time Mrs. Cortez' living quarters can be seen. The house was formerly a stable on the Mews and in remodeling it for living purposes Mrs. Cortez has allowed the stalls and general architecture of the stable to remain. She uses one of the two stalls as a little dining nook, although above it the name of the horse, "Apocalypse" is still printed on a placard. The next stall has been converted into a little escritoire, and over this stall is the name "Morning Star." The place is lit with electrified stable and carriage lamps and furnished with harness and horse adornments which contrast with the rich piled carpet, the lovely square piano of rosewood and the beautiful modern prints with plain wood frames. Book shelves cover the largest portion of the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Cortez wends her way through little groups of her guests and goes to the door.

</JASON>
<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But why come to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDD>
<JASON>

	I'm afraid you don't understand. Miss Gibson's sister is missing -

	Missing? Well, no wonder. When she took up with Louis Judd she went out of circulation, like that!

	No. You've just turned the dagger in the wound - - a beautiful job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JASON>
<DIRECTION>
He looks quickly over to Mary, sees tears coming to her eyes, takes her elbow and leads her to another part of the room. Gladys' attention is attracted by laughter from another group of the party and she drifts off. Ward and Judd are left together.

INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY- DANTE - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Jason comes up the stairs whistling. As he reaches the landing, Mimi comes out of her door at the end of the corridor and goes across to the bathroom. She is in her soiled dressing gown, her hair lank about her shoulders. She carries a towel over one arm.
</DIRECTION>
<JASON>
<DIRECTION>
(waving to her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mimi!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JASON>
<DIRECTION>
She turns toward him and is about to speak when a fit of coughing takes her. She passes on, goes through the doorway to the bath. Jason goes on to a door halfway down the hall, #lO. He knocks on the door. Mary's voice can be heard bidding him enter.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Jason turns the knob and throws the door open. Through the open door Mary's room can be seen. It is a small, dismal cubicle like the room with the noose. There is a day bed, a dresser, a little desk, an armchair, an old- fashioned rocker and light curtains at the window. There are a few odd-shaped pillows on the day bed and some other evidences of Mary's attempts to make this place bright and livable. On the dresser top stands a large framed photograph of Jacqueline.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the door opens, Mary can be seen washing a pair of white gloves in a little basin set in the corner of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the scene progresses,, she can be seen washing the gloves on her hands, removing them, rinsing out the soap and then tacking them up on the open window sash to dry. Jason pulls a rose from his pocket. A withered blossom. He offers it. Mary holds up her white-gloved hands to indicate that she can't take the flower. He picks up a tumbler, fills it with water, puts the rose in it, and sets the whole mess on the window sill.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.

<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.

</MARY>
<JASON>

Mary chuckles to herself and, taking up one of the gloves, blows into it, laughing in spite of herself as she does so. In a playful mood, she brushes the blown-up glove against the back of Jason's neck. He starts nervously. Like a young child, Mary is thrown into a fit of laughter.

INT. FLANDERS ARMS - JUDD'S APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Judd, dressed in a dressing gown, is seated on the straight chair before the makeshift desk, talking with Mrs. Cortez who is dressed in street clothes and who has perched herself on the arm of a large, overstuffed chair. They have evidently been talking for some time. The scene opens with a slight lull in the conversation, while Judd takes a cigarette and lights it, blows out the first inhalation of smoke and looks squarely at Mrs. Cortez.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>

	One believes - it's like any other religion...

<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd hardly describe It that way - The worship of evil is a pretty dreadful and special thing.

</JUDD>
<MRS_CORTEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It seems right to us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CORTEZ>
<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know the theory behind the movement. If one believes in good one believes in evil. If one believes in God, one must believe in the devil. And an intelligent person can make his own choice - that's it, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDD>
<MRS_CORTEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because you are intelligent - that's why they sent me to you -
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CORTEZ>
<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I can give you a more practical reason for your kind invitation. I know too much. I was Jacqueline's psycho-analyst.

	<DIALOGUE>
	A gay lot - Redi, for instance. I don't know what her sorrow is, but her life's an empty one. She's had to have this to cling to. Frances Fallon, with her worship of Jacqueline, has had to follow like a sheep. And Bruns, the fanatic. And you...

INT. MARY'S BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mary is in the shower. It is an old-fashioned affair in a tub with a round pipe rail above it from which a translucent curtain is hanging to keep the water from splashing. Mary's head, neck, shoulders and a portion of her back can be seen. She is wearing a shower cap. The warm water is streaming over her, making a comfortable fog of steam. Mary is humming or whistling the song that Mrs. Romari was singing downstairs. She lifts her hand to soap the back of her neck. A dark and threatening shadow falls athwart the curtain, and through the steam and water a figure can be dimly seen standing there. It is a moment or two before this figure speaks.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Mary.

INT. NATALIE CORTEZ' APT. - LATE EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT There is a fire burning in the fireplace. The lamps have been lit, although outdoors there is still a gray, cold light in the street. The room looks bright and warm. There are about a dozen people who are standing and sitting, smoking and chatting. Before the sofa a tea service has been set on the coffee table. An alcohol stove keeps the tea water hot and a slight steam rises from the tea kettle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Among the guests can be seen certain familiar faces. Frances Fallon stands near the door talking with a young man, Mr. Durk, who can be recognized as one of the two drunks who supported the body of Irving August on the subway. The other of the two drunks, Mr. Leo, is seated by himself in an armchair looking through a record album. In his street clothes, chatting with a very lovely, white-haired woman, is Joseph, the workman at La Jeunesse.

Mrs. Cortez is opening the door, as the scene opens, to admit Mrs. Redi, who is dressed in exactly the same clothes she wore in the previous scene.

	She didn't betray us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<MR_BRUNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even if I believed that, I would still consider her dangerous. There is the matter of Irving August's death. Without consulting me, Mrs. Redi was ill-advised enough to have the body removed by Leo and Durk. This makes us all a party to the crime. What if there is a trial? What if Jacqueline is asked how the body was removed? Do you think, Frances, she would keep silent?

There is a long pause. He looks around the circle.

INT. JASON'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a small room with a skylight. There are no curtain on the skylight. Behind it the night sky can be seen, and occasionally the beam of a searchlight cuts across. There is a bed, an easy chair and a desk with a typewriter stand beside it. The walls of the room are almost hidden by bookcases and books, and even the mantel bears a burden of numerous volumes. Jason is seated at his desk, turned toward the typewriter. He types a line, reads it inaudibly and at the same time beats out the rhythm with his left hand on the desk top. Evidently it scans, because he types another line and is about to repeat the rhythmic test on it, when there is a small knock on the door. He gets up, crosses the room and opens the door. Mary stands outside. She is dressed in the little traveling suit she wore in the first sequence and wears a hat.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.

Jason looks at her. He is silent, but his face shows her his concern.
</DIRECTION>
<JASON>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought your coming up here to the third floor to see me - that it was your advent into my world. It turns out to be good-by. Why?

</JASON>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to go -

</MARY>
<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>

</JASON>
<DIRECTION>
He suddenly senses the compulsion that had been in her words.

<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It isn't that - you said, "have to go." What could compel you -

</JASON>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't make me tell you, Jason.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought myself your friend, Mary. Just good-bye isn't enough for a friend.

Mary turns away, close to tears. Jason stands looking at her.
</DIRECTION>
<JASON>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I had begun to write again - that's whet I was doing when you came in.

<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's because of Jacqueline - I can't go on looking for her -

</MARY>
<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You went to see Mrs. Redi... She told you something - what was it?

</JASON>
<MARY>

	Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<JASON>
<DIRECTION>
(incredulous)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you believe that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JASON>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to. It was Irving August - everything Mrs. Redi said - it fits in with what I saw - she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Jason thinks for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it is true - there's all the more reason for you to find Jacqueline.

</JASON>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Gregory - he loves her.

</MARY>
<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He loves you, Mary, and you'll have to tell him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JASON>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
She begins to cry. Jason puts his arm about her shoulders.
</DIRECTION>
<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't tell him - you can't even dream of loving him - you feel guilty for not having had love enough for Jacqueline to save her from whatever it was that took her away - I know that feeling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JASON>
<DIRECTION>
They stand for a moment silently.
</DIRECTION>
<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you've got to tell him about Jacqueline - if only for the practical reason that he's a lawyer and will know what to do. I'm going to phone him.

Gregory Ward is striding up and down the room. He seems greatly perturbed. He speaks and the CAMERA PULLS BACK to show Mary and Jason, both seated and both watching him as he strides.
</DIRECTION>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's got to be found. That's the first step. She's got to be found so that she can give herself up to the police.

<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've tried so long to find her.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.

</JASON>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's clever and he's cautious in his way. If he knew I think he'd advise her to do what I want - surrender herself to the police - stand trial - I don't think he knows.

</GREGORY>
<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>

Gregory strides on again to the end of the room, then turns to Jason.

<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose so. I can pick him up somewhere.

</JASON>
<DIRECTION>
Jason picks up his overcoat from the foot of the bed, and takes his hat in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jason, I sometimes wonder - you're so sweet to me - so kind and sympathetic - I don't know how I can ever thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>

Jason looks at her for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank me? You don't need to thank me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JASON>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her again and then at Gregory Ward. Evidently some idea has passed through his mind, because he turns from Mary, crosses to the table, picks up a manuscript and puts it into a large Manila envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<GREGORY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?

EXT. GREENWICH VILLAGE STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Judd walks along unconcerned and seemingly unaware that on the opposite side of the street Jason is patiently following him. He sees his image reflected in a weighing machine mirror and turns to him. The two men wave a friendly "hello." Jason ducks out of sight around a corner for a moment and then takes up Judd's trail again. Judd passes into a small apartment house. Jason follows a moment later.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT HOUSE HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a self-service elevator. Jason comes in and sees that the elevator is in use and the sign "in use" is glowing, and the fourth floor button is red. He waits patiently for the elevator to stop and presses the "down" button. When it returns to the first floor he opens the outer door, then the inner grill, and is about to step in when Judd suddenly appears from the other side of the elevator, reaches in and taps him on the shoulder. Jason turns around, surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDD>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't bother going up. I can do this all night, Jason. Watch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDD>
<DIRECTION>
He draws Jason out of the elevator, lets the grill door slide shut, passes his hand through the grillwork, pushes the button and sends the elevator up empty. Jason grins and shakes his head. Judd takes a cigarette packet from his pocket and passes it to Jason.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually I want to ask two favors of you - one as a poet - one as a detective.

</JASON>
<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It sounds strange, and I'm going to be very wary.

</JUDD>
<DIRECTION>
Jason reaches into his overcoat pocket and pulls out the Manila envelope containing the manuscript.
</DIRECTION>
<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some time ago you spoke about my writing again. I want your help. I'd like you to bring this to your publisher.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JASON>
<DIRECTION>
Judd takes the envelope and starts to open it, looking up at Jason.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is curious, Jason. Half the time you talk as if Shakespeare were not fit to tie your shoe-laces; now this sudden humility.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I should like people to read what I've written.

Judd looks at him and taps the envelope.

<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this poetry - like the poetry you wrote before extols the passion and beauty of life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDD>
<JASON>

	It goes beyond that. It praises the goodness of God and the greatness of all His works.

EXT. HOUSE IN CHERRY LANE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The little group of people come up to it. It is a mean little house. Mary looks up at the dark windows, glances at the garbage can full of refuse near the door, and shudders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Judd takes a key from his pocket and opens the front door. The hallway is dimly lit by a bare electric bulb. At the back can be seen an angular stairway.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. I'll call her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDD>
<DIRECTION>
He goes into the house and the rest stand together on the stoop looking in through the open door. Judd crosses the hall and standing at the front of the stairs, calls up to Jacqueline.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jacqueline, this is Judd.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
There is no answer. He waits a moment, then calls again.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jacqueline.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDD>
<DIRECTION>
There is a frightened strained voice, that answers; a voice that seems to have come up through layers of heavy sleep, emerging only to be frightened.

<JACQUELINE_S_VOICE>

</JACQUELINE_S_VOICE>
<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Judd. I'm here with your sister. Come on down.

</JUDD>
<DIRECTION>
Judd goes forward and stands by the banister. Mary stands at one side with Jason, and Gregory at the other side. They wait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Very slowly Jacqueline comes down the stairs. She has on her nightgown and over it a fur coat. Her hair is loose about her shoulders, her eyes are wide and apprehensive. Judd puts out his hand to help her down the last few steps. Mary goes into the lighted hall. The two sisters look at each other for a moment, then go into each others arms. Judd leans against the banister, watching. Finally, they break from their embrace. Mary is crying and Jacqueline is half-laughing, half-crying. She holds Mary off at arm's length, looking at her.
</DIRECTION>
<JACQUELINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mary!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACQUELINE>

She sees the two men in the doorway, and starts back fearfully. Gregory steps forward.

She stands quite still, looking at him nervously.

Jacqueline turns back to Judd and moves a little in his direction. Judd continues to lean against the banister, smiling.

Again she looks from one to the other.

<GREGORY>

	Yes. I'm very sure there's only one way to protect you - to help you you've got to come with us- let me do all that I can as a lawyer to straighten out Irving August's death.

INT. JASON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a bright fire in the fireplace. Jason is crouched before the fire. He has a coffee pot set up on the edges of three bricks inside the fireplace, and on the hearth is a reflector baker with biscuits baking in it. A bottle of cream and other oddments and endments of his culinary art are strewn about on the hearth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacqueline is seated before the fire in an armchair with Mary at her feet. Mary's head is resting against Jacqueline's knee. Gregory sits on a straight chair, a little uncomfortable, and facing them from the other side of the fire. Judd lounges on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason wraps a tea towel around his hand and reaches in the fireplace for the coffee pot. He pours out a cup of coffee and then with the same wrapped hand snatches a biscuit from the baker, and puts it on the edge of the coffee saucer. He hands it to Jacqueline. Her hand trembles as she takes it.
</DIRECTION>

She pauses, and Judd in moving from his place on the bed, speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jacqueline was always a sensationalist, trying to seize onto something - anything - in order to find happiness. Through Mrs. Redi she stumbled onto the Palladist movement - it appealed to her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDD>
<JACQUELINE>
<DIRECTION>
(shuddering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't happy with them - wanted to break away - was miserable. I went to Louis for help. They felt that I had betrayed them. They wanted me to die - to kill myself. They kept me locked up at La Jeunesse. I was there such a long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACQUELINE>

She stops.

<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can Imagine the effect of such imprisonment on Jacqueline.

</JUDD>
<JACQUELINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was terrified. The darkness in the corners of the room - the little noises. Then one night the door opened - a man came in - tip-toeing in. I had a scissors in my hand - I struck at him, I ran away. He was lying in the hall with the blood around him.

She shudders.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JASON>

Gregory turns away self-consciously. Jacqueline continues to look into the fire without answering. Judd looks over at Jason. He sees what plan lies in the poet's mind. Getting to his feet, he crosses to Jacqueline and Mary.

	It's been a hard evening for both of you. Perhaps you'd better take Jacqueline to your room, Mary.

<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA IS FIXED at the spot in the apartment where the Palladists had grouped themselves during the meeting. There is no one present, but the chairs are still in the same disorderly pattern to which they had been pulled during the meeting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is the sound of a door buzzer, and the light tread of feet as someone crosses the room at the other end and answers the door. The door can be heard opening.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CORTEZ_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Louis Judd! I'm amazed to see you.

</MRS_CORTEZ_VOICE>
<JUDD_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Natalie. I wouldn't have disturbed you if it weren't for a matter of grave concern to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDD_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs Cortez and Judd come into the scene She is in negligee. He is dressed in street clothes with his overcoat over his arm and hat in band. He stops and looks moodily at the oddly spaced collection of chairs. Mrs. Cortez seats herself on the arm of the sofa.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. She's no longer under my care.

<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Cortez looks at him in astonishment. He is too absorbed to notice this start on her part.
</DIRECTION>
<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know how to begin this, Natalie. Perhaps it's best to just plunge in. I want to join you.

	<DIALOGUE>
	We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CORTEZ>
<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm not coming to you out of deep conviction, I'm coming to you out of loss. I no longer can believe in the power and the rightness of things that are called good.

<MRS_CORTEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never thought you did.

</MRS_CORTEZ>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I've talked nonsense. I've scoffed and hooted - but somewhere very deep down in me, I always felt that good held the balance of power.

	<DIALOGUE>
	But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - - quarreled with him -
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_CORTEZ>
<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I love and admire him more than any man I ever knew. I read these poems. He's lost his talent and his was a really great gift. What I have to do today - to bring him this rejected manuscript - will be the most disheartening thing I have ever done and the most disillusioning.

Judd starts for the door. Mrs. Cortez goes with him.

The room is almost dark. The lamps have not yet been lighted. Only Jacqueline's white and tortured features catch the last cold light from the window. The rest of the Palladists are in darkness. At the piano someone sits playing. It is Mrs. Cortez. She plays with only one hand, with a deadly monotony and a curious unevenness.

INT. MRS. CORTEZ' APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only two lamps are lit, one a small table lamp and the other a tall standing lamp which throws a pool of light around Jacqueline. The beams of the other lamp gleam on the eyes in the dark faces around her. There is a deep silence in the apartment. After a moment, Bruns' voice, grown hoarse, can be heard speaking from the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<BRUNS_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead, Jacqueline Go ahead!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRUNS_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The words drop into the silence like stones in a pool of still water, and the silence closes over them, Jacqueline moves her position a little bit. Her movements are slow and she moves without disturbing the stillness of the room. Mrs. Cortez' light voice comes in.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_CORTEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is late -
	</DIALOGUE>

Again there is silence, end again Jacqueline shifts her position just a little bit. Suddenly the stillness of the scene, the almost tableau arrangement of the character, is shattered. Frances Fallon jumps hysterically to her feet.

Very slowly Jacqueline's hand goes forward and seizes the stem of the glass. Slowly she brings it up to her lips. Frances, suddenly, knocks the glass from her hand. It goes crashing to the floor. Frances, sobbing, falls at Jacqueline's feet, embracing her knees and weeping bitterly.

<DIRECTION>
Mrs Cortez reaches back of her and snaps on the wall lights. The whole room is filled with a hard, white light. Jacqueline has not moved. Frances continues to sob at her knee. The rest get up stiffly and move awkwardly about. Bruns and Leo whisper together. Bruns comes over to Jacqueline end stands before her.

Jacqueline makes no move to rise, but continues to sit with a dead, set face, looking ahead of her, with Frances still weeping at her knee. Bruns takes her arm roughly and pulls her to her feet. In the background Leo can be seen going out of the room.

EXT. WASHINGTON NEWS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacqueline comes out of Mrs. Cortez' apartment and stands for a moment in a broad patch of light thrown by the open door. Behind her this door closes and she is suddenly in darkness. She looks apprehensively into the shadows and then quite hesitantly begins to walk to the right. At the end of the street the brighter lights of Fifth Avenue can be seen. Washington News, itself, is full of dark shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is exhausted and unnerved. She walks slowly. She passes one place where the out-jutting of the building casts a deeper shadow on the sidewalk. A garbage can is set behind the out-jutting, this and the bough of an old ailanthus combine to cast a man-like shadow beside the shadow of the building. Jacqueline pauses, peers intently into the shadow, then summons up courage enough to pass. She walks quickly past the out-jutting building. Somewhat relieved, she walks a little bit more confidently. Suddenly, there is a clatter and bang of metal behind her. She gasps, startled, and whirls around
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A white dog with a long bony tail slinks away from a garbage can. The lid of this can is still oscillating from its fall and roll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacqueline draws her coat more closely about her and goes on. Ahead of her, thrown by the thin light from a transom above a door, is the enormously long shadow of a man across the sidewalk and across the street. She hesitates then starts to cross the street diagonally, looking back all the while at the doorway. From the center of the street it can be seen that a man stands there. With him stands a woman, her figure somewhat lost in the doorway. They are saying good night. On the opposite side of the street, Jacqueline hurries toward the Avenue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE AVENUE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With evident relief, Jacqueline comes out of the darkness of Washington News to the more brightly lighted avenue. Traffic is passing and people are all about her. She starts off up the avenue with confidence. Then some premonition makes her turn. Only a few paces behind her is Leo, and there is a grin on his lean, satyr-like face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hurries her step. Behind her Leo quickens his pace. It She peers into the faces of passers-by, seeking some unpreoccupied person who might be sympathetic and helpful. People pass her, intent on their own business and without concern. She begins to run. Leo merely lengthens his stride. It is easy for him to keep up with her. A few people turn their heads to watch her run, but Leo's long strides attract no attention. Suddenly, in desperation, she dashes across the street. A cab narrowly misses hitting her and a bus, coming from the other direction, has to stop with an appalling scream and roar of brakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jacqueline, shaken, out of breath and trembling, reaches the other corner of the- street. She pauses for a moment to take a deep breath. She looks back of' her. There is no sign of Leo. Again she starts on and from the shadow of a light standard a deeper shadow detaches itself and steps out behind her. It is Leo and he is grinning. She sees him and begins to run down the cross street. She runs wildly. Leo, at first lengthens his stride, and then suddenly breaks into a lope - a lope that will bring him up to her within an instant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She ducks into an alley and is lost in the darkness. She hides in a corner amid some debris, crouching back out of the light. Leo plunges ahead in pursuit. Jacqueline stands a moment as the sound of his footsteps diminish, then turns back and begins running down the street. Ahead of her, a dark slim figure, not unlike Leo's, is walking up the street toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She dodges into the next alley. This is an alley behind a theatre. It is cluttered with all sorts of strange impedimenta; flats, crates, etc. There is an overhead lamp burning in the center of the alley, but the periphery of the light beneath it, does not extend to the walls of the alley. The area immediately adjacent to these walls is heavy with darkness and strange shadows. Jacqueline stands in the middle of the pool of light and listens. It seems to her that she can hear in the darkness the soft tap-tap of someone walking on his toes. She shrinks back from the bright light into the darkness and begins to grope her way along the wall, She is going from left to right. A sound at her right attracts her attention and she looks off, but continues to grope her way along the wall to the left. Her hand passes from the roughness of the wall to the smoothness of cloth and a split second later, Leo, whom she has touched, grins as he seizes her wrist. She screams and then silently struggles to free herself. Still smiling he holds her firmly with his right band. With his left hand he draws something from his pocket. He presses a button on this and a four-and a-half inch knife blade flashes out. Jacqueline stands stock still with fright. Leo's hand goes back for the blow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the opposite side of the alley a door is suddenly thrown wide open and a great patch of light is thrown on Jacqueline and Leo. He puts the knife behind his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Out of the door come half a dozen people in costumes. They are members of a ballet company performing in the theatre. Also there emerges the sound of loud and merry music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The actors are in a gay mood laughing and shouting. One of them breaks into a half dance step. It is infectious and the rest join in, making a sort of Carmagnole that sweeps down the alley. Jacqueline breaks from Leo's hand-hold on her wrist and runs in among them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the dancers is an enormous man dressed in Roman half armor to represent the god Gambrinus, with gilded hop blooms as a garland about his shoulders and wearing a papier mache mask, surmounted by crown of similarly gilded hop leaves and wheat. The face of the mask is a grinning, jolly, rubicund visage. It is next to this enormous man that Jacqueline finds herself. In sportive mood the giant dancer sweeps her up with one arm, forcing her to dance his grotesque steps.

EXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the street corner is a beer saloon. The dancers, some of them still skipping and dancing, come around and go into the brilliantly lit saloon. The dancer with Jacqueline tries to pull her into the saloon. She fights away from him. Laughing and slapping his thigh in mirth, he leaves her and passes into the saloon. She is left alone in the street. She makes a half-hearted movement to adjust her disarranged clothing. Slowly, with great weariness, she begins to walk away from the saloon, going further and further into the darkness. She looks around. The darkness frightens her. She looks back. There is the warm glow of light from the saloon windows. She starts to go back. From the lighted end of the street a man crosses to the same side of the street as Jacqueline. His silhouette somewhat resembles the silhouette of Leo. She turns, runs and is lost in the darkness.

The Palladists, with the exception of Leo, are all here and all seated. Judd, still wearing his overcoat, is seated in a small chair facing them and beside him stands Jason.

<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that you've hounded and worried her half to death, you don't oven know where she is. At least tell me, has she been here?

</JUDD>
<MR_BRUNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was here for a little while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_BRUNS>
<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JUDD>
<MR_BRUNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. She left here an hour or so ago. She may even be home now. Why don't you try it?

<JUDD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, Jason.

Judd gets up and they start for the door. Half-way to the door, Jason stops and turns around. Judd also turns.

	We've not asked your opinion.

</MR_BRUNS>
<JASON>

	I propose to give it to you anyway. You're a poor, wretched group of people who have taken the wrong turning.

	Wrong? Who knows what is right or wrong?

	I can prove you wrong so simply Listen:

(he bows his head and recites very quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name Thy kingdom come, thy will be done On earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day, our daily bread Forgive us our trespasses as we Forgive those who trespass against us. Lead us not into temptation But deliver us from evil For thine is the kingdom, the power And the glory forever. Amen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JASON>

As he prays, the CAMERA MOVES FROM one off the Palladists to another. Tears form in Frances Fallon's eyes. Mrs. Redi turns her head. Even Bruns, the ardent and fanatical believer, chokes back a sob.

Both men turn and go. The CAMERA HOLDS ON the Palladist group.

EXT. DANTE RESTAURANT - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Jacqueline, still running, comes into the scene and goes up the steps. She opens the front door and lets herself in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UPPER STAIRS - HALLWAY - DANTE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gas light has been turned down so that there is only a tiny flame to illuminate the hall. The draft in the hallway stirs this little flame and the shadows move with it. Jacqueline comes up the stairs. Now that she can be seen more closely, it can be seen also that she is exhausted, her eyes wild, her hair in disorder. She almost staggers as she reaches the landing and goes slowly supporting herself on the banisters, toward Mary's door. Her way brings her past Room #7, the room with the noose. For a moment she stands weakly staring at the door, then goes on. She has reached Mary's room, has crossed the narrow hallway and her hand is almost on the knob when Mimi's door opens and Mimi, white night-gowned, comes out into the eerie gas light. Jacqueline looks at her face which is distorted and horrible in the moving shadows and flickering light. She stifles a scream. The other girl is also frightened. The two stand staring at each other for a moment.

</JACQUELINE>
<MIMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. It's been quiet, oh ever so quiet. I hardly move, yet it keeps coming all the time - closer and closer. I rest and rest and yet I am dying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIMI>
<JACQUELINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you don't want to die. I've always wanted to die - always.

</JACQUELINE>
<DIRECTION>
But Mimi has already turned back into her room. Jacqueline stands watching until the light snaps on in Mimi's room and then the door closing, plunges the hall into weird half light again. In this semi-darkness, she turns away from Mary's door and walks down the hall toward room #7. She opens the door and goes in. For a brief moment the light from the hall casts the shadow of a noose against the further wall of the room and then the door closes behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is lit by a single little lamp on the dressing table - Mary herself stands near the window, looking out. Gregory is talking over the telephone. From downstairs we hear Mrs. Romari singing. The song comes faintly to this upper story. She is singing an Italian song. The words are Dante's:
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_ROMARI_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(singing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Death, why hast thou made life so hard to bear, Taking my lady hence? East thou no whit or shame? The youngest flowers and the most fair Thou hast pluck'd. away and the world wanteth it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROMARI_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Gregory puts down the telephone and crosses to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was Dr. Judd. He was phoning to say that, Jacqueline is on her way here -

</MARY>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's what I should have done yesterday. I'll take her away somewhere where she can rest.
	</DIALOGUE>

Mary turns back toward the window. Gregory stands watching her.
</DIRECTION>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>
<DIRECTION>
She turns toward him. He puts his hands on her shoulders and turns her back to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Stay that way. I want to talk to you. I love you - you know that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>
<MARY>
<DIRECTION>
(in a choked voice )
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps, later, when things are settled, when Jacqueline's well again - maybe we can arrange things differently.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>
<DIRECTION>
Mary turns and faces him.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you - you must know it - but Jacqueline's my sister - whom I had lost and have found again....

Mary shakes her head, turns back toward the window. They stand together for a moment. From below comes the sound of Mrs. Romari's singing.

INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL - DANTE RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA IS LEVELED on the empty hall. From downstairs can be heard the sound of Mrs. Romari singing. Then Mimi's door opens and Mimi sweeps out, dressed in a black dress, gleaming with sequins, her hair piled high, her walk proud and steady. She comes down the hall toward the camera. Just as she reaches the door of #7, there is the sound of an over-turned chair falling. She pauses and looks toward the door. There is the creaking sound of the rope. She listens for an instant, and failing to comprehend, sweeps on past the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DANTE RESTAURANT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a bright day and the sunlit street can be seen through the windows. Children are hurrying by on their way to school, At a table near the window Mary sits with Gregory. She has been crying and has her sodden handkerchief in her hand. Gregory has a pre-occupied air and is tracing figures on the table cloth with his fork.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason comes in bearing a small tray with three tiny cups of coffee on it. He puts a cup in front of each of them and keeps one for himself. He sips his coffee. Neither Mary nor Gregory touch theirs Jason pushes Mary's cup toward her to attract her attention, She picks it up and brings it to her lips.
</DIRECTION>
<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate people who try to peddle comfort. But,Mary, you shouldn't mourn for Jacqueline. Life for her was full of the agony of a disordered mind. It's better this way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JASON>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I keep telling myself that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, tell yourself, Mary, that this is a world that doesn't pass with the passing of any one of us. All three of us are going to start afresh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up and across at Jason with a meaningful glance at Mary.
</DIRECTION>
<GREGORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You and I have new hopes - and new plans can come from them -
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREGORY>
<DIRECTION>
Jason looks at him across Mary and shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not I - I am alive, yet every hope I had is dead,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns to Mary)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Death can be good. Death can be happy.. If I were really dying I could speak like Cyrano - "My courage like a white plume" - and all the other lovely words with which he greeted death. Then perhaps you might understand,

	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand.

<JASON>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. We all understand each other. You, Gregory and I. We all know. There is sunlight in the streets and work to do. Both of you - you're off to work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JASON>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up and takes Mary's arm, helping her to rise.
</DIRECTION>
<JASON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Off with you. You can't sit here in this cellar with the sun shining.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JASON>
<DIRECTION>
He hustles her toward the door and Gregory follows. Mary and Gregory ascend the steps to the street level.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason steps back a pace or two so that he is backgrounded by the mural of Dante. He stands there, and the smile leaves his face. His whole body reflects his hopelessness and despair. It is at this moment that Mrs. Romari comes hustling in from the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_ROMARI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah! Good! They have all gone! Now you and I can laugh and joke again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_ROMARI>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to her, forcing a smile.
