:SC: THE HIGHWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Georgia. Two-lane blacktop, stretching from here to heaven. Empty. Silent. Then, suddenly in the far distance, several dark specks rise over a hill and head straight toward camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera holds and the specks begin to take form. Vehicles. Trucks. Six monstrous eighteen-wheel diesels, coming at us, their smokestacks blasting. Sound grows louder, as we begin to hear snatches of Citizens Band Radio talk over:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_ONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Breaker, this is Banana Peel...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_ONE>
<VOICE_TWO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Yeah, Breaker go head on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_TWO>
<VOICE_ONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Thanks much. I'd like to get me a Smokey report?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_ONE>
<VOICE_TWO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Road looks clean as a hound's tooth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_TWO>
<VOICE_ONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Okey, doke. Last one to the Roadeo is a homo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_ONE>
<DIRECTION>
Voices fade and titles and credits begin. "Black Smoke Blowing Over Eighteen Wheels" by Red Simpson comes up in the b.g. as the six trucks blast right over camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN AERIAL VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
of the trucks driving through an entrance gate to a huge parking lot. Over the gate is a sign reading: "GEORGIA TRUCK ROADEO STATE FINALS." Music and credits continue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: TRUCK ROADEO - PARKING LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Macks, Kenworths, Whites and Jimmys, all polished to a mirrored finish. Truck drivers decked out in their flashiest western outfits. The stands filled with spectators on the edge of their seats, watching the gearjammers put their rigs through tests of skill and reflexes -- parallel parking, driving around eggs, through complicated barricades, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PICKS UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a customized white Cadillac convertible pulling into the Roadeo grounds. The Caddy has mounted chrome quarter horses on each front fender, bull horns on the front bumper, stacked rifles displayed in the rear. Garish. The car's Texas license plate reads "Mr. Big."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cadillac stops. Two men climb out and wend their way through the trucks and spectators. Camera tracks behind them. Although we can't see their faces, we see that one man is pudgy and decked out in a fancy white western suit and hat. The other is younger, tall, skinny and wearing a grey western suit and hat. Kyle Brand and his son Dickey.
</DIRECTION>

MUSIC AND CREDITS FADE

Kyle laughs. His laugh then turns into a hacking cough.

<DICKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't we just rent a Lear jet and haul it back ourselves?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICKEY>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I wanna see this hot shot Bandit do something that can't be done. Besides, there's nothing I like better than breaking legends.

He laughs, coughs again, continues walking.

Dickey crosses to a trucker couple, polishing up their chromed rig.

The Husband shoots his old lady a jealous look. Dickey rejoins Kyle and they head toward Bandit LaRue's truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE - MOVING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as they come to the only battered, beaten-up eighteen-wheeler at the entire Truck Roadeo. It looks like it hasn't been washed since it left the showroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On one side of the truck is a faded and peeling mural of a stagecoach being held up. A teamster and a shotgun guard have their hands high in the air and a Bandit on horseback has a six-gun pointed at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An elaborate CB radio antenna grows out of the cab beside the driver's door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - KYLE AND DICKEY - FROM BEHIND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as they round the truck and stop in their tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE - WHAT THEY SEE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hammock is stretched from the cab of the truck to an oak tree. A man wearing a faded denim western shirt, open with the sleeves rolled up, levis and silver-toed cowboy boots is lying in the hammock. A cowboy hat covers his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as shadows fall across the figure. The man slowly tips back his hat and we see he's in his thirties, boyishly handsome, with a cocky smile. Bandit LaRue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And for the first time we get a look at Kyle and Dickey. Kyle is wearing sunglasses and diamond rings on every finger. His smile is as tasteless as the suit he wears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dickey is in his early twenties. Blonde, blue-eyed and scared to death of his old man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bandit looks at them for a moment, then casually pulls the hat back over his face.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw, ain't you glad to see me, Bandit?

There's a long pause interrupted by Kyle's hacking cough.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you turn your head?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT>
<DIRECTION>
Bandit gets up and begins untying the hammock from the tree. Kyle crosses to him.
</DIRECTION>
<BANDIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Kyle; I ain't in this Truck Roadeo for the money. It's the challenge. You know, the ecstasy of victory, the agony of defeat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT>
<DIRECTION>
Kyle looks out at the cheering crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<KYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe there's two thousand people here to watch a bunch of guys back up their trucks.

</KYLE>

Bandit, wearing aviator shades and his cowboy hat, is backing the truck up and shouting down to Kyle and Dickey on the ground.

Bandit smiles at Dickey again.

And for the first time, we get a real look inside the rig. It's quite a set-up. The opposite of the outside. Home on the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheepskin over the two front seats, a poster of Raquel Welch in a bikini tacked above the windshield, under which is a bumper sticker reading: "Do It For Truckers." On the dash board, a St. Christopher medal and a chattering skull. Also, a stereo tape deck and the best Citizens Band Radio outfit money can buy.

Bandit's truck pulls to a stop in front of a small white clapboard house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
A FEW MINUTES LATER - INSIDE THE HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Most of the furniture is old and what isn't, is covered with plastic. No fancy carpets or objects d'art. On the coffee table is an open, colorfully illustrated Bible. A blonde wood television set sits in a corner of the room. There are a lot of toy trucks lying around and over the mantel is an oil painting of a fancy eighteen-wheeler with an epitaph under it reading: "I'd rather be a truck driver, than be a millionaire..."
</DIRECTION>

Bandit is trying to get into the bedroom, but his path is being blocked by a faded Georgia beauty lost somewhere in her thirties. Waynette Snow.

Bandit takes the moment to slide past Waynette and duck into the bedroom.

<DIRECTION>
THE BEDROOM

is dark. The venetian blinds are drawn. Bandit hurries into the room with Waynette still hollering in the b.g.

Cledus Snow slowly comes up from under the covers and we get our first glimpse of him. He's thirty-three, but you'd never take him for a day under forty. Trucker all the way. He's wearing boxer shorts and an undershirt. As he reaches across to the nightstand and puts on a pair of glasses:

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT THEY SEE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The roadblock. No way around it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bandit looks ahead down both sides of the highway. Thinks quick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: HIGHWAY - DAY - HIGH SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Bandit I comes roaring down the highway headed directly for the roadblock. A farmhouse is off to the side, about a hundred yards before the roadblock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bandit I swerves off the highway, throwing itself into a broadside. The car lurches onto the Farmhouse driveway and barrels across the front yard. It snaps a clothesline full of clothes, sending bras, panties, shirts and socks flying in every direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It then crashes through a chicken yard and corral fence, sending whatever animals are available -- flying toward freedom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RACING ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Bandit I roars across a fruit orchard, weaving in and around rows and rows of trees, finally slamming onto an access road and back onto the highway -- way ahead of the roadblock!

BRANFORD AND HIS MEN

a rattled Kate turns to Bandit. She's about to speak, but sees his intense concentration and says nothing.

Bandit whips the wheel to the right and again, the Cobra is airborne -- flying off the highway, careening down the shoulder, through a creek and up onto another dirt road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHERIFF'S CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
spins around in the middle of the highway -- almost flipping over in the process -- straightens out and takes off over the shoulder after Bandit I.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE SHERIFF BRANFORD'S CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His Deputy is doing at least 80, as he pulls within a few feet of the lead car. The Deputy angrily honks his horn.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat and Bandit I comes roaring straight toward the creek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE BANDIT I
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bandit and Kate see the creek. No bridge. End of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bandit barely has time to hit the brakes, sending the Cobra into a wild fishtail. Kate desperately braces herself, hanging onto the dashboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Bandit wheels the Cobra a full 360° and comes to a halt. He looks back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS VIEW - DOWN THE ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a half mile back, the Arkansas Sheriff's are coming on fast. Sirens blasting. The choices are simple. Give up. Or jump the creek.

<BANDIT>

(turning to Kate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, we can either give up or...

The speedometer whizzes past eighty. Bandit holds the wheel tight. Kate takes a breath, then crosses herself.

<DIRECTION>
Bandit grins and as they take off:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS BACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
to the creek. As the first Sheriff's car comes roaring toward the edge doing at least 95. He sees the bridge is out, hits his brakes, goes broadside and flies over the side -- into the creek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat and Sheriff Branford's car comes wailing down the road. The Deputy slams down his brakes in the nick of time and the car skids halfway over the edge -- hanging suspended in mid-air halfway over the creek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the Third Sheriff's car comes barrelling down the road, spots Branford's car hanging over the edge and brakes. But its rear end slings around, smashing into the rear of Branford's car, sending it flying into the creek. A huge splash, then:

THE HIGHWAY

<DIRECTION>
Bandit I streaks past, Kate driving. A beat and a big rig, hauling a crane comes out of a side road. The truck moves slowly down the highway -- a wide load.

Clayton floors it and hunches low over the wheel as he passes the truck -- afraid the crane's going to take off his head.

They're speeding around curves now, Kate doing her best to control the Cobra. She takes a corner too fast and too wide. Bandit I drifts into the oncoming lane and suddenly they're staring at:

The Center Fielder is absolutely flabbergasted, as Kate straightens out the Shelby Cobra and takes off across the baseball field.

She roars over second base and does a 360° fishtail in the middle of the pitchers mound. PLAYERS scatter in every direction.

Sheriff Clayton's car comes to a sliding halt in front of the fence. He looks around for some sign of Bandit I. Nothing. They've vanished.

Cledus nails one of them with a pool cue to the nuts. The Biker screams and doubles over. A Biker flies over the pool table and crashes into Cledus from behind -- knocking the pool cue away. Another Biker rushes in, but gets Cledus' Frye Boot in the gut for his trouble.

But then the other two nail Cledus from each side and it's over. They've got him. Cledus tries to shake himself loose, but the First Biker, picks himself up from the jukebox, strolls over and lets him have it twice in the groin. Cledus doubles over. Onto the ground.

Cledus pulls the big eighteen-wheeler off the scales and into the inspection area.

	C'mon, Ebersol... I've been through this chicken coop a hundred times...

But the Weight Station Worker and the Georgia Highway Patrolman have already started toward the rear of Bandit II. The Weight Station Worker jumps up to unlatch Bandit II's back doors.

FULL SHOT

<DIRECTION>
The Highway Patrolman and the Weight Station Worker dive for cover, as Bandit I blasts past them, doing at least 90.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bandit whips the wheel to the right and the Shelby Cobra roars around the Weight Station Shack on two wheels -- tires screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Weight Station Worker and Georgia Highway Patrolman rush back toward the Shack, completely forgetting Cledus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Cledus casually eases the rig into first and rolls out of the parking area, onto the highway.

Nobody notices Cledus drive off, as Bandit I continues screaming around the Weight Station -- tires smoking.

Bandit sees Cledus has safely returned to the highway and whips around the Weight Station Shack for the final time and hits the highway on ramp doing 100.

The Two Georgia Highway Patrolmen race toward their cars, leap and take off after Bandit I -- lights and sirens blaring.

The Two Georgia Highway Patrol cars race past Bandit II. Cledus gives them a small wave. They don't notice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANDIT I - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the Cobra comes racing up to the rear of a long line of slowmoving traffic. Bandit moves out to pass and sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PICKUP TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
coming straight at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANDIT I
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
swerves onto the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PICKUP TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
does the same.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANDIT I AND THE PICKUP TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bandit I swerves back onto the highway. So does the Pickup. And it looks like a head-on for sure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the last instant, Bandit swerves back onto the shoulder. The Pickup rips past him and Bandit manages to pull the Cobra back onto the highway and into the free lane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the Pickup Truck now is face-to-face with the First Georgia Highway Patrol car. They jockey for position. The First Highway Patrol car swerves and passes the Pickup, but the Second one hits the shoulder barely avoiding a head-on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - THE SECOND HIGHWAY PATROL CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it flies over the ditch and does a complete midair end- over-end flip -- landing in a ditch. Out of the chase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE EXPRESSWAY OVERPASS - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bandit I races toward the overpass, the Georgia Highway Patrol car three hundred yards behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bandit I takes the hairpin turn full out and goes into a four wheel drift. Bandit manages to maintain control and punches it in mid-slide, blasting the Cobra through the turn, onto the Expressway below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA HOLDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the Highway Patrol car tries the same feat, loses control and crashes into the chain link divider.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE EXPRESSWAY - FROM ABOVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bandit roars onto the Expressway, sailing right past A GEORGIA STATE TROOPER'S CAR, parked on the shoulder, waiting for speeders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The State Trooper fires up his engine and with red lights twirling and siren wailing, pulls out after Bandit I.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as he does, the Georgia Highway Patrol car comes racing by and they slam into each other -- knocking both cars twenty feet each way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both cars straighten out and wait for the other to take the lead. The Trooper starts off. So does the Highway Patrol car. The Trooper stops, so does the Highway Patrol car. This goes on for several beats until they both start off at the same time -- and smash right into each other again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIGH SHOT - THE EXPRESSWAY

as Bandit I races down the Expressway, the Two Police cars finally get it together and take off after him.

A large red sign reads: WRONG WAY - DO NOT ENTER. Bandit I blasts by the sign and enters the on ramp. Going the wrong way!

Bandit hugging the shoulder. Kate hugging the seat. Petrified.

<DIRECTION>
THE TWO CARS

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, at the last possible instant, the Highway Patrol car swerves to the right, crashing through the guard railing and sailing into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIDAIR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Highway Patrol car flies through the air and crashes down on the back of a moving FLATBED TRACTOR TRAILER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Flatbed Truck just keeps driving. Not even noticing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE EXPRESSWAY - RACING ANGLE - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bandit I, still going the wrong way. Up ahead -- an Expressway full of cars -- headed straight for Bandit I.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bandit floorboards it, flies over the center divider and ends up on the other side of the Expressway, just ahead of Bandit II.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE BANDIT I - MOVING - LATE AFTERNOON

INTERCUT - A DRIVE-IN RESTAURANT

A teenage hangout. Really hopping. Country and Western MUSIC blaring from the radios of Pickup Trucks, VW Vans, Sports Cars, etc, all parked in front of the restaurant. Almost every vehicle sports a CB antenna.

Bandit I whizzes past camera. Wait. Then here comes the Highway Patrol. They've picked up reinforcements. Ten in all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HIGHWAY - IN FRONT OF THE DRIVE-IN - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hot Pants has gathered all the cars from the drive-in and lined them up along both shoulders of the highway. Some are facing east. Some west. The drivers all wait in complete silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, in the distance, the sound of sirens. Coming closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOW ANGLE - THE HIGHWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as a speck rises over a hill and comes barrelling down the center divider, doing at least 120. A beat and a dozen more specks top the hill and roar down the highway in pursuit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The specks quickly take form. Bandit I followed by a dozen Georgia Highway Patrol cars. The vehicles parked along the shoulder all fire up their engines on cue. And wait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bandit I roars past the cars parked along the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The instant Bandit I clears, the vehicles pull off the shoulder and begin moving down the highway -- eastbound and westbound -- all doing a conservative law-abiding 55.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HIGHWAY PATROL CARS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
come roaring down the eastbound lane and find the road totally blocked by teen-age traffic going both ways. They're stuck. Even the shoulders are blocked by cars from the drive-in. Just in case.
</DIRECTION>

And as Bandit I disappears around a distant curve:

<DIRECTION>
The Peach Tree Classic Track looms ahead.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSER STILL - MOVING

as TWENTY-SEVEN POLICE CARS converge behind Bandit I and II, forming an endless line of flashing lights.

Then he looks up ahead. And is speechless.

as it comes barrelling toward the entrance gate, cutting right through the remaining Police cars -- sending them reeling.

Then the big rig blasts through the entrance gate, demolishing it and sending timber flying sky high.

<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>

Bandit II heads for the race track smoke stacks blasting.

A beat and Bandit I, followed by half of Atlanta's Smokeys, comes roaring through what's left of the entrance gate.

The Stock Cars swerve, slide and sail onto the infield -- trying to avoid collisions.

The Convoy of Police Cars, their sirens blasting and their advertising still swirling, are forced to stop -- as the Stock Cars pile up in front of them. Flags go down. The race is abruptly halted. A helicopter still hovers low overhead.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe six months with good behavior.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(resigned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One to five.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT>
<KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(coughs, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I guess I gotta hand it to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches into his pocket and brings out a shiny new set of keys. He then gestures toward the sidelines. They all turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT THEY SEE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The late afternoon sun sparkles off the chrome smokestacks of a brand-new KENWORTH EIGHTEEN-WHEELER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kyle hands Bandit the keys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them, the POLICE have all jumped out of their cars -- (which now, along with the stock cars, cover the entire infield -- ) and are rushing toward Bandit and Cledus.
</DIRECTION>
<DICKEY>
<DIRECTION>
(toothy grin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wonder if they'll let you take a K- Whooper to prison?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICKEY>
<CLEDUS>
<DIRECTION>
(to Kyle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mind if I cream your son?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLEDUS>
<KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Bandit)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't sweat it. I'll have y'all out on bail in no time. Fools like you are valuable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KYLE>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE - TRACKING - ACROSS THE TRACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Bandit, Kate and Cledus start across, toward the oncoming rush of police.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they walk:
</DIRECTION>
<BANDIT>
<DIRECTION>
(to Kate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, thanks for the lift.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<BANDIT>
<DIRECTION>
(it was nothing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT>
<DIRECTION>
There's a long pause. The cops are now closing in. Cledus walks toward them -- arms outstretched.
</DIRECTION>
<BANDIT>
<DIRECTION>
(after an uneasy beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can I say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
He grins. The cops are on top of them. Handcuffs on Bandit. Kate moves forward, pushing the cops out of the way. And kisses Bandit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE STANDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as five thousand people cheer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a deafening ROAR is heard O.S. and all heads turn to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHERIFF CLAYTON'S CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
storming through the gate and across the infield. The Texas Highway Patrol car is almost a complete wreck. So is the driver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car comes to a skidding halt and Sheriff Buell Clayton leaps out. He heads straight toward Bandit -- fists clenched.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAYTON>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get your hands off my daughter!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAYTON>
<BANDIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT>
<DIRECTION>
Clayton takes about five more frenzied steps, then suddenly drops to the ground. And faints. Out cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everybody rushes forward, thinking the poor son-of-a-bitch is dead.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Bandit)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's just exhausted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<BANDIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That man is your father?!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT>
<DIRECTION>
She nods. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<BANDIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(speeding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, he's nuts. I mean certifiable. But believe it or not, he once looked great in Levis. That's why my mother married him. But like all good things...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what you're thinking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Bandit says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you thinking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<BANDIT>
<DIRECTION>
(looking over at
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Clayton, still out
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
cold)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gotta admire the man's determination.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT>
<DIRECTION>
She hugs him. A beat and the cops push Bandit and Cledus into the back seat of the lead squad car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Two Cops move around the front, Kate leans in the rear window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE SQUAD CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bandit and Cledus. Handcuffed.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the guys)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, was it worth it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
Bandit and Cledus look at each other. Then nod. Then laugh. Kate laughs with them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the Two Cops hop in the front seat, as the other Twenty- Six Smokey's head for their cars.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Cledus)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take care of Fred.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<DIRECTION>
And now it's almost over. The Cop starts up the engine. Kate and Bandit look at each other for a long moment.
</DIRECTION>
<KATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See ya, Bandit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATE>
<BANDIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See ya, Kate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BANDIT>
<DIRECTION>
Kate backs away from the window, as the squad car pulls out, followed by the endless line of Atlanta's finest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their sirens now silent. But their advertising still flashing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now, as we pull further and further away, watching the whole event become history...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_ONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Breaker, Breaker. This is Banana Peel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_ONE>
<VOICE_TWO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Yeah, Banana Peel, go head on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_TWO>
<VOICE_ONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Did ya hear they nailed the Bandit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_ONE>
<VOICE_TWO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Yeah, I heard. But they won't hold him for long. Anyway, he sure gave them sumbitches a run for their money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_TWO>
<DIRECTION>
And:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
