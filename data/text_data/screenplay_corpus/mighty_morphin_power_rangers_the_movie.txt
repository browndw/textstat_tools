The Rangers crest a hill and Adam, who's in the lead, suddenly drops down - the others following suit.

They peer over the ridge -- their eyes wide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before them, a tenuous rope bridge leads to a vast rock landing. The ocean RAGES BELOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On top of the island is the Nathadian Monolith. It's a mind- boggling wonder from another time and place.
</DIRECTION>

Between the Rangers and the bridge, the Tengu Warriors are on patrol.

EXT. ROPE BRIDGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Tengu are on full alert. One of them hears something, snaps around, there's nothing there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another Tengu looks down as a frog hops between his leg. He SCREECHES and STOMPS down his taloned foot, missing the creature by inches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a CAW and the Queen Tengu squints as she spots a falcon circling in the sky above. The Queen is perched on top of a 20 foot rock face. She looks around hesitantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the Rangers ATTACK, some of them LUNGING OFF ROCKS, others BURSTING out of crevices, others coming over the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Billy wields his WHISTLING sticks -- misses several times, then starts BASHING and THWACKING the feathered beasts.

The Queen SHOOTS A LASER BLAST from her eyes -- it EXPLODES before Tommy.

Rocky takes a deep breath, goes into a crouch position. Incredibly he SCALES THE WALL IN THE SAME WAY HE WENT UP THE POLE. HE FLIPS OVER THE TOP and lands right before the Queen Tengu. He looks her dead in the eye.

All of them turn their mirrors toward the pyramid. A BEAM OF LIGHT SHOOT FROM THE POWER; INTO THE MIRRORS AND BACK IN TO THE POWER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a RUMBLING SOUND as the earth starts to SHAKE. The Rangers look to each other, horrified.
</DIRECTION>

Then everything falls still and silent... and then a miracle happens.
