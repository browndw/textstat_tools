<DIRECTION>
A vast and undulating sea of wheat. We become aware that there are two HEADS sticking out of the stalks of wheat: two men are standing and looking up at the sky. As we move towards them, we begin to hear their conversation...and we can see that the two men are SCOTTY and CHEKOV, dressed in civilian clothing.

A man in a high-tech body harness and parachute LANDS in the wheat flat on his back. His body-suit is charred, scorched, wisps of smoke still curling off of it. There are small thrusters attached to his backpack and boots. Scotty and Chekov move to him. The man removes his helmet. Revealing that it is KIRK. He smiles broadly, like a child who has just come off a roller-coaster.

CLOSE ON A SET OF TURBOLIFT DOORS as they slide open to reveal Kirk, Scotty and Chekov. A bright light shines into their faces and they react. MOVE TO REVEAL - that the bright light is coming from a futuristic CAMERA with a small bank of lights attached to it. The camera is a holographic recorder with two lenses and is worn on an operator's head. There are four JOURNALISTS clustered in front of the Turbolift -- one associated with the camera, the others using PADDS to make notations.

Also clustered around the door are the BRIDGE CREW of the Enterprise-B. Everyone is APPLAUDING as Kirk and the others blink under the bright lights and ENTER the Bridge.

	So, Captain... this is the first Starship Enterprise in thirty years without James T. Kirk in command. How do you feel about that?

</JOURNALIST>
<DIRECTION>
The Journalist has unknowingly touched a nerve. Kirk's eyes flash for a moment -- the longer he's on this Bridge, the more he realizes he doesn't feel good about it at all. He tries to shrug it off with a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just fine. I'm glad to be here to send her on her way...

	It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. My father's told me some... interesting stories about you.

Kirk nods absently. Scotty realizes something...

	So... that's why you've been running around the galaxy like an eighteen-year-old. Finding retirement a little lonely, are we?

The Holo-camera light is shined on Harriman as he shifts in his seat, hesitant to take the plunge. Kirk is drumming his fingers impatiently on his leg. Finally, Harriman takes a breath and straightens his jacket a bit.

Scotty quickly elbows him in the side -- this isn't Kirk's ship. Kirk shuts up. Harriman glances at Kirk.

Harriman frowns again, trying to come up with another solution, but it isn't easy -- it's his first day in command; his ship is under-manned and ill-prepared. It's a nightmare come true. Kirk is itching to get in On this, his fingers digging into the arms of his chair -- but he restrains himself.

The room is filled with the SURVIVORS of the Lakul. They are all members of the EL-AURIAAN race -- humanoid and dressed in distinctive clothing. The survivors are in various states of shock. Many sit on the floor, staring into middle distance. some lie on tables, unconscious. others are mumbling incoherently to themselves. Chekov and the Journalists are moving from person to person trying to get control of the situation as the ship is ROCKED and FLUNG about. Chekov has a tricorder.

MOVE TO REVEAL Guinan's Quarters, which are unlike any of the others on the Enterprise. None of the standard furniture, consoles or decoration are present. The floor is made of tile, not carpet... the walls are draped in exotic fabric. The lighting is moody and subdued.

Picard is standing before Guinan, who is sitting cross- legged on the floor. They talk to each other with an easy familiarity... two old friends who know each other well.

His eye has been caught by an ORNAMENT near the top of the tree. It is a large and beautiful glass ball with a tiny LIGHT at the center in the shape of a star. As Picard watches, the star suddenly GOES OUT... and it radiates a SHIMMERING LIGHT EFFECT that expands outward into the glass sphere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a startling and beautiful ornament whose effect is reminiscent of the star going out, as seen earlier in the movie. But this is just coincidence. this is the way the ornament was designed and it's simply one of many ornaments on the tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PICARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reacts. The image of the ornament has touched a nerve within him somewhere. It has reminded him of something he'd nearly forgotten - a discordant note in an otherwise wondrous and magical scene. He frowns, the reverie momentarily disrupted. But he tries to push it aside, not wanting the spell to be broken. He stands and turns away from the tree and looks out a nearby window -- it's snowing and the beautiful image of snow soothes him for a moment. Then he reacts to something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PICARD'S POV (VFX-P)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
reflected on the pane of glass is the image of the ornament -- it's still blinking. Picard now realizes that this image is not going to go away... he can't hide from it.

Picard turns to see

<DIRECTION>
GUINAN (VFX-P)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
standing before him. She is wearing the same outfit seen in the beginning of the movie on the Enterprise-B. As they talk, the children and the woman continue to move about their business as if Picard and Guinan aren't there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Picard is stunned.

<PICARD>

	Enjoy them, Jean-Luc...

Picard tries to make sense of it- he focuses on Guinan.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guinan, what are you doing here? I thought you were on the Enterprise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<GUINAN>

	I am on the Enterprise...I am also here.

	Left behind...?

Picard glances over at the boy, who is building a play castle out of the 24th-century equivalent of "Lego". For a moment, Picard is tempted to drift back to the warm embrace of the fantasy...

There's a general rush toward the adjacent dining room. The youngest boy looks at Picard, goes over to him and takes his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Papa... are you coming?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<DIRECTION>
Picard looks down into the face of his child. His heart swells, the temptation to stay here and live this out is profound. Almost in a trance, he takes a few steps with the child toward the dining room... His eye is caught again by the unusual ornament on the tree for a moment... torn between the two images. and then, in one of the most difficult moments of his life, he bends down to the child...
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on... go on without me...
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
The boy looks at him quizzically for a moment, then obeys his father and dashes off toward the dining room to join the others. Picard straightens up and tries to steel his voice.

Picard realizes the opportunity before him.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>

<GUINAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't leave. I'm already there, remember?

Picard looks crestfallen for a moment. Guinan gives him an enigmatic smile.
</DIRECTION>
<GUINAN>

<DIRECTION>
Suddenly there's the cry of a HAWK from offscreen. Picard turns at the sound --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KIRK'S HOME - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Picard finds himself standing outside a rustic, but Architecturally striking house with spectacular views in the Canadian Rockies. A hawk is circling overhead, making the crying sound that Picard heard. The air is cold, frigid -- Picard can see his breath. Picard is just starting to adjust to this sudden change in location when he hears the sound of wood being CHOPPED from around the corner of the house. Picard moves to look around the corner and sees -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
James T. Kirk. He's still in his uniform and looks exactly as he did the last time we saw him aboard the Enterprise-B at the beginning of the film. He is vigorously chopping wood with an axe. He's enjoying himself, lost in the sheer pleasure of the manual labor. He's never felt this good in his life. There's no trace of back pain or any other ailment. Picard recognizes the famous Captain - as would any 24 Century Starfleet officer.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	James Kirk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk pauses, looks up at the strange man before him. His expression is wondrous, almost child-like. Like in Picard's Christmas sequence, Kirk is immersed in the sensual feeling of the Nexus. It's like a dream that's over-powered him.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beautiful day, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes... yes, it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk points to a nearby log on the woodpile.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you mind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
It takes Picard a beat before he realizes that Kirk wants him to put the log on the chopping block for him.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
Picard places the log on the block and Kirk gives it a vigorous chop with the axe.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain, do you realize what --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
But Kirk interrupts as he sees something o.c.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a second. I think something's burning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Picard follows his look to see SMOKE billowing out of one of the windows of the house. Kirk rushes into the house, and Picard follows...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KIRK'S HOME- KITCHEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk rushes in. The kitchen's decor is 19th century with a few 23rd Century touches -- copper pans and an antique stove mixed comfortably with computer consoles and Starfleet paraphernalia. Picard hesitates in the doorway -- a little unsure about rushing into some stranger's house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk yanks a burning frying pan of food off the stove. It's very hot -- he quickly sets it down near the sink, waves the smoke away with his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like someone was cooking eggs...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Picard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on in, it's all right. This is my house -- or at least it used to be, I sold it years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Picard comes in and tries to orient Kirk to what's going on.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Captain Jean-Luc Picard of the starship Enterprise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
Before Kirk can react to this remark, an antique CLOCK on a shelf CHIMES as it strikes the hour. Kirk moves to the shelf and looks at the clock in surprise and wonder -- he is entranced by this experience, beginning to connect with things and memories from his past.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This clock... I gave this clock to Bones...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
(pressing on)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm from what you would consider the future... the twenty-fourth century.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk hears what Picard is saying, but like Picard in his fantasy, he is more interested in the sights and sounds around him. A dog barks from o.c. They both look as a large black dog bounds into the room and greets Kirk with enthusiasm.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jake! Jake, you miserable old Mutt... How can you be here?

(to Picard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's been dead seven years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk is still looking around the kitchen when suddenly we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE from somewhere upstairs that stops Kirk in his tracks. As she speaks, we can see the shock on Kirk's face.
</DIRECTION>
<ANTONIA_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Jim, I'm starving. How long are you going to be rattling around that kitchen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANTONIA_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(amazed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Antonia...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk looks at the food on the stove. He's beginning to realize something.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk glances at Picard.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The future... what are you talking about? This is the past...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk moves to a drawer and opens it. Inside is a HORSESHOE with a tiny red bow tied to it. This confirms things for Kirk. He picks up the horseshoe.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is nine years ago... the day I told her I was going back to Starfleet...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk is swept up in the moment, overwhelmed by memories, sensations, feelings. He goes back to the frying pan and looks at the contents with a sudden burst of recognition.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These were Ktarian eggs -- her favorite.I was cooking them to soften the blow...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(re: horseshoe)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I gave her this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Picard steps in.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know how real this must seem to you, but it's not. This isn't Really your house. We've both been caught up in some sort of temporal nexus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
But Kirk's mind is clearly elsewhere... he's being swept away by the emotion of the moment... realizing the opportunity he suddenly has.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dill weed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk indicates a shelf, as if asking Picard to go to it.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a bottle of dill weed on the second shelf to the left, right behind the nutmeg.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk moves to the stove and tosses out the ruined eggs. He cracks open two new eggs on the skillet and begins preparing a breakfast. Picard waits for a moment, then goes to the shelf, grabs the dill weed and hands it to Kirk.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long have you been here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk takes the bottle and uses it to season the eggs.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I was on the Enterprise-B... in the deflector control room... keep stirring these, will you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk moves to a cabinet and begins putting plates on a breakfast tray. Picard is getting a little impatient, but stirs the eggs anyway.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The bulkhead in front of me Disappeared... then I was out there chopping wood.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(back to stove)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk takes the pan of eggs back from Picard.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	History records that you died saving the Enterprise-B from an energy ribbon eighty years ago...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
But Picard's words mean almost nothing to Kirk. He is Thoroughly enjoying himself and Picard is almost a distraction. Kirk begins serving the eggs onto the plates and grabs a small vase of flowers to put on the tray.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(amused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're telling me this is the twenty-fourth century... and I'm dead?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not exactly. As I said, this is some kind of...

</PICARD>
<KIRK>

	Temporal nexus... yeah, I heard you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(frowns at tray)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something's missing...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Then he remembers and turns to look at a nearby toaster -- as if on cue, two slices of toast pop out. Kirk grins and puts the toast on the plates. Kirk picks up the tray and heads for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Captain, I need your help. I want you to leave the Nexus with me.

Kirk goes out of the kitchen and Picard follows...

	We have to go back to a planet called Veridian III and stop a man from destroying a star. There are millions of lives at stake.

Kirk tries to keep it light, hoping this man will go away.

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was like you once... so worried about duty and obligations that I couldn't see anything past this uniform. And in the end, what did it get me? Nothing. Not this time.

Kirk brushes past Picard and stops at the foot of the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(looking up the stairs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to walk up these stairs, march into that bedroom and tell Antonia that I want to marry her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk begins to climb the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This time things are going to be different.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
He goes through a bedroom door and closes it behind him. Picard glances around the room in frustration, then gets a determined look on his face and marches up the stairs after Kirk, grasps the doorknob, opens it and steps through the door into

INT. BARN - DAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Picard suddenly finds himself standing in the doorway of a wooden barn. Straw on the floor... farm implements on the walls... sunlight streaming in through the slats. There are stalls in the barn with a few horses visible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk is standing a short distance away -- he looks surprised as well... and he is no longer holding the tray of food.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
(re: barn)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This doesn't look like your bedroom.

Kirk looks around for a moment, the pieces starting to fall into place. He smiles with a growing realization...

	<DIALOGUE>
	I took that horse out for a ride seven years ago... on a spring day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk moves to the barn door and opens it revealing a beautiful spring day.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just like this. If I'm right, this is the day I met Antonia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to Picard.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This Nexus of yours is very clever. I can start all over again -- do things right from day one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk grabs the horse, swings up onto the saddle, and rides out of the barn, filled with excitement. Picard watches him for a moment, then looks at one of the other horses in the barn. he makes a decision and then moves toward a saddle hanging on the wall...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY (VFX-P)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk is riding his horse hard over the countryside -- and across a stream... through a thicket of trees... and finally out onto a rolling plain. There is a large RAVINE up ahead. Kirk sees it and smiles tightly. He spurs his horse faster toward the ravine... The horse is tearing along... comes up to the edge of the precipice, and makes a daring leap to the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Horse and rider land together and Kirk spurs the horse on. But as he rides, we begin to see a change come over him -- a look of doubt crosses his face. Something's not right. He slows the horse to a trot... and then to a complete stop. He sits there for a moment and frowns. turns and looks back at the ravine, which is now a fair distance away. Something about that jump is nagging at him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns his horse around and then digs in his heels. The horse breaks into a gallop, racing back toward the ravine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk grips the reins tight in his hands and then the horse makes the LEAP across yet again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This time when Kirk lands, he brings his horse to an immediate stop. We can see on his face that something is very wrong. He turns and stares at the ravine with a mixture of shock and sadness on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, Picard can be seen approaching on a horse of his own. He stops next to Kirk. There is a long, quiet moment as the two men sit there side by side. Kirk is introspective as he sorts through his feelings...
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(re: ravine)

	<DIALOGUE>
	I must have made this jump fifty times. and every time it scared the hell out of me. But not this time.

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because... it's not real.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
A quiet beat. Kirk turns and looks toward a particular hill in the distance, shading his eyes against the bright sun. Picard follows his gaze and we can now see the distant figure of a WOMAN walking her horse.
</DIRECTION>

	She's not real either, is she? Nothing here is... nothing here matters...

<DIRECTION>
All euphoria is now gone from Kirk -- It's a moment of self-revelation. He glances around.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's kinda like... orbital skydiving. Exciting for a few minutes... but in the end, you haven't really done anything... you haven't made a difference...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk takes a beat, then looks at Picard. And in a way, he's truly seeing him for the first time.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>

There is a passion and a fervor in Kirk that we haven't seen until now.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, let me tell you something - don't. Don't let them promote you... don't let them transfer you... don't let anything take you off the Bridge of that ship...

(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because while you're there, you can make a difference.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
The two captains face each other for a moment. Picard hears what Kirk is saying but also knows that's not the whole story. Picard gives him a direct look, and there is something in Picard's eyes -- a glint of resolve and determination.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>

	You don't need to be on the Bridge of a starship. Come with me. Help me stop Soran.

	Of course, if Spock were here, he'd say I was being an irrational, illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that...

And for the first time, we can see the twinkle in his eye that tells us Jim Kirk is back.

EXT. MOUNTAINTOP - DAY (VFX-P)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soran is standing in front of the forcefield, facing Picard.
</DIRECTION>
<SORAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, if you'll excuse me, Captain, I have an appointment with Eternity and I don't want to be late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SORAN>
<DIRECTION>
We realize we are watching the same events play out again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soran turns and begins to climb up the scaffolding toward the top of the rock face. Picard drops to the ground on his back and begins to wriggle underneath the forcefield. Picard accidentally TOUCHES the field...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SORAN (VFX-P)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
turns at the sound of the field, sees Picard, and then draws his weapon. Soran quickly FIRES at Picard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GROUND (VFX-P)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is BLASTED APART, creating a cloud of dirt and debris, obscuring Picard and the whole area momentarily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Soran jumps down one level, his disruptor still in his hand, ready just in case Picard somehow survived.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soran peers through the cloud of dust and debris.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- The dust CLEARS... but Picard is gone along with several feet of the ground where he was crawling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SORAN (VFX-I)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soran glances up at the sky and sees the ENERGY RIBBON, then begins to climb the scaffolding. Suddenly a BOOT kicks him in the head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVEAL KIRK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who is attacking Soran in Picard's place. The two men begin to fight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE (VFX-P)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Picard rushes to the probe launcher and steps up onto the control platform and desperately begins trying to shut down the launcher...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The following happens very quickly:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Kirk fights with Soran, hand-to-hand, brutal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Picard works the control panel, trying to make sense of it all. It won't respond. The control panel is bizarre and confusing -- many different screens and alien graphics. The alien countdown graphics continues to race by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SKY (VFX-I)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the distant energy ribbon can be seen getting closer...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MOUNTAINTOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soran tries to pull his disruptor, but Kirk knocks it to the ground. There's a struggle for the weapon...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Picard looks helplessly at the control panel. Nothing he does has any effect. He keeps hitting buttons...looking for other control panels, anything to affect the launcher.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE (VFX-P)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Picard touches one particular control and the screen CHANGES to an image of the Veridian SUN, held in the center of the alien CROSS-HAIR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PICARD (VFX-P)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
begins working the control panel... desperate... he looks at the screen... hits a control. Suddenly the probe CLOAKS. Picard reacts at his mistake. Picard is left standing on an invisible platform three feet in the air -- a bizarre sight. Picard isn't sure what to do -- he can feel the console, but he can't see any of the controls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Kirk punches Soran and sends him flying backward. Soran lands heavily on the ground, unconscious. Kirk stands over him, breathing heavily. He holds his back in pain -- that old back pain from the beginning of the movie.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
(desperate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kirk -- there's a control PADD in his right pocket!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
KIRK (VFX-P)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sees Picard standing in mid-air and then reaches down, pulls the control PADD out of Soran's pocket. He begins working it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON SORAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes open... he sees what Kirk is doing... looks around quickly... sees the disruptor lying a few feet away, just beyond his reach...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PROBE LAUNCHER (VFX-P)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Decloaks. Picard goes back to working on the controls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KIRK (VFX-P)

he smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The twenty-fourth century isn't so tough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Without warning, Kirk is BLASTED forward, shot from behind. Reveal Soran on the ground with the disruptor in his hand. He gets up, whirls around, points the weapon at Picard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOUNTAINTOP - WIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The probe is suddenly LAUNCHED in a roar of flame. Soran freezes. His eyes follow the probe as it arcs into the sky. The two men watch the probe as it heads toward the sun...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PROBE (VFX-I)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
makes a sweeping turn to the right and arcs back down toward the planet. Soran watches in horror as the probe crashes harmlessly into the distant jungle. We hear a muffled explosion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SORAN (VFX-I)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
can't believe his dreams have been shattered. He looks into the sky and sees the distant ribbon streaking overhead. The disruptor falls from his hand as he rushes to the top of the scaffolding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PICARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
moves to Kirk, checks his pulse. The Captain's eyes flutter -- he's still holding on, but he's badly wounded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SORAN (VFX-I)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is standing on the rock ledge. He reaches up toward the sky as if trying to grab the Ribbon with his bare hands...but the ribbon passes by and disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<SORAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SORAN>
<DIRECTION>
His look of shock turns to fury and madness. He turns to Picard.
</DIRECTION>
<SORAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YOU!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SORAN>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE (VFX-P)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He jumps down a few levels and then DIVES off the scaffolding at Picard. But Picard is quicker. He GRABS the disruptor and FIRES -- the BLAST CATCHES SORAN IN MID-AIR .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soran drops to the ground a short distance away. Dead. The pocket watch has been shattered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PICARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
turns back to Kirk, cradles the dying man's head in his lap. Kirk's eyes flick open, and he takes a ragged breath.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice shot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk coughs. His eyes flutter. He's fading fast.
</DIRECTION>
<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll find a way to contact the Enterprise. You're going to be all right.

<PICARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try to hang on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PICARD>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk looks up at the sky. the sunlight is warm on his face. A quiet moment... then, with a last smile on his face
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was fun.

Close on Picard's hand
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he places a stone on a large pile of other stones. MOVE TO REVEAL that Picard is placing the final few rocks on Kirk's grave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches into a pocket and pulls out Kirk's command insignia pin. He carefully places it on the grave... and stands there silently for a few moments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A distant WHINE of engines can be heard. Picard looks up into the sky...
</DIRECTION>

PICARD'S POV (VFX-I)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An Enterprise SHUTTLECRAFT is flying through the sky toward the mountaintop.

The shuttle has just landed, and the door OPENS as Picard enters the clearing. Worf, Geordi and N.D. security guards jump out to meet him.

Picard moves toward the shuttle... then stops as he notices that the shuttle is damaged. Picard turns and notices for the first time that La Forge has a bandage on his face and Worf's uniform is torn.
