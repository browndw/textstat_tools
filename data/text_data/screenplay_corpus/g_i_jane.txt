INT. SENATE HEARING ROOM - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blinding in their white uniforms, naval flag officers sit in the audience, showing their support for THEODORE HAYES, a 50-year-old civilian. This is his confirmation hearing. Reading from prepared material:
</DIRECTION>
<HAYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... last few years have brought many advances in the interests of women in naval service, particularly in the land-based maritime specialties. What's more, the Navy has instituted special sensitivity courses with an eye on --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAYES>
<DEHAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa, whoa, whoa. "Land-based maritime specialties." Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEHAVEN>
<DIRECTION>
At the center of a dais, LILLIAN DEHAVEN leans back to ponder the ceiling of the hearing room. Her plaque card reads "CHAIRPERSON -- SENATE ARMS COMMITTEE." DeHaven is a tough-hided old Southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara at 60. In her arsenal she carries conversational hand-grenades -- and she's apt to pull a pin at the slightest whim.
</DIRECTION>
<DEHAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would that be anything like "typing"? "Restocking the cupboards"? That sort of thing, Mr. Hayes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEHAVEN>
<DIRECTION>
CHUCKLES from the packed gallery. The flag officers go stone-faced. Hayes forces a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<HAYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hardly the case, Senator.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAYES>
<DEHAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type. I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military. Case in point...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEHAVEN>
<DIRECTION>
On cue, aides begin distributing reports to other members of the dais. Hayes gets a copy, too. And it jars him.
</DIRECTION>
<DEHAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"The Lark Report."
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEHAVEN>
<HAYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam Senator... this is an internal document of the U.S. Navy. I must seriously question whether --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAYES>
<DEHAVEN>
<DIRECTION>
(to others on panel)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier. Female aviator, it just so happens.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Hayes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEHAVEN>
<HAYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was one member of the investigating commission.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAYES>
<DEHAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's. And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEHAVEN>
<HAYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm really not prepared for any kind of in-depth review of --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAYES>
<DEHAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything, Mr. Hayes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEHAVEN>
<DIRECTION>
A humorless smile. She's roasting his nuts over an open fire, and everyone knows it.
</DIRECTION>
<HAYES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The commission concluded that the aviator in question failed to execute a proper approach to the carrier.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAYES>
<DEHAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(closing report)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this. Never. I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes. Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
	</DIALOGUE>

INT. CORRIDOR - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heading for her office, DeHaven is escorted by a small PRESS RETINUE.
</DIRECTION>
<DEHAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... a full 35 percent of all jobs in the U.S. military are still, to this day, off-limits to women. And that's simply gotta change.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEHAVEN>
<PRESS_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about those who say women aren't suited for all jobs? That they're physically weaker... they have less stamina...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRESS_1>
<DEHAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. And we're gonna hog the bathroom, too.
	</DIALOGUE>

DEHAVEN'S AIDE catches up, pulls her aside.

INT. DEHAVEN'S OFFICE - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shoes dumped on her desk, DeHaven changes out knee-high stockings while devoting one ear to...
</DIRECTION>
<WHITE_HOUSE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... to reassure you that he has every faith in the ability of Mr. Hayes to guide the Navy into the next century. The task, as the Administration sees it, is to acknowledge changing realities without losing traditional values.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE_HOUSE_1>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. DeHaven looks between the two WHITE HOUSE boys -- #1 young and eager, #2 older and cagier.
</DIRECTION>
<DEHAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Zat it? Ten minutes, nothin' on the table? Sweetcakes, you best go back to the President and tell him to open up the phone book and start lookin' for his next nominee.

White House #1 looks spanked. Taking over, #2 pops a briefcase. An inch-think report appears before DeHaven.
</DIRECTION>
<WHITE_HOUSE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Administration's plan for 100 percent integration. If female candidates measure up in a series of test cases, the President will support full integration within three years' time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE_HOUSE_2>
<DIRECTION>
Surprised -- maybe even startled -- DeHaven flips through the report, absorbing by osmosis.
</DIRECTION>
<WHITE_HOUSE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's your gender-blind Navy, Senator. Surely you're not going to balk now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE_HOUSE_2>
<DEHAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's just that askin' you all to integrate the Navy is like sending a man to do a woman's job.

	How do you propose to handle the Combat Exclusion Laws?

	By calling women "Honorary Men." Ingenious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEHAVEN>
<WHITE_HOUSE_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Senator, President's pitchin' right down the center of your plate. If women measure up to men, they've got the job. You going to take a swing? Or step out of the box?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHITE_HOUSE_2>
<DIRECTION>
DeHaven riffles the edges of the report, thinking it over. Thinking light years ahead.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY

Buttoning up topcoats, the White House boys move down marble steps to reach a pair of limousines. Hayes and two FLAG OFFICERS wait.

<FLAG_OFFICER_1>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I suggest we start there.
	</DIALOGUE>

EXT. POTOMAC RIVER - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

Winterscape: Dotted with ice floes, the Potomac wends through the capitol city, banks iridescent with snow, morning water calm. There's an almost hallowed beauty to it all. Soon we pick out...
</DIRECTION>

A spot of day-glo. Coming out of the mouth of morning. Overtaking the floes.

CLOSER on JORDAN O'NEIL. She pushes her flat-water kayak downriver, paddling hard and clean, making good time. Gliding through the graceful arches of the Arlington bridge, she passes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cars overhead. Grid-locked by snow conditions.

In seconds Jordan paddles clear, leaving the traffic behind as she heads toward the Washington Monument. Something BURRS from a life-vest pocket. She rips through velcro to free a cell phone.

Riding the current, Jordan blows a troubled sigh as she accesses the file of her brain. Drifting past the Jefferson Memorial:
</DIRECTION>
<JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	North Korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world. The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system. Extraction team has to be small and silent -- I'd go with Seals over Delta Force. Problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice. Where's The Polk?
	</DIALOGUE>

INTERCUTTING:

	Quick-hit technique used by Capone. Rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles. All his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride. Check the files -- DPRK-57 -- I doped it out as a contingency plan: Seal Team infiltrates, picks up the package, links up with recovery sub. But don't waste time opening and closing hatches. They just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORDAN>
<DIRECTION>
A dubious beat.

	You expect the extraction team to ride the sub bare-back? Is that correct, O'Neil?

Silence on the radio: They're discussing her scenario privately. During, Jordan's kayak reaches the junction of the Potomac and the Anacostia rivers. On the far bank lies...

Naval Intel Center (N.I.C.), bristling with communication antennae.

For a beat, COMMANDING OFFICER (C.O.) TURRENTINE takes stock of the female in his doorway, sizing her up like a fighter across the ring. Then he stubs out a perfectly good cigar, rises with an amiable face, and touches the back of a chair -- stopping just short of pulling it out for her.

Other eyes quickly lock in on...

<DIRECTION>
Jordan. Across a grass courtyard, she walks the ground floor of an identical building, trying to match key number to room number. Every door is open, every room empty. Soon she feels the presence of...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men. They're disgorging from their rooms -- ten, twenty, thirty of them -- all buffed and cut. These guys are what Hitler saw in his dreams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jordan picks up her pace. Where the hell is her room?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On all three levels of their building, the men shadow Jordan en masse. Not hooting. Not leering. Just assessing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jordan finds her room at the far corner of the building: She's got the entire floor to herself. With a last look over her shoulder, Jordan vanishes inside.

CAMERA SURVEYS faces of the trainees: MILLER, MCCOOL, SLUTNIK, CORTEZ, FLEA, STAMM, ENGLAND, NEWBERRY, WICKWIRE. We'll get to know them later. Dressed in Navy greens, they stand in formation -- ten rows, ten deep, helmets in hand. Pacing before them:
</DIRECTION>
<C_O>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is all that will be said about the special nature of this class -- by us or by you. Many of you have waited years for admission to this program. Opportunities like this are rare -- and those who seize upon them are rarer still.

Taking over, THE CHIEF stands before the class a moment, sizing them up while giving them -- get an eyeload of him, too: His body is 30 years old, his face 40, his eyes 50. An ageless warrior. Somewhere, the blood of Ulysses runs in this guy's veins.

	You may think that you are the brightest, the best, the strongest. I assure you, that is a total delusion on your part. It is my job to show you just how weak human beings can truly be. 60 percent of you will not finish this course. How do I know? Because that is an historical fact.

Two beds. Matching lockers. A desk, a chair, a mirror. All overwhelmingly dull.

EXT. OBSTACLE COURSE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An explosion of sand: England and Wickwire belly-flop into a sand pit and speed-crawl under barbed wire. Clear, they gain their feet and blitz toward...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rolling logs. They balance-beam their way to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rope climb. Racing to the top, they reach a platform and fling themselves down onto...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The high poles. They land awkwardly, losing their wind and their grip, tumbling into the sand pit below before...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Racing for the finish. The Chief thumbs a stopwatch.
</DIRECTION>

	England, 88 seconds. You're good to go for the slide-for-life. Wickwire, roll back till you get south of 90.

</INSTRUCTOR_PYRO>
<DIRECTION>
Wickwire dusts off and starts back for...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The starting line. Stepping up next is Cortez, the human fighting cock. Jordan lines up beside him and psyches up for the first obstacle -- and eight-foot sheer wall.
</DIRECTION>
<INSTRUCTOR_JOHNS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang on, here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INSTRUCTOR_JOHNS>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs something off a truck and positions it at the base of the wall. It's a little two-step platform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SNICKERS, MOANS from the guys. Cortez can barely contain his disgust.

	</DIALOGUE>
</INSTRUCTOR_JOHNS>
<DIRECTION>
Cortez blurs away. Jordan starts a step late.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cortez takes the wall clean. Eschewing the two-step, Jordan jumps right over it -- but jumps too far out because of it. She takes the wall awkwardly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT the others as they break rank to follow, eager to see Cortez blow her off the course.
</DIRECTION>
<CLASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lesgo, Cortez, LESGO, GO, GO!

Cortez belly-flops into the sand pit -- and snags going under the barbed wire.
</DIRECTION>
<CORTEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit of a saint...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORTEZ>
<DIRECTION>
Catching up, Jordan clears the wire without a hitch and leads going into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rolling logs. They both tight-rope across nimbly and bound on toward...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rope climb. Jordan starts up at a decent clip -- but Cortez comes from behind like a chimp on white sugar, doubling her speed.
</DIRECTION>
<CLASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take her, take her here, Cortez... lookit that monkey-man go... hoo- yah, hoo-yah...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLASS>
<DIRECTION>
Cortez reaches the top platform. Now he's faced with...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The high poles. He's seen others land sideways and pay the price. Trying another way, Cortez takes a flying leap...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And WHUMPS down with legs astraddle. He tried to cushion the landing with his hands -- and failed magnificently. His balls took the brunt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jordan WHUMPS down beside him with legs astraddle -- and shoots Cortez a "Hey, no problem" look. She rolls off the poles...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And drops to the pit below. Cortez lands right behind. Now it's a flat-out sprint for...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The finish line. He takes her at the tape.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_CHIEF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cortez, 93 seconds. O'Neil, 94. Cortez, do a little rescue-recovery on your gonads and line up again. O'Neil... move ahead.

Heading back to the starting line, Jordan wheels around.
</DIRECTION>
<JORDAN>

<INSTRUCTOR_PYRO>

	Automatic five-second deduction, which slips you under the wire. It's called "gender-norming," O'Neil -- standard procedure for all females in physical training courses. Where you been the last few years?

An on-base bungalow. Jordan bangs on the front door until the C.O.'S scowling face appears.

	Pardon the hour, sir. But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.

	It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment. It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.

<C_O>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I was civil, now you're complaining.
	</DIALOGUE>
</C_O>
<JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't afford civility, sir. How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider? Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..." I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?

	<DIALOGUE>
	What I resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment. What I resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day-care center I have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the OB/GYN I have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears.
	</DIALOGUE>

	But most of all, lieutenant, I resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three-dollar-and-fifty- nine cent cigar, which I will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities. DOES IT?

A car parks at barricades. Jordan and Royce emerge, both in uniforms.

Not waiting for directions, Jordan takes the Capitol steps two at a time. We've seen this look on her face before -- and last time, she nearly knocked the grinder bell into orbit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jordan and Royce move quickly down a corridor, eyes hunting, passing CAPITOL GUIDES and their tourists. Soon they find...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DeHaven's office. A Navy captain exits with paperwork. Hasty salutes.
</DIRECTION>
<ROYCE>

The captain. He has a distinct bald spot.

In a side office, DeHaven's aide overhears. He rises quickly and enters the foyer.
</DIRECTION>
<DEHAVEN_S_AIDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms. O'Neil. Yes, of course. I'm Douglas Champeau. Unfortunately, the Senator is in chamber right now. How can I help you?

	What chamber? Which way is that?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, which way?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORDAN>
<DEHAVEN_S_AIDE>

	She really can't be disturbed. But if you care to wait, I'll find you an office with a phone. It might be several hours, but --

A TOURIST pokes in.

Over the aide's shoulder, Jordan watches as...

<DIRECTION>
INT. SENATE CHAMBER - CAPITOL BLDG. - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the chamber floor, SENATORS mull about, consulting aides, polling party mates. PAGES place microphones and fill the ceremonial snuff boxes, readying the room for session. Among the activity, we find...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DeHaven. Caucusing with another Democrat.
</DIRECTION>
<JORDAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Senator DeHaven...

DeHaven looks behind her. Nobody.

<JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DeHaven...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORDAN>
<DIRECTION>
Now she looks up to behold...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jordan standing in the gallery. Staring down on DeHaven as she is, it's hard to read anything into her expression but open disdain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drawn by Jordan's voice, a CAPITOL GUARD hurries down the gallery steps. Royce runs interference.
</DIRECTION>
<JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can talk here or we can talk outside, Senator. You tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORDAN>
<DIRECTION>
On the floor, half the U.S. Senate stops what it's doing and looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the gallery, the guard is thrown off-balance by the naval uniforms: Do Royce and Jordan belong here or not? Confused, he looks for guidance from...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DeHaven. She notes C-SPAN cameras swinging Jordan's way. Summoning a page:
</DIRECTION>
<DEHAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cloak room. I'll meet her there. Just her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEHAVEN>
<DIRECTION>

Towering doors swing open. DeHaven appears, face pleasant but harried.

	Jordan. I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --

</JORDAN>
<DIRECTION>
About to hug Jordan, DeHaven stops awkwardly.
</DIRECTION>
<JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORDAN>
<DEHAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sounds familiar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEHAVEN>
<JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It should. You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORDAN>
<DEHAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jordan. Might we do this over lunch tomorrow? I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEHAVEN>
<JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you set me up? Did you set me up just to see me fail?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORDAN>
<DEHAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEHAVEN>
<DIRECTION>
DeHaven glances back at the doors to the Senate chamber -- the open doors. Walking Jordan a few steps away:
</DIRECTION>
<DEHAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wickwire was there to help. To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot. At least that was the intent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEHAVEN>
<JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What changed?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORDAN>
<DEHAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should probably ask him that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEHAVEN>
<JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORDAN>
<DIRECTION>
It's a threat DeHaven doesn't appreciate. The Senate DOORKEEPER appears.
</DIRECTION>
<DOORKEEPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Madam Senator? Your esteemed colleagues are requesting --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOORKEEPER>
<DEHAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two seconds, Walter.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(answering Jordan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In 1981, the Supreme Court was asked to rule on the issue of women in combat positions. The Court cited the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws as a legal foundation for keeping women ineligible. That decision held for all these years -- until the White House, 10 days ago, moved to have the Exclusion Laws voided. To demolish that legal foundation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEHAVEN>
<JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So? Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORDAN>
<DEHAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What he did was light the bandwagon on fire. Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEHAVEN>
<JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORDAN>
<DEHAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In face, I do: Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEHAVEN>
<JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you saying? That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORDAN>
<DEHAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him. He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEHAVEN>
<DIRECTION>
Jordan shakes her head in disbelief. She has met the enemy -- and she is us.
</DIRECTION>
<JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were never going to let women serve in combat. You always had a safety net. Or thought you did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORDAN>
<DEHAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jordan. I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEHAVEN>
<JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JORDAN>
<DEHAVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The reality is this: We send far too many men off to war. I don't need to compound the problem with women.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off Jordan's look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life? Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEHAVEN>
<JORDAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted the choice. The chance to prove myself, my skills, my work, me. That's how it should've been.

Not happy about it, the doorkeeper reaches into an alcove, grabs a broom he keeps around for just these occasions. He enters the chamber...

... and moves behind the rostrum. Holding the broom by the bristles, the doorkeeper stands on tip-toes...

And uses the broom handle to turn back the Senate clock by three minutes.

Senators GROAN. It's an old trick played by senior members -- and they all hate it when it happens to them.

Through a window, we see the C.O. with a phone pressed to his ear. He stands at attention even though wearing a bathrobe. Half-audible through the glass:

<C_O>

	One of you here understands better than anyone what this is all about. Someone who has engaged in conduct unbecoming. Someone who knows, I would hope, what he must now do.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE on Wickwire. Feeling the heat. Wondering if they really know who it is. Now the C.O. parks himself right in Wickwire's face.

	And unless that someone takes the honorable way out in the next 10 seconds -- I will make certain he faces action under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

Wickwire breaks rank and heads for the bell. He slows when reaching Jordan, considering an apology he knows would be inadequate.

Wedged into a tortured maze of hydraulics and equipment, we find the Chief, operating out of an air-pocket near the windscreen. The pilot is dead, impaled on his cyclic stick, head submerged.
