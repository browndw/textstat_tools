<DIRECTION>
Sounds of a train rolling to a halt, a shrill whistle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UP ON the door of a weathered cattle car as a German soldier steps into frame wearing that familiar gray of the all-too familiar era.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He throws the door to reveal a mass of huddled and frightened people inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The words are not necessary. The language is not ours and the images say enough.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Men, women and children are herded off the train like cattle toward a large open yard. There they huddle until the Germans begin to shout and shove through the mob.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FENCE CORRIDOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are looking up at rows and rows of fences topped with barbed wire all designed to create a separator for the thousands of Jew who pour through each day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then we see the eyes themselves that look up at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LITTLE BOY. A boy who will not die this day. A boy who will live to see the end of the war and the world of the future.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at the metal wire with an unusual fascination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy looks up at HIS WORRIED PARENTS - a sturdy- looking couple who try to smile and comfort him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The corridor comes to a junction where it splits in several different directions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soldiers here push the mob using rifles as pikes, screaming and terrorizing the lot of them. Suddenly it is clear what they are doing. They are dividing the mob into smaller groups.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soon, the groups themselves become evident.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Men from women. Children from adults.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The family tries to stay together, clinging to one another dearly, until finally, they are put upon by a number of gray uniforms and pulled apart. The boy is dragged screaming his feet no longer touching the ground. Two soldiers carry him as they follow the back of a large column of children being led through a gate of barbed wire so dense, it resembles wool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gate closes and the boy looks back to see his parents - along with many others - being restrained by a number of soldiers. The screaming is deafening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the boy's can be heard above it all. The soldiers seem to be having a hard time carrying such a frail child. The farther they get from the fence, the heavier he seems to get, until they are literally pulling him as though he were anchored to something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His outstretched fingers claw at the thin air and he screams until the blood in his face is blue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The soldiers are literally pulled back a step and they begin to slip in the mud. They look at one another and then over their shoulders as they hear a sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A groaning, creaking sound. And then the unmistakable twang of wire stretched to snapping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fence. The gate that separates the parents. It bows toward them like iron filings to a magnet, and several of the strands of barbed wire have given way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy continues to scream as all the other faces simply freeze and wonder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the soldiers pulls a wooden baton from his belt and brains the boy violently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slumps and the soldiers carrying him spring forward as through a rope that was holding them back has been cut. They nearly fall, looking at one another with some concern, some confusion....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then they follow the line of children that has gotten ahead of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy's parents watch him as he -- as they, are taken away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rest of their story is as you would expect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKY - DAY

Bright, bright blue framing a blinding white sun.

PAN DOWN AGAIN TO REVEAL:

The cracked, drought-stricken soil of nowhere.

TITLES:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KENYA - 1978
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of children at play. Tribal children who, without the help of the titles, could be from any age.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They run through a tiny village of tents, playing. Every child holds a long reed-like stick and they chase each other playing their version of tag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As each child is tapped, they chase the others. Each trying to avoid being "it", though never going far enough away to miss the fun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One girl in particular. A PRETTY GIRL OF 12, with unusual white hair, is tagged and immediately shunned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She chases kids this way and that, but to no avail. She is not strong enough, nor agile enough, to win.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tumbles and lands on her stick, snapping it. She stands and, when the children see that her stick is broken, they begin to giggle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The giggles become laughter and the laughter becomes a taunt, and before we even realize, the inherent cruelty of children let loose becomes evident.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They have now formed a circle, at first avoiding her touch with distance, but now growing tighter with menace. In the unspoken manner of children at prey, the group begins to chant in their native tongue - a song we have not heard but sung in a way none-too inviting. They begin to poke at her with the reeds, driving her back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girl now moves to the center of the circle, no longer wishing to tag anyone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONE DEVIOUS CHILD seems to get an idea. He takes his stick and smacks it across her shoulder. She turns to face the child and another swings his stick across her back with a solid THWACK. Before long, mob rule gives way and all the kids are swinging at her and laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It grows to the brink of frenzy, the laughing and the shouting not too unlike the noise of the previous scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
So much so, we may miss the first flake of snow. The children certainly do. It is snowing for a good ten seconds before the last of them stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By then, the snow is thick as flies and wafting down to melt instantly on the hot African soil that has never seen snow before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adults come out of their huts and in from the fields and the whole of the village is soon gathered around the little girl, staring up from the clear blue sky and the snow that falls from nowhere. From nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One by one, all eyes fall on the little girl and the looks of curiosity become looks of fear. Of superstition.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Punctuated by a solid thump.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN OLD MAN looks down at his feet and sees a tiny, misshapen ball of ice, no bigger than his eye. He looks at it, bites it, then pops it in his mouth - breath turning to steam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another such chunk of ice pops him on the head. THE CROWD LAUGHS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look up again and see that mixed with the snow are tiny pellets of hail, seeming to increase in number as the snow mysteriously wanes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the pellets are getting larger. Until they land as hunks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The white haired girl drops to the ground and covers her head as hailstones the size of baseballs plow into the Earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before long, tents are collapsing and panic ensues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And all along the white haired girl sits huddled in the dust, crying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As hailstones fall in a circle around her, never coming closer than then a few feet or so.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONE MORE SKY. This one a backdrop. Cheap paint and tissue paper hung with hooks on a wall just behind the basket on a full court.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we pull back, we see the skyline of New York, crudely made out with its silhouette buildings of dark gray and black - windows of yellow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Among the famous landmarks represented is the Statue of Liberty, complete with a real light bulb burning in the torch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are at a prom. The theme is RHAPSODY IN BLUE and the decor has made tragic efforts to show it. The tablecloths are blue, the napkins are blue - far too many of the tuxes are powder blue, and the blue eye shadow is as heavy as expected.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Peter Gabriel's "In Your Eyes" gives painful indication of the era, but here it is, nonetheless:

INT. BOYS BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several boys are here, bow ties undone - unclipped in most cases. Smoking, drinking from whatever inventive container was used to smuggle in booze. Breath freshener and Visine are the chaser.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some of the guys are rolling joints while others make the sad effort to wave smoke away. Who are they kidding? It's a fog in here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE DOWN THE ROW OF TOILET STALLS to one in particular. Here we find A FRECKLED KID standing in front of mirror, clearly holding himself up from the effect of God knows what.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He talks to his friend in the he stall behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<FRECKLED_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, what's the matter with you?

His friend is on the toilet with his head in his hands. He seems to be in some pain. He is SCOTT SUMMERS - AGE 17.

<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My... eyes...

</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
The freckled kid looks and sees that Scott's eyes are watering so badly that tears are literally streaming through his fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes back to the mirror to look at his own.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... they're burning...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
The freckled kid turns back to him.
</DIRECTION>
<FRECKLED_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dude, how much did you smoke?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRECKLED_KID>
<SCOTT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't smoke anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT>
<DIRECTION>
Scott looks up, taking his hands away, revealing for an instant that his eyes are merely bright red embers in his head. Featureless but for the color.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freckles takes a step back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GYM - OUTSIDE BOYS ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A blinding flash of light shows through the frosted glass in the double door and cuts through the crack into the dark of the gym.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All who see it are stunned. Frozen. A lingering moment of confusion, then:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM, the doors to the Boys Room burst open and the occupants scatter into the gym.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GYM - STALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freckles is still there, legs locked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRECKLES' P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at Scott who is now crying meekly in the stall, covering his eyes again -- afraid to open them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door of the stall across from him swings closed TO REVEAL:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HOLE, PUNCHED THROUGH THE STALL DOOR framing Scott's face perfectly. Pull back to reveal that the hole continues through the wall, into the girl's bathroom next door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the corner several girls huddle together, they are afraid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SENATE HEARING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Packed with reporters and photographers. There's a dais - a raised panel of senators - and a second, lower panel. This is where the "experts" are testifying.

Panning across the faces of several G.O.P. creeps as they watch something with varying degrees of interest.

WASHINGTON D.C. - THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE

A woman's voice holds over the proceedings. It is the voice of JEAN GREY - whom we will soon meet.

<DIRECTION>
As she is speaking, we come to a large screen television at one end of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In every organism on Earth there exists a mutator gene - the X-factor, as it has come to be known. It is the basic building block of evolution - the reason we have evolved from homo habilus...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
FOOTAGE REFLECTS THE VARIOUS STAGES OF HUMAN EVOLUTION. Accompanying it is a GRAPH with a DIAGONAL LINE indicating the ascent of the "human being" as we know it. Accompanying the graph are evolving images of the "evolution of man."

	... to homo erectus, to homo sapiens Neanderthals, and, finally, to homo sapiens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
The animated demo on the screen zooms in on the lowest order of human depicted - homo habilus - a primitive, ape- like humanoid covered in hair. As he is singled out, the terrain of his time appears, along with the harsh signs of his winter.
</DIRECTION>
<JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Taking it's cues from the climate, terrain, various sources of nourishment, the mutator gene tells the body when it needs to change to adapt to a new environment. The process is subtle, normally taking thousands of years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
As the graphic changes and depicts WARMER CLIMATE, the HAIR STARTS TO DISAPPEAR ON THE MAN'S BODY - gradually evolving into the human we now know as ourselves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the terrain is modern, the weather pleasant. The image pulls back and places this man back in line at the front of evolution.
</DIRECTION>
<JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only in the last few thousand years did mankind begin to make clothes for himself, build shelters, use heat and grow food in large quantities. With this man-made environment remaining relatively stable, the X-factor became dormant.

On the room, the reactions, and on JEAN herself.

A strong, attractive woman in her early 30's. A simple placard before her:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JEAN GREY. GENETICALLY ENHANCED RIGHTS ASSOCIATION.

The screen shows the words "PRESENT DAY," where the "evolution line" has resumed its rise.

	For reasons still not known to us, we are seeing what some are calling the beginnings of another stage of evolution -

<DIRECTION>
A MICROPHONED VOICE interrupts. Bearing down is the flamboyant SENATOR SCOTT "FRANK" KELLY, a conservative from Florida, and the hearing's Chairman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just behind him sits his aide HENRY GUYRICH - mid 30's, typical government cog.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're avoiding the question I posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, Ms. Grey. Three words: Are mutants dangerous?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, Senator. The wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.

Another SENATOR (LUCINDA ROWEE) speaks into her microphone:

	Well, we do license people to drive.

	<DIALOGUE>
	But not to live.

Kelly raises a hand, continuing his tirade.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms. Grey -- you work at a school for mutants in Westchester, New York. Can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Math. History. Science. English. Athletics --

<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to --

	<DIALOGUE>
	Control, Senator... we teach them control.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly raises a blown-up photograph: a grainy, super- zoomed, somewhat obscured image of a CAR ON A FREEWAY which appears to have "melted." Now he's really playing to the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was taken by a state police officer in Secaucus, New Jersey. A man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him. I don't know where you come from, Ms. Grey, but where I come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off. You do it the old fashioned way -- you give 'em the finger.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs from the crowd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what you presume to tell this committee -
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I presume nothing, I am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet. Perhaps even your children, Senator.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
The room LAUGHS. Kelly mistaken thinks it is for him, until the double meaning occurs to him. He is momentarily embarrassed, but he quickly recovers.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms. Grey, we are not here to weed out mutants. The Registration Act is designed merely to assess their potential threat - if any - to national security.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd reacts loudly in support of the Senator. Some cheer, some roar, some yell obscenities at Jean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean stands and walks out, pushing her way through reporters now moving in for her response. All the while, Kelly is delivering his last words.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
<DIRECTION>

	Mutants are very real. They are among us. We must know who they are. And above all, we must know what they can do.

AS THE SHOUTS OF THE MOB RISE AND GIVE WAY TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAPITOL BUILDING - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An angry mob outside the Senate hearing. Voices roar in dissent when Jean emerges, coming down the steps without hesitation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sees signs condemning mutants, a scarce few supporting them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of reporters are behind her and more meet her in front, closing her in. Microphones are shove in her face.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTERS_VARIOUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Grey, how do you feel about the Senator's Statement / How is the mutant community reacting? Is it true that mutants are dangerous? / Is there a mutant plot to overthrow the government?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTERS_VARIOUS>
<DIRECTION>
She ignores them all, trying to push through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A KID IN THE CROWD holding a full can of Coke. Smiling to his friend beside him. He fires it over the heads of everyone toward Jean. Perfect trajectory. Closing fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence falls over the crowd. A total silence. An absolute silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All eyes watch in awe at the can and its liquid trail, frozen in mid-air a few inches from Jean's face. It simply hovers there.
</DIRECTION>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not the ones to be afraid of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Using telekinesis she slowly lowers the can to the ground. She shakes her head, almost ashamed of the display. Almost as if to say ìI didn't want to do that.î
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The can rolls down the steps. People move away from it as though the can itself were dangerous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd steps back in genuine fear. Jean simply moves ahead now, unimpeded, still shaking her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CABIN IN THE SNOW COVERED WILDERNESS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smoke curling from the chimney, warm light emanating from the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A well-worn pick-up truck parked axles deep in the snow, the back filled with a cord of cut wood. A hand painted scrawl on the door reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Firewood for Sales
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A slope, just behind the cabin leading to a frozen lake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUSH IN SLOWLY TOWARDS THE CABIN. Ten beers sit cooling in the snow outside the door. We hear LED ZEPPELIN'S ìBLACK DOG.î
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CABIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Music thunders, quite a contrast to the surroundings. A cosy little abode, showing signs of neglect, as though decorated with a gentler touch that passed not too long ago.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large shelf replete with books. An electric mix from Sun Tsu's The Art of War to Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fire burns in the fireplace. On the mantle sit a few old black and white photos of a slightly younger Logan posing with a group of HARD-CASE MILITARY TYPES in a heavily wooded area. We can not tell if they are true Military or simply mercenaries.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the wall above the mantle, a sketch of a beautiful woman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And finally we come to the occupant of the house, sitting at the only table in the center of the room. His back is to us. His hair is coarse and black, sprouting wildly from his head. He is LOGAN. We will come to know him well. As well as we can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Despite the loud, pounding music, he is working with the meticulousness of a watch maker. At the same time, he smokes a thick cigar. A tall bottle of beer on the floor next to his chair. A SINGLE, SILVER DOG TAG hangs from his neck from a battered chain. As we get closer, we look over his shoulder and see what he is working on so intensely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pencil rubs against paper furiously. He is sketching, what we cannot see. But he is definitely caught up in his own minds eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS HEAD SUDDENLY TURNS. He listens to something we cannot begin to hear. A momentary pause, and he goes back to sketching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as he seems to be settling back into the details again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches over and shuts off the music coming from the box beside him. He listens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands, turning around slowly in a circle. He drops the sketch pad on the chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only the crackle of logs in the fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOGAN'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow his gaze around the room. Past the fire which sounds suddenly like a blazing inferno, past the clock which ticks as loud as clapping hands, past the simmering tea-kettle which hisses like a seething cauldron. Finally, he glances at the cigar which we hear crackling nearly as loud as the fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan's senses are amplified many times more then ours, he walks to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
E.C.U.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His nostrils flare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He raises his fist beside his face. For a moment, it seems as if he is just chinking. Then -- SHOOK - THREE STEELY CLAWS some nine inches long, emerge inexplicably from the skin just above Logan's knuckles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan barley turns his head before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WINDOW EXPLODES, letting in freezing wind and billowing snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan is hit from behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The attack is so ferocious that we are unable to make out the attacker. Whatever it is, it is HUGE. We can hear it snarling and see flashes of its claws as it slams Logan back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CABIN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front door SMASHES OPEN. The two combatants roll madly down the hill obscured by flying snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, we see Logan separate from his attacker and CRASH THROUGH THE ICE of the frozen lake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
E.C.U. - A MASSIVE CLAW-LIKE HAND lifts into frame the SHINING DOG TAG hanging from it. The tag's chain slides off and too the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDER ICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan struggles, already short of breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he struggles -- water starts to fill his lungs. His skin goes pale. He is drowning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ABOVE ICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear an angry grunt as the thing starts to hunt for Logan. It stalks across the ice, searching. We catch a glimpse of shoulder, a CLAWED FOOT, a MANE OF HAIR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDER ICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan's struggle has decreased somewhat as his strength wanes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ice above Logan shatters as a clawed hand reaches through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ABOVE ICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A violent YANK. The ice gives way to the soaked and half- frozen Logan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The creature picks Logan up by his face, CUTTING DEEPLY into his cheek, and holds him up like a rag doll. The two are face to face. This is called SABRETOOTH. The reasons are obvious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Teeth like said animal and cat's eyes to match.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mutant, certainly a member of a class remote in the extreme.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then it speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<SABRETOOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not gonna be that easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SABRETOOTH>
<DIRECTION>
Logan, half-drowned, opens his eyes and looks right at Sabretooth as though he's going to say something. Instead, a LUNG-FULL OF WATER comes shooting out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With that, Sabretooth ROARS, as he hoists Logan up and throws him. Logan flies nearly ten yards. He lands head first.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sabretooth skulks over to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the sound of Sabretooth's breathing comes the rising of the wind...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Snow from the ground begins to swirl in the bitter cold air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sabretooth is nearly upon Logan now and the wind rises further, until he must shield his eyes from the bitter icy air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he approaches, we see a fresh cut on Logan's face HEALING BEFORE OUR VERY EYES, leaving not so much as a scratch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SUDDEN FLASH OF LIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lightning. No. Lightning is not red.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sabretooth looks around, puzzled, then down at Logan's motionless body. Then to his feet where a hole in the ice sprouts bubbling water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wind blows so violently now that he nearly misses two figures standing only a few yards away - mere silhouettes in the icy haze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A closer look tells us it is a man and a woman, THEY WEAR STRANGE UNIFORMS of form-fitting material - the man wears a reflective visor that hides his eyes. The woman's face is care revealing dark skin, penetrating eyes and unusual white hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER FLASH - one that seems to come from the man's visor itself. An intense beam of red light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sabretooth looks down and sees the ice at his feet has broken away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He plunges through the ice like a mark in a carnival dunking tank. His massive weight and hairy coat quickly suck him down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TWO FIGURES - CYCLOPS (Scott Summers) AND STORM (Ororo Munroe) - obviously two of the children we saw earlier now grown - move over the hole and calmly watch Sabretooth gather himself and swim back to the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm looks down at the hole, concentrating her intense gaze. The wind whips further and the water in the hole begins to freeze over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDER THE ICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sabretooth wisely concedes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With one last look at the two mysterious figures now nearly obscured by the ice, he turns his body and swims away with the same agility he had on land.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ABOVE THE ICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SNOW AND WIND ARE NOW VIOLENTLY RAGING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cyclops and Storm walk over to Logan and look down at him curiously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOGAN'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look at one another, wondering. Above them, a black shape looms into frame, bringing with it the whining of jet engines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is the X-JET and it is like no other plane we have seen before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan's eyes begin to close as they obscure the last of all perceptible detail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAVERNOUS ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Periodic Table of Elements. A chart made up of blocks depicting the elements and their chemical symbols.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Among the standards like Gold (Au) and Iron (I) and Oxygen (O2) is a new square on simple red construction paper tacked to the top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It contains simply a large letter ìA.î
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING SHOT THROUGH:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are in a laboratory of sorts, quite different from any we have ever seen -- and so are its occupants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MORTIMER TOYNBEE, a dim, loyal thug whose agile leaping ability and superhuman strength have earned him the name TOAD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the room, JOHN ALLERDYCE, a wiry redhead whose ability to control fire with his fingers has earned him the name PYRO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the corner we see BLOB, no explanation needed, devouring a BUCKET of cereal, preariously balanced on his huge belly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are a bestial and sinister bunch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Toad and Pyro are working on:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MACHINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fantastic device which occupies a hallowed space in this lab. It is meticulously designed, and with its intricate circuitry, wires, and power boards, it resembles most closely (and only resembles, because truly it's like nothing we've ever seen before) a combination of an upright torpedo and a fantastic light source -- only far more dark and foreboding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pyro holds a stick of solder in one hand. He lights a lighter with the other, then drops it. Strange thing -- the flame remains hovering about his finger. Quickly the flame intensifies and turns blue, melting the solder over a small circuit board. Then, the flame is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sticks out his hand like a surgeon.
</DIRECTION>
<PYRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hand me the dykes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PYRO>
<DIRECTION>
Toad, both hands occupied, flicks his long tongue and grabs a pair of pliers which he rests in Pyro's hand, leaving them slicked with SLIME. The flame in his finger goes out. The slimy coat over the pliers quickly HARDENS, freezing their action.
</DIRECTION>
<PYRO>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I asked you not to do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PYRO>
<DIRECTION>
Blob laughs. Toad shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the background, almost ignored by them, something is on the television. The news.
</DIRECTION>
<NEWSCASTER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Preparations are nearly completed for the upcoming anniversary gala celebrating the formation of the United Nations. With nearly every invitation confirmed, the occasion promises to be the largest single gathering of world leaders in history.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEWSCASTER>
<DIRECTION>
The image in the screen is a helicopter shot of ELLIS ISLAND, with Liberty Island and the famous Statue in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<NEWSCASTER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ellis Island, once an arrival point for thousands of immigrants crossing the Atlantic with the hopes of a better life, will open its doors again. Only this time it will be to leaders and their families from over 200 nations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEWSCASTER>
<DIRECTION>
Blob belches his skepticism deafeningly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACK FURTHER THROUGH THE LAIR AND OUT THE DOOR as the Newscast drones on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR/OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE MOVE through subterranean corridors and past dozens of projects that share some similarity to the machine we have seen, including crude designs that have been rejected or stripped of their good ideas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FAINTLY we become aware of a clicking sound. Almost like a stopwatch very far away, always growing louder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The newscast has faded and another voice is getting closer from somewhere down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sabretooth emerges around a corner heading towards us, turning just as we get to him. The clicking is loud and clear now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sabretooth enters an office and we follow him. Seated at a desk in the center of the room is MAX LENSHERR - age - somewhere after sixty, but strong and vital for his years. He is more often called MAGNETO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The clicking is from the sound of an executive pendulum thingy on his desk. The six steel balls hang onto one another from string supports in formation depending on how many are let to fly from either end. One ball strikes one and one ball swings out from the other. Two balls and two, and so on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slight difference. There are no strings supporting the balls, thus defying gravity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A chess set - all of its pieces made of beautifully crafted iron - sits on the far end of the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is watching television, or more accurately listening - his eyes looking off into space, deep in thought.
</DIRECTION>
<INTERVIEWER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and the leading voice in the call for Mutant registration is Senator Scott Frank Kelly, of Florida, who claims to support the constitutional rights of the genetically enhanced, but whose crusade to register mutants is gaining popularity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INTERVIEWER>
<DIRECTION>
Now Kelly is on the screen. Magneto shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not this one again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
When Sabretooth clears his throat, the clicking balls instantly freeze and hover there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The volume on the television drops, though no remote is in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Magneto notices Sabretooth's apparent exhaustion, his torn clothing, including the slashes in his side. His look asks ìwhat happened?î
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sabretooth crosses the room and places the shining dog tag on the table. The one he ripped from Logan's neck. He sits at the desk, puzzling over it.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your expression tells me the news is not good, brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<SABRETOOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I lost him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SABRETOOTH>
<MAGNETO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<SABRETOOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was Xavier's people. They knew.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SABRETOOTH>
<DIRECTION>
Frustrated. Magneto inspects the dog tag.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want him. That is all they know because that is all you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing odd about the tag at a glance, military dog tag, weathered and beaten, but certainly plain, Canadian Military, Logan's name, rank, and a faded serial number.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His thumb feels the indention of the word at the bottom of the tag that does not seem to fit here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WOLVERINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the voice of Senator Kelly on the TV. Kelly is on the screen giving good face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he turns up the television, and again, we don't see how, he places the dog tag on his desk, thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think the President's pre-occupation with international affairs has drawn his attention away from this problem. American's deserve the right to decide whether they want their children to be in school with mutants. To be taught by mutants. They also have the right to know the dangers. That's the purpose of registration. And mark my words, if the President isn't strong enough to do what needs to be done...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
As the Senator continues we PULL BACK and see Magneto watching this. He begins speaking over Kelly's diatribe.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you may mark my words, Senator Kelly. All your plotting, all your hatred. I have plans for you. I've seen you come, and I will see you go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
As Magneto turns Logan's dog tag between his fingers, we can't help but notice FADED PURPLE SERIAL NUMBERS TATTOOED IN HIS ARM. He then drops the dog tag on the desk, Magneto stands and heads for the door, Sabretooth follows. The television shuts off and Magneto waves a hand as though beckoning someone to follow. Or some thing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops and looks back at the dog tag on the desk and waves again. A paper clip just next to the dog tag skips off the desk and into Magneto's hand. He drops it, annoyed and tries again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A slight rattle, then nothing more, as though the dog tag were held down by an unimaginable weight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks over and picks up the dog tag, inspecting it, then trying to bend it. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can it be..?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
He puts it back on the desk. Now Magneto concentrates - sending a wave of magnetic force that ripples the air around it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tag trembles, but does not budge. He looks at Sabretooth and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<SABRETOOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that what you're looking for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SABRETOOTH>
<MAGNETO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A piece. Only a piece.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<SABRETOOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it enough?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SABRETOOTH>
<MAGNETO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough for a test.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
And as Magneto looks up at Kelly on the television we:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAN OVER TO A BULLETIN BOARD on the wall beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To a periodic table, smaller than the first.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But still with that red square and added letter ìAî.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WHITE HOUSE - PARKING LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly and Guyrich walk out of the White House on their way to their limousine.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe the President can't see it. I wouldn't be surprised if he has a mutant on his staff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly and Guyrich climb into the limo and slump back in their seats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<GUYRICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you thought of a demonstration of some kind? Maybe use the UN Summit to our advantage. The whole world will be watching.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUYRICH>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not interested in the whole world, Henry... I'm interested in America. Let the rest of the world deal with mutants their own way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<GUYRICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUYRICH>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly rubs his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Guyrich leans to address the driver.
</DIRECTION>
<GUYRICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dulles Airport.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUYRICH>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LABORATORY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Medical monitors beep, keeping track of the vital signs of -- Logan, who lies in a bed in the middle of a medical lab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the wall beside Logan's bed is a light board on which hang Logan's X-rays. Logan's skeleton seems to be more the creation of a Deco architect than of nature. Streamlined, refined... almost manufactured.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is asleep, recovering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean Grey enters the lab. She walks over and examines the X-rays, fascinated by their unique structure. She notices what appears to be an unusually complex network of bones in the forearm. Jean looks down and runs her fingers over the traces of three incisions on the backs of Logan's hands. Jean's eye moves across his body. His rippling muscles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean uncaps an IV needle and moves to the middle of Logan's arm. We cannot help but notice a diamond ring on her left hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean starts to put an IV in Logan's arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as she is sticking the needle in his arm HE JOLTS VIOLENTLY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SNAP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan's hand reaches up quickly, breaking the needle off in his arm. He grabs a startled Jean by the throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is out of bed. She is unable to speak, choked silent by his grip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He places his fist near her face. We see the three faint scars just above his knuckles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hesitation. Logan looks at her for a moment. Taken by her beauty. Then he is on his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean is on the floor, gasping for breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan realizes something is missing. He reaches to his chest and feels for the dog tag. Gone. He stifles a curse.
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at Jean who recoils from him in terror. Logan thinks, then bolts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan comes out into an empty hall. Strange. Deathly quiet. It is very sparse and modern, matching the lab we have just left. Logan runs and goes through the first door he comes to, to keep Jean from seeing where he has gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. READY ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around and sees he is in some sort of locker room. A row of lockers run along one side of the wall. And hanging from the other side in a row, are UNIFORMS, much like the ones Cyclops and Storm were wearing in the snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to rummage through the lockers, coming up with a shirt and pants that almost fit. A pair of sneakers as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hears the sound of approaching foot-steps coming from the hallway. He spots another entrance on the far side of the room and, carrying his clothes, he staggers out, still in considerable pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HANGER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan rushes through the door, looking behind to see if he has been seen. He closes the door and leans back to catch his breath... which stops momentarily as he looks around the massive hanger he has entered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The X-Jet, the stealth plane we saw in Alaska, now sits parked and quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan walks to the plane and stops -- listening. We hear a strange THUMPING. He listens for a second. The sound picks up in speed and we realize that we are listening to the SOUNDS OF A BASKETBALL GAME coming from above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Logan tries to digest this, the door that he had just come through begins to open, letting in a shaft of light. Logan looks around wildly for a moment, looking for a place to hide when -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An elevator door opens in the wall of the hanger ten feet from where Logan now stands. He whips around and runs for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a button marked ìG.î He presses it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator opens on a hallway that doesn't match the rooms we have already seen at all. It is plush and stately, the hallway of a great mansion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hears a voice coming from a room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he gets closer to it, we can begin to hear:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... until the Emperor Constantine converted to Christianity. With that one act, history was changed. The Christians who were once prosecuted and fed to the lions, became accepted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Now the voice is clear as a bell, coming from a room with the door slightly ajar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan peeks in and sees in front of a chalk board, a massive blue furry creature called BEAST. Besides two arms and two legs, the only remotely human thing on his ape-like face is a pair of wire spectacles. He addresses a class of kids between the ages of 16 and 17. Besides the occasional physical alterations, there is an overall oddness to the group, giving way to the fact that in some way or another these are all mutants.
</DIRECTION>
<BEAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So as their leaders went, so did follow the hearts and minds of the people of the Roman empire. Which made for some very happy Christians.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEAST>
<DIRECTION>
Now he sees Logan standing in the door, looking back at him in mute shock.
</DIRECTION>
<BEAST>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEAST>
<DIRECTION>
All the students turn to see Logan, standing in a hospital gown with a mean case of bed head. They start to giggle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan turns and heads down the hallway to the left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan hears footsteps and quickly does a one eighty back down the hallway. He turns a corner, hugging the wall. He halts. A large oak door stands down the hall. He smells something, taking in a deep breath, his head cocking to the side - listening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and looks behind him. More foot steps. Someone is about to enter the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns again, ready to run the other way when he sees the SHADOWS of two more people coming from the other direction. Logan is trapped. He lunges for the large oak door and bursts through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. XAVIER'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan shuts the door and leans his head back against it, exhausted.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, Logan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Logan, still clutching his stolen clothes, opens his eyes and sees a man sitting behind a large mahogany desk -- PROFESSOR CHARLES XAVIER, an intense and intelligent man just to look at him.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like some breakfast?
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
Logan, who was prepared for anything but this, just stares.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, allow me to formally introduce myself -- I am Professor Charles Xavier. This is my school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you know my name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier taps the side of his head with his finger.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not the only one with gifts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
When he speaks, his lips do not move. We realize Logan ìhearsî the voice in his head. In addition, the voice is accompanied by the FAMILIAR SOUND OF FOOT STEPS indicating that perhaps Xavier had herded Logan through the mansion with his mind. He does not like it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier comes out from behind his desk. We see that he is in a MOTORED WHEELCHAIR. Realizing that he is safe for the moment, Logan begins putting on his stolen clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I brought you here so that you would be safe from Magneto.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A very powerful mutant who for some reason has taken an interest in you. I'm not sure why, but until we find out, I must ask you to stay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
Logan looks Xavier over. He is obviously a kind man who is offering his help. Logan is silent for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Logan goes to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier, disappointed, just watches him go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRONT HALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan sees a grand entrance with two huge oak doors and brightly-polished steel knobs that scream ìexit.î He starts in that direction when the doors begin to open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment of traffic, laughing, chatter... then they are all gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets to the doors and pushes them open. Bright white sunlight floods in, nearly blinding him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANSION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first thing he sees through the haze is wings - GIANT WHITE, FEATHERY ANGEL WINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A young boy, no more than fourteen, has them sprouting from his back. He is stretching not only his limbs, but his unusual appendages in the morning breeze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sensing something - the boy turns, and sees this shambling ruin of a man in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Off Logan's expression, we hear the flapping of wings and see his awestruck face following the boy onto the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This only holds his attention for a moment. Logan looks across an expanse of grounds that house the Mansion. A high, wrought-iron gate surrounds the entire property.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He watches as several children play basketball across a large court.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan shakes his head and is out the closing door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier simply watches from his window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANSION - FRONT GATE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan heads for the gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOOK -- Logan pops his claws.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the gate slowly opens -- Inviting him to leave. He pauses, momentarily confused. He takes one long look back at the mansion. And then leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stay for a moment. Watch him go. Then pan across a sign which reads --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PROFESSOR CHARLES XAVIER'S SCHOOL FOR THE GIFTED,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Westchester N.Y..
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PANNING slowly across the road to the thick woods on the other side of the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOMETHING MOVES in the trees, catching our eye. Someone is watching. It is Toad, camouflaged amidst the trees and branches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKY - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A helicopter streaks across the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HELICOPTER - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly sleeps fitfully in the large seat. A bump of turbulence. He wakes suddenly and looks out the window seeing the ocean below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly looks out the window again and sees water. They are flying low.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at Guyrich, who sleeps as well. He wakes him.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where the hell are we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Guyrich looks out the window and looks at Kelly, puzzled. He stands and goes to the door to the cabin of the helicopter.
</DIRECTION>
<GUYRICH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pilot?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUYRICH>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. Guyrich tries to open the door. It's locked.
</DIRECTION>
<GUYRICH>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pilot?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUYRICH>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly looks out the window now and sees the helicopter is closing in on an island - where, is anyone's guess. What is known is that the place is no pleasure resort.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is in fact some sort of refurbished island fortress, complete with turrets, built right into the side of the cliffs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ISLAND HELIPAD - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A clearing in the middle of a ring of trees at the base of a rocky rise. The helicopter touches down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PILOT, wrapped from head to toe in a flight suit and helmet, gets out and opens the side door, exposing Kelly and Guyrich to the intense wind of the rotors. They cover their eyes, cowering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KELLY'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two figures come out of a hole in the mountain. One seems extremely larger than the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guyrich and Kelly step out. As they get closer he can make out Magneto and Sabretooth.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dear God... Dear... God.

	What the hell is this?

</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly is utterly confused. As Magneto nears, Guyrich steps forward to greet him, putting arms around Magneto's neck and kissing him deeply. Then Magneto looks deep and lovingly into Guyrich's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And with that GUY SHAPE SHIFTS into a beautiful woman who herefore will be known as MYSTIQUE. Her body is covered in iridescent blue scales, which complement her lovely, solid yellow eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly, of course, is shocked. Mystique shows a little hip, raising the scales at her mid-section mockingly, as the last of what we thought was Guyrich slips underneath.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>

	You... wha... Who are you... Where is Henry?

Pyro grabs the Senator as he runs back for the helicopter in vain.

<MAGNETO>

	Gosh, I hope so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
As Kelly struggles against all hope.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People like you are the reason people like me exist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
And with that, Mystique walks up.
</DIRECTION>
<MYSTIQUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And people like you are the reason I was afraid to go to school as a child.

With that, Mystique punches Kelly. Knocking him out cold.

INT. MACHINE ROOM - MAGNETO'S LAIR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly comes to.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Magneto walks past him, holding Logan's dog tag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His thumb crushes one last time over the curious ìWolverine.î
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL OUT TO REVEAL:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly is strapped to a metal chair, bound impossibly tight. He struggles. Mystique watches from the far side of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you a ìGod-fearing man,î Senator?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly's reaction tells him he is certainly afraid of something right now.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That term always confused me. As if there were something to fear.

Kelly looks around wildly, terrified.

<MAGNETO>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God after all, is often defined as all- forgiving. A description I rather like. I think what you really are afraid of...

Magneto uses his mind to move Kelly's chair a little closer. Kelly nearly loses it.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	And this law. Your mutant registration act is only the beginning.

<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The intention of registration act -
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<MAGNETO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	INTENTION? Intention, Senator? We are talking about mankind here. His fear. It is only a matter of time before mutants will be herded into camps. Studied for weaknesses. And eventually wiped off the face of the Earth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly shakes his head. There is nothing he can say to sway this man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Magneto turns and admires his machine.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we're much more giving than that. We simply want to share with you... To help you understand.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a leader, Senator Kelly -- you set an example. And if more of you... were like more of us? Well, you'll see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly watches as Magneto takes Logan's dog tag and places it atop a tube at the bottom of a large spire in the center of the room some thirty feet high.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks toward the opposite side of the room and watches as the tag is raised to the top of the device, through the shaft.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't fear God, Senator. And certainly - most certainly... don't fear me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not any more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAGNETO raises his arms and a series of metal rings up from the machine platform that holds the dog tag. With a slight motion of his hand, the rings begin to spin slowly gaining in speed as Magneto controls it with his power.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The air around it ripples, gaining in intensity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WAVES OF MAGNETIC ENERGY POURS from Magneto's hands toward the machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now, Magneto has the rings spinning around the dog tag at such speed, the rings themselves are no longer visible - merely a blur around the stationary tag. Magneto lowers his hands. The machine is now working on its own.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly's eyes grow wide with fear as the metal dog tag begins to glow. Dull at first... the brightly... too brightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The deafening whine of the machine builds louder and louder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly -- SILENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIVE SECONDS OF ABSOLUTE SILENCE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sphere vanishes, enveloped in a light so white, it defies description.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But I'll try:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A light that seems to ooze rather than radiate. A light that fills the room as it expands outward and engulfs everything in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is liquid light. Creeping and unstoppable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From outside the room, Pyro and Sabretooth watch through the window. It comes through, first casting its shadows darkly against the wall, then erasing them as it swallows them - as though they were never there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From under a door, the light leaks in, filling the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All through the lair, air vents, keyholes, drainpipes and the like, the liquid light fills the lair to the gills.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAGNETO'S LAIR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE TURRET ATOP THE LAIR, the light beams up into the night sky, shinning like a beacon for miles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the white light obscures all. Fueled by this tiny piece of metal, the light extends like an ever growing bubble, out and up over the ocean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK FROM THE SMALL ISLAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bubble of white light is easily five miles across.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MACHINE ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly grits his teeth, barely visible in the whiteness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then it is gone. He hangs his head in exhaustion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Magneto himself is a bit overwhelmed. He looks at his own skin - no apparent change. He shakes his head, blinks his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sabretooth and Pyro are also a bit struck by the display and they also seem a bit dazed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Magneto walks over and reaches into the still steaming metal device. His hand comes out holding the dog tag - actually its remains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A frazzled, blackened wire, warped and spent. Nothing more. And this turns to dust in his fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Magneto has amazed even himself this time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The silence is shattered by a phone ringing. Sabretooth picks it up. He listens, then hands the phone to Magneto.
</DIRECTION>
<SABRETOOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've found him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SABRETOOTH>
<DIRECTION>
Magneto puts the phone to his ear. He smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE on Kelly, his skin glistening slightly, almost luminescent. Pinker (healthier?) then it was when he came in.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh... Oh God... what have you done to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Magneto hangs up the phone. He crosses to Kelly, leans in and whispers in his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome to the future... brother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
Magneto stands, looks at his machine, then back at Kelly.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now if you'll excuse me... I have a train to catch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The silver Amtrack moves speedily through the dark countryside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CONDUCTOR makes his way through a half filled car of commuters taking tickets. He passes a restroom and exits the car. He takes a seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan emerges from the restroom, having avoided paying his fare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few seats in front of him, in a grouping of seats that face one another, sit four large guys, early twenties -- They're the guys from your college named Brad that used to get drunk and try to drown freshmen in the toilets. We'll call them BRADS 1, 2, 3, and 4. They are drinking from beer cans in paper bags.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the aisle from them sits a lone oddly pretty twenty year old girl. Her name is ROGUE -- a dark-eyed and somewhat distant creature. From the shawl around her head to her boots, layers of odd clothing wrap every inch of her body, except her face and hands. She looks worn, it is the face of a runaway. Next to her, a dirty duffle bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Brads are staring at Rogue, making lewd comments about her. They have obviously been drinking for awhile.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAD_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD_1>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue looks at him, then quickly looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAD_1>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey... Hey I'm talking to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD_1>
<DIRECTION>
The Brads laugh amongst themselves at her reaction.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAD_2>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at her duffle bag)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD_2>
<BRAD_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Awww... look guys she's shy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD_1>
<BRAD_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe that's why she's alone. Is that why you're alone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD_3>
<DIRECTION>
Brad 4, who is closest to Rogue, leans toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAD_4>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll keep you company.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD_4>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue is silent and turns her back on him, trying to ignore him.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAD_4>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey... I'm talking to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD_4>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue continues to ignore him. This gets Brad 4 angry. The other Brads watch his failure and laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAD_4>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (louder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said I'm talking to you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD_4>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON: Logan, his ears picking up everything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue looks down trying not to look at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brad 4 will not be ignored. He reaches out to the one place which is not covered by clothing that he can reach - - Rogue's hand lying at her side.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAD_4>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (louder still)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD_4>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Brad 4's eyes open wide as if he's in shock, an instant later, he COLLAPSES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue reels back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brad's 1, 2, and 3 stand up, they are angry.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAD_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, what did you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD_1>
<ROGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't touch me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue stands, frightened and confused. Brad blocks her in.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAD_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Brad, she's a mutant!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD_3>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue moves to get away, but Brad 1 shoves Rogue. Rogue falls to the floor of the train, right next to Logan's feet. Brad 1 moves toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Logan steps in front of Brad 1.
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about you sit down and leave the kid alone, alright?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<BRAD_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's a mutant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD_1>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well, nobody's perfect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON: Rogue, she gets up and huddles toward the rear of the train.
</DIRECTION>
<BRAD_1>
<DIRECTION>
(who is considerably larger than Logan)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you should take a seat little fella.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD_1>
<DIRECTION>
He shoves Logan backward. Logan gathers himself. Brad 4 is very weak but regaining consciousness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brads 2 and 3 stand to back their friend against Logan. It's now three against one. All the passengers are watching --
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen -- I don't want any trouble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<BRAD_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well you got trouble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRAD_1>
<DIRECTION>
Brad 1 slams his fist into Logan's stomach. Logan grabs the man's fist and lifts him up and over, slamming him into the train floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brad 2 grabs a commuter's briefcase and smashes it on Logan's head. Bursting open, its contents fly everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan turns. Brad 2 stares wide-eyed as the gash on Logan's head starts to heal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Brad 1 is up. He grabs Logan around the neck from behind. He holds Logan in his head lock while Brad 2 and 3 start punching him in the stomach and face. Logan is taking quite a beating and naturally the entire train of people are doing nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON: Logan's eyes, his pupils are getting smaller. His brow furrows like a wolf. A low guttural GROWL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly rage -- PRIMAL RAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan's feet kick out, his left foot strikes Brad 1 in the face knocking him backward, while his right foot hooks around Brad 2's head dragging him forward. With his left hand Logan grabs Brad 2 by the throat, squeezing the esophagus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brad 2 is paralyzed. His eyes roll up as the oxygen is cut off. Brad 2 collapses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON: Brad 3 running out of the car with the other passengers. A TRANSIT COP pushes past the fleeing passengers, into the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brad 1 still bear hugs Logan from behind. Logan reaches pushing his knuckles against Brad 1's leg. Suddenly:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOOK -- the sound of metal extending. Brad 1 howls in pain. SHOOK -- the sound of metal retracting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brad 1 releases Logan and stares down at three punctured holes in his leg. Logan wheels around, kicks him to the floor, and punches him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All eyes in the train are on Logan, as he raises his fist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOOK -- Logan extends his claws.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan is at the peak of his rage. The passengers stare in disbelief. Even Rogue is astonished.
</DIRECTION>
<TRANSIT_COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Freeze... transit police. Drop your weapon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANSIT_COP>
<DIRECTION>
Logan pauses, only for a second. Brad 1 is wailing for his life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But rage has taken over. Logan raises his blades to finish what he started.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, THE TRAIN LURCHES VIOLENTLY. Logan goes flying backward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train has been brought to a sudden stop -- but the wheels are still turning. Finally, they are shut down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights are out. Everyone gathers themselves. Then comes a low grinding creak. The sound of metal bending. Rivets popping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like the top of a sardine can, the entire side wall of the train car is peeled off. Revealing the terrified passengers inside -- and Magneto, Sabretooth, Mystique Toad and Pyro on the outside. With a final thrust, the air RIPPLES and Magneto tosses the car wall to the side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Passengers from the other cars stare wide-eyed out their windows. The train has stopped at a railroad crossing, the gates are down.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can come out now, Logan. You're among friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
The transit cop rises to his feet, brandishing his pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<TRANSIT_COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Freeze!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRANSIT_COP>
<DIRECTION>
With a turn of his finger, Magneto draws the pistol to him. The cop holds tight and is yanked off the train, onto the ground. With another twist of his hand, Magneto makes the gun leap from the cop's grasp and HOVER, pointing at the cop's head.
</DIRECTION>

THUNDER RUMBLES ACROSS THE SKY

Xavier's metal chair is gripped by magnetic forces. It shakes and begins to inch towards Magneto.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Magneto.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
The chair is pulled closer to Magneto. Cyclops steps forward. Xavier need not turn to know help is coming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Magneto sees and respects Cyclops's power. The chair stops moving.

<XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Cyclops)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's alright... it's alright.
	</DIALOGUE>

Magneto glances at Storm, then Cyclops.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>

Magneto smiles now, tapping his METAL HELMET.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't read my mind?

Xavier's expression falters. It appears as if the helmet has been made to block Xavier from doing just that.

	Is that so?

	You definition of definitive was always a bit extreme for me, Max. What is it like these days?

</XAVIER>
<MAGNETO>

	Let's just say that I am out to make some radical changes. Now come on Charles. For old times sake, for your sake... Leave him to me.

Logan slowly rises from the huddled passengers. Sabretooth fighting the urge to move on him. Logan glares back at Sabretooth.

	Ahh... there you are brother. I believe you possess something I am very much in need of.

Just then, SABRETOOTH ROARS UNCONTROLLABLY and punches Toad in the stomach, doubling him over. Oddly - Toad is laughing. He stands upright.
</DIRECTION>
<TOAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do it again.

Cyclops cannot help laughing. Storm and Jean smile.

<DIRECTION>
Magneto is furious.

Xavier turns back to Logan, still standing in the train car, amidst all the huddled passengers. Suddenly, all the passengers except Rogue lay on the floor and seats and go to sleep. A few of them even snore.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now will you come back with us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
A look crosses Logan's face. Uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I appreciate your concern. But, I do better on my own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier indicates the wreckage of the train.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got less than sixty miles today. I'll make you a deal. Two days. If we haven't figured out what Magneto wants with you by then... I'll bring you back myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
Logan looks up at Xavier suspiciously, hating that he is making sense. Xavier moves closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan looks over at Rogue, covered in her layers of clothes. Storm is helping her off the train, yet taking care not to touch her skin.
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you going to do with her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier looks to Rogue. A warmth comes over his face. An look of understanding. At a glance he has read her mind. He knows her pain -- her struggle. Rogue looks to Xavier. Their eyes meet.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rogue is a beautiful girl, with an extraordinary power. One that even her own family isn't able to accept. She's been on her own for weeks now, searching for a home. A place to belong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier turns to Logan.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- We're going to give her that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
Logan looks at rogue, contemplating this. Then to Xavier.
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forty-eight hours, old man. But if you cross me, I won't feel any guilt about what I do to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
Logan eyes the rest of the gang until he settles his gaze on Jean. He offers a faint seductive smile. This is not lost on Cyclops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAGNETO'S LAIR - CELL - LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cell with bars, but no visible door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly is hunched over his toilet, heaving. His suit is rumpled and dirty, showing signs that time has passed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a television just outside the door:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see SEVERAL NEWS HELICOPTERS circling a platform built against the backdrop of the main entrance to Ellis Island. We see massive security measures, the likes of which have never been attempted, being prepared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(Voice plays over the rest of the scene)
</DIRECTION>
<NEWSCASTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there such a thing as too much security? A possible complication adding to the United Nations Anniversary is the sheer number of security personnel for what will be the largest single summit in the history of the planet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEWSCASTER>
<DIRECTION>
He walks towards the cell and tries to look down the hall, pressing his face to the bars.
</DIRECTION>
<NEWSCASTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O. CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	While the Secret Service has never had difficulty handling one or even several world leaders, it has never had to handle the daunting task of watching over all of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEWSCASTER>
<DIRECTION>
It is only then that he hears a slight crack and his head squeezes between the bars like a soft-shelled egg. He gasps in pain, but more from shock. He pulls his head back with some difficulty and POP, it squeezes right back through.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have you bastards done to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly is horrified. Disgusted. He paces the cell, unable to comprehend what has happened to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is only when he hears the sound of a HELICOPTER IN THE DISTANCE that he reacts. He starts to panic, then collects himself. Then he goes over to the bars again. He pauses, afraid... then:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pops his head through again. He turns his shoulder toward the bars and begins to push. His feet slip in the floor and his fingers stretch and crack inside, then his ribs begin to pop one by one with the brittleness of undercooked spaghetti. It is agonizing, but Kelly finally manages to pull his horribly-altered body through the bars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly's whole chest and pelvis are slightly flattened beneath his clothes, but with a hideous crunching sound, they seem to inflate again back to normal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly looks at his body with a mixture of fascination and disgust.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HEY.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly turns and screams. Blob has just walked into the room and lunges, grabbing him by the arms. Kelly is enveloped in this fat, hulking mass. He manages to keep one hand free and all he can do is push it against Blob's face. It is futile. Until...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steam begins to come off Blob's face. And Blob SCREAMS IN PAIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HELIPAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Senator Kelly's helicopter, which has obviously been pilfered for Magneto's use, lands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Magneto, Sabretooth, Pyro, Mystique (no Toad) all climb out, having returned from their ill-fated attempt to get Logan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - ELSEWHERE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly peers down the hall where we first went on our way to meet Magneto.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly, with only that way to go, does so, passing once again the odd assortment of machines, very reminiscent of the one he was exposed to.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hears voices coming toward him and he looks around wildly, wondering what to do. Shadows foretell the arrival of the brotherhood headed this way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly turns to run back from where he cam from.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - ELSEWHERE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Magneto and Sabretooth come walking from the other end of the hall and pass the very spot where we just saw Kelly. No sign of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From which Kelly has escaped. The bars bend to make room for Magneto as he walks into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are we feeling today, Senator? Advanced, I hope...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
But he freezes when he actually enters the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
First, he sees that Blob is laying on the floor with a purple, welt-like hand print across his face. It is blistered and hideous. Blob is gasping for air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Magneto looks and sees the cell is empty. He looks at Sabretooth.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want him alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<SABRETOOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll find him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SABRETOOTH>
<MAGNETO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ALIVE.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
And Sabretooth bolts back from where they came.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MAGNETO'S LAIR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly hits the fresh air, looking around wildly. He runs for the edge of a cliff high over the ocean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He raises his hands, we see his palms are covered with those wicked spines and they are dripping a venomous fluid not too different in color from the wound on Blob's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But then suddenly, something is wrong. Kelly buckles, clutching his stomach again. He squelches what would have been a scream of agony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at his palms and the spikes are gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly hears footsteps. Suddenly out of the darkness Sabretooth barrels toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly turns and LEAPS. Sabretooth comes to the edge of the cliff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When he looks over, Kelly's body has vanished. Swallowed by the sea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only his clothes remain on the rocks below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOGAN'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean shows Logan the simple dorm cube with a bed and a small desk. Jean opens the door for Logan and he inspects the sparse surroundings grimly. Cyclops stands just outside the door - eavesdropping.
</DIRECTION>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything else I can get you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some cigars. Case of beer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no smoking or drinking on the school grounds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't light the cigars - how about that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see what I can do -- You should get some sleep. Even with your healing ability, you're going to be hurting for a while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if I like the pain?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Jean doesn't know what to make of that. She is about to leave, then pauses.
</DIRECTION>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Professor said you were a solider. Actually, I believe he used the word mercenary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah? Well I don't like to talk about my past.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe, the Professor could help you with that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By reading my thoughts?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If necessary.

<LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Jean smiles politely at his knowing glance.
</DIRECTION>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get some shut-eye, slick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
She shuts the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean hesitates at the door, thinking. Smiling. She turns and only then does she realize Cyclops is standing there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is startled.
</DIRECTION>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scott.. I -

</JEAN>
<CYCLOPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like him being here.

<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<CYCLOPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You saw what happened tonight. You think Magneto won't come after him again. You think he won't come here if necessary. This is a school, for God's sake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYCLOPS>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If Magneto is planning to use Logan for some terrible purpose it's our responsibility to do something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Cyclops shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong? There's something else bothering you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Cyclops gets closer to Jean. She puts her hand on his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<CYCLOPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a bad feeling about this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYCLOPS>
<DIRECTION>
Jean leans in slowly and kisses Cyclops just beside his mouth
</DIRECTION>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I love you, Scott.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Cyclops pulls her close. The hold each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOGAN'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
E.C.U. Logan's ear. His super-sensitive hearing has picked up the whole conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan looks over on the bed and sees a new sketchbook and several pencils.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small note is attached.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
I hope you don't mind. I understand this helps you relax. - X.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. XAVIER'S OFFICE - LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A white light board. Beast's blue furry hand slides a long, full-body x-ray in place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beast is showing Logan's x-rays to Cyclops, Storm, Jean and Xavier.
</DIRECTION>
<BEAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Adamantium. Until today I thought it to be a myth. Impenetrable, unbendable, resistant to the most extreme heat, cold, indestructible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEAST>
<DIRECTION>
Beast points to the x-ray.
</DIRECTION>
<BEAST>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been grafted to his entire skeleton.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEAST>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He also has accelerated healing abilities - uncharted regenerative capability, making his age impossible to determine. He could very well be older than I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is the Adamantium part of his mutation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Someone put it there, relying on his healing abilities to keep him alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<CYCLOPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think Magneto wants with him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYCLOPS>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier wheels himself to the window, starring out, deep in thought.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not entirely sure it's ìhimî that Magneto wants.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON: X-ray of Logan's Adamantium skeleton.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue. The waifish young thing who hides so well in the shadows seems more comfortable to be moving through the mansion at night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She passes through the halls and rooms not making a sound in her strangely-swathed body suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOGAN'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She creaks a door open slowly, letting a shaft of dim light slice the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light shines across a nightstand. Rogue stares down at the notepad, a sketch it. It is of an animal, small but fierce - a wolverine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks in to a figure laying in the bed and stands over him. Over Logan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lays under a single sheet, sweating, his eyes moving quickly this way and that in R.E.M. His hands twitch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue leans closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUSH IN ON LOGAN'S EYES AS THEY MOVE UNDER THE LIDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH - DREAM SEQUENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MILITARY LAB - THE PAST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like none we have ever seen thus far. In fact, judging by most of the instruments here, we are looking at a laboratory some fifty years old.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan looks down and we can see his body, naked, strapped to a table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hand puts a mask over his mouth and -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He awakens -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STILL LOGAN'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He struggles weakly with restraints as doctors in lab coats and thick, red rubber gloves stand over him taking notes, paying very little attention to him at all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the other side of the room is a huge vat filled with some kind of molten metal. At the base of the vat is a giant electromagnet generating a huge gyroscope which created enormous friction energy - the apparent source of the intense heat for melting the metal in the vat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AGAIN THE MASK PUTS HIM UNDER AND:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Awake again, but this time sinking into water - restrained completely now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan looks down and gets only a glance of his body, seeing that he is a series of incisions from head to toe - literally split open - the flesh held back with hundreds of clamps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HE SINKS INTO THE STRANGE LIQUID - LIKE WATER BUT THICK AND VISCOUS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the sound of a DROWNING SCREAM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AND THE METAL IS POURED IN AFTER HIM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SOUND OF MOLTEN METAL HITTING LIQUID IS UNNERVING. Mixed with screams, it is unbearable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOGAN'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCREAMING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan's screaming as he comes to.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan's eyes FLASH OPEN. He looks up and sees a figure looming over him. In a flash he reacts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUD. Nothing more. Then silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door bursts open and Cyclops stands in the doorway shocked. Frozen. Jean is next and finally Storm. They can only stare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan sits upright in bed, CLAWS EXTENDED, INTO ROGUE'S CHEST. She is literally frozen at the end of his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Cyclops breaks the silence and moves to grab her.
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DON'T TOUCH HER.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
Cyclops freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan finally pulls his claws free and retracts them. Rogue staggers, she pitches forward and touches his face gently with her hands, as though she would like him to be the last thing she sees on this Earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan and Rogue, locked in a fatal moment of tenderness snaring a look of loneliness that only they can understand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But suddenly, Logan seems to change.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And before he can say another word, he begins to tremble, then he starts to howl in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue SNAPS BACK, mouth open in a gaping, silent scream. What sound comes out does not match the expression at all. Merely a gasp, like steam escaping. Through the huge slash in her clothes, we see the wound on her chest slowly vanish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before long, she transforms back into a healthy young girl with no sign of injury.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, her escaping breath begins to accelerate, much in the way Logan's did - too much like Logan's did. It is as if she has taken in his trait of berserker rage. Soon she is smashing things all around her. One hand rakes the wallpaper like claws.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, she gets a hold of herself, becoming the introverted Rogue we all know so well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she stands slowly, looks at the others.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And she runs from the room. Storm runs after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rest turn to Logan, who lays on the floor, convulsing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean goes to help him. She looks back at Cyclops. His expression makes it clear that his worst fears about Logan have come to pass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PUBLIC BEACH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A familiar scene of suburban escapism. Crowded enough that most people can move about unnoticed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In fact, most people do not notice the very large jellyfish shooting through the water at remarkable speed. And only a few notice the COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT MAN emerging from the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is Senator Kelly, and he resembles in many ways a jellyfish. His skin and innards are clear and gooey. It is only when he comes completely and naked out of the water that he returns to somewhat normal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks up to the beach and people recoil from the very sight of him. Pointing, whispering. Then just laughing at the naked man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly grabs a towel off an empty chair, a Hawaiian shirt off another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, he buckles, grabbing his stomach and lurching away in terrible pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He barely pauses when he hears a child's voice in semi- whisper:
</DIRECTION>
<CHILD_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom, is that a mutant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILD_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm and Logan walk down the hall. Logan is wearing sweats. He has obviously just woken up. The sun is low in the horizon and the hall is suffused with an orange glow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Students pass by them. By now, the students have heard rumors about what happened the night before. They watch Logan fearfully as they pass by him.
</DIRECTION>

<LOGAN>

	What did she do to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She borrowed your power to save her life. When she touches someone, she absorbs their strengths -- their gifts. In your case -- your ability to heal. That's why she keeps her body covered.

<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I felt like she almost killed me.

</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Storm shakes her head, but remains patient.
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've learned to embrace what we are rather than hide it like an affliction. For some, it has become their identity. You mock the names these people choose but they wear them as badges of pride.

Cyclops begins to walk away in the other direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan just watches him go. After a moment, he decides it might be more interesting to see where this is going. He follows. They walk across the hall to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On first glance, the gym looks really average. A fairly standard boxing ring in the middle. A fairly standard weight set nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then you notice the weights themselves are abnormally large.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
100. 200. 300. 400 pounds. All the way up to 2000. And that is just one stack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cyclops enters first with Logan coming in behind him.

<CYCLOPS>

<DIRECTION>
Logan is barely through the door when Cyclops whips around on Logan and thumps his finger into his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<CYCLOPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just wanted to make you clear on something. Personally, I don't care what Magneto wants with you. He can take those claws of yours and use them for Barbecue skewers. What I do care about is the safety of this group. The Professor is in charge, and after the Professor, there's me. So, for the remainder of your time here, you're going to keep that killer instinct of yours locked down so no one else gets hurt.

<LOGAN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	And I don't think this has anything to do with my ìkiller instinct.î You just don't like the way I'm looking at your girl -- Or maybe you don't like the way she's looking back. And maybe you think you're man enough to do something about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Cyclops is enraged. A red light begins to glow around the edge of his visor and the ruby-quartz lens brightens. We can faintly hear the low hum of immense power that is now barely contained. Before Cyclops can even react, Logan puts his fist against Cyclops' throat. SHOOK! Logan extends one claw up one side of Cyclops' neck. He smiles.

	C'mon sport. You think you can blow the meat off my bones before I gut you? Let's find out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
The air is now charged with tension. The two men are about to attack when-
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cyclops!
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
Logan whirls and sees Xavier regarding them sternly. Logan turns his building anger on Xavier.
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have a question for you, Chuck. What's the point?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier sits calmly as Logan, claws still extended, marches over to him.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The point of what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This. This whole God damn thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(derisively, at Cyclops)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Making yourselves into some sort of ìteamî of super-powered freaks. Teaching wayward mutants about classical literature. For what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Logan continues to advance on Xavier. Cyclops moves to stop Logan, but Xavier waves him off.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The point is to step into a more evolved position of social responsibility. To recognize that there is a world out there and that we mutants are as much a part of it as normal human beings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if it never happens? What if they're so afraid of us that we become the enemy? -- This place is gonna be one giant cemetery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier has heard this argument before.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that's Magneto talking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. That's me talking. And you know what? It's only been thirty-two hours and you still have no idea what this guy wants with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe he wants you for your Adamantium.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
Logan raises his hand to his chest grasping for something that no longer hangs from his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're thinking of your dog tag. It was made of Adamantium wasn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Professor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Logan turns and sees Jean walking towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rogue's missing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Logan looks at Jean with concern.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long, dark subterranean corridor with gleaming walls and floor. Well lit and strangely echoless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan follows Xavier, who are in turn followed by Storm, Cyclops and Jean to a thick steel door at the end of the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are we going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To find Rogue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
At Xavier's eye level is a black screen with a chin-rest like you see at the eye doctor. Xavier rests his head in it and the screen lights up.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cerebro amplifies my power. It allows me to browse the world's consciousness and find the genetically enhanced.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
A vertical beam scans across his eye and a picture of Xavier's retina appears on the screen next to a computerized image of the same. The two images overlap and match perfectly.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is how I found you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
A small beep and a loud KNOCK of tumblers rolling and the vault door opens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They walk inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CEREBRO - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They come into a room with a high sphered ceiling - entirely black.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the center of the room is a huge - for lack of a better term - device. Part computer, part super- structure, it is the sort of precision tangle of metal and wire that would make Da Vinci weep. It has a space in the bottom that seems to fit Xavier and his chair perfectly. Suspended above its center -- a web of wires, tubes, and cables all connecting to the heart of the device -- a CHROME SKULLCAP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan slowly circles the device.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan looks at Xavier, perhaps even a little impressed.
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You designed this yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, Magneto helped me put it together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He helped you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were friends once... But that was a long time ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
Jean, Logan, Cyclops and Storm watch as Xavier fits his wheelchair into the huge machine, and the chrome skull cap lowers onto the Professor's head, fitting like a second skin. It comes to life. What was dark and menacing is now a brilliant explosion of colored lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
XAVIER - into and through his eyes and:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SPACE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Closing in rapidly on the planet Earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Passing into its atmosphere, making a few orbits, all the while hearing the deafening voices of billions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Every country, every city, every town, berg, hamlet and village.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Every language.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Every thought.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The voices descend to a sizeable crowd of millions, then thousands, gradually working their way to one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKY - OVER WESTCHESTER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Down a tree-lined road and around a corner into a parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Single out a figure that - by the clothes - can only be Rogue. Close in faster and faster, lower and lower until we go right through the back of her head to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SILENCE
</DIRECTION>
<ROGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't belong... I don't belong... I'm sorry... so sorry... there's nowhere...

</ROGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CEREBRO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier's eyes open.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've found her, Westchester Mall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll go.

</LOGAN>
<CYCLOPS>

	O.K. sport... you go.

<DIRECTION>
INT. WESTCHESTER MALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mother and child wander in a typical shopping daze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL OUT TO REVEAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crowds of shoppers mill about, a typical crowded evening at the mall. Rogue comes up the escalator, wandering through them all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks under a high-sphered glass ceiling, revealing the night sky outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks over to a Victoria's Secret store and looks up at the mannequins in the windows who wear almost nothing at all. Quite a contrast from her own, stifling garb. She touches the glass as though trying to reach them, then she moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROGUE'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks all around the mall at the many oblivious people here. Children playing tag on one side. A young couple holding hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Human contact all around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks past a small child, her hand nearly brushing the girl's hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue takes a seat on a bench, alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A figure comes into frame.
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rogue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue looks up and sees Storm standing right in front of her. Her eyes dart around, looking for a way out.
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to run.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Rogue surrenders.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I'm not like the rest of you -- I'm tired of hurting people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to cry now.
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<ROGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did I have to be like this? What purpose does it serve?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And when Rogue looks up, she sees another figure - this one filling the frame behind Storm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge clawed hand grabs Storm around the throat and lifts her up as she struggles in vain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MALL - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cyclops looks up and sees Storm is being CHOKED BY SABRETOOTH, her feet not touching the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue is frozen with fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to get a shot with his visor, but too many people are in the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MALL - UPPER LEVEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sabretooth smiles as Storm struggles to turn. He whispers in her ear.
</DIRECTION>
<SABRETOOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scream for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SABRETOOTH>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STORM'S EYES as the life is being squeezed out of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. XAVIER'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIRROR SHOT OF XAVIER'S EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Xavier touches his throat, then raises a shaking hand to his head.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dear God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier wheels himself from the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MALL - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cyclops has a clear shot now. His eyes start to glow brightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a familiar movement on the pedestal behind him. Toad has been camouflaged the entire time. He comes down and FLICKS HIS LIZARD-LIKE TONGUE, snatching the visor from Cyclops' face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deep red light far greater than anything we have ever seen before comes blasting out of cyclops' eyes without any sort of control, as if a fire hydrant had been ripped from the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His head comes back and the light blows the whole of the glass ceiling to smithereens, bringing it down on panicking shoppers who scatter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Toad leaps to the second level and then again out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MALL - UPPER LEVEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sabretooth reacts, surprised by the sudden shift. This gives Storm one last chance to breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We notice now that something is happening to her body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MALL - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cyclops stumbles helpless, his eyes are shut to prevent further destruction.
</DIRECTION>
<CYCLOPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GET OUT OF THE WAY. GET OUT OF THE WAY.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYCLOPS>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MALL - UPPER LEVEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm, nearly lifeless now, struggles with what little strength she has to get free of Sabretooth. He relishes the slow kill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But suddenly ALL THE HAIR ON HIS BODY STANDS ON END. Sabretooth is momentarily confused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm's eyes open wide as her body convulses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge bolt of lightning shoot from her body into Sabretooth's chest, knocking him back in shock. Storm falls to the ground, not breathing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sabretooth, stunned and scorched, gets to his feet and smiles at his handiwork. He is about to move in and finish them both when the rumble of a helicopter can be heard above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up and sees SENATOR KELLY'S HELICOPTER passing over the hold in the roof. Sabretooth leaps up and pulls himself out of the opening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Toad is a leap behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue rushes to Storm, struggling with how to give her mouth to mouth, CPR, anything to resuscitate her without touching. She is starting to panic now. She looks around, but anyone still left in the mall is running for the doors.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SOMEONE HELP ME. SHE'S NOT BREATHING.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MALL - LOWER LEVEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cyclops stumbles blind and helpless, covering his eyes. He hears Rogue screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<CYCLOPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	ROGUE?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYCLOPS>
<ROGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HELP ME. STORM ISN'T BREATHING.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Cyclops tries to find a way up, but he trips over all the debris, helpless.
</DIRECTION>
<CYCLOPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YOU HAVE TO COME AND GET ME. I CAN'T SEE.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYCLOPS>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREETS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier is in a specially designed car that enables him to drive solely with his hands. He races towards the mall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MALL - UPPER LEVEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue is talking, walking backwards towards Storm, trying her best not to lay a hand on Cyclops.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, here, here... a little left. Careful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cyclops drops to his knees, the sprinklers still gushing. His eyes are tightly shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He feels for Storm's face and touches her lips.
</DIRECTION>
<CYCLOPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYCLOPS>
<DIRECTION>
He immediately begins mouth to mouth, though it may have been too long.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier fights the rush of traffic - people fleeing madly from the mall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he pulls up to the front doors, he sees Cyclops emerging, carrying Storm. She is conscious, but her breathing is shallow. His eyes are shut tightly and he must follow Rogue's direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sirens wail in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier looks at the lot of them: waifish Rogue, blind Cyclops, unconscious Storm and his wheelchair-bound self as their guardian.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But why would they do this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
Then a look of realization...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANSION - MEANWHILE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue hurries past several students.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs up to the large front doors of the school, but they are locked. She looks around and then runs toward the side of the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beast, continuing his research into Magneto's plan, is analyzing the x-rays of Logan's skeleton. Several books about metallurgy are scattered across the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOGAN'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan is sketching quietly. He chews a cigar, keeping it politely unlit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hears something. He stands, goes to the door and opens it. He cocks his head... listening... smiling...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear it too, sharing his ears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a woman breathing, groaning. He smiles and follows the noise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue climbs through a student's open window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MANSION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She darts down a hallway and around a corner, looking around, staying low.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean is working out on an average-sized set of free- weights, sweating, pushing hard. Obviously the sound Logan heard. She is on her back doing presses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, she looks up and sees Logan standing over. She is startled and starts to drop the bar. He catches it.
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should always work with a spotter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's busy right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Logan cannot help but glance at her left hand, still clinging to the bar. The shimmering diamond on the third finger.
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was thinking maybe you and me could go into town.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were you now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not interested.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Logan shrugs, starts to take his hands away. Jean is not ready to take the weight of the bar. It almost comes down on her when he catches it again.
</DIRECTION>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suit yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
And he does. And so does Jean at the same time. She gets up and faces Logan - the bar simply hovers in mid- air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beast looks at his watch. It's stopped. He puts it to his ear -- shakes it. Then his ears perk up. He hears something. He glances at the wall. All things METAL -- picture frames, chairs, objects on tables, etc. start to move one after the other. It is as if some magnetic force is moving past the wall, just outside the lab, heading for the open door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beast, sensing the danger, makes a run for the metal door. Just as he reaches it, it SLAMS closed -- knocking him back across the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beast CRASHES into the wall on the opposite side of the lab. His leg badly hurt, Beast tries to crawl toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But as he does this, METAL OBJECTS from around the lab fly in front of it sealing him in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue moves quietly down the corridor that leads to Cerebro.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She comes to the retinal scanner - she brings her eye to the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It lights up and scans her eye. A PICTURE OF XAVIER'S RETINA appears on the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SINGLE WORD APPEARS ON THE SCREEN beneath it:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACCESS DENIED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scanner scans again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
E.C.U. ON ROGUE'S EYE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something is wrong. The eye not being scanned is a familiar yellow. It is Mystique.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her other eye changes in the light of the scanner. The retina reshaping itself in minute ways.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON: The screen -- ACCESS GRANTED -- CHARLES XAVIER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door to Cerebro opens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue or rather Mystique, rushes in. She goes to a small panel on the side of Cerebro.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She opens it. She reaches in. SHE REMOVES A COMPUTER CHIP -- No more than three inches wide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON: The black boots of a man, walk down a hallway, as students peer from their sleeping quarters, terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean is casually wiping sweat from her brow. Logan's eyes possess a certain focus intent.
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's uptight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He takes his work seriously.

<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He takes himself seriously.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just interested.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Holding out her left hand.
</DIRECTION>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Logan, do you see this ring?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've seen a lot of rings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'll bet you have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Before he can reply, Rogue is standing in the doorway looking at them.
</DIRECTION>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rogue, where have you been?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<ROGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Logan. The Professor wants you to come with me right away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGUE>
<DIRECTION>
E.C.U. on Logan's nose. His nostrils flare... sensing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan squints the tiniest bit. We know he knows something is wrong, but he is hiding it.
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Rogue)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Rogue, tell Jean what you were telling me last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue pauses. Confused.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Professor--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Logan walks towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You remember. About women.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
He moves closer.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Logan--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGUE>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever you say about them being the same...

SHOOK. The claws are out. HE LUNGES.

<LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No two women smell alike.

</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs Rogue by the throat.
</DIRECTION>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Logan, what are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Jean, seeing Logan threaten Rogue with his claws for the second time, RAISES A VAULTING HORSE INTO THE AIR.
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This ain't Rogue!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
He keeps his claws pointed at her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE TIGHT: Logan's left hand is wrapped around Rogue's throat but part of it is TOUCHING THE EXPOSED SKIN OF HER FACE WITH NO ILL EFFECTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean realizes that Logan is right. ROGUE MORPHS INTO MYSTIQUE.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Telekinesis.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
Jean spins around and sees MAGNETO. Without hesitation, the vaulting horse FLIES AT MAGNETO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simultaneously, one of the thousand-pound weights flies from the weight set and smashes the vaulting horse aside.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fascinating. What I wouldn't give for that. Alas, metal is all I'm good for. But it seems to serve me well enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
Jean is completely unaware of the huge set of lockers rising behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jean!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lockers hit her in the back, sending her flying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean lies motionless on the floor, unconscious. The heavy lockers are floating above her, wavering between a few feet and a few inches.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>

Pause.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why don't you kill her.

This catches Logan a little off guard.

The lockers now stand upright, hovering over Jean's knees.

Logan thinks for a moment -- looks at Jean still unconscious on the floor. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan retracts his claws.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mystique has morphed back into her natural state with the exception of ONE OF ROGUE'S POCKETS, which still clings to her hip. Mystique produces a large syringe from the pocket and sticks it in Logan's neck. Logan's legs weaken instantly.

EXT. MANSION - LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fence that surrounds the property has been bent and buckled violently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MANSION HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier wheels down the hallway, pajama clad students are milling about the halls. Their faces showing that they are afraid to go back to their rooms. One GIRL, younger and smaller than the others, seems particularly upset.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier wheels over to her and gently touches the side of her face.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's going to be alright.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
She manages a faint smile. Then Xavier looks to the other students -- their frightened faces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LABORATORY - LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beast reclines in his lab chair, a splint on his leg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean stands with Cyclops who watches through a new visor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue sits off to the side, bearing the guilt. While Storm, her neck badly bruised, stands near her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For the first time we have seen -- Charles Xavier is angry.
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When Rogue left the mansion, they must have followed her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier shuts his eyes furious.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes... they wanted me out of the way. If I had been here... I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier opens his eyes and sees Rogue sitting on a chair in the corner. She is visibly upset. Xavier wheels over to Rogue. Xavier reaches out and softly touches her clothing covered shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was not your fault. I knew there was a danger, I should have never left the school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>

And with that he turns his wheelchair to the door.

<XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I am going to find Logan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CEREBRO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier enters and wheels himself into the giant machine. It immediately comes to life - lighting the room. The chrome skull cap descends onto Xavier's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier closes his eyes as the machine powers up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
E.C.U. ON XAVIER'S EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They fly open. And then a terrible noise. The sound of a well tuned machine suddenly going horribly wrong. Xavier is in terrible pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His back arches and he falls from his chair onto the floor. He struggles to reach for a fire alarm on the wall. His fingers stretch until finally -- he pulls it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Warning bells wail. Xavier falls unconscious, convulsing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON: Cyclops and Jean as they burst into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LABORATORY - LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier lies asleep in a hospital bed. Several electrodes are taped to his head. A screen next to the bed monitors his erratic brain waves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean and the splinted Beast stare at the monitor following its rhythm. Storm and Rogue stand at the foot of the bed. They are each trying to hide their fear, and not doing a very good job of it. Cyclops looks on, the stress shows on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<CYCLOPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong with him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYCLOPS>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His vital signs are weak and getting weaker.

</JEAN>
<BEAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm in the process of running more tests. But it seems that every minute that goes by he gets weaker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEAST>

All are silent. Rogue looks to Beast with desperate eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you help him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGUE>
<BEAST>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Xavier lies in bed, motionless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FRONT HALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two huge wooden front doors -- morning light shines through the jagged holes in the wood where the knobs had been pulled off. The antique steel knobs lay twisted and mangled on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The small girl from last night kneels in front of the door with a dustpan, sweeping up the mess.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something catches her eye. She sits up and leans in closer to the jagged hole in the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON: The little girl -- light from the hole washes over her face. Then suddenly the light is cut off, as if something is blocking the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOLLY IN: as the small girl steps back, a look of fascination comes across her face. As if she sees something coming through the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CEREBRO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cyclops, Jean and Storm stand before the device. Beast rises awkwardly on his splinted leg, his back to the open control panel.
</DIRECTION>
<BEAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's gone. The neuro-filter, someone removed it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEAST>
<DIRECTION>
Jean stands.
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does that mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<BEAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The neuro-filter acts like a surge protector, regulating the infinite flow of information from Cerebro to the Professor's mind. It's what keeps him from being crushed by the consciousness of millions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEAST>
<DIRECTION>
Cyclops steps away, pondering Beast's words. He understands the ramifications -- the damage that has been done to Xavier.
</DIRECTION>
<CYCLOPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can the Professor repair his own mind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYCLOPS>
<BEAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid without Cerebro's help, he won't have the strength to heal himself -- And without the neuro- filter... there's no Cerebro.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEAST>
<DIRECTION>
Jean is noticeably upset.
</DIRECTION>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's already losing control of his vitals. Respiratory. Cardiovascular. Unless we manage to replace the filter by tomorrow morning, I'm afraid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<CYCLOPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have to find Magneto.

He exits. Jean follows him.

Cyclops is standing, motionless.

</JEAN>
<CYCLOPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I'm... I don't know if we can do this without Charles.

Jean puts her hand lovingly to his face. Cyclops takes her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<JEAN>

She goes to kiss him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone is here to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMALL_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Jean's eyes widen -- and around the corner steps Senator Kelly, wearing the clothing he had taken from the beach. He trembles as though from a high fever. His body is covered with a layer of sweat.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Grey.

Kelly makes a hole with his hands that is not much larger then that of a coffee can.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I squeezed through.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly buckles in pain, but then catches himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean and Cyclops rush to help him. Beast crutches himself out to see what's happening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly notices Beast.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>

INT. LABORATORY - LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier is in bed, eyes closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue holds vigil at his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly is in the bed next to him, trembling, burning up from what seems to be a bad fever that keeps getting worse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean has a syringe in her hand and is swabbing some alcohol on Kelly's skin.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry to come here, Ms. Grey. I was afraid if I went to a hospital, they would...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<JEAN>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Treat you like a mutant? We are not what you think. Not all of us.

Jean looks closer at his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<JEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't see these spikes you're talking about. I'm going to give you an antibiotic for the - Oh my God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Jean and Kelly both look as the cotton swab ignites like flash paper in her hand. Everyone is shocked. Jean pauses and takes the bottle of alcohol from the shelf. She pours a small amount on Kelly's arm and it instantly catches fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LABORATORY - LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue is still sitting in a chair, next to Xavier's bed -- Xavier's opens his eyes. He looks at Rogue and smiles softly.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Rogue?
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue almost jumps out of her chair with excitement.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on, I'll get the others.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue exits. Xavier slowly looks over to Kelly lying in the bed next to him. Both men are weak and getting weaker.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Senator... Kelly?

</XAVIER>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes... Who are you?

<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am Charles Xavier. This is my school.

</XAVIER>

Kelly tries to speak, but his strength is waning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two men are a pitiful sight, both slowly coming apart.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you tell me what happened to you?

Kelly is in pain. It's a struggle to speak.

The following is an audio-visual collage of Kelly's perspective from throughout the film, coming back to us in a new order.

THE CAGE OF SENATOR KELLY in Magneto's lair. NOW HIS P.O.V. as seen by Xavier.

A VIOLENT COLLISION OF NOISE, IMAGE AND LIGHT AND THEN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier's eyes burst open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LABORATORY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue leads Storm, Jean, Beast and Cyclops quickly into the lab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier is lying in his bed. Jean looks up at the screen above him and sees Xavier's brain waves have dropped severely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly lies unconscious in his bed, his heart monitor weakening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beast limps over to Xavier. Xavier struggles to speak. Beast bends down so that Xavier can whisper into his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
E.C.U. Xavier's lips move as he tells Beast what he knows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LAB - LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean, Storm, Beast and Cyclops talk while the news plays silently on the TV in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<BEAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It appears as though Magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. And he is using Adamantium as its core.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEAST>
<CYCLOPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Its core?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYCLOPS>
<DIRECTION>
Beast grabs a wax pen and draws a lightbulb on a glass drawing board.
</DIRECTION>
<BEAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thomas Edison knew how to make the light bulb. He had the energy source. He had the vacuum. But he didn't have the filament. He tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEAST>
<STORM>
<DIRECTION>
(nods -- now understanding)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... until he found tungsten.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
Beast finishes his lightbulb by drawing the filament.
</DIRECTION>
<BEAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Correct... Apparently, Adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces. He used the Adamantium in Logan's dog tag to test it on the Senator. And I assume now he plans to use the rest of Logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEAST>
<CYCLOPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what purpose?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYCLOPS>
<BEAST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- Only there's a problem. The mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature. It's forcing the body's cells to replicate thousands of times faster than they're accustomed to. The Senator's body is literally burning itself out. Scott -- this machine kills people and I don't think Magneto realizes it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEAST>
<CYCLOPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So where do you think he's planning this larger demonstration?
	</DIALOGUE>

Jean looks down and sees Xavier pointing with a trembling hand, trying to speak.

Xavier is pointing to the television.

	<DIALOGUE>
	There...
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
He is looking at yet another report on Ellis Island.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cyclops and Jean walk over. All they see on the TV is an aerial shot of Manhattan, slowly coming around toward the harbor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The television image is from the P.O.V. of a helicopter circling Ellis Island, taking in all the security and construction. The grand main hall to Ellis Island and finally, what the helicopter sees as it comes around for one more pass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY - The sound of Kelly's heart monitor begins to PICK UP SPEED. Jean rushes to Kelly and touches his pale neck. She draws her hand back quickly as if burned. The heart monitor keeps speeding up until it is racing faster than a human heart could possibly produce.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean backs away helplessly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sheet that covers Kelly's body begins to flatten out. The sweat covering the hapless Senator's body thickens into a viscous, clear liquid and begins to run off the table. Kelly is literally melting away. Cyclops holds Jean as she turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON: THE TV -- the gathering leaders of the world, the water clogged with boats, and the thousands of onlookers on Manhattan Island. All well within range.

INT. LAB - NIGHT

Cyclops stands looking down at Professor Xavier. He starts to walk away but he is stopped. He looks down and sees that the Professor has weakly grabbed his sleeve. Cyclops looks at Xavier but he is still unconscious. His hand falls back to the bed.

<DIRECTION>
Every fifty feet or so, uniformed Secret Service agents keep tight watch on the island.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One Secret Service guy in particular.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUSH IN FROM ABOVE - We realize we are pushing in unusually fast, as though we are falling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM. A sickening crunch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Toad lands on top of the Secret Service guy. We have been watching from his P.O.V. The Secret Service man is tumbled into a heap. A real frog rabbits O.S.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two Secret Service guys approach one another. One is holding a smoke, the other is producing a lighter. Just as his smoke is about to hit the flame, the flame dodges to one side. He moves the smoke to follow it, and the flame dodges the other way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guy with the smoke looks at the guy with the lighter as if to say ìknock it off.î The guy with the lighter shrugs as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FLAME INSTANTLY GROWS TO A RAGING INTENSITY, ENGULFING THEM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they are incinerated and their ashes fall to the ground, Pyro climbs into view from the seawall below, dripping wet.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. COAST GUARD BOAT DECK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PILOT'S P.O.V.

<DIRECTION>
Man-made rocky shore. The boat bumps and grinds on the rock. Sabretooth jumps down to the deck and meets Magneto coming up from below. They nod to one another and walk toward the front of the boat. On the deck is something covered with a tarp. Sabretooth pulls back the tarp to reveal Logan, still unconscious from the drug.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER, MUCH LARGER OBJECT is on the back of the boat under another tarp, but we cannot see what it is.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HE IS NOT ON ELLIS ISLAND AT ALL
</DIRECTION>

THE MACHINE. The one Kelly and Xavier saw. The air ripples as it rises higher in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUSEUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm and Rogue quietly enter the Statue's museum. It is filled with scale models and full size displays documenting the history of Lady Liberty. One display showcasing the METAL STRIPS which line the Statue for support. They quickly head for an exit on the far side of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights go out. Darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A low guttural CROAK echoes in the void.
</DIRECTION>
<STORM>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rogue... run.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STORM>
<DIRECTION>
Rogue runs into the darkness, heading for the exit. She dashes past a six foot copper replica of the Statue and out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As soon as Rogue is past, the Statue's HEAD TURNS and watches her go. The replica blinks and the eyes turn Mystique yellow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TORCH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The machine is rising. Logan yanks at the manacles in an attempt to pull his hands free.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OLD TORCH ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A giant room that welcomes the many visitors to the Statue. In the center is the old torch, placed there after the Statue's 1986 restoration. The only light in the room is a soft red glow that emanates from the old torch.
</DIRECTION>

INT. MUSEUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear an ominous LOW RUMBLE, as you hear on an overcast day just before a thunderstorm. SHEETS OF HEAT LIGHTNING begin to roll across the ceiling, lighting the room in sporadic bursts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Toad darts around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH -- Reptile eyes -- DARKNESS.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
The heat lightning continues to expose the room in rolling flashes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, behind Storm the sound of ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING. Storm spins and unleashes a BOLT OF LIGHTNING. The lightning strikes an empty GLASS HYDRAULIC ELEVATOR SHAFT. No TOAD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OLD TORCH ROOM - NIGHT

ANGLE ON: The map of the statue. Cyclops watches as the dim red glow turns brighter and brighter. He turns to look up at the old torch -- it glows FIERY RED HOT.

Move up through the CEILING OF FIRE to reveal Pyro at the center of the old torch. His eyes wide, manipulating the fire like an orchestra conductor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE MUSEUM - NIGHT

Rogue runs down the hallway, she stops. The sound of footsteps echo from behind her. The footsteps quicken from walking to running. Rogue runs to get away as the footsteps of her pursuer get closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUSEUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darkness. Silence -- except for the sound of Storm's own breathing. Storm's eyes dart around the room, her senses are in overdrive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, SLIME drips onto her cheek. A low guttural CROAK. Storm looks up -- TOAD clings to the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM. Webbed feet slam into Storm's chest sending her flying into the elevator shaft. She crashes helplessly to the bottom -- stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Toad's head peers through the open elevator doors to the level below, looking down on the helpless Storm. Toad SMILES. His webbed finger presses the elevator button.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator doors above her close, sealing her in the glass tubular shaft. The ROAR of the hydraulic engine coming to life, the elevator begins its crushing descent down toward Storm as she lies at the bottom of the shaft dazed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OLD TORCH ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
C.U. on Jean and Cyclops both pinned down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fire sweeps around the map pedestal. Cyclops turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM -- He fires a series of OPTIC BLASTS blindly through the fire, blasting the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chunks of debris from the ceiling shower down onto Pyro. The inferno stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smoke fills the room, Jean tries to catch her breath. Cyclops stands and heads toward the old torch trying to draw a bead on Pyro. Cyclops doesn't see him. When:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A COLUMN OF FIRE erupts from the thick smoke, rocketing at Cyclops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cyclops dodges, flipping a heavy wood table with flaming pamphlets on it -- using it as a shield against Pyro's fiery onslaught.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TORCH - BACK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE FROM DIRECTLY OVERHEAD:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Magneto on the side of the torch's flame raises the huge machine -- while on the other side -- LOGAN PUSHES HIMSELF THROUGH THE HOLE -- his hands still bound behind his back, and slams against the outer railing of the torch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan looks around in shock. He realizes where he is. He looks out at all the activity on Ellis Island, drawing a greater understanding of Magneto's plan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TORCH - FRONT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a MAGNETIC RIPPLE of the air Magneto drives the machine right up through the bottom of the torch like batteries in a flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TORCH - BACK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan turns his back to the hole he has just emerged from and braces his cuffs against the rising machine. The machine pushes against Logan's wrists driving his cuffs up against the top of the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pressure leaves the cuffs apart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm's eyes open, looking straight up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON: The elevator continuing its crushing descent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm struggles to her feet. Her hand presses against the thick glass elevator shaft, it surrounds her like a coffin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIGHTNING strike the glass -- to no effect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm frantically searches for a way out. She looks up to see the elevator closing fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm raises her hands above her head. WIND begins to lift Storm's hair. The wind picks up and starts swirling violently against the sides of the elevator shaft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wildly, the wind whips around causing a CYCLONE within the glass shaft buffeting upwards against the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator groans as the hydraulics fight the unrelenting vortex of wind. Smoke begins to pour from the hydraulics, which whine in protest. At the center of the tornado stands Storm, a force of nature.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the elevator continues its descent the cyclone pushes outward. Small cracks start to appear on the glass walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is now forced almost to the ground. The elevator is now inches from Storm's head. The floor is made of a thicker version of the same Plexiglas and we look up through it, the massive elevator looming over Storm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The glass walls explode outward, showering the museum.

INT. OLD TORCH ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean, having caught her breath, looks over to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
C.U. on Cyclops. He's pinned down as fire wraps around the table -- the fire is burning through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean, seeing Cyclops defenseless, stands up from behind the marble podium. She quickly scans the room and spots, on opposite walls near the old torch, TWO LARGE FIRE EXTINGUISHERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean stretches out her fists and focuses her telekinesis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pyro spots Jean -- with one hand continuing to blast Cyclops, he uses the other to unleash an ARM OF FIRE toward Jean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean focuses as she brings her outstretched fists closer together. Suddenly -- the two fire extinguishers crash through their glass holders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like two gunslingers in a showdown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The extinguishers bullet toward Pyro.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The arm of fire rockets closer to Jean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the EXTINGUISHERS COLLIDE EXPLODING in front of Pyro.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inches from Jean's face, the ARM OF FIRE disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The COLUMN OF FLAMES against Scott VANISHES. The flames once covering the room are gone, a choking smoke is all that remains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the smoke, at the center of the old torch, Pyro lies dead, covered in a sea of white foam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean starts choking on the smoke. Cyclops stands and motions for her to get out of the smoke filled room.

Magneto turns and opens the hatch. Magneto sees the hole -- Logan is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TORCH - BACK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Magneto walks over and stares at the hole, clearly out by Logan's claws.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Magneto looks at his fingers after wiping the edge of the hole. Logan's blood. Magneto looks down and sees Logan's claw marks down the arm of the Statue, marking his escape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Magneto scans the island from his high perch. He does not see Logan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STATUE - MAIN ENTRANCE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors to the old torch room burst open -- SMOKE BILLOWS OUT. Jean runs out coughing violently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Toad lands in front of Jean, grabs her head and before she can react, his tongue launches at her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His tongue covers her face with an ADHESIVE SLIME. Jean falls to the ground. Toad looks back at the main entrance, sees Cyclops emerging and LEAPS up, out of frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cyclops stumbles out of the smoke filled building. Seeing Jean lying on the ground, he runs to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cyclops turns Jean on her back, ready to perform CPR. He is shocked, the slime has now hardened to Jean's face. She is suffocating. He desperately tries to pry it off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera quickly pulls higher and higher revealing --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOAD'S P.O.V.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Toad looks down, perched on top of the railing surrounding the base of the Statue -- the same position he had before crushing the Secret Service agent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Toad arches his back ready to spring downward. He will kill two birds with one crushing leap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of WIND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
C.U. Toad's face static, his eyes slowly look to the side. His head twists, looking over his shoulder. Storm stands behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Toad turns and hops off the railing towards Storm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
C.U. on TOAD'S FACE. Which is horrible.
</DIRECTION>
<TOAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you people die?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOAD>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the wind picks up violently. Toad moves closer -- fighting the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm is MAD. A face we remember seeing on a young girl in Africa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Toad fights the gale force winds, his webbed feet adhering to the ground. He inches closer to Storm. Toad bares his FANGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STATUE - MAIN ENTRANCE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the ground Cyclops notices the wind howling with rage above him. He frantically pulls on the encrusted slime suffocating Jean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OBSERVATION DECK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm's eyes widen. HURRICANE force winds blast Toad. Try as he might to use his sticky feet to hold on, Toad is blown back off his feet, catching the deck with his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The piece of the deck TEARS LOOSE still attached to Toad's hands. He flies off the deck, past the metal railing. Toad's tongue LASHES OUT AND ATTACHES TO THE RAILING. For a moment, Toad just flaps there like a flag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm RAISES HER ARMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRASH -- A huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes the railing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Toad is blown off the railing in a flash of electricity and --

Toad lands in the water. He disappears below the surface leaving nothing but bubbles.

Storm moves to the railing. She looks down at Cyclops and Jean. Suddenly, the metal railing on which her hands rest BEGIN TO BEND TOWARD HER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STATUE - MAIN ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Cyclops continues to pull on the slime. Jean's struggles are becoming more panicked.

He takes a hold of her chin and grips it tightly. He FIRES A THIN, FOCUSED OPTIC BEAM INTO THE ENCRUSTED SLIME, splitting it in half. He pulls the remains away from her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean GASPS for air. Then she looks up. Her face turns to horror. Behind Cyclops, towering over him is -- Sabretooth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM! Sabretooth smashes down.

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE THE MUSEUM - NIGHT

Rogue turns the corner of the hallway and trips, tumbling to the ground.

E.C.U.-on Magneto's belt, which is lined with METAL STRAPS. Magneto's hand comes into frame holding CYCLOPS' VISOR and places it against one of the straps. The strap WRAPS ITSELF BACK AND AROUND, pinning the visor to the belt. He brings a radio to his mouth.

Sabretooth exits as Magneto turns to reveal --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jean and Cyclops, without his visor, are trapped in a hideous tangle of metal (taken from the Statue's steel bracing) forcing the two to face each other. Two sharp points of metal rest on either side of Cyclops' head, locking it in position. Cyclops' is close enough to feel Jean's breath -- if he opens his eyes, he will destroy everything in his path, including Jean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Storm is also encased in a myriad of sharp metal bands, pinning her to the wall. Razor sharp pieces of metal warp and close on her throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All in all, they are completely disabled.

Jean struggles to free them with her telekinesis, to no avail.

Logan quickly comes up the stairs and into the Statue's head. He stands over the crippled Magneto.

Logan turns to Jean who is still pressed eye to eye with Cyclops. He is relieved to see her alive.

THREE METAL BAND peel off the ceiling, coming to life with magnetic energy. They leap across the room and wrap around Logan. Forcing his fists to press against his chest.

Should he so much as extend his claws, he will rupture his own vitals. The metal bands wrap behind his back.
</DIRECTION>

Magneto raises his hand and MAGNETIC WAVES RIPPLE. Metal groans as Magneto peels open a gaping hole in the top of Lady Liberty's head. Magneto looks up at the torch. The wind howls.

A MASSIVE CLAWED HAND strikes Logan's chest. The blow sends Logan sailing back to the far end of the torch.

Logan lies against the railing. Opening his eyes he sees --

The metal railing bends.

Sabretooth holds Logan by his wrists, trying to push him over the edge. It is several hundred feet to the ground below.

<DIRECTION>
Sabretooth stands and looks over the edge - nothing. All he can see is the Statue's body curving away towards the ground. He smiles, and turns back to the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON: LOGAN - Hanging from the ear of the Statue, the claws of his right hand embedded in the lobe at the end of three sets of long claw-marks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up. A look of brutal determination crosses his face. Straining, he pulls himself up by his right arm. The cords stand out on his neck as he tries to get to shoulder level. He aims his left claw a little further up on the ear and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUNK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drives it in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM -- E.C.U. Sabretooth's feet as he lands on the metal floor. He quickly takes in the situation, Magneto and Rogue are still unconscious. He walks towards Storm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The air in the room starts to CRACKLE and Sabretooth's hair begins to stand on end as it did when these two last confronted each other.
</DIRECTION>
<SABRETOOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SABRETOOTH>
<DIRECTION>
Sabretooth backhands Storm across the jaw, knocking her out. As her head drops, he draws his claws and slashes it down. It STOPS, just before tearing open Storm's throat, HELD BY AN UNSEEN FORCE. He turns and sees that Jean has focused her power in his arm. He smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks to Jean and tears off her bonds. He reaches out to grab her neck but his claw is stopped again in mid- air. Sabretooth just smiles wider and forces his hand forward. The outcome never really in doubt, the claw wraps around Jean's neck. She begins to choke.
</DIRECTION>
<CYCLOPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jean!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYCLOPS>
<DIRECTION>
Sabretooth lifts Jean by the neck and walks away from Cyclops as he chokes her.
</DIRECTION>
<SABRETOOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry about this sweetheart, but I made Logan a promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SABRETOOTH>
<DIRECTION>
Jean struggles desperately against Sabretooth's unbreakable grip, the life draining from her. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, ya big pussy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Sabretooth whips around, still clutching Jean to see - LOGAN -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bleeding, beaten and panting, and yet still standing defiantly over Magneto's unconscious body.
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ain't finished with you yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Sabretooth looks at him, disbelieving that this man can still be standing, let alone challenging him... and he starts to laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<SABRETOOTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SABRETOOTH>
<DIRECTION>
Logan grins.
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not just me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
And with that: he extends ONE CLAW from his right hand, squats down, and cuts the piece of metal holding Cyclops' visor to Magneto's belt. He lifts it up and it slides down his claw to his hand. He casually throws it in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Logan looks at the visor and it freezes in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It flies across the room, right past Sabretooth's head. He lunges at it with his free claw but just misses it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The visor lands square on Cyclops' eyes, and attaches itself to Cyclops' face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A focused OPTIC BLAST hits Sabretooth like a FREIGHT TRAIN. He drops Jean and SLAMS THROUGH THE WALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STATUE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the side of the Statue's head. Suddenly, Sabretooth BLASTS THROUGH THE EYE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment Cyclops' beam continues to fire through the eye as if the Statue itself is imitating Cyclops' power.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SEAWALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Magneto's boat still sits quietly next to the seawall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRASH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sabretooth's body SMASHES THROUGH THE ROOF of the boat. The tarp flies up and drifts back down to rest over Sabretooth's body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan's breathing is strained, a blood stain in the middle of his shirt, but he is in control. Logan looks up, his eyes met by Jean's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks over to Storm and Cyclops and SHOOK! cuts them loose. Jean and Cyclops catch Storm, who begins to come around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cyclops smiles. Logan kneels down beside Rogue. He wants to comfort her but cannot touch her. She opens her eyes and sees Logan.
</DIRECTION>
<ROGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey... There you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sudden apprehension)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it really you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROGUE>
<LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
(not quite sure what she's talking about)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it's really me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<CYCLOPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, let's get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYCLOPS>
<DIRECTION>
Logan stands. He takes a couple of steps before collapsing in Cyclops' arms.
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
(sliding to the ground)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm o.k. I'm o.k.

EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - DOCK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several Coast Guard cutters and police boats reach the island. Men run across the dock as we pull up --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LIBERTY ISLAND - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Coast Guard, Secret Service, and FBI descend upon the island.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OLD TORCH ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Security enters the smoldering remains of the old torch room. The walls blackened by a past inferno. At the center, Pyro lies motionless in a sea of foam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MUSEUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Push in on MYSTIQUE who is tied up. Across her feet a crack of light as the door begins to open. Swish pan over to the NYPD entering the room. Swish pan back. Mystique has taken the form of a Secret Service agent.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT_MYSTIQUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, could somebody untie me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGENT_MYSTIQUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SEAWALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Secret Service spots the wreckage of Magneto's boat and the large tarp which covers it. He pulls his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<SECRET_SERVICE_MAN_3>
<DIRECTION>
(to other agents)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Over here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECRET_SERVICE_MAN_3>
<DIRECTION>
Three other agents pull their guns and aim at the tarp. The first agent pulls it back to reveal... nothing. Sabretooth is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STATUE - HEAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NYPD and Secret Service rush up the stairs and into the head. Magneto lies unconscious on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lead guy, an NYPD OFFICER in a flak jacket, holding a shotgun, stares up at the ceiling. He peers out through the gaping hole. Beyond the damaged torch the star filled sky is momentarily eclipsed by a aircraft -- the X- Jet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The officer turns to say something, but stops -- wondering if his eyes were merely playing tricks on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MANSION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cyclops, Jean, Storm, Rogue and about two dozen students all sit in front of a wide screen TV watching the Special Report on the Mutant Registration Act vote.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the Anchorman speaks we move over the concerned looks on all of their faces.
</DIRECTION>
<ANCHORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even after last weeks terrorist vandalization of the Statue of Liberty by an unidentified mutant organization, the outcome of the vote was 51 to 49 in opposition to the Mutant Registration Act.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANCHORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
A LOUD CHEER as the room erupts into celebration.
</DIRECTION>
<CYCLOPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quiet. Quiet everybody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYCLOPS>
<ANCHORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This narrow defeat was probably due in large part to the surprising last- minute reversal by Senator Scott ìFrankî Kelly, who until today provided the loudest voice in the cry for Mutant Registration. Earlier today, Kelly had this to say:
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANCHORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The TV cuts to a shot of Kelly being grilled by reporters as he walks down the Capitol steps.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
(struggling to get through)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we can not go into the future together, the divisions of fear and prejudice will tear this country apart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
As he is speaking, we cut to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAPITOL BUILDING - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kelly pushing past reporters.
</DIRECTION>
<KELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No more questions. Please, no more questions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KELLY>
<DIRECTION>
E.C.U. The back of Kelly's neck as he passes. A BLUE SCALE is visible above his collar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOGAN'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FAINT CHEERS are heard through the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAZY THEN FOCUS INTO -- light pushes through blinds. A gentle breeze moves them slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan sits up in his bed, his chest bandaged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VRRRIP -- the sound of blinds being pulled open. Bright sunshine fills the room, washing across a box and a card sitting on a bureau.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON: the card as Logan reads it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOGAN -- WELCOME HOME. It is signed simply, X.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan reaches in the box, pulling out -- a UNIFORM. He lays it on the bed. He pulls on one of the gloves, stretching his fingers in it. Perfect fit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOOK -- He pops his claws through THREE METAL RINGLETS on the back of the glove -- clearly it was made specifically for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan looks down into the box for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOGAN'S ROOM - LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From behind Logan we see him finish putting something on over his head. Logan turns into frame, he is wearing a dark blue MASK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It fits his head neatly. The sides arch up shadowing his ears, giving him a wolf or fox-like appearance. The shape is reminiscent of Logan's sketch -- the wolverine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan stands facing a mirror. The mask looks good on him and he seems to know it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier is in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan pulls off the mask, embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you knock?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're all asking how you're doing. Are you feeling up to saying hello to everyone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
(pulling the glove off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually I'm feeling up to leaving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Logan walks over to the closet and pulls out a shirt. He puts it on.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? You have a home here now, if you want it. Everyone will...
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?... miss me? Charley, I'm gonna walk out the front door and trust me, it won't be soon enough for everyone here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Logan pulls a duffle bag out of the closet.
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I, umm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. Everything in this room is for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
Logan seems genuinely touched by the gesture.
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, I'll pay you back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Logan shoves some clothes into the bag, but not all.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well if you're going to leave then you at least owe them a goodbye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
Logan smirks. He picks up his bag. They exit the room together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MANSION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The celebration continues unabated. The newscaster on the defeat of the Mutant Registration Act muted, in the background -- Storm, Jean, and Cyclops all sit around a table chatting. Rogue sits on the couch with other students, trying on a new pair of leather gloves.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(louder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier is in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone, Logan would like to say...
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
Logan steps into the doorway. Everyone can see him now. Before Xavier can finish his sentence he is interrupted by --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
APPLAUSE -- simple, genuine, applause.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Students slowly stand up. Proud of Logan. For he is one of them. He is a mutant. And he is a hero.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the unconditional applause echoes around him, Logan seems sincerely touched by their spontaneous outpouring. He is almost choked up -- almost.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The applause quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Logan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
All eyes are on Logan. Logan pauses. He looks to Xavier, then back to the room.
</DIRECTION>
<LOGAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's a guy gotta do to get a beer around here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOGAN>
<DIRECTION>
Logan puts his duffle bag down. He walks over to the table with Storm, Cyclops and Jean. Jean smiles at him, so does Cyclops -- his arm around the back of her chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Logan sees them together, they are happy, and finally he offers a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier holds for a moment at the door. A look of pride on his face, the pride a father has for his children.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PLASTIC PRISON - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CLEAR PLASTIC HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That's right, PLASTIC. Everything we can see -- walls, ceiling, floor -- is made, entirely, of thick, clear plastic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWN THE HALL TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A THICK PLASTIC CELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There, in the middle, at the clear plastic desk, with two clear plastic cups filled with the only thing of color other than the two men in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier and Magneto.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They play a friendly game of chess.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Magneto is notably without his trademark helmet. Two casts encase his legs from his Logan-inflicted injury.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier is on a modified plastic chair with plastic wheels.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't really have let you die, you know. I just needed...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
Magneto thinks for a while; then:
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't it ever wake you in the middle of the night? The feeling that some day, some day very soon, they will pass that foolish law - or one just like it - and they will come for you and your children? Take you all away?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It does indeed, Max.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<MAGNETO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what do you do when you wake up to that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel a great swell of pity for the poor soul who comes to that school again looking for trouble.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
He stares right at Magneto.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Xavier makes a move, Magneto counters. Xavier moves again.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you know that it is a war, old friend. And to win a war it takes the will to fight it at all costs, by any means necessary. And for that reason, I will always have the advantage. No matter how you trap me, how I am contained -
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
Chess pieces seem to visually mimic their conversation Xavier's white pieces slowly surrounding Magneto's Black King.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	- I will always find an escape.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGNETO>
<XAVIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I will always be there, old friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
And with that, Xavier places his queen gently down, taking away a knight.
</DIRECTION>
<XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Check.
	</DIALOGUE>
</XAVIER>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, the door to the cell opens. A Guard waits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Magneto and Xavier stare at one another before Xavier turns and wheels himself out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door closes behind him, leaving Magneto alone with his plastic chess set in his plastic cell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Magneto looks at the pieces before him. Something occurs to him. He smiles a wicked smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And his rook LEVITATES, despite its properties, moving across the board and toppling Xavier's king.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGNETO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And mate.
