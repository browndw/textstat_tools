The seven characters are now seen situated atop an array of large rocks surrounding a flagpole.

The viewer pulls out from a T-shirt displaying a crappy mall- computer-photo of a Happy Kid to see the SHIRT-WEARING KID HIMSELF, clinging to a bus door, WAILING his reddened eyes out. Moving off, one takes in the panorama of rabidly freaked-out CAMPERS and beleaguered COUNSELORS.
</DIRECTION>

Immediately most noticeable is a warped, sparkle-haired fairy later to be known as PIXEL, who floats throughout the scene sticking different colored band-aids on every camper and counselor. Oasis-of-adorability Wendy overgloriously leads a seated circle of singing, clapping campers into song.

There is sudden silence except for the lone shout of Wendy bleating out "Red, red, red." Completely mystified, Oberon and the viewer spin around to see AN EPILEPTIC GIRL having a trembling-on-the-ground fit, unnoticed by the soulfully shut-eyed Wendy.

Camp Director Oberon's seething, whistling face slam-cuts into the image of a roaring bonfire. Oberon's body reveals itself around the inferno, doing a circular storyteller stroll. Huddled and bundled, the campers have settled into something approaching paying attention.

Turning from the youngsters, Wendy incongruously loses her smile, staring down to her hand's insane shorthand. One can almost feel the buzzing in her brain. Suddenly, a marshmallow she is lazily roasting bursts into flame. She quickly blows it out...then slowly, spookily squeezes the burnt marshmallow into her scribbled hand, taking the pain.

The truck noise gets louder. The bed quakes. Red-haired victim Nathan stirs. Adam cues the Straddling kid, who turns on both flashlights.

Oberon looks out to the delirious mass of unshackled boys and girls. Something deep inside him is touched.

EXT. THE BEACH--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another grand glide is made across the camp's lake to the beach waterfront area--now packed with uncharacteristically casual and downright happy kids. Bloodbrothering. Sunbathing. Sandcastle building. Playing Gameboys on motionless canoes.
</DIRECTION>
<SMOOTH_NARRATOR>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	59 minutes of free time. It seemed like such a small concession, yet it was the official end of one summer camp and the beginning of another.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMOOTH_NARRATOR>
<DIRECTION>
The viewer drifts to the end of the beach where a surly Talia, in backpacking gear, is leading a co-ed pack of would- be adventurers. Dripping wet in an unintentionally sexy bikini, Wendy rushes up to Talia, who resists snapping her neck.

<WENDY>

Talia flips the insulin over her head. Sheila, the Sleepwalker, breaks from the pack to make a bobbling catch. Wendy does a hurt cringe as Talia and the hikers move ahead.

TWO FEMALE BEST FRIENDS bring up the rear, arms lobbed over each other, laughing away at some shared secret joke.

The girls scan Wendy rejoining a beatific block of languid sunbathers. Being the more Tomboyesque of the two, HAYLEY's look is one of disparagement while the more prettified VANESSA has a look of longing.
</DIRECTION>
<HAYLEY>

<DIRECTION>
AT THE END OF THE PIER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jasper is cannonballing an eager assembly line of Waterlogged Boys and Girls. There are two sensitive lads that will be part of Jasper's arc--CALEB is a boy from harsh upbringing who responds to Jasper's sensitivity while ANDREW seems to like Jasper in a crush sense.
</DIRECTION>
<CALEB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was a good one! You know, you're not an asshole like other counselors and like--My Father likes to throw me in our pool without warning me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CALEB>
<JASPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, really, Caleb?--Warning!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JASPER>
<DIRECTION>
With good-natured lightning speed, Jasper sends Caleb joyfully flying into the drink as Andrew comes shivering up out. Jasper touches to happy-go-lucky Andrew's blue lip.

Andrew pelicans back into the water. Jasper laughs.

THE BLOCK OF SUNBATHERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CRUSHING-ON-JASPER GIRL (DOROTHY) sits among the sunbathers, charcoaling a pretty impressive drawing of Jasper. Soaking rays nearby, Wendy peers over Dorothy's shoulder. Seeing the object of her. affection, Wendy opens her mouth to say something, then wisely closes it.
</DIRECTION>

Off to the side, the familiar crew of Camper boys gape to the sunbathing enclave. Two tanning thirteen year old Bombshellettes dramatically flip onto their stomachs.

<DIRECTION>
Wichita unzips a fanny pack at his waist and begins to tug out a water balloon as the boys coo in excitement. He quickly re-zips as Wendy turns to him with a look of real affection. Wichita is affected by his effect on her. They awkwardly wave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEACH PANORAMA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the Smooth Narrator chimes in, the sunbathing girls breathlessly look from waving Wendy to waving Wichita. The boys surrounding Wichita do the same. A co-ed group of counselors and campers halt their horseplay in the water to watch the waving.
</DIRECTION>
<SMOOTH_NARRATOR>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some liked the cookouts, some liked the water sports, but the one activity everyone had an interest in was watching the attractive and attracted opposites of Rulemaker Wendy and Rulebreaker Wichita. They were becoming the heart of the organism, pumping blood to its every pore.

	Haven't you seen movies where the beautiful girl realizes--"Hey, maybe I don't have to be with the most foxy hunk in the world, you know, maybe that nice, caring guy, the one the others sometimes call "nerd"-- Maybe he's the one who--"

</DON_T_TOUCH_ME_TODD>

Wendy sighs with amused compassion as Donald tries to turn the boy off. She pivots back to the block of sunbathers-- a water balloon whips past her right into the radio causing it to static. The sunbathers shriek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wendy swerves to the sight of Wichita and the boys cackling away. Wendy doesn't know whether to shout in anger or amusement. A frog grib-bits at her feet. She smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wichita and the boys continue to whoop it up with intentional gold-medal-win exaggeration. Wendy, with the Sunbathing Girls as giggling chorus, rushes up and puts a frog down Wichita's trunks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wendy races off. The boys "Whoa!" The girls "Yes!" Wichita wrenches the beast out with an impressed chuckle. He narrows his eyes to Wendy bounding like a doe into the woods, then slowly looks down to the frog. He breaks into a dash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE FOREST--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wichita pants into the woods; the crackling bramble at his feet and the croaking frog in his hand are the forest's only sounds. Wichita weaves his vision tree to tree trying to lock on to his target--he scans a blur of bikini darting behind a cedar. He heaves forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An envious Donald and a coed cluster of campers have entered into the brush, berating each other with shushing sounds. Like one multi-legged beast, they rustle toward Wichita.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wichita swings around a tree (with an ancient heart and initials carved upon it) to see Wendy lying in wait against the next tree over, seemingly unaware of Wichita's presence behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Wichita panthers forward, Wendy bites her lip and closes her eyes. Wichita carefully reaches out to the bikini bottom, clenching his teeth, dangling the frog.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Catching discreet sight of this strange image, the boys and girls slam to a gasping halt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Talia and her hikers, from a ridge above, catch another angle of this perverse-act-posing-as-an-all-in-good-fun-prank.

Wendy's suit is ever-so-slightly pulled back. Wendy gulps. Wichita gulps. The frog moans as it is gently lowered into...

	What kind of nauseous fucky-fuck ritual is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBERON>

Almost magically appearing in the middle of the forest, snarling through his headset, Oberon sends everyone into trembling fear. Wichita drops the frog to the ground. It hops away.
</DIRECTION>
<OBERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wichita...I should have known this was going to happen! Et tu, Wendy? And look at all of you, the giddy witnesses! I command a complete camp lockdown until dawn! No one is to leave their cabin and no one is to say one word about this incident or the entire subject of sexuality until I can concoct proper punishment! Move it!

Donald makes a triumphant re-entry into the cabin to lounge upon Jasper's bed.

<DONALD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was one of the five great shits of my life. You know, when you start off with incredible resistance, then pow, two, neat packages that you barely have to wipe. I need a hug.

Finishing a patrol, Jasper huffs into the room, setting down his flashlight. There is a moment of awkwardness. Donald a-little-too-quickly bounds up from Jasper's bed.

	Oh God...that's it? I'm "the gay guy." Every time I walk into a room, everyone is going to...

Wichita and Wendy are quite cozily seated side-by-side in the middle of the staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ann Taylor would have paid a lot more, but I wouldn't trade this experience for the world. Sometimes the first time you understand anything is when you have to explain it to someone younger-- You think I'm a big dork don't you?

Wichita cackles, further nestling against Wendy. They take each other's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<WICHITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have more in common than you think, Wendy dear. I loved summer camp when I was young and I love it now. It's important. Between school, family, friends, pot, playstations, basic cable, and the goddamn Internet, it's possible to go your whole life without listening to your soul. Out here, in nature, away from the shit, surrounded by reminders of who I once was...I get recharged. Now who's the dork?

Oberon suddenly awakens. He bounces up from a cot in his pristine office and begins violently sniffing.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE STAIRS BETWEEN THE CABINS--NIGHT

Wendy and Wichita lie back on the landing in the middle of the staircase, going into a full-on, side-to-side make-out session. Wichita's hand begins a smooth ascent beneath Wendy's shirt. Wendy breaks off.

Thinking he has suavely defused the situation, Wichita swoops yet again. Alas, Wendy grimly sits all the way up.

	Sometimes I think you're just into nihilism for nihilism's sake.

	That's the point of nihilism; you know, what other sake is there? You're not laughing.

Wichita exhales through his teeth and rises all the way up to look out into the night. He turns to Wendy.
</DIRECTION>
<WICHITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe in organized religion, organized school, and organized summer camp. I don't believe cigarette advertisements have ever caused a single teenager to take up smoking. Premature death sells itself. I find Catcher in the Rye a bit whiny, and much prefer Franny and Zooey...

	That is one frightening sentence.

	Please, that's the way summer camp has worked for years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<WICHITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, that's the way summer camp has not worked for years. The old coming-of-age rituals are just so...expired. You think you can just throw an arm around these kids' shoulders and say, "I know how you feel. Life is kind of tough. All that I ask is that you be the best you can be." How do you tell my tubby, whiny loser Todd to be the best you can be, when the best he can be is probably pretty shitty. Wendy, you're an idealist and that's wonderful, but an idealist without reality is like a great dancer without legs.

	Yeah, well, too bad for him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
In a clumsy attempt at passion that comes across as even more passionate because of its clumsiness, a rising Wendy struggles off her shirt. Wichita effortlessly peels off his and also stands. They crush into each other's arms and each other's lips, waltzing off the side of the staircase, disappearing into the darkness of the forest.

He raises his mighty flashlight to...Sheila, the Sleepwalker in the middle of another eerie somnambulistic trek. Oberon sighs, then readjusts his beam...as the Sleepwalker shockingly/obliviously drifts by Wichita and Wendy clawing each other on the forest floor.

	Of course after I was hit by lightning, things around the camp changed...but not as much one would think. At least not right away...Oh. Yes. I'm the narrator.

INT./EXT. ARTS AND CRAFTS ROOM--DAY
</DIRECTION>

Wendy is aggressively marking up some official paperwork. She then rises from the desk to vociferously supervise a line of campers making wallets. She reaches the window where she pulls on the head-set, sticks out her head, and blows the whistle-- commencing an obstacle course going on outside.

Wichita does a fake-yawning peek out the window to see crush- on-Jasper Dorothy recoil behind a tree.
</DIRECTION>
<JASPER>

	Hey, it's not a crush anymore if you actually say it to the person you supposedly have the...

EXT. A PIECE OF THE FOREST--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Head down in depression, Wendy leads a single-file centipede of her robed campers away from the showers. Wichita, head down as well, leads a line of his camperstoward the showers.
</DIRECTION>
<OBERON_NARRATION>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Being over eighteen, the counselors assumed all love is shit. It was the campers who were most disillusioned by the fall of Wichita and Wendy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBERON_NARRATION>
<DIRECTION>
The two human trains are about to collide when Wendy and Wichita look up. Without verbal acknowledgement, they glumly readjust and continue their head-down trek. The boys and girls look from Wendy to Wichita in despair.

Wendy hops upon a chair at the head of the cafeteria and booms out a cheer.

	At even the best camps, the fear and excitement of the opening weeks gives way to dull routine, but after finding and losing the thrill of romance, the organism that was Camp Bleeding Squaw seem to wither and die faster than usual.

The image of Wendy vibrating atop the chair, leading a cheer, repeats itself.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another line of campers solemnly sit with their bored look- a-like parents in the Arts and Crafts room. The campers dutifully hold up some piece of crap they made. The parents weakly smile as it falls apart.
</DIRECTION>
<OBERON_NARRATION>

</BOYS_VOICE_FROM_DIARY>
<GIRLS_VOICE_FROM_DIARY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was just so neat to see them flirting and pretending to be arguing with each other. It was like watching Titanic without the boat. That's why I'm so happy everything's going to come together on Day 21...

Oberon smiles, then looks to his watch. He kicks out the fire and heads off.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. CENTER OF CAMP--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A flag reading DAY 21 hits the top of the flagpole. Wendy is revealed to be pulling it, sadly mumbling her familiar flag raising song.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WICHITA AND JASPER'S CABIN--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wichita watches Wendy walk away from the flagpole way in the distance. He turns to see Eric slide off his top bunk to chat up his pal Stanley in the bunk below.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was a bummer, Stanley--your parents not coming to parents day-- you all right?

	Sure, Wichita. Whatever you say...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BY THE LAKE--MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guitar music accompanies Eric's pumped trek. He spurts from some trees and stops dead at the sound of a splash. Pixel is unwinding in the water, luxuriating in her ritualistic skinny-dip. A traumatized (in the best sense) expression is frozen upon Eric's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE MESS HALL--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Strumming a guitar before the crowd, Wendy is revealed to be responsible for the soundtrack. She finishes off, seemingly commenting on the previous scene.
</DIRECTION>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't Fun great? It's the first day of last half of camp, so let's start with the biggest YEE-HO yet. YEE- HO!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
The cafeteria crowd does not even attempt a response, completely wrapped in their own conversations. Wendy grits up some strength and belts out louder, pulling out a gold flyer.
</DIRECTION>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy oh boy and girl oh girl, looks like I'm going to have to tug out my super-secret summer weapon! I think I have two words that will turn some of those frowns upside down.

Talia and Donald share a moan. Donald raises up his hand for a high-five.

</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ted, dry for a week. I'm proud of you.

</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
The counselor and camper trade thumb-up signs. Adam continues on, flipping forth scavenger lists to Wichita and Jasper, who drowsily scowl at them.
</DIRECTION>
<JASPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wichita, this is one girl who needs a good virginity loss...Uh, what's with Eric?

Eric sits at the end of the table with the same dazed expression he had while watching Pixel.

<WICHITA>

	Eric's been a good boy, so I thought I'd initiate him into the world of...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WICHITA>
<DIRECTION>
Wichita cuts off. Squinting down, he pokes his finger into his cereal bowl and pinches out a plastic baggie that has been submerged in the milk. In the bag is a note which Wichita swiftly skims. His eyes widen and he bolts up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT WENDY'S TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The African-American Super-counselor bends to Wendy, who speaks while she eats.
</DIRECTION>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And don't forget to make sure the campers all have sacks to put their retrieved objects in. Oh, and before I forget...What's he doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
Wendy cuts off to watch Wichita rush past and pound through the cafeteria doors. She brings a spoonful of cereal, with a baggied note balanced atop, to her unsuspecting lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WENDY AND PIXEL'S QUARTERS--DAY

Wendy pounds into her quarters just as Wichita vaults through the mammoth open cabin window. Awkward.

Wichita and Wendy uncomfortably lean toward each other, comparing notes.

	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<WICHITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely. Day after Parent's Day is important. The campers need to feel they're not going back to the usual grind. They need to be challenged...

Wheezing, controlling her anger, Wendy counts to ten.

<WENDY>

	8, 9, 10...I apologize for my outburst. We've both been under stress. I know you're not religious, but ever since Oberon...What are you doing? Don't, please don't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
Wichita narrows his eyes, past a hand-flailing Wendy, to a myriad of family photos stuck to her wall. He focuses on a picture of Young Wendy and family at Niagara Falls.
</DIRECTION>
<WICHITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When were you in Niagara Falls?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WICHITA>
<WENDY>

Wichita zeroes his gaze behind Wendy's family in the picture to an adolescent boy in the background, standing at a rail with his back turned. WICHITA'S BLOWN-AWAY EXPRESSION TELLS THE VIEWER THAT THE BOY IS WICHITA.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone was hungry for a change, but no one more than Talia, even if Change meant being eaten by a family of bears. She had become a camp counselor for reasons other than camp or counseling with harsh results. On Day 21, she was pretty much resigned to 19 more days of torture...until she opened her eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBERON_NARRATION>
<DIRECTION>
Talia re-focuses back to the log--Subversively tomboyesque Hayley is making her cross when her friend Vanessa calls out from a planted position at the end of the makeshift bridge. The Bombshellettes can be seen waiting in the fuzzy distance.

FURTHER ALONG IN THE WOODS

The Kids are spread out over the woods, looking downward like a search party tracking down a corpse. A RED-TEAM CAMPER rushes up to a staring-ahead Adam, holding up a robin's egg.

Adam is revealed to be transfixed by Pixel-in-tight-shorts before him. The viewer drifts ahead to Pixel, who has a naughty, knows-she's-being-watched-but-dare-not-turn-around smile on her face.

	As much as Pixel was nauseated by Adam, she was intrigued. The Wendy project was not quite going the way she wanted...and a vibrator would keep the kids awake at night and besides, there was only one electrical outlet in the cabin to begin with so...

	Well, a positive "suck" usage. You must be so proud. Okay, I suppose I deserve to be poked fun of a little bit, but...but climbing the mountain is the granddaddy of the Camp Bleeding Squaw No-No's! It can not be done!

EXT. UP AHEAD ON THE SIDE OF THE HILL--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camp is splayed on the side of the hill, basking in a warranted rest break. A constellation of seated-on-the-rock female counselors and campers are getting vigorous back massages from the Wichita's boys. Stanley shiatsus a comically shellshocked Wendy.

	Oh yes...I need this.

The painfully familiar ballad blares on. Wendy relaxes in a reverie. Everyone else groans. The nearby counselors and campers begin singing along with the song in intentionally silly off-key fashion. Talia and Hayley are especially obnoxious. Wendy seethes.

Jasper and his young pals, Caleb and Andrew, laugh it up to the bad singing, then continue banging on a very complicated Playstation.

Jasper gives up the game with a groan. The boys bustle away. Jasper looks out in sad contemplation. Adam suddenly sits down beside him. An amazing flower is sprouted between them.

Wendy turns off the radio to cut off the smartass singing. Led by Talia and Hayley, everyone applauds themselves. Wendy exhales, then turns back to her masseur, Stanley.

EXT. THE TOP OF THE HILL--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behold, the flat top of the mini-mountain, overlooking a rather glorious vista. A lone boy clambers up into view. It is the wailing child from the opening, who now has a glowing expression that matches the one on his T-shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rest of the camp bubbles atop the mountain gasping and sputtering with "We did it" joy. Everyone quickly winds down into a plop upon the summit and looks out. The first moment of absolute tranquillity in the film. And the last.

Pixel undeniably-glamorously lights up a cigarette, ripping a match against a rock--all under the watchful eye of an ADORING FEMALE CAMPER.

Wendy rack-focuses to the view of a bee pollen-bingeing upon a nearby flower. She ferally crawls over and squeezes the flower and the bee, launching into a therapeutic scream.

The boy wipes away his tears, giggling at Wendy, as she shuffles to the edge of the mini-mountain, raising her stung palm in the air.

	Oh my, you're making your big move, aren't you, Retarded Marshmallow Head? And you've been coached by the best. I mean, of course, let's pair off the two geeks! How convenient for everyone. Talia can't possibly have any standards! All of you can go to hell!

WENDY

continues to rave, stung hand in air, back to the viewer.
</DIRECTION>
<WENDY>

DONALD

wobbles to the ground in mortification. Hearing a sizzling noise, he turns to see Billy's lit fuse blazing toward a Frog covered with taped firecrackers.

The disgusting sounds of the thankfully unseen explosion are thrown into the mountaintop mix. Donald staggers Pvt. Ryan-style, sprinkled with frog's blood.

Some counselors are huddled in a nearby trench. They watch Troublemaker Billy fall to the ground, laughing.

</DIRECTION>
<OBERON_NARRATION>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Much like a little boy who throws sand at the girl in the sandbox because he likes her, Wichita had helped turn the mountain into a rumbling volcano that had almost given Wendy a nervous breakdown. A good time was had, but it was now time to move on. To start to take responsibility. To deal with the implications of the photograph on Wendy's wall...
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBERON_NARRATION>
<DIRECTION>
Sounds of chaos come back. Wichita finally turns and tanks forward, making sharp scans to the pockets of anarchy around him. Darkening clouds. Traumatized campers. The blood-stained statue of Donald. The wailing wake around a froglike crater. Talia helping hemorrhaging Hayley down the hill. Laughing Billy. Zombie Mutant Wendy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wichita exchanges nods with a rather familiar girl. The rather familiar girl goes into the throes of a very familiar epileptic fit immediately sobering everyone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
However, the creature that will not die, the monstrously swollen Wendy continues to hobble forward.

INT. INFIRMARY ROOM--DUSK

Rain pounds outside. Her head bloated to an almost sci-fi degree, Wendy moans away on a cot. Wichita is by her side, surrounded by some of the other counselors.

<DIRECTION>
Trying to rip open a tampon, Talia is crouched before a standing, shivering Hayley. Both are crying.

Wichita hustles into a cabin, leading out his charges.

Soaked to the bone, Donald moroses through the door, straight into his quarters, clutching a sack. Wichita takes notice.

INT. DONALD'S QUARTERS--DUSK

Donald unlocks a drawer and throws in his condoms atop an another load of unopened condom boxes. He plops a shiny porno mag atop them all and relocks the drawer. Wichita pokes in (Worshipping Eric noticeably loiters behind).

</DONALD>
<WICHITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's still pissed at me and took it out on you. We should have taken it slower. It's hard to operate in the woods. Much easier in, like a club. Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up from behind and touch her neck...

	Camp Eberhardt. Anne Wilson, lovely Anne Wilson. She was the only camper to have a lifeguard's license so she was the only one allowed to take out a canoe without supervision. She asked me to come with her for a post-bonfire spin around the lake and I said no. I was young, I was nervous, I didn't really like canoes-- I said no. If I would have gone on that canoe, I'd be a different person, I know it. Successful, happy, assertive. I'd be a nearsighted Wichita. You think you're a kid so your decisions don't matter now. They do. They all do.

<WICHITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. You know, Todd, no one cares whether you live or die. Don't get me wrong, it's the same for everybody. Now it's a sad thing that nobody cares if you die--but then if you're dead, who cares that nobody cares. Now the nobody cares if you live part is great. It means you can come up with any idea and quietly burrow it into the world. You may fail a few times and other people might say negative things, but other people are basically lame and they never put up much of a fight.

A radio is playing "Oh, my Unforgettable Summer Love." The monstrously swollen Wendy, half-awake, murmurs affectingly along with the song. Wichita is revealed standing in the doorway watching her. He briefly murmurs along, too. His ruggedly casual look has smoothed into one of a tamed tiger.

Wearing only boxers, Donald obliviously closes shudders over the sight of the camper prowlers. Donald proceeds to put a towel upon his chair and a hot oil bottle upon his desk, beside an innocuous Wendy Polaroid. He climatically opens his drawer. No dirty mag. Donald goes into a panicked ransack.

THE REST OF THE CABIN

Troublemaker Billy is wailing as loud as a gagged person can. Hence the strange noise. His arms are tied around a tree. A Tennis racquet is pressed against his bare chest by one Adamesque camper, while others, using Brillo pads, severely scrape skin poking out. Adam observes.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's called "Pink waffle"--perhaps before your time--Brillo pad scraped against the skin popping out from a pressed down tennis racquet. Okay, that's enough!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a chuckle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm only kidding. More.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
The Brilloing gets fiercer. The muffled moans get louder. Pixel suddenly appears, pushing everyone out of the way. Tennis racquet batted away, Billy's stomach indeed resembles a pink waffle. Adam's Henchmen tear the boy away with them.
</DIRECTION>
<PIXEL>

	Sadist! I can't believe I thought you could change--This is your idea of discipline? You're a monster. That kid is going to be traumatized for...

Surprising Adam, the viewer, and herself, Pixel unzips Adam's pants and reaches her hand inside. She determinedly strokes and Adam helplessly quivers.

EXT. WOODS BEHIND THE BOYS CABINS--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wiping off his sweat with his shirt, a euphoric Adam emerges from the woods behind his cabin. He scans a half-awake Bedwetter Ted crunched upright against a tree stump with a blanket.
</DIRECTION>
<BEDWETTER_TED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Adam...I'm sorry...I've...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEDWETTER_TED>
<ADAM>

Adam hefts Ted up and compassionately steadies him toward the cabin. The viewer's viewpoint rises to take in OBERON lumbering across the roof like a warped Santa Claus. His narration slithers over the following visions.
</DIRECTION>
<OBERON_NARRATION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only now that I was detached from it, could I see how dazzling and alive a summer camp could be. Can you blame me for wanting to experiment, to test and to prod the organism, to want to take it to the next extreme...

</OBERON_NARRATION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ONE OF THE BOYS CABINS--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OBERON's hands snatch a Playstation from a knapsack and another one out from underneath a pillow. He also clings up a pile of comic books poking out through a trunk
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WENDY'S CABIN--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From a shelf above Wendy's sleeping head, OBERON's hand tugs out a pristine copy of the happy-happy Counselor workbooklet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GROUNDS NEAR THE CENTER OF CAMP--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Many workbooklets, many playstations, as well as whistles, drugs (medicinal and otherwise), car keys, candy bars, cell phone and power books are heaved into a massive, dug-out hole. Oberon's beloved stopwatch is maraschino-ed atop the pile. Dirt is heaved over everything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OBERON'S OFFICE--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OBERON kicks open the door to his ex-office. He takes a delicious pause before laying siege to the immaculate lair of efficiency. OBERON violently tips a bookcase, hurls papers, shreds his cardboard timetable. He then rips out the camp's ham radio sending the film into black.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OUT OF BLACK--CENTER OF THE CAMP--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The campers stagger the center of the camp, silently howling their heads off. The counselors help some breathe into inhalers. Oberon's voice soothes the soundtrack.
</DIRECTION>
<OBERON_NARRATION>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	The initial reaction to my actions, especially the burying-the-toys maneuver, was less than superb.

INT. OBERON'S OFFICE--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wendy, Wichita, and the other counselors suspiciously encircle the "sleeping" Oberon. They turn around, walk a couple paces, then spin back hoping to catch him moving.
</DIRECTION>
<OBERON_NARRATION>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tensions were raised and certain suspicions were aroused...but it wasn't long before the counselors realized the succulent freedom that lay before them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBERON_NARRATION>
<DIRECTION>
The counselors survey the damage, the destroyed communications equipment and the spilled bookage, with boggled expressions that are not necessarily unhappy. Donald lifts up the ripped-up cardboard timetable and broadly grins. The other counselors, even ex-fascists Wendy and Adam, grin as well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE FOREST--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like Dali watches, campers are strategically splayed about a forest clearing. A deer delicately clumps around them. The campers simultaneously rise up out of their stupor.
</DIRECTION>
<OBERON_NARRATION>

	Soon the rest of the camp let go and went with the utopian flow.

EXT. THE LAKE--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lake is placid and untouched. Suddenly, the entire camp, counselors and campers, boisterously plow into the frame and into the water with their clothes on to splash and shout in giddy release.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BONFIRE AT THE CENTER OF THE CAMP--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam and Jasper tip the humungous homemade scoreboard into a huge bonfire as the rest of the camp cheers. The campers jut forward to fling their colored headbands into the flames.
</DIRECTION>
<OBERON_NARRATION>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Every camp, in its closing weeks, must cut loose from the regimentation of its early stages. Every camp has to find a way to reinvent itself in a more casual, free-er form....Bleeding Squaw just went a bit further. I can't take all the credit--there was a much deeper cause of our anarchy than my cut-the-camp- off-from-civilization mischief...

EXT. BY THE LAKE--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the operatic music continues, Pixel splashes/meditates in the throes of her morning skinny dip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric again stares out from the woods, completely bewitched. The viewer's viewpoint pulls out to reveal that Eric is surrounded by practically every other male child in the camp, all looking forward with the same life-will-never-be-the- same gaping mouth.

Pixel does a somersault in the water, catching a glimpse of the army of young voyeurs. She bursts back up. The boys are gone.

EXT. PATCH OF FOREST--DAY

<DIRECTION>
Crush-on-Jasper Dorothy snips a hefty lock of a napping-in- the-forest Jasper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TALIA'S CABIN--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seemingly chanting along with the operatic music, a very pagan Dorothy puts the hair in an altar covered with sketches of Jasper. Her friends help out in the bizarre ritual.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE CENTER OF CAMP--DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the center of camp's grass, resembling a 60's love-in, every male camper gives a massage to every female camper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAFETERIA--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Operatic music cuts off. With comically intentional stiffness, Wichita approaches Wendy at her cafeteria table.
</DIRECTION>
<WICHITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, Counselor Wendy, I need assistance in finding that important...thingie in the storage room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WICHITA>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my gosh, why didn't you say something earlier...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
Holding in laughter, Wendy and Wichita solemnly move off from the table toward a storage room at the back of the Mess hall. Most of the campers and counselors subtly stop speaking and eating to behold them as the operatic music creeps back on.
</DIRECTION>
<OBERON_NARRATION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As always, everything revolved around Wendy and Wichita. They were the plant on the classroom windowsill, fed and watered by enthusiastic teachers and children.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBERON_NARRATION>
<DIRECTION>
A special pan is made across the unrequited lovers Donald, Jasper (big patch of hair missing at his temple), and Pixel, who sighs down to a shockingly relaxed Adam dozing on her lap. They all sadly blink as Wendy and Wichita animatedly unlock the storage door and disappear inside.
</DIRECTION>
<OBERON_NARRATION>

INT. STORAGE ROOM--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wichita naughtily backs Wendy into the sizable storage room. She gleefully half-fends off his frisky prods beneath her blouse and down her shorts.
</DIRECTION>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you really think we're fooling anyone?

Wendy surrenders into a kiss. The couple crushes back against a wood table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STORAGE ROOM--ANOTHER DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With no tentative giggling foreplay whatsoever, Wichita and Wendy hungrily bash through the storage room door and immediately launch into each other. They do a Postman-Always- Rings-Twice collapse up atop the table and begin clawing each other's clothes off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STORAGE ROOM--YET ANOTHER DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Passion down to a clinical science, Wendy and Wichita swiftly but calmly enter the storage room. With military precision, Wendy removes her shorts, lies back on the table, and lifts her tennis shoed feet into the air. Wichita removes his shirt and fiddles with his pants. They converse as if they were playing Scrabble.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOREST CAMPFIRE--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oberon, beard larger than ever, is familiarly sifting through Wichita and Wendy's respective Journals. The pages are barren of new writing. He eventually clings up some of the campers' journals as well. Blank as well.
</DIRECTION>
<OBERON_NARRATION>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So much was happening, so quickly, no time to process it for both witnesses and participants. The journals, so often packed with scribbled spiritual groping, were now completely blank. Constant activity, be it archery or fucking, without introspection is dangerous. It causes a brain clot, even worse a clotting of the soul. Bleeding Squaw had gone Koyaanisquatsi...out- of-balance, but then, if you've ever been to a summer camp, you know how matters most astonishing, tragic, and wondrous are not worked out until the very last day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBERON_NARRATION>
<DIRECTION>
Gravely rising, Oberon clumps the diaries into his arms and kicks dirt over the campfire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CENTER OF CAMP--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A very different Wendy--tougher, older, not quite wiser-- dutifully raises, while smoking a cigarette, a ragged flag marked 40. A pack of campers can only-very-briefly be seen making a wild Lord of the Flies run in the b.g.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE MESS HALL--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MESS HALL is a mess. Loud and dirty with a black eye or two, the campers race around from table to table in rhythmic chaos. Boys and girls eat together--some of them on the floor. The counselors are too ethereally de-energized to do anything actively disciplinary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BY TALIA'S TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In perfect syncopation, the Bombshellettes, with a similarly coiffed Vanessa musketeered between them, saunter across the mess hall. A much more bohemian Hayley passes by the trio. The two ex-friends do not even acknowledge each other enough to ignore each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hayley brakes before the uncharacteristically counseling counselor Talia, who is surprisingly holding court with a group of awed campers. Talia is almost unrecognizably unbrittle and earth motheresque (flower in hair!). Hayley attaches a string of Arts and Crafty beads around her mentor.
</DIRECTION>
<OBERON_NARRATION>

	Oh, I almost forgot about Talia. She did the most shocking thing of all: She became a camp counselor.

Dazed by his would-be revolutionary fervor (and non-fervor toward her), Wendy wobbles down to the nearest seat. Next to her, Ryan, the former Golden Boy, looking like a strung- out heroin addict, sleazes up to Eric.

	Yeah, okay, I was a little out of hand, but come on, you got to give me Todd. Don't get me wrong, I've learned to love the little Piggy, but Todd is the most invincible loser I've ever come across. His greatest talent is lack thereof. No matter what the category, bet against him and win.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wichita rounds the outside of the mess hall, tossing the football to himself, humming. He gets a glimpse of Wendy and Pixel in heated discussion around the corner. Wichita recoils back, letting the football drop to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<PIXEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, let's go through it again...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIXEL>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is so silly, Pixel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<PIXEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to know if Wichita's love is true. I can think of nothing less silly. I approach Wichita at the beach, tell him he needs to go to the woods...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIXEL>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll never work...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
Pressed against the brick around the corner, a lip-biting Wichita eavesdrops, absolutely enthralled.
</DIRECTION>
<PIXEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll be hiding behind a tree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIXEL>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The oak where Jocelyn sprained her ankle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<PIXEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. When we get into the clearing, I'll turn on my sexy moves. Wichita will go for it or he'll shoot me down. Either way, you come away with knowledge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIXEL>
<WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
(resigned sigh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's do it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
To the sound of their retreating footsteps, Wichita exhales a tickled chuckle. Strangely though, his beaming face deteriorates into a rock-hard-serious expression.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE BEACH--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting on the beach, Wichita has maintained his eerie, stone faced expression as the camp merrily gallivants around him. Pixel's shadow envelopes him.
</DIRECTION>
<PIXEL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wichita--the Thomas Twins are missing. Somebody said they saw them run into the forest. Can you help me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIXEL>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE WOODS--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In alluring bathing suitage, face scrunched in mock-concern, Pixel leads Wichita through the forest. She stops in a clearing for some borderline bad acting.
</DIRECTION>
<PIXEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmmm...I wonder where those two rascals could be...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIXEL>
<DIRECTION>
Wichita gives a glance to a nearby massive Oak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND THE OAK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wendy eeks around the back to see Wichita move closer to Pixel, who is nastily fingering her bathing suit straps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CLEARING
</DIRECTION>
<PIXEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that were in the middle of nowhere, aren't you a little curious to know what it'd be like to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIXEL>
<DIRECTION>
Wichita abruptly yanks Pixel into a passionately passionless kiss. His eyes are wide open. So are Pixel's. She watches Wendy quiver out from around the tree in shock.
</DIRECTION>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! No...You...you...God damn you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
Wichita tears Pixel away with a cold stare. He closes his eyes, swallows hard, then turns to see Wendy bolt away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE BEACH--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The counselors and campers continue to cut an idyllic image on the beach, playing, splashing, relaxing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The new, laid-back Adam lazily catches some rays, reading some gooey Women-are-from-Venus self-help book. Pixel scampers up in a breathless delirium.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where have you been, babe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<PIXEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch this--the empire is crumbling...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIXEL>
<DIRECTION>
A weeping Wendy tears into the Beach Party postcard, stopping at the water's edge. Wichita storms up behind her. Frisbees drop. Sandcastles collapse. The camp extinguishes their beach blanket bingo to watch their model of romantic love rupture.
</DIRECTION>
<WICHITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wendy--I'm sorry--Wend--
	</DIALOGUE>
</WICHITA>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could you--how could--I gave you ever-y-thing! I gave you parts of myself I never even knew I had!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<WICHITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wendy, I never meant to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WICHITA>
<DIRECTION>
Wendy connects with a savage punch to Wichita's stomach that leaves him and the rest of the beach gasping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OBERON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is revealed in the bushes at the back of the beach, watching through binoculars. He swings his viewpoint from the Wendy- Wichita fight to a small canoe...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE WATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unaware of the goings-on sandside, Tracy, the epileptic girl, has her arms around Two Best Buddies, belting out a silly song, while standing on a canoe. She starts to vibrate into a seizure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEACH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oberon lowers his binoculars and howls. Wichita and Wendy truce their war to take notice of him.
</DIRECTION>
<WICHITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Big Chief Oberon has awakened. What is he...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WICHITA>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh look, that girl you got on your payroll is doing her seizure act again...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
The expression on Wichita's face tells the viewer what is already known. That this is no act.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE WATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tracey falls. Her head bashes against the side of the boat on the way down into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE BEACH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wichita instantly breaks from his stupor and lightnings into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rest of the counselors charge onto the pier. Wichita aches Tracy the epileptic girl's body up out of the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Talia cuts in before an impressed African-American SuperCounselor and takes over with paramedic poise. Mouth to mouthing. Shaking Tracy awake.
</DIRECTION>
<TALIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tracy, can you hear me? Okay good, that's it, that's right, cough it out. We're going to the infirmary, honey...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TALIA>
<DIRECTION>
Tracy coughs to consciousness. Talia hefts Tracy up and hustles her away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WICHITA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is still in the water in his clothes, utterly unnerved. He sinks below the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE PIER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The counselors watch Epileptic Tracy being carried away into the forest. Wendy rumbles...then erupts.
</DIRECTION>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't you see...We've been selfishly clawing for any thrill we can get with a reckless, putrid disregard to safety and morality and...and now we are being punished! Rightfully punished!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<PIXEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, please. Epileptic Girls should always wear life preservers. End of story. Let's dance.

EXT. THE AREA BEFORE THE BOYS CABINS--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The area before the cabins has been done up with cheesy hanging lights. A vicious rocker pounds from a crappy stereo system worked by Donald. The Upper and Lower Income Latin Boys from the opening are doing an intense lip-sync, sharing a mike before the wildly-badly dancing crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSKIRTS OF DANCE AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Talia and Hayley are crashed on some cabin steps. They are silent and a little sad.
</DIRECTION>
<HAYLEY>

</HAYLEY>
<TALIA>

	Yeah, an insane female gynecologist! Hayley, don't listen to her.
	</DIALOGUE>

	They're the easiest to shoplift, okay? No woman should have to pay for something forced-on-her-without- choice by Nature...what's the matter, Hayley?

As they playfully bicker, Hayley gazes, with a tinge of longing, to Vanessa and the Bombshellettes parked at a picnic table, flirting up a storm with their cute-boy-counterparts.
</DIRECTION>
<TALIA>

	What do you think--it's the Last Night of Camp Dance.

DANCE AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Briefly lowering the musique, Donald takes the microphone.
</DIRECTION>
<DONALD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You asked for it. You're scared of it. You got it--the last slow dance of the summer--in ten minutes. You have been warned. Act accordingly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONALD>
<DIRECTION>
The campers stop and shudder as if hit with an electromagnetic pulse. They gulp and move toward one another as Donald cranks back up with a happy tune.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking and feeling unfestive, Wichita enters the arena. His eyes rove over the Last Dance ambiance. The African- American SuperCounselor and her big Stoner Lug beau stroll by, touchingly holding hands, with matching paper mache roses. Adam sidles beside Wichita for contemplation.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get a load of those two. Still in the kissy-hand holdy stage. Pretty pathetic, huh?

INT. THE KITCHEN--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A slam-cut away from the dance, into the kitchen. Wendy, in an eerie black turtleneck, pounds a vast scattering of multi-colored tablets into dust with a meat tenderizer. She sweeps the chemical powder into the familiar thermos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE DANCE--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The campers continue to adorably-awkwardly couple up. Pixel and Talia look on like Wall Street brokers.
</DIRECTION>
<PIXEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right, you're right, that's a good match. Pam never speaks and Martin can't shut up. Hurry, what about Hayley...

Taking to the crowd, Talia and Pixel burst from each other, revealing behind them: Adam leading one of his campers through a practice slow dance with Bob Dole grace as other Adam-Campers study from the side.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A slow dance is a light moving hug. Don't force anything. Be her shadow.

Adam glances to Jasper, who raises up a cup in a "toast" motion. Adam tries to glower, but half-smiles.

JASPER

sips his cup and turns to Caleb.

BY THE DJ AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donald presses a button and an Acid Jazzy version of "Kumbaya" comes over the speakers. Donald turns to poignantly watch the young and younger couples clumsily come together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bespectacled Donaldish Cosmo is dancing with his rendezvous partner. He gives Donald a salute, which the counselor sadly returns. Suddenly, wordlessly, the darkly garbed Wendy appears and pulls Donald out onto the dance floor dirt.

MIDDLE OF THE DANCE FLOOR DIRT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bedwetter Ted and Hayley drift, quite relaxed in each other's arms. The red-capped Teaser from his cabin shouts out, while dancing with Vanessa.
</DIRECTION>
<RED_CAPPED_TEASER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Bedwetter Ted, too bad your dry spell's over. I hope you remembered your diaper, dude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RED_CAPPED_TEASER>
<DIRECTION>
Losing a smile, Adam focuses upon the Red-capped jerk with a look of death. The viewer curls to Adam's dance partner, Pixel. Pixel's eyes float down the backside of Wendy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wendy's partner, Donald, floats on air, his face beaming out of control. The viewer's viewpoint twists around to the stony of expression of Wendy. She is, in turn, glaring out to Wichita and Talia dancing together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wichita and Talia feel the chill.
</DIRECTION>
<TALIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Br-r-r. Nice show at the beach this afternoon. What's this little tift about?

	Oh my God, there goes Amber again. I gotta go be a counselor...

</TALIA>
<DIRECTION>
Talia rushes off. "Kumbaya" ends and is replaced by a robust punk ditty. The couples go into tribal writhing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The abandoned Wichita's attention is pulled to the sight of Eric planting his dance partner on a chair. With queasy awareness, Wichita watches Eric give her an "I'll be right back" gesture. The mentor's eyes follow the protoge to the punch bowl where Eric flirts with some other girls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wichita scans back to Eric's dance partner beginning to feel restless and unwanted. After a squirming beat, Eric finally neck-touches the Girl from behind. Wichita sadly realizes, just as the viewer does, that he has taught Eric well. Dark Wendy breaks Wichita's concentration, clutching a lantern and the fateful thermos.

	But, but that was before we started sharing stuff. Before I told you how I cried when Peepers died. I never told anyone that before.

</ADAM>

	And this Peepers was your...dog? If it makes you feel better, I probably wasn't paying attention.

	That doesn't make me feel better! Why are you being like this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>

Adam spins Pixel by her elbows, slamming her spine against a tree. She lets off a more amused-than-angered yelp.

EXT. OUTSIDE THE BOYS' CABINS--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donald sweeps up post-dance debris. A radio sputters.
</DIRECTION>
<RADIO_ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
(RADIO)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You keep requesting it. We keep playing it-- "Oh, my unforgettable Summer Love."
	</DIALOGUE>
</RADIO_ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
The overpoweringly overplayed ballad again cuts into the air. Donald sadly warbles along with it--then angrily stomps up and begins changing channels. But every channel is playing some part of the song. He bangs off the radio. But the song can still be faintly heard from his cabin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DONALD'S CABIN--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donald bashes into his room. A nightstand radio has been left on-- the ballad wails to a crescendo. Donald batters the radio and rends open the desk drawer full of unopened condom boxes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donald dunks the drawer contents onto his bed. He then whips open his closet, revealing yet another awesome array of condomage--pristine boxes lined up like an encyclopedia set.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OUTSIDE THE BOYS CABINS--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donald flaps out a bedspreadful of prophylactics to the ground and wrenches up the microphone.
</DIRECTION>
<DONALD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, stop pretending to be asleep and get out here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONALD>
<DIRECTION>
Donald meticulously removes a single condom and glides to a water pump. He fills the rubber with water as the Male Campers plow from the cabins and the females cascade down the stairs.

EXT. BY THE ROCK BY THE CREEK--NIGHT

The lit tip of Wendy's cigarette is the only thing visible.

<DIRECTION>
Wendy flicks the cigarette through the air where it ignites a kerosene drenched mountain of branches. Wichita violently recoils at the chilling bonfire.

	</DIALOGUE>
</WICHITA>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it is. What conversation could be more important--eight white guys sitting around a conference table arguing about tax hikes and budget cuts? We are two people who gave each other their hearts. Two people who knew they were not alike, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(clapping hands)
</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<WICHITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want from me? You want the good stuff. You want to know that my father, in the three years before he died, only had custody of me for the summer and he sent me to camp. You want to hear that I thought that was the only decent thing he ever did. Here's another good one: I was misdiagnosed as schizophrenic at 14 and given a bunch of poison that almost killed me. Keep going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WICHITA>
<WENDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Wichita...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<WICHITA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't "Oh Wichita" me. I refused to be defined by such bullshit trivia. I take that back, I'm defined by that shit and all sorts of other shit that you can't rip out of me. I don't want to be cured! That's what makes me a good camp counselor, because I protect who I am and I pass that on. I make the kids question things; I teach them how to get through life, decode it, attack it...

<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIN BATHROOM--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The viewer tracks across a line of sinks where adrenaline- geysering campers expertly fill condoms and water balloons. At the end of the line, Donald confers with expert Troublemaker Billy.
</DIRECTION>
<TROUBLEMAKER_BILLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Always aim for the face. When it comes to water balloons, a body hit is pointless.

LATER OUTSIDE THE BOYS CABINS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donald marches before a perfectly positioned military regiment of campers. Very Kurosawa. Rubbing sleep from her eyes, Talia floats in from the back, dazed at the epic sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DONALD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All the magazine polls say that the trait most looked for in a lover is a "sense of humor"! Now that's funny! I'm the most hilarious fucking guy in the world and I have never touched a human breast! But I digress, let's do this attack for all of us who have ever been told "Wait here, while the rest of us have all the fun." For all of us who have been told "You're too young and uncool to understand." Let's do this attack because it's not like we have anything better to do tonight. Are you with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONALD>
<DIRECTION>
Raising a water weapon into the air, the campers erupt into a terrifying roar. Led by Id-unleashing Donald, the soldiers besiege the forest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Talia holds in a laugh and then is handed a condom weapon by Hayley. With a cheerful shrug, she follows.

<OBERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was I thinking, taking all this time off, playing God? Nobody tells you how to be an adult. But you just keep getting older anyway. That girl almost died! We needed an authority figure on that beach today! Is it too much to ask for a little order! Is it too much to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBERON>
<DIRECTION>
A swooshing rainbow constellation of condoms and water balloons rocket up into a raging Oberon, crashing him to his knees. Oberon looks down to the unleashed little beasts of Camp Bleeding Squaw scrambling on the ground below. Oberon completely clicks to his past persona.
</DIRECTION>
<OBERON>

	You children should be in bed! That's it, I'm subtracting major points!

EXT. THE NON-SEXUAL COUPLE'S PATCH OF THE FOREST--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camper army makes a swift ninja sweep through the romantically carved-up forest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Stoner Lug and the African-American SuperCounselor break from each other and drop their smiles. Lined across like an execution squad, the campers fire away with their water packed weapons. The counselors slam back against their initialed tree.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. ADAM AND PIXEL'S PATCH IN THE WOODS--NIGHT

Adam's hands launch up to Pixel's neck and begin squeezing.

	You meant something to me! I'm almost sure of it. Damn you!

Adam tries to tighten his stranglehold...but he is suddenly obliterated by a fleet of swooshing water balloon/condoms. Pixel's laughter is cut off as she too is bombarded by the camper commandos.

Billy makes a particularly severe throw. Adam grabs his eyes in pain.

The demon campers bound up over a ridge. Suddenly, they halt, silencing their deafening battle cry. Before them, Jasper and the Cook are necking on a blanket in the woods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone blinks, then instantly goes back into terrorist- mode, projecting their water balloonage down upon the gay lovers with equal-opportunity malicious glee.

Side by side, Caleb and Dorothy the Crush-girl, drop their unthrown balloons with a tragic thud. The savages retreat past them, wailing in delight.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. BY THE ROCK BY THE CREEK--NIGHT

Wendy's fingers spider around the noxious thermos. She takes it out from the crevice and unscrews the lid. She then pours herself some hemlock.

	Have you ever thought of instead of making children more equipped for reality, we should make reality more equipped for children?

To the sound of lyrical banjo strumming, the drenched and discombobulated counselors emerge from the forest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ADAM'S CABIN--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam slicks back his wet hair, making it look as short as it originally was. He fo-fums past his sleeping campers to focus upon the Teaser from the dance floor, snoozing while still wearing his familiar red cap. Adam unzips his pants. A streaming sound is heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE PORCH OF DONALD'S CABIN--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A very content Donald is revealed to be playing the banjo upon his porch. Banging water from his ear, Wichita pauses before the porch.

	</DIALOGUE>
</WICHITA>
<DIRECTION>
Donald stops playing the banjo.
</DIRECTION>
<DONALD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not the competition. I'm just...me. A person shouldn't be allowed to have a crush on someone they don't have a chance with. A buzzer should go off, like when your seat belt is not on.

	I'm gonna miss you, Donald Dark.

</WICHITA>
<DONALD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wichita...How could you hurt her-- how could you hurt yourself. I had one slow dance with Wendy and for me, that made for a great summer. You did everything with her--and you're still not satisfied. I don't understand. I guess I never want to be that cool-- I mean, Wendy is a dream come true.

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, Daffy. A dream. I have a lot of them...Lot of dreams...

A little unconvinced of himself, Wichita smokes off. Donald raises back up his banjo and starts playing again. Faster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OBERON'S OFFICE--NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To the sound of this more malevolent music, a waterlogged Oberon bangs into the disarray of his office. Trembling, Oberon heaves up the crashed bookshelf from the ground and carefully places in it a lone, discarded camp workbooklet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oberon catches his reflection in a mirror. He touches his beard. Oberon then opens the mirror, revealing a shiny pair of scissors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE NEXT MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mirror closes on the scissors. Oberon smoothes his now completely shaven face. With a familiarly severe expression, the director sweeps across his now completely clean and sterile office and tugs on his head-set.
</DIRECTION>
<OBERON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Camp is over. Rise. Shine. Now. You can pick up all your "missing" crap in the mess hall. Move it.

INT. THE ADAM'S CABIN--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Red Capped Teaser awakens and adjusts his trademark head- piece. He smells something. Feels something. Screaming as if it were a severed horse's head, he whips off his sheet, revealing a vivid urine stain. The campers laugh away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bedwetter Ted smiles toward Adam, but Adam moodily shuts his duffel and pounds out the door.
</DIRECTION>

INT. WENDY AND PIXEL'S PART OF THE CABIN--DAY

Wendy and Pixel are engaged in a deep, open-mouthed kiss. Wendy's face contorts away into a snicker.

The flustered Wendy stomps her cigarette. She proceeds to pluck and pack her family pictures from the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<PIXEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One day they'll find a cure for AIDS. They'll never find one for sex. It's kind of funny, most movies and stories with a bunch of camp counselors has some serial psycho in the woods with a chainsaw who systematically butchers everybody one by one.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. WOODS LEADING INTO THE CENTER OF THE CAMP--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burning across the forest, mumbling to himself, Wichita pulls out the ripped-off image of his Young Self and DEVOURS IT IN HIS MOUTH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The deadened counselor emerges into the madness at the center of camp which can't help but resemble the madness of Day 1. Wichita drifts forth taking in the scattered sights of baggage-grappling campers and counselors trading goodbye hugs before humming buses. Eric scampers before Wichita.

Eric breaks from Wichita's guilty grip and bustles to his pals. Jolting them all, Oberon kicks Stanley's overflowing duffel bag.

	For what it's worth, Wendy, I find you more interesting when you're unhappy.

	Aren't we all...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WENDY>
<DIRECTION>
The young women walk off together past the Kid with the Cheesy-Computer-Picture-of-Himself on a T-shirt, clinging to a bus door. Once again, his bawling face is a comic mismatch with the beaming photo. Day One problem was getting him off the bus. Day 40 problem is getting him on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INSIDE THE FIRST BUS--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the front row of the bus, the African-American SuperCounselor and the big Stoner Lug are asleep in each other's arms. Behind them, atypically-not-crying-or-kissing, Amber, the Lovelorn Girl, sits beside a weeping Cute Boy.
</DIRECTION>
<WEEPING_CUTE_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I loved you so much...

<DIRECTION>
Across from that pair, Jasper makes eye-contact, through the window, with a sour Caleb. Caleb gives him the finger, mouthing the word "Fag." Jasper sadly grits his teeth. Dorothy, the Crush Girl sits herself next to Jasper and silently, tenderly, puts her head on his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE BUS ONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pixel is craftily unPixelating a line of girls--scissoring off the mini-braid from each girl's hair (a pile forms in the dirt) and rubbing-alcohol-cotton swabbing off each girl's tattoo. She sees Adam moodily staring upon her from the bus. She gives him a pinkie wave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE BACK OF THE BUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam turns away from the glass and strenuously pushes his hair back. The Endlessly Muttering Girl seats herself down next to him to haywire his thoughts.
</DIRECTION>

Adam glares to the girl and then bolts up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE BUS ONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In one sweeping gesture, Adam twists out and yanks the Computer Image T-shirt Boy inside. The doors close instantaneously behind and the bus roars away. Wendy runs up beside it, but can't catch up. She turns to the other bus with dread as Wichita can be seen clambering inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INSIDE BUS 2--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Bombshellettes giggle together in one of the front seats. Behind them, Hayley and Vanessa sit side-by-side in complete silence. Words are not necessary to show how wide the chasm between them has become.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them a couple rows, Eric hands the ex-Golden Boy a Pink Snowball.
</DIRECTION>
<RYAN_EX_GOLDEN_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks Eric. I'll get you back, I swear.
	</DIALOGUE>

Behind them, in opposing rows, Donald and Talia hold up checks.
</DIRECTION>
<TALIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was fun last night, Donald.

	Another day. Another dollar. Literally. I think I'll cash this and buy myself a...pizza.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, we didn't do this for the money, we did it for...help me out...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONALD>
<DIRECTION>
All eyes turn to a head-down Wendy thudding up the bus steps and clumping down the aisle. The viewer can quickly discern that the only open seat is next to a lone, brooding Wichita, but Wendy is in denial. She shuffles all the way to the back of the bus before retreating forward.
</DIRECTION>
<OBERON_NARRATION>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As long as it continues to feel good, the young are not going to stop taking drugs, getting drunk, having sex, and watching crap media. Even a parody of a grown-up like me knows they're will never be a return to old-fashioned values--But that doesn't mean we won't get some new fashioned ones. Coming of age in the 21st century is less about the loss of innocence, then the finding of it. Wendy, Wichita, Talia, Adam, Jasper, Pixel, and Donald Dark were reborn this summer. And it hurt. And that's good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBERON_NARRATION>
<DIRECTION>
As if the seat were covered with needles, Wendy descends next to Wichita. The bus immediately begins to lumber forward. The ex-lovers stare straight ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK AT THE CAMP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oberon watches the buses rumble away. He clicks off his stopwatch.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	"You'll learn the true meaning of responsibility, while creating memories that last a lifetime." The workbooklet is not bullshitting. It's just pretty fucking sketchy on the details.

<DIRECTION>
INT. BACK ON THE BUS--DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Turning to the zombie tableau of Wichita and Wendy, would- be cheerer-upper Donald wobbles up with his camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DONALD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no, I'm sorry, I refuse to go out with this doom-and-gloom. I'm getting a picture from you complex individuals. Hold on, let's get a kid in here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONALD>
<DIRECTION>
Not really taking his eyes away from the camera, Donald latches a child's arm in the aisle. With a shudder of fear, Donald realizes he has grabbed Don't-Touch-Me Todd. Donald cringes for a scream, but Todd calmly curls into a seated position between the caught off-guard Wendy and Wichita.
</DIRECTION>
<DONALD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now stop pretending you didn't have any good times...Shooting stars. Frogs down pants. Surely, at some point, one of us watched a baby deer being born. Come on...Smi-ile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DONALD>
<DIRECTION>
The members of the trio drift their heads forward. Look ahead. Look down. Look around.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, I know, our tale is supposed to have a happy ending. Okay, this may not be happy, but look on the bright side, it's not an ending either. Life is a lot like death, it happens to everyone whether they like it or not. It's going to be beautiful-ugly, exciting-boring, endless-abrupt-- So go ahead, smile. God bless my counselors and campers, in a small but significant forest- in-the-middle-of-Oregon way, they tried to destroy the cliches of growing up and come up with some better ones. Let's not get uptight over their ultimate failure...I mean, there's always next summer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OBERON>
<DIRECTION>
Wichita, Wendy, and Don't Touch-Me-Todd all momentarily creak their heads up and form a valiant, bittersweet smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Donald snaps. The image freezes into a photograph.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CENTER OF CAMP--A DAY NEXT SUMMER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instantly multiplied, the photograph is now the cover picture of the new Camp Workbooklet. NEXT YEAR'S SET OF COUNSELORS, in their uniforms, are seated atop the center-of-camp rocks, pretending to read the silly tome. Oberon's loudspeaker voice crackles in the air, pretty much ignored.

	</DIALOGUE>
</OBERON>
<DIRECTION>
The counselors' tension-breaking laughter melts back into tension as a convoy of Buses rumble to a stop nearby. All the counselors charge up, except for a LOVELY FEMALE REDHEAD COUNSELOR and a HANDSOME, AFRICAN-AMERICAN MALE COUNSELOR.
</DIRECTION>
<LOVELY_FEMALE_REDHEAD_COUNSELOR>

The novice counselors turn to make instantly smitten eye- contact. The Lovely Female Counselor enchantingly shrugs her shoulders.

<DIRECTION>
The counselors both suddenly turn, along with the viewer, to the sight of the bus doors opening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FILM GOES TO BLACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And after a beat of silence, a bold, full version of "Oh, my Unforgettable Summer Love" completely takes over.
</DIRECTION>
