	The assignment was to take the hill. There were four of us. Five if you counted Vincente but he had lost his hand when a grenade went off and he couldn't fight as he could when I first met him and he was young and brave and the hill was soggy from days of rain and sloped down toward a road and there were many German soldiers on the road and the idea was to aim at the first group and if our aim was true we could delay them.

	I believe that love that's true and real creates a respite from death. All cowardice comes from not loving or not loving well which is the same thing and when the man who is brave and true looks death squarely in the face like some rhino hunters I know or Belmonte who is truly brave, it is because they love with sufficient passion to push death out of their minds till it returns as it does to all men and then you must make really good love again. Think about it.

He goes to Inez's jewelry box and picks out art nouveau earrings he knows Adriana would like. He grabs a box and gift wraps it quickly. Maybe it comes in a blue velvet box and he finds some colored paper. Gil writes card: To Adriana with love. He crosses it out - To Adriana avec amour. He gives a final check to himself and opens door to leave, running smack into Inez and both her parents, home from their trip prematurely.

<ADRIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm from the twenties and I'm tellin you the golden age is the Belle Epoque.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes but don't you see - to these guys the golden age was the Renaissance. They'd all trade the Belle Epoque to paint alongside Michelangelo or Titian. And those guys probably imagine life was better when Kubla Khan was around. I'm having an insight. A minor one but that accounts for the anxiety of my dream.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ADRIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What dream?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last night I dreamed I ran out of zithromax - and then I went to the dentist and there was no novacaine - these people have no antibiotics -
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIL>
<ADRIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And even in the twenties - no dishwashers - no 911 if your appendix bursts - no "movies on demand" Â·
	</DIALOGUE>
<ADRIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But if we love each other what does it matter when we live?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because if you stay here and this becomes your present, sooner or later you'll imagine another time was really the golden time. And so will I - I'm beginning to see why it can't work, Adriana. The present has a hold on you because it's your present and while there's never any progress in the most important things, you get to appreciate - what little progress is made - the internet - Pepto- Bismol. The present is always going to seem unsatisfying because life itself is unsatisfying - that's why Gauguin goes back and forth between Paris and Tahiti, searching - it's my job as a writer to try and come up with reasons why despite life being tragic and unsatisfying, it's still worth it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ADRIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the problem with writers - you're all so full of words - but I'm more emotional. I'm going to stay and live in Paris' most glorious time. You made a choice to leave Paris once and you regretted it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, that one I regretted but it was a real choice and I made the wrong one. This is a choice between accepting reality or surreal insanity.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADRIANA>
<ADRIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So finally you do love Inez more than me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<GIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No - I love you - but this way lies madness - and if I'm ever going to write anything worthwhile I've got to get rid of my illusions and that I'd be happier in the past is one of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<ADRIANA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, Gil.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Goodbye Adriana. Good luck.
