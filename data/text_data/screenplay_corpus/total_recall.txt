Quaid walks from the precipice down a gradual slope. The ground gives way underneath him. He falls. His visor hits a rock. A small crack spreads, and the visor blows out.

Quaid starts to decompress. HHHHNh! His breath is drawn out. His face puffs up. Veins stand out in his skin. His eyes bulge. His tongue protrudes. His nose and eyelids bleed.

Dressed for heavy construction work, Quaid makes the POWER SHAKE to end all power shakes. He grinds up fruits, vegetables, buts, wheat germ, leftovers, several kinds of powder.

ERNIE, a hyperactive young technician, lowers over Quaid's head a burnished metal bowl at the end of an elbow arm. He has the air of an acid-head who's still out there.

Quaid shuts the door. He looks at himself in the mirror. He twists the faucet and washes the blood off his hands. Quaid splashes water on his face, takes a deep breath, dries off, then opens the bathroom door. Tracer bullets RIP into the dark bathroom, smashing the mirror, walls, and fixtures.

Quaid hides behind the BAR, and peeks over the edge.. Bullets shatter bottles and glasses all around him. He creeps around the bar and jumps toward the far wall. His assailant fires and looks for him with a flashlight. Quaid lands behind the dining table and goes for the chair next to the display shelves. As his assailant fires again, Quaid throws a chair and runs after it to attack the assailant. Their fighting silhouettes are visible against the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gun SKITTERS across the floor. We hear a few meaty THUDS, then a painful GRUNT as someone's breath WHOOSHES out.

A LIGHT comes on, and Quaid is standing there with one hand on the lamp switch and the other arm circling Lori's neck in a chokehold!

Lori elbows him in the ribs, hits him in the balls, then punches him in the face. She then continues her assault on his pushing himbackwards along the kitchen counter.

<DIRECTION>
Quaid merely defends himself, unwilling to strike his wife. Under this handicap, he absorbs savage blows that would kill a lesser man.

As Lori winds up for the coup de grace, he throws her over the counter. She flies all the way to the kitchen, where she lies, dazed.

</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Quaid furiously wrenches Johnny (an armless torso) from his console, drags him into the back seat and takes off in the Johnnycab just as Richter and Helm run up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richter and Helm fire. A window shatters in the Johnnycab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quaid leans over the driver's seat and awkwardly turns the steering joystick. The cab starts spinning. As Richter and Helm keep shooting, the windows blow out in sequence.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY_S_HEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please fasten your seat belt.

</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>

Quaid runs away from the explosion and up some stairs, entering the factory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CEMENT FACTORY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quaid enters into the MACHINE ROOM, a huge space filled with rusted equipment. Rats scurry out of his way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quaid sets the satchel on an assembly line apparatus and removes the contents: Packets of MARTIAN MONEY. Quaid whistles to himself as he flips through the RED BANK NOTES. A few false IDENTITY CARDS with photos we can't clearly see. A SPACE SHUTTLE TICKET TO MARS, FIRST CLASS. A weird SURGICAL INSTRUMENT sealed in clear plastic. A WRIST WATCH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Quaid examines the watch, he is startled by a fearsome INTRUDER who stares at him from the shadows about thirty feet away. Quaid draws his gun and FIRES. The Man simultaneously SHOOTS at Quaid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Who's going to drop? Neither.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guns extended, they have each other in check. Quaid takes a step forward. The Intruder also steps into the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quaid can now see the Intruder. It's himself! Or rather, a mirror image HOLOGRAM of extremely high fidelity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks toward the hologram, which matches him step for step. Like the Marx Brothers routine, Quaid makes a sudden movement. The hologram isn't fooled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quaid presses a button. BZZZT. The hologram disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches into the satchel and removes a miniature VIDEODISC PLAYER/TV SET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quaid turns it on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE TV SCREEN Quaid himself appears in close-up and addresses the camera.

	Take this thing out of the case and stick it up your nose. Don't worry; it's self guiding. Just shove real hard...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUSER>
<DIRECTION>
Quaid throws the remainder of his Mars bar to the rats and takes out "the thingy in the plastic bag". He tears it open and removes a surgical instrument that looks like the metallic tentacle of an alien.

	<DIALOGUE>
	And be careful. It's my head, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAUSER>
<DIRECTION>
The recorded message freeze-frames. Quaid warily sits down and continues with the procedure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the instrument winds through his sinuses, Quaid's face bulges and distorts. The pain grows more and more intense until CRUNCH! The instrument breaks through cartilage and stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quaid pulls the large device from his nose. The homing device glistens like an aluminum pea in a tiny claw at the end of the tentacle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quaid takes the bloody pea, rolls it between his thumb and forefinger, then shoves it into a Mars bar.
</DIRECTION>

	Now this is the plan. Get your ass to Mars. Then go the Hilton and flash the Brubaker I.D. at the desk. That's all there is to it. Just do what I tell you, and we can nail that sonovabitch who fucked you and me and millions of other poor bastards here on Mars.

The TV automatically turns off. Quaid is left in the silent darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hears Richter and his men nearby, sees a beam from their flashlights and springs to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quaid races back to his things, throws them into the case, smashes the videoplayer with his case and runs. He stops, and returns to put the bug in a piece of candy.
</DIRECTION>

The Immigration Hall is filled with passengers arriving from Earth, queued up in three long lines. SOLDIERS on a high state of alert stand guard with AUTOMATIC RIFLES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
QUAID'S SATCHEL sits on the floor behind a white line. A hand reaches down, picks it up, and carries it forward. FROM THE BACK, we see that the person carrying the satchel is a tall FAT LADY in a loose-fitting dress. She steps up to the Immigration Officer at his desk.

They get closer and closer to the Fat Lady...and pass right behind her without noticing anything in the least suspicious.

The near-vacuum outside creates an INSTANT TYPHOON in the station. WHRRRRRR! Loose objects are sucked out through the broken window. Richter, Helm, Everett and all the soldiers hold on for dear life.

Quaid pulls himself along a stair railing toward a doorway.

ALARMS sound and METAL BARRIERS slide down over windows and doorways, sealing off the depressurized area: SQQRRCHANG! SQQQRRCHANG! SQQQRRCHANG!

It's empty....except in the back, there's a piece of red paper folded in eighths. Quaid grabs the paper and hurriedly unfolds it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON: RED PAPER. It's an advertising FLIER for a bar, THE LAST RESORT in VENUSVILLE, featuring a drawing of a naked woman.

All of a sudden, Quaid flings opens the door and takes hair-trigger aim at...Dr. Edgemar from the Rekall commercial!!! He's dresses in the same tweed jacket. Quaid keeps the gun on Edgemar and glances up and down the hall.

<QUAID>

	How much is Cohaagen paying you for this?

</QUAID>
<EDGEMAR>

#2 comes in with a right leg kick at Quaid's left shoulder/head. Quaid grabs the leg and throws him. Instantly, #3 is rising up behind Quaid and hits him on the back of the head with his gun. Quaid collapses and tries to crawl away towards the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
#1 grabs Quaid by the collar and shirt. #4 grabs his left leg, and they try and restrain him.

Quaid thrashes about in his chair. The screws holding the chair together start to loosen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In adrenaline overdrive, Quaid rips the right armrest from the chair. It hangs from his forearm like an unwieldy splint. (One of five handicaps is gone.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Doctor rushes over. Quaid swings the armrest and drives a long exposed bolt through the Doctor's throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Assistant 1 grabs Quaid's forearm. Quaid curls him into a one-armed hug and snaps his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quaid lifts the helmet from his head. (Two of five handicaps are gone.) Assistant 2, behind him, grabs his wrist. Quaid grips #2's hair and pulls him forward, over his shoulder. #2's head lands between Quaid's knees. Quaid cracks his skull like a walnut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quaid reaches over and releases the bracket over his left wrist. (Three handicaps down; two remain) But Assistants 3-5 converge on him, holding down his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quaid sees that Melina is still fighting her brainwashing.
</DIRECTION>
<QUAID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on!

</QUAID>
<DIRECTION>
Assistant 6 charges with a long metal pole. Quaid pulls #5 in front of him, like a shield. #5 is skewered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quaid flings #5 aside, reaches down, unshackles one ankle, and immediately kicks #3 in the balls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quaid stands up with only one leg still shackled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
#6 and #4 bait Quaid like a bear, using the pole and a fireax. Quaid grabs the bole from #6 and uses it to block the ax. He then bends to unfasten the last ankle bracket. The fireax comes arching down at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quaid leaps clear just as the fireax lodges in the chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now free and unhandicapped, Quaid faces #6. He sidesteps a thrust, grabs the pole, and thrusts it into #6's head. It goes in one temple and out the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Immediately, Quaid pulls off Melina's helmet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Number 4 (the ax man) activates an ALARM and makes a run for the door. Quaid swings the pole, tripping 4 so that he lands directly on his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As ALARMS SCREAM, Quaid runs to Melina and begins releasing her from her many shackles.

INT. CORRIDOR - LAB TO ELEVATOR - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
ALARMS blare. Quaid and Melina run through the hallway for the elevators. Quaid goes to the right, Melina to the left. Quaid throws the axe to Melina. The elevator doors open, two soldiers are inside and start to exit. Quaid hits the first soldier on the right, knocking him down and out. Melina axes the second soldier on the left in the stomach and he goes down. Then run into the elevator after taking the guns from the dead soldiers. As the doors close they are each taking a flashlight off the back wall of the elevator.

Quaid attacks the mole with the drill. Quaid's arms and shoulders are lacerated on both sides by the drills. In a final daring thrust, Quaid drives the drillhammer into a cable. SPLURG! Black hydraulic fluid gushes all over Quaid, and the central drill grinds to a halt. GRGGRRGRR -- the tip of the central drill chews into the stone wall. Melina is trapped in a tiny recess to the right. Quaid is penned into a slightly larger cul-de-sac to the left.

Quaid moves through the hole and continues down a tunnel which quickly widens, affording a panoramic view of a great wonder: The alien reactor glimpsed in Quaid's mind probe!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hundreds of geometric columns hand suspended in a graceful draping pattern, like metal stalactites in a vast mechanical cavern built by giants. The titanic construction is organized into four groupings which radiate from a central core.

Quaid and Melina meet up. Melina throws the hologram watch back to him. Quaid takes the hologram watch and runs up the middle of a row of columns. Richter runs across in front of him and fires and misses. Two soldiers pop out behind him and Melina kills them. Quaid continues after Richter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REACTOR CORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richter sprints onto an open FREIGHT ELEVATOR at the far end of the area. The elevator starts to rise. Quaid jumps onto the elevator and drags Richter to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Melina runs over too late and watches the elevator ascend at incredible speed with Quaid hanging below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richter and Quaid wrestle savagely on the floor, trying to force each other over the side. Richter lodges his foot in a hole in the floor and shoves Quaid's head over the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quaid looks up. YAAA! The elevator is approaching a hole Cohaagen cut in the metal shell which encloses the bunch of columns. The hole is exactly big enough for the elevator to pass through. Anything extended beyond the boundaries of the elevator--like Quaid's head--will be sliced off!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quaid summons all his strength and throws Richter and himself back into the elevator without a nanosecond to spare. As the elevator passes through the hole cut in the metal, a sharp edge guillotines Richter's rifle in half. Nasty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator emerges in a narrow space between two concentric curved walls. The adversaries exchange blows. Richter knocks Quaid down, then rushes at him. Quaid flips Richter over the side!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Richter grabs Quaid's wrists and drags Quaid with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quaid's foot catches a crater in the floor and halts their mutual slide to death. He hangs over the side, bend at the waist, supporting Richter who dangles from his wrists.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quaid struggles to pull himself back inside, but Richter bounces up and down, pulling Quaid further out.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quaid's searching foot finds a hole. He pulls back...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The metal edges sweep by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AGAAGHGGHGGHAA! A cry of pain.
