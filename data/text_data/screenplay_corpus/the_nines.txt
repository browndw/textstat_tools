:SC: THE NINES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
READER NOTE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One thing that will be obvious to viewers, but not to readers, is that the nine principal parts in this film are played by only three actors:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1) Gary, Gavin, Gabriel
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
2) Sarah, Susan, Sierra
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
3) Margaret, Melissa, Mary
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It'll make more sense in context. Promise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN'S HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
unwinds a short length of green string. We're extremely close, with a shallow, blurry focus. It's like the first moments after a dream -- just fragments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scissors cut the string. The man wraps it around his left wrist. A loop. A bracelet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the man's teeth, the edge of his chin as he pulls the knot tight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His fingers pull against the string. Solid. It won't break easily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PITCH BLACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's no music. No sound at all, really, except for some distant birds CHIRPING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then a SQUEAK. A SQUEAL as rusty springs engage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GARAGE DOOR LIFTS,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
revealing GARY BANKS in silhouette. He's 30, effortlessly fit, with movie-star good looks. (Although for now, he's merely a TV star.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like most Laurel Canyon garages, this one has never held a car. Instead, it's the resting place for all the detritus of bachelordom: shitty Ikea furniture, a drum set, a styrofoam snowman, and the Harley he always meant to get running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary spots what he was looking for.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BACK PATIO / LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - MAGIC HOUR (DAWN)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary drags a beaten Weber kettle. One of its wheels is broken, SCRAPING against the deck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER, we see Gary's house has an incredible view of the city. He couldn't fucking care less.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He yanks the circular grill out of the Weber and throws it down the canyon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He empties a garbage bag into the barbecue: mostly women's clothes, but also some stuffed animals and photos still in their frames. There's too much to fit, so he tries stomping it down with a flip-flopped foot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He cracks open a container of lighter fluid and begins drenching everything inside. He sprays until the container is WHEEZING air. He shakes it, making sure it's really empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he cracks open a new container and keeps spraying. And spraying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow the dripping fluid as it runs across a photo of Gary and a BLONDE WOMAN. Her eyes are scratched out, making her unrecognizable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Under the grill, lighter fluid is dripping in a stream, soaking into the wooden deck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally satisfied, Gary throws the lighter fluid aside. He takes five steps back and pulls a box of matches from his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTREMELY CLOSE as the match SCRAPES, erupting in flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On Gary's left wrist, we see a green string bracelet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC STARTS: a pounding, hypnotic track that will carry us through these MAIN TITLES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In EPIC SLOW-MOTION, we follow the burning match as it sails through the air, tumbling end-over-end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as it's about to reach its target, we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DIGITAL METER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shoots to 100 miles per gallon. It's the display of Gary's Prius. We are...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PRIUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary's at the wheel, driving, as he finishes a fifth of bourbon. JUMP CUTS take us out of Hollywood, heading downtown. Our TRAVELLING MUSIC is serving us well.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary stops at a light. He looks left and sees himself on the side of a bus. It's an ad for CRIME LAB ("This fall, Mondays are killer.") Gary watches himself drive away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Further along, Gary spots two THUGGY TEENAGERS sitting on a low wall. He calls out to them:
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Do you sell crack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
The boys look wary.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>

	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
QUICK CUTS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Money changes hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary holds a small ziplock bag -- and has no idea what to do with its lumpy beige contents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLLYWOOD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary pulls up to a curb. He's now on Sunset Blvd. A matronly black streetwalker (OCTAVIA, 35) approaches the passenger window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary holds up the little bag.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this crack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>

She takes a closer look.

INT. SHITTY MOTEL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary and Octavia jump up and down on the bed, each trying to bounce higher than the other, LAUGHING all the while.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary bounces so high that he THUNKS his head against the ceiling. He crumples, falling off the bed. But he's still laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

LATER, Octavia is sleeping.

INT. MOTEL BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary takes a shower with his jeans on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Toweling off, Gary looks at his body in the mirror. He notices something odd. He tries to wake Octavia up, but she's down for the count.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking around, he finds his cell phone. Dials 911. Pacing, he tries to sober up while it rings. The far side answers.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, hello. I'm having a medical situation. Yes. Okay. I don't have a belly button.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(explaining carefully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not have a belly button where I should, on my belly. And I'm concerned, because I don't know if that's...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
He sits down on the edge of the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can a person live without a belly button? Because if you think about it, you're born with one. So if you don't have one, you're unborn and it's really hazy whether you're alive or not. I guess I'm wondering: am I alive?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a sudden thought)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or what if I'm God?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>

	No, no. I'm totally sober.

</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't think I need an ambulance. I don't seem to be dying any faster than usual. But I should probably go to the hospital, don't you think? Yeah, I should.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE PRIUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's driving again, but most of his attention is focused on trying to locate his missing navel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up in the rear-view mirror, where he sees two
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERSIONS OF HIMSELF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sitting in the back seat. All three Garys give each other thumbs-up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driver-Gary looks out the driver-side window, where he sees shoes and asphalt. Only now do we ROTATE to reveal we're
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UPSIDE-DOWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary has rolled the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music suddenly STOPS. We hear SIRENS approaching.

Noticing something to her right...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's coming. I'll call you later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
She hangs up, wrapping the earpiece around her phone. We reveal
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GARY

being escorted through glass doors by a polo-shirted PAROLE OFFICER. Margaret moves to intercept them, offering a hand.

<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are there reporters out front?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A few. Not Hugh Grant level. More like Robert Downey, Jr. when he broke into that family's house and slept in the kid's bed like Goldilocks. "This bed is just right." I handled episodes two through four for Robert. This sort of thing is my specialty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>

	What is?

A designer kitchen in Hancock Park -- spacious and kosher- ready. The phone on the counter is RINGING.

<PAROLE_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Answer it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAROLE_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
Gary picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Yes. Yes.

</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
He looks to Margaret while the other end of the call talks at length. Then, very deliberately...

<GARY>

(CONT'D)

	<DIALOGUE>
	The weather in Toledo is rainy.

The Parole Officer takes the phone from him, punching in a series of numbers and jotting notes on his work sheet.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's computer voice recognition. The system can call you any time day or night. If you don't answer within five rings, the police come and haul your ass off.

</MARGARET>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if I'm not here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>

Catching the officer's concerned look...

INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

Margaret pulls open curtains, flooding the room with light. Gary wanders, checking it all out.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, just so it's said, this house is flammable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't mean to burn down my house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I didn't mean to eat my way into a ten-year shame spiral, but I did, and it's healthier to acknowledge it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(moving on)

	<DIALOGUE>
	This flammable house belongs to one of Lola's other fabulous clients, who is currently shooting a pilot in Toronto.

	Actor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<MARGARET>

Noticing two crates...

<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He has dogs?

</GARY>
<MARGARET>

	They're away at summer camp. Now, try the bed.

He lies back on it, feeling it out.

She massages his besocked feet.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't do heroin.

	Yeah, crack is classy. And I'm not buying you porn. There's spray-per- view on cable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. I really wasn't concerned about my career, my family or my future. I just wanted to jack off.

Margaret is a little impressed by this show of backbone.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me see your phone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
He hands over his cell phone. She drops it in the contraband box.

<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon! All my numbers are in that.

</GARY>
<MARGARET>

INT. HOUSE / VARIOUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary paces around his new home, trying to get a feel for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He plays a few NOTES on the piano.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up at the painting over the staircase: a cliff near the ocean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens random drawers in a Chinese herb cabinet, wondering if there's anything hidden in one of the 46 slots. There isn't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a long beat to consider three paintings in the dining room, which show the same thing in three different ways.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BACKYARD - SUMMER NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary swims laps, trying to exhaust himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands in the shallow end, listening to the quiet.

INT. KITCHEN - SUMMER NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wearing a fluffy white robe, he looks through the delivery menus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FOYER / FRONT DOOR - SUMMER NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a bag of food from a college-age DELIVERY GUY, who seems to recognize him. Gary pays him, shuts the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he's walking to the kitchen with the food, Gary looks back and sees the Delivery Guy watching him from the front walk. The guy is a little embarrassed, but Gary is pretty used to being stared at.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - SUMMER NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary unwraps the Thai food. Makes himself a plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He watches CRIME LAB on the plasma screen while eating dinner.

INT. LIBRARY / TV ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary scans the shelves, looking for something to read. There are five times more books here than Gary has opened in his lifetime.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He settles on a paperback of Voltaire's Candide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lies back on the couch, reading it.

He flips a few pages ahead to see if it gets more interesting. A beat.

GARY JACKING OFF

<DIRECTION>
to soft-core pay-per-view. We're CLOSE ON Gary's straining face, but we can hear the pleasured MOANS of the actresses as they go down on each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nearing climax, he looks for something to come on. He can't find anything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FOYER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His left hand cupped to hold the semen, he pads barefoot from the TV room to the downstairs bathroom. We hear WATER RUNNING as he washes his hands. Then it shuts off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a THUNK. Something hard was dropped on the wood floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary hears it too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He steps out of the bathroom, looks around. He takes a few silent paces back in our direction, stopping just before he reaches the two-story section of the foyer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
That's when he hears it: CLICK-CLICK-CLICK-CLICK on the wooden floor. A JINGLE of metal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow Gary's eyes up to the second-floor walkway. We can hear the little FOOTSTEPS, toe nails CLICKING. Faint PANTING. But there's no dog.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK ON Gary, increasingly unsettled. He's directly below the walkway, and can't see up into it.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is somebody there? Hello?

</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
He CLAPS his hands twice. Listens.

Nothing.

He's about to venture a step forward when suddenly

He nearly jumps out of his skin. It RINGS two more times before he ducks into the TV room to answer it.

Gary is lying in the sun, eyes shut. Suddenly, a golf ball hits him on the head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits up, perplexed. For a long moment, he has no idea where the ball came from, until he hears a voice from beyond the wall that separates the properties.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry! Really sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(A practiced ear notices a Canadian accent.)

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Sorry. Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
He follows the voice to a gap in the hedges at the far corner of the yard, finding SARAH GLEASON. Late 30's, fresh- scrubbed and girlish, she looks more fragile than she really is.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm working on my putting, if you can believe it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
Indeed, she's holding a putter.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not really.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Maybe I was just looking for a way to meet my infamous neighbor. You see, I'm under house arrest, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you do?

</GARY>
<SARAH>

Gary neatens up, tossing out newspapers and delivery boxes. He plumps pillows.

He looks up at the clock: 2:30.

He sits, trying to read Candide again. He fidgets.

INT. UPSTAIRS WALKWAY - DAY

Gary carefully sets rat traps, staggering them every few feet.

He pokes one with a pencil. The metal arm SNAPS back, breaking the pencil in two.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FOYER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary notices that the piano has an electronic device attached to it. He turns it on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens the piano bench, finding computer disks. A red disk is labelled "Knowing." He puts it in. Hits play.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The piano begins playing by itself, a sensuous but melancholy CLASSICAL PIECE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary lies on the floor, listening to it. He stares up at the elaborate chandelier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary is sitting on a bench by the front walk, trying to read more of his book. He looks over to see Sarah coming up the steps, carrying the baby monitor and a bottle of chardonnay.

She stops beside him.

Sarah tops off Gary's wine glass. They're both on the couch. The baby monitor is sitting on the table behind them.

<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... so it's kind of hard to prove that I only meant to burn my ex- girlfriend's stuff, and not the entire house.

</GARY>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Fire's tricky that way.

MUSIC begins, providing backing to her monologue.

<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I fell in love with the most wonderful boy in the world. We would take long walks by the river or just sit for hours gazing into each other's eyes. We were so very much in love.

<DIRECTION>
TO CAMERA:
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what you're thinking. If that's the way she feels about it why doesn't she just end it all? I'm in no hurry for that final disappointment. I know just as well as I'm standing here talking to you, when that final moment comes and I'm breathing my last breath, I'll be saying to myself...

Gary washes the wine glasses, being sure to wash off any trace of lipstick. He dries them and puts them back in the cabinet.

Faced with the remainder of the wine, he considers dumping it down the sink. Instead, he chugs it from the bottle.

He wraps the empty bottle in newspaper and tucks it in the recycling.

He does abs on a stability ball. He's spent.

INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Gary enters from the driveway door, gulping from a water bottle. He starts to look through the delivery menus when he notices an orange Post-It note by the telephone. It reads:

Gary backs away from the phone like it might sprout legs and jump on him. Suddenly, he backs into
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOMEONE ELSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He spins around, startled. He only catches a glimpse of THE MAN -- same height, same build, same everything. The Man is gone in half an instant, vanished into thin air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary bolts for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reaching the foyer, Gary steps on a
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAT TRAP,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
which SNAPS down on his toes. He SCREAMS, pulling it off. He looks around to find all eight traps are now on the main floor, rather than the second-floor walkway.

Limping, he hops out the door. We stay behind, looking out through the open door.

EXT. WILSHIRE BLVD. - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEADLIGHTS FLARE as cars travel down Miracle Mile, bringing us to a Metro Bus stop -- a semi-enclosed bench with backlit signage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The far side of the shelter has a one-sheet for Crime Lab. ("This fall, Mondays are murder.") The bench side is a promo poster for a show called Knowing. ("Some fates are chosen for you.")
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's here we find Gary taking a seat, gingerly checking his toes where the rat trap snapped. He's hobbled his way here from the house, which is probably a block away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's only a little blood, but his toes really hurt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over Gary's shoulder, we see a blonde 8-year old girl (Noelle) watching him with concern. She BANGS on the shelter to get his attention. Gary nearly jumps out of his skin.

Left alone, Gary rolls the dice idly. He gets a 4 and a 5. Rolls again. 4,5. 3,6. 4,5. 3,6. 3,6. 3,6. 4,5.

<DIRECTION>
He keeps rolling, the wheels in his head starting to turn.

EXT. FRONT OF HOUSE - DAY

Sarah is looking in through the living room windows, trying to spot Gary. Giving up, she turns back to the main steps, only to find...

MARGARET,

who doesn't look pleased.

EXT. SIDE PATIO - MORNING

Gary opens the newspaper to a page at random. He starts circling things with a red Sharpie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MACRO CLOSE UP. His pen circles the number nine every time it appears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he flips the page, he spots Sarah looking in through the rounded trellis, just a few feet away. She's holding her own newspaper, still in the wrapper.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>

	Hey neighbor.

</SARAH>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>

<SARAH>

</SARAH>

He almost deflects it, but decides to trust her:

<GARY>

	How many times should the number nine come up? Probablistically?

	Probablistically?

</SARAH>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about every time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
He hands her the paper through the bars.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But they only show up when you look for them. Looking for them changes things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
Trying to find an explanation...
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some of these are prices. There's going to be a lot of nines when...

</SARAH>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is something wrong with the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>

Sarah looks up slowly. She smiles for an uncomfortably long beat. She's stalling, thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have an eyelash on your... here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
She steps forward, and motions for him to lean closer to the bars. Brushing off the non-existent eyelash, she WHISPERS:

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY [A FEW MINUTES LATER]
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON a white plastic device mounted in the corner of the room, about ten feet up. It might be a smoke detector.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary stares up at it, intently. He steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A little red light flicks on inside the unit. After a few seconds it turns off. It's some sort of motion detector.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary tests it again, trying to move his arm slowly enough that the light never engages.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margaret enters, carrying two mugs. She watches him warily.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?

<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sort of hard to start there...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try. And don't tell me I'm imagining it. They're showing up everywhere, and I want to know why.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
Trying to formulate the simplest truthful explanation:
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Best guess? They're your subconscious trying to remind you who you are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a Nine?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. It doesn't make a lot of sense of out context.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(offering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coffee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the mug, then reconsiders. Maybe it's laced with something.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you drink coffee? You're always drinking tea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
Frustrated, she takes his coffee back and drinks it. She'd really like to drink the whole thing to prove her point, but it's just too hot.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
She gestures for him to sit down. Reluctantly, he does. She sits across from him.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not going to understand this yet, but we've known each other for like 25 years. One day when I was 12, you called me out of the blue. And we've been talking ever since.

</MARGARET>
<GARY>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. FRONT WALKWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's walking towards the blue chalk perimeter line, headed for Sarah's house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leaves fall lazily from the trees, counter-point to the tension.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margaret calls out from the arched windows.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know what you're doing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
She's almost at tears. He stops at the edge of the chalk line.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happens if I cross this line?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
The tear in her eye falls.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. But it's not good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
He very deliberately steps over the line. We hear a thin BEEPING from the house-arrest anklet. He shoots her a look to say, is that all there is?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the BEEPING grows louder, deeper. It starts to come from all sides, booming, a nuclear-meltdown/self-destruct-sequence- activated DRONE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gary suddenly realizes something very, very terrible is about to happen.
</DIRECTION>
<GARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARY>
<DIRECTION>
The world ignites in white-hot atomic flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the blinding glare erupt behind Margaret, illuminating through her skin, right to the bone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same flash catches a leaf in mid-air, sizzling through it like an etched x-ray.

As the light hits Gary, we...

CUT TO BLACK.

Through a one-way mirror, Gavin and Susan watch as the Moderator asks a group of twelve MALE VIEWERS about the pilot they just watched.

Their comments are mostly positive. Gavin and Susan share relieved looks. She has a notepad, as always.

One AGITATED MAN keeps staring at the mirror, right at Gavin. (We recognize him as the Parole Officer from Part One.)

	And I'm letting them, because I really want the show on the air. I have all these characters inside my head, and they want to live. I'm the only way they can. This is the only way they can.

He reaches a crosswalk. He has to wait for the light. Finally, he looks INTO CAMERA:
</DIRECTION>

We see Gavin and the woman on the corner. There's no camera Gavin could have been talking to. He's understandably perplexed: Where did the documentary crew go?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Was there ever anyone there?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our CAMERA style has changed: instead of handheld and jerky, we're smooth and slow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MUSIC has completely changed, underscoring a sense of creeping dread.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We HOLD for a long beat. The light changes. Still a little unnerved, Octavia begins to cross the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only then do we notice something unusual floating above her head:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SPHERE OF BLUE LIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER, we see that everyone on the street has the same kind of sphere floating a foot above their heads. No one seems to see the lights other than Gavin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gavin looks around in uneasy fascination, as if he's just landed on an alien world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat, then he has an unsettling thought.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slowly looks up. Above his own head, he sees the same sphere of light -- only his is bright white. Pulsing. Blinding.
</DIRECTION>
<GAVIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God.

We PULL BACK, RISING UP to a perspective above and behind Gavin. As we do, the edges of the frame creep in, revealing ICONS and unintelligible STATISTICS, changing moment by moment.

EXT. MEADOW - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a WIDE SHOT, we see a vast field, bordered by green mountains. Unseen BIRDS call out from the trees, while insects CLICK and WHIRR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, we spot swatches of bright colors moving our way. It's a family: father GABRIEL (34), wife MARY (33) and daughter NOELLE (8). They're returning from a short day hike. Mary carries a small videocamera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing that Noelle is already a ways down the path...
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Noelle! Don't get too far ahead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Noelle turns around. Instead of speaking, she moves her hands in sign language. (She's mute, not deaf.)
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You had ice cream at lunch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Noelle begs to differ. More signing.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
(to Mary)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Apparently frozen yogurt doesn't count.

<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll make note.

</MARY>

EXT. SMALL GRAVEL ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The family walks up to their car, a blue Toyota Prius. Gabriel sheds his daypack, trying to open the hatchback. It won't lift.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mary goes to open the passenger door. Locked.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you hit it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shouldn't have to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
He fishes the keys out of his pocket. Presses the remote entry button repeatedly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel tries to open the driver's side door. Locked. Even Noelle knows something's wrong.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel pulls the small mechanical key out of the fob. Unlocks the door and climbs in. Opens the door for Mary and Noelle.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we left the overhead light on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
He taps it. Moves the switch.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Noelle signs her made-up representation of "shit."
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Noelle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel slides the key into the slot. Hits "START." Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Battery is dead. Least the starter is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Noelle leans forward, aware that this is something serious.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do we...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We call the service. That's all we can do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just the little battery that's dead, right? The big one is probably fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't jump it from one battery to the other? Cross-over somehow?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who did you marry? MacGyver?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
He gets out of the car, retrieving his cell phone. Mary follows him out. Noticing that he's not dialing...
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you getting a signal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
She checks her phone. A long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes! One bar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
They're both relieved. Finding the AAA card in his wallet, Gabriel takes the phone and dials.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's at this moment we notice the familiar green string bracelet around Gabriel's wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the back seat, Noelle KNOCKS on the window. She signs, asking if everything is okay.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're okay. Daddy's calling people to help us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel pulls the phone from his ear. Looks at the screen. Hits redial. Fuck.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The minute you try to place a call, the bar goes away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep trying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I'll keep trying, Mary. But it will keep happening.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what do you want to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
He tries redial.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe if you hold it up higher.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Humoring her, he holds it at arm's length. No good.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The problem is we're boxed in. It's a canyon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where we turned off the main road, it was more open. And higher, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's at least a mile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can run that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So...we stay here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay with that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think we have a choice, so, yeah. Go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Half a beat, while each waits for the other to think of a better plan. Neither does.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel leans down next to Noelle's window.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy's going to get a truck to help us out. You take care of your mom, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Noelle nods.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be right back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel gives Mary a quick peck and starts running down the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We MOVE IN on Noelle, who smiles a little.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GRAVEL ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gravel CRUNCHES under Gabriel's shoes as he runs. He keeps an easy pace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In VARIOUS SHOTS, we get a sense of the distance he's travelling. He passes gulches, meadows and boulder fields.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He finally arrives at the junction of the dirt road and a larger...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PAVED ROAD - DAY [CONTINUOUS]
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulling out Mary's cell phone, Gabriel tries to get a signal. By his reaction, it's still iffy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He dials, but the call drops. Tries again. Just the same.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks left. Looks right. Looks back down the dirt road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He decides to head off to the right, downhill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We catch up to Gabriel as he's walking in the middle of the road, still trying unsuccessfully to get a signal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, he spots a patch of moving color: a female hiker. A moment's hesitation, then he YELLS out to her:
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me! Hi! Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
She stops, turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel jogs to close the distance. As we approach, we reveal SIERRA, 38. In the past 10 years, she's "made a fresh start" 12 times. In this incarnation, she's a wilderness- loving, Bush-hating, wildly-overeducated clerk at Trader Joe's in Venice.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me. Do you have a cell phone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<SIERRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't. There's no service up here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIERRA>
<GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
(re: his phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'm finding that out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<SIERRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can usually get a signal up at the ranger station.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIERRA>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
She points in the opposite direction -- back the way he came.
</DIRECTION>
<SIERRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You follow the road. It's probably... I don't know. You have a car?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIERRA>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's dead. That's why I need...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<SIERRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIERRA>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls a stray hair back from her mouth. Notices him noticing her.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. She takes a subtle step closer to the center of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you headed back to your car now? If you could give me a ride to a gas station, wherever...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't leap to extend an invitation. It takes a beat for Gabriel to figure out why.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Hey. Look, I'm not some crazy Ted Bundy guy. I'm not going to rape you or kill you or anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't seem reassured.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, that's what Ted Bundy would say. Look, I'm a videogame designer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(fishing through wallet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My wife is an editor. My daughter is four.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
He offers her a family photo. She looks at it, but doesn't take it.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're waiting back at the car, and I want to get some help before it gets dark.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<SIERRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can call somebody when I get to town.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIERRA>
<DIRECTION>
Trying to temper his frustration...
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe you. I do. But you don't know where the car is. And the guy might not come. We can't be up here all night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
Sierra backs away.
</DIRECTION>
<SIERRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIERRA>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be sorry. Just help me out here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<SIERRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I can't. I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIERRA>
<DIRECTION>
Once she feels she's reached a good distance, she turns and keeps walking.
</DIRECTION>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why won't you trust me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't turn back, heading down the road.

Mary is sitting in the back seat of the Prius with Noelle, who's getting tired of her coloring book.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Noelle signs something to Mary, who considers the request.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, but you have to be careful, understand? You have to use Big Girl hands.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Noelle nods. Mary hands her the small video camera. Noelle has some trouble folding out the little screen, but eventually gets it open without any help from her mom.
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want to see where we were today?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>

Noelle nods.

Mary takes the camera back for a second, flipping it to playback mode and rewinding. The blocky video footage zips past.

<MARY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, now hit play. This button.
	</DIALOGUE>

Noelle does. On the tiny screen, we see Noelle and her father eating lunch by a waterfall. (Mary is filming.)

	There's you. And there's Daddy. You're a little movie star, huh?

Noelle smiles. Signs something.

He turns, finding her a ways back. She approaches.

<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were you following me?

</GABRIEL>

	So your boyfriend plays videogames?

</SIERRA>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Super-crack?

Mary is pacing -- but trying not to look like she's pacing. She holds the other cell phone (Gabriel's), which she turns on and off, hoping that somehow she'll get a signal.

Each time she turns it on, we hear the CHIMES.

Noelle is still playing with the video camera, watching footage of the hike. She decides to wind back further.

	That's when you have all the powers, and you can't be killed. It's fine when you're designing, but it's really boring to play. A game isn't fun unless there are rules.

</GABRIEL>
<SIERRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you make the rules.

</SIERRA>
<GABRIEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes I do. I mean, you want to give everyone freedom, but they can't handle it. Half your players are teenage boys, and it's like they're programmed to be destructive. They deliberately crash the world servers. They'd ruin everything just to prove they could.

	So where's the orc now?

	He's dead. I spiked his water bottle with a massive quantity of GHB. He hallucinated, went into convulsions and died.

He screws the cap back on the water bottle and hands it back.

Mary sits down in the front passenger seat of the car. Noelle is still in back, watching footage on the video camera.

Noelle doesn't look up.

Without looking up...

<NOELLE>

	He's not coming back.

Mary is stunned. For her part, Noelle seems to have no idea she just spoke her first words.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear three evenly-spaced BEEPS. After the third one, Mary says:
</DIRECTION>
<MARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY>
<DIRECTION>
Mary flinches. It's like someone walked over her grave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Noelle hands her the camera. The footage is cued to earlier in Part 2, where Gavin is having Melissa loop in a wild line:

Mary backs out of the car, as if trying to get away from the video camera. But she's still holding it.

She hits STOP. Tries to collect herself.

Noelle gets out of the car, but doesn't approach. She signs, "Mommy?"

Gabriel and Sierra stop for a moment, so he can pull off his outer shirt. For the first time, we see that Gabriel has a large tattoo on his back which looks like this:

He's sweating a lot.

</SIERRA>
<DIRECTION>
She hands him back the water bottle. He gladly drinks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she takes the bottle back, she steps forward. The motion leaves them face-to-face. She pauses for a moment, just long enough for him to turn away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She kisses him. He doesn't really kiss back -- but he doesn't fight it, either.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She puts a hand on his thigh, sliding up the inside. Only when she reaches his crotch does he pull back.

He manages to steady himself.

	It's not that hard to make a universe. At first, you just checked in every once in a while. See how the Neanderthals were doing. Move some continents around. But then you got more into it.

He kisses her. It's not a big, passionate, movie-ending kiss, but rather a fond kiss farewell. At the end of it, he WHISPERS into her ear:

	<DIALOGUE>
	You're my favorite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GABRIEL>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles.

With two fingers, Gabriel BREAKS the green string bracelet around his left wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And in that moment, a film passes over him, like the boundary between water and air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's stepped out of this dimension.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mary is frozen with the same smile on her face, but we notice that she and the kitchen around her have flattened out to two- dimensional images.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She and everything around her has become like wallpaper, slowly curling away, revealing emptiness beneath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gabriel collapses into a single, spiky sphere of light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light moves through the kitchen, creating waves that ripple through the tissue-thin walls.

Picking up speed, the sphere rushes through the window, heading west.

We dive into the blue ocean beneath us, which becomes only a swirling gray fog with a viscous thickness.

We see three lights in the distance. We join them, moving with them.

Further ahead, more lights, circling. It's a loose spiral made of stars, resembling nothing so much as the number 9.
