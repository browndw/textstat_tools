TITLES BEGIN over the SOUNDS of city traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE UP:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THEATER DISTRICT OF BROADWAY - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sidewalks are filled with theater-goers heading for their shows. Cabs line the streets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIDE ALLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cab quickly turns into the alley, coming to a screeching halt. A Man in a Grey Suit jumps out and rushes to the side entrance of a theater.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the background we see that the title of the play, "Anonymous", is written on the theatre's marquee...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BROADWAY THEATER - BACKSTAGE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow the Man in the Grey Suit as he rushes through narrow backstage hallways, passing several ACTORS dressing in Elizabethan costumes, applying their make- up, etc...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES CONTINUE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BROADWAY THEATER - BACKSTAGE/EMPTY STAGE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The curtains are still closed, and the sound of the audience excitedly MURMURING behind them is heard. .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stagehands are moving stage lights as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A STAGE MANAGER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
takes a nervous peek through the curtains to check the audience-- it's a full house. He holds a prop umbrella in one hand, anxiously checks his watch in the other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks on both wings of the stage-- and then relief floods his face as he sees The Man in the Grey Suit hurrying over to him. The Stage Manager wordlessly hands him the umbrella and signals to a stagehand in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The curtains start to OPEN and the MURMUR of the audience dies down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BROADWAY THEATER - THE STAGE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man with the umbrella stands on the empty stage, a single light on him. He is "PROLOGUE". (We will see the same actor later as the "Prologue" of Henry V).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Prologue" regards his audience for a beat before:
</DIRECTION>
<PROLOGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soul of the Age! The applause, delight, the wonder of our stage! Our Shakespeare, rise...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat, repeating)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our Shakespeare... For he is all of ours, is he not? The most performed playwright of all time! The author of 37 plays, 154 sonnets, and several epic poems that are collectively known as the ultimate expressions of humanity in the English language. And yet... And yet...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not a single manuscript of any kind has ever been found written in Shakespeare's own hand. In four hundred years, not one document-- be it poem, play, diary or even a simple letter.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was born the son of a glove-maker, and at some unknown time, armed with but an elementary school education, he went to London where, the story goes, he became an actor and eventually a playwright.

</PROLOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
OFF STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A stagehand takes a wooden hammer and beats against a flat metal pate, creating the SOUNDS of THUNDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another stagehand starts to lift shutters in front of a stage light back and forth to create LIGHTNING STRIKES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON STAGE

<DIRECTION>
"Prologue" opens his umbrella.

In the rafters a stagehand opens valves. It starts to RAIN.

	His will famously left his second best bed to his widow. But it made no mention of a single book or manuscript.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROLOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The actor who will play "Ben JONSON" (mid 30's) appears in the wings, bearded, ready to go on stage, holding a prop leather manuscript. Behind him a group of Elizabethan "soldiers" strap on their swords.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Prologue" continues, as do TITLES.
</DIRECTION>
<PROLOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it possible Shakespeare owned no books at his death because... he could not read? That he wrote no letters because he, like his father before him and his children after him, could not write?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(lets that sink in, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our Shakespeare is a cypher, a ghost; his biography made not by history... but by conjecture. His story not written with facts, but with... imagination.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROLOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The rain has intensified. "Prologue" turns and the camera starts to leave him and the TITLES END....
</DIRECTION>
<PROLOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (more energetic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So! Let me offer you a different story. A darker story... Of quills and swords. Of power and betrayal. Of a stage conquered, and a throne lost!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROLOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A FLASH OF LIGHTNING, and for a moment only sheets of RAIN are visible. No stage, no "Prologue". Then, trough the rain, we see a form of a man... Ben Jonson... running. Then we make out the shapes of houses... a street. We're not on a stage anymore. We are:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BANKSIDE LONDON - 1604 NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jonson-- carrying the manuscript-- runs up the street toward a large circular theater.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He frantically opens the wooden door to the theater--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE ROSE THEATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--and he quickly bolts it behind him, turns, and desperately looks for a place to hide. He runs towards the stage as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
About a dozen uniformed guards reach the door. They are led by Sir Richard POLE (40), Captain of the Guard.
</DIRECTION>
<POLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Break it down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLE>
<DIRECTION>
And several of the guards charge the door with their pikes, HITTING it hard.

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Again!
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jonson hurries backstage, and disappears from our view just as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT/INT. THE ROSE THEATER - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--the guards SMASH the door open. Pole is the first in.
</DIRECTION>
<POLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jonson! Jonson!! Show yourself!
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLE>
<DIRECTION>
The soldiers immediately spread out into different parts of the theater. Jonson's gone. Because--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JONSON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
has moved under the stage silently scurrying like a rat trying to find a place to hide among the stacks of props and costumes (swords, masks, flags and banners, shields, barrels, canons, etc.) But Jonson freezes when he sees--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE CRACKS OF THE STAGE'S FLOORBOARDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--the soldiers jump onto the stage and spread out, Pole amongst them.
</DIRECTION>
<POLE>
<DIRECTION>

Nothing. A beat, then--

<POLE>

(CONT'D) (to a soldier)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

<POLE>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Torch it! All of you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</POLE>
<DIRECTION>
The soldiers obey, lighting fire to the walls, the galleries, the columns as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JONSON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GASPS in horror. Desperate-- he spies an open metal box nearby filled with un-used fireworks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tosses the fireworks out of the box-- and then places the bound manuscripts in their place, then closes the box. Then-- he grabs a nearby rapier as--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLAMES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--begin to take hold everywhere: the columns at the front of the stage... the trompe-l'oeil walls... the seating galleries... the columns...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TRAP DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
opens center-stage, and Jonson JUMPS out, the rapier in his right hand, ready for a fight. But-- three soldiers jump onto the stage, pikes ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jonson-- no fool- turns and runs for the other end of the stage-- but then runs smack into four other soldiers!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ballocks!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jonson turns this way and that-- nowhere to run-- grins wryly, drops his sword. Raises his hands in surrender.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ROSE THEATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jonson, his hands tied behind him, is pushed through the door, Pole following.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small crowd of actors, whores, etc., watch the theater burn. The guards have to push their way through them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fire reaches the fireworks below the theater's stage, and--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- the SOUND of fireworks EXPLODING makes Jonson turn and see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE THEATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Timbers CRASH and fireworks EXPLODE over the theater.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE THAMES RIVER - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A longboat carrying Jonson, Pole and the guards makes its way towards the Tower Of London.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOWER OF LONDON - AN INTERROGATION ROOM - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jonson is thrown into a chair, a guard on either side of him. It's dark-- the only light coming from a few torches in the walls, and a large fire pit at the far side of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An INTERROGATOR (30's) faces him. Dressed all in black, he is wispy thin.
</DIRECTION>
<INTERROGATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are Benjamin Jonson, playwright? Son of William Jonson, glass-blower, son of James Jonson brick-layer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INTERROGATOR>
<DIRECTION>
Jonson nods.
</DIRECTION>
<INTERROGATOR>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And have you ever been arrested before, Mr. Jonson?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INTERROGATOR>
<JONSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a writer, aren't I? Of course I've bloody well been--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONSON>
<DIRECTION>
And a guard BACKHANDS Jonson on the face full force-- hard enough to send Jonson and the chair to the ground. His nose starts to bleed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the Guards pull him up, the Interrogator looks across the room-- there is someone else there, a FIGURE, watching, but cloaked in the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jonson notices the figure as well. We hear a voice from the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<FIGURE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ask him about the plays.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIGURE>
<JONSON>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Interrogator)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Plays?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the Figure)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which would you prefer, my lord? A pastoral? An historical? An historical-pastoral, or an hysterical historical pastoral--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONSON>
<DIRECTION>
And SMACK! He's hit by the guards again. He SPITS out a tooth.
</DIRECTION>
<INTERROGATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are not interested in your plays, Jonson. We are interested in the plays given to you by Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INTERROGATOR>
<DIRECTION>
Jonson stares at him a beat, and then looks into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<JONSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry my lord, but I am not sure I know whereof you speak. I have had the honor of meeting his lordship--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONSON>
<DIRECTION>
And SMACK--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FACES
</DIRECTION>

laughing. Not in this room, somewhere else. Somewhere outside. Before we really understand what we are seeing we are:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK IN THE CELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jonson blinks, trying to stay conscious. His mouth is ripped, bleeding. So is his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The skin has broken on his forehead. The Interrogator leans into the bloody Jonson.
</DIRECTION>
<INTERROGATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are the plays?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INTERROGATOR>
<DIRECTION>
Before Jonson even has a chance to answer-- SMACK!

<DIRECTION>
MORE FACES

<DIRECTION>
Laughing. We are:

walk towards the theater. Edward de Vere (47), the Earl of OXFORD, an intensely handsome man. His clothes have seen better days.

His companion is Henry Wriothesley, Earl of SOUTHAMPTON (22). Blonde, attractive, a bit of a pretty boy-- and extremely enthusiastic.

The usher takes them up a flight of stairs. Oxford observes everything as they walk.

</SOUTHAMPTON>
<DIRECTION>
They come to the second floor, where a SELLING-MAID has a box of food and drink in front of her bosom-- much like a match-stick girl.

<SELLING_MAID>

	Ale? Mutton, mi' lord?

Oxford continues up, two steps behind Southampton.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They come to the third floor and enter the box seating area reserved for nobles, giving Oxford his first real look at the theater itself. Oxford looks around and sees-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROM OXFORD'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Audience members LAUGHING-- others DRINKING-- maids SELLING food-- the actors ACTING...

<DIRECTION>
It's alive. Magical.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oxford takes it all in, almost stunned by it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON-STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The actor William SHAKESPEARE (30) plays a commoner. He is handsome, sexy, charismatic; and holds a tankard of ale, and SWIGS from it constantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another actor SPENCER (30) plays "FASTIDIOUS"; a pompous, over-dressed, caricature of a nobleman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wears an enormous feather on his hat. Also on stage is an actor called John HEMINGE (late 40's), who plays "Sogliardo"
</DIRECTION>
<SHAKESPEARE>

	O, pardon me, sir, twenty places more; your hot-house, your pig-house, or your whore-house!

The audience ROARS in laughter as Shakespeare looks below at a buxom young lady among the "groundlings". He smiles seductively. She smiles back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACKSTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jonson (now 25 and clean-shaven) is watching the performance from behind a curtain, silently speaking the lines with the actors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE RAISED SEATING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of playwrights and poets watch the play with an air of judgement. They are: Christopher "Kit" MARLOWE (32), young, brilliant, a bit foppish (he likes the boys), Thomas NASHE (late 30's)-- a heavy-set, a hard drinking satirist-- and Thomas DEKKER (29), considered a bit of a hack by his colleagues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are called the "Mermaid's Wits" because they frequent a pub named The Mermaid's Tavern.

	His second play, and almost a full house.

Marlowe glances across the theater and spots Southampton siting next to Oxford.

	But with whom? Tell me not he prefers the company of such old grey men as that!

</MARLOWE>
<DIRECTION>
Nashe squints.
</DIRECTION>
<NASHE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think-- yes, by the beard, that's the Earl of Oxford. Old Tom Hooker used to play for him. Had his own acting troupe for private Court performances and the like.

</NASHE>
<DEKKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wonder if he needs any material?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Certainly not any of yours.
	</DIALOGUE>

As the audience HOWLS in laughter, we see:

INT. TENNIS COURT AT ESSEX HOUSE - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Robert, Earl of ESSEX (28), is playing tennis against Southampton. He's handsome, red-headed, and, we will learn, very ambitious.
</DIRECTION>
<ESSEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and how do the Cecils spend their time and energy? Shutting a theater! A theater, for god's sake? It's madness! No wonder the mob hates them so!

</ESSEX>
<DIRECTION>
The court is inside, and slightly different from today's game: the back walls are playable, somewhat like racquet-ball.

Oxford sits on a bench, watching. Essex SLAMS a shot, but it goes--

Southampton SERVES. Essex returns, and another heated rally begins.

	You know you need not ask. I stand with you, as I always have.

Essex smiles at him warmly. They both HEAR something shuffle behind them. They turn, and see:

Nothing. He is gone.

They stop. Southampton makes sure that his men are out of earshot.
</DIRECTION>
<SOUTHAMPTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rumor? My god, all you have to do is look at Essex to see the Queen's reflection. Everyone thinks he's her son, everyone! And I for one would rather bow to a Tudor, bastard though he may be, than a Scotsman!
	</DIALOGUE>

And then he feels instantly ashamed of having said that.

<OXFORD>

	I only have your interests in mind, Henry. For as you so rightly point out, my interests are already lost.

</OXFORD>

Oxford nods, still worried, and Southampton heads for his horse.

EXT. CECIL HOUSE - SUNSET

<DIRECTION>
The stone house is nothing like a stereotypical Tudor house; it's enormous, and very ornate and intricate in design.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It faces the river, and has an elaborate docking area which is now filled with all sorts of longboats letting the noblemen off for a week-end get away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CECIL HOUSE - GREAT HALL - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Most of England's nobility is assembled in small groups, talking. It's a dour, quiet affair. Some music, no life. Quite Puritan.

Southampton is there, but Essex and Oxford are nowhere to be seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HUNCH-BACKED MAN

--makes his way through the room, causing conversations to cease as he walks by. Even the most senior of the nobles bow their heads slightly in greeting him. This is Sir ROBERT CECIL (mid 30's).

DOUBLE DOORS

open, and Elizabeth (in her 60's) enters. She is wearing a large sparkling pearl-encrusted dress with a wide collar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks slowly and carefully, and has a slight tremor in her head and hands. She seems un-certain; like she's not sure she recognizes all the faces around her (Alzheimer's?). And she compensates for it by being all the more regal, all the more un-human.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Essex is on her arm, dressed in a splendid jewel- encrusted doublet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert Cecil FROWNS at the sight of Essex on her arm.

Essex ignores Cecil's glare, notices Southampton--

Southampton CLAPS his hands and a door across the room OPENS.

A DWARF enters, followed by dancing faires, actors swirling sparklers, and musicians playing music.

Elizabeth's rheumy eyes widen in complete delight, a smile of total jubilation crosses her face.

Robert Cecil, on the other hand, looks horrified.

Several actors are mid-scene in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (Act 3, Scene 1), their make-up quite elaborate and fantastical: "Bottom", who is costumed as a man-- except that he has a DONKEY'S HEAD, "Quince", a commoner, "Puck", played by the dwarf who is now dressed like a cupid, and "Titania", Queen of the fairies, who is presently asleep in a bed of fur.

We see Elizabeth watching. But it is an Elizabeth only 26 years old (referred to as YOUNG ELIZABETH in this script). We HEAR the sound of other dialogue, but from the same play. We are:

<DIRECTION>
INT. HEDINGHAM CASTLE - GREAT HALL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Thirty-eight years earlier. And YOUNG ELIZABETH watches an earlier, slightly less sophisticated staging of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" (the costumes and sets are a bit more thrown together).

<DIRECTION>
All the actors are children from 7-12 years old or so.

Thirty-eight years later. The door SWEEPS open and a snoring, sleeping Jonson is awakened by--
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jonson! Ben Jonson!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>

The other prisoners make way as the guard approaches Jonson. The guard tosses a wax-sealed piece of parchment onto Jonson's lap.

EXT. A BOAT - RIVER THAMES - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jonson is in a nobleman's longboat (for the first time in his life). Across from him sits FRANCESCO-- Italian, 60's-- wearing a doublet with the Oxford coat of arms on its chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The City of London is far in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jonson looks around uncomfortably at the luxurious boat for a moment before--
</DIRECTION>
<JONSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONSON>
<DIRECTION>
Francesco just stares back.

The boat approaches a large stone house, Oxford Stone.

as it is cut from its bush by ink-stained hands. We are:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OXFORD STONE - GARDEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oxford smells the rose, inhaling its essence. Then he turns and sees Francesco escorting Ben Jonson towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before they reach him he glances at his wife ANNE De Vere (40's) who sits in the distance knitting with one of their daughter's, BRIDGET (17).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jonson is quite uncomfortable to be at such a grand place. Jonson CLEARS his throat.
</DIRECTION>

	The Tudor rose. The most beautiful of flowers, don't you think?

	It looks to me to have quite a number of thorns, my lord.

	So it does. So it does.

</OXFORD>
<JONSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am told, my lord, that I owe my freedom to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONSON>
<OXFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is true. And it was quite hard to come by. One does not cross my father-in-law lightly.

Jonson doesn't know who he is talking about.

<OXFORD>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Lord William Cecil. I have the questionable distinction of being married to his only daughter.

Oxford looks over to his wife who watches them suspiciously. He begins to walk away forcing Jonson and Francesco to follow.
</DIRECTION>
<OXFORD>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It did, however, serve as helpful when I wrote to your jailers to release you in my father-in-law's name.

</OXFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Jonson suddenly looks worried and turns and looks back to Anne.
</DIRECTION>
<JONSON>
<DIRECTION>
(in a panicked whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lord-- I'm sorry, does that mean my release is not officially sanctioned?

<OXFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be an idiot Jonson, of course it wasn't.

Oxford turns to Jonson.

<OXFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I enjoyed your little comedy last week, Jonson. You have potential, great potential.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OXFORD>
<JONSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONSON>
<OXFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it's politics did seem to have quite an effect on the Tower. My father-in-law's men felt it quite seditious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OXFORD>
<JONSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Politics? My play had nothing to do with politics! It was just a simple comedy--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONSON>
<OXFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That showed your betters as fools who go through life barely managing to get food from plate to mouth, were it not for the cleverness of their servants.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All art is political, Jonson. Otherwise it would just be decoration. And all artists have something to say, otherwise... they'd make shoes. And you're not a cobbler, are you, Jonson?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OXFORD>
<DIRECTION>
As they enter the center of the maze, Oxford turns to his servant.
</DIRECTION>
<OXFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Francesco.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OXFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Francesco steps forward and hands Jonson a leather bound manuscript. Jonson looks at it confused and opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<JONSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A play, my lord?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONSON>
<OXFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One you shall stage Bankside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OXFORD>
<JONSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stage?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONSON>
<OXFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Under your name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OXFORD>
<JONSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name, my lord?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONSON>
<OXFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't very well use my name, can I? I'm the seventeenth Earl of Oxford. The Lord Great Chamberlain of England, Viscount Bolebec, Lord Escales, Sandford and Badlesmere, etc, etc. No. I have a... reputation to protect. In my world, one does not write plays, Jonson. People like you do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OXFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Jonson tries not to be offended.
</DIRECTION>
<JONSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. My lord. You wrote an entire play, my lord. I know how difficult--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONSON>
<OXFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not a play, Jonson, I've written many. No doubt, many more than you yourself. A good number performed at Court years ago, others never seen by a living soul.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OXFORD>
<JONSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you want... me to apply my name to this play?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONSON>
<OXFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I mean you to put your name to all of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OXFORD>
<JONSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All of them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONSON>
<OXFORD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well don't look like I just gutted your pet dog, Jonson. I mean to make you the most popular-- and therefore the most monetarily successful-- playwright in all of London.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OXFORD>
<DIRECTION>
Jonson pales. This is a disaster for him.
</DIRECTION>
<OXFORD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish you god speed and good morrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OXFORD>

Jonson looks down at the manuscript, reads a few lines.
</DIRECTION>
<JONSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lord-- I really--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONSON>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up, but Oxford is gone, having left the maze without so much as a good-bye.

<JONSON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lord?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONSON>
<DIRECTION>
But before he can follow, Francesco tosses a leather pouch of coins at his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCESCO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is for your trouble, Signor Jonson. And your silence. If I hear you break that silence, then... not so good for Signor Jonson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCESCO>
<DIRECTION>
And Francesco follows after his master as Jonson picks up the pouch, examining its contents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then Jonson realizes he doesn't know how to get out of the maze. He chases after them.
</DIRECTION>
<JONSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? My lord?! I--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONSON>
<DIRECTION>
And he's lost. He looks this way and that, then picks a path (the wrong one).

Robert Cecil is standing at the opulent river entrance to Cecil House, waiting for an enormous barge docking. William Cecil (now 75) is at the front of the barge, waiting to disembark. He constantly holds an ornately carved white cane.

	He is an Earl, father. I cannot deny him--

<WILLIAM_CECIL>

	Of course not! You don't deny him anything. You find excuses. She is unwell, she is reading, she is seeing the Ambassador from Russia. For God's sake, use your imagination, Robert. Whatever will you do when I am gone?

Robert Cecil looks surprised for an instant that he knows about that as well.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What purpose indeed?

<DIRECTION>
(to Robert)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But through your carelessness I must now deal not only with Essex, but Edward as well. For whether in shadow or in person, Edward has returned to Court!

And with that he slams the door shut.

And a SERVANT is looking at the poems, then quickly stuffing them into a bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But then he HEARS footsteps coming. Panicked, he looks for someplace to hide-- a tapestry half covers a door-- he runs to it-- the door is locked!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
So he hides behind the tapestry just as the door opens, and Young Oxford enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a few steps, Young Oxford senses something amiss. Looks at his--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WRITING DESK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where the parchments are scattered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
YOUNG OXFORD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
goes to his desk, picks up one of the pieces of parchment. It has poetry on it. His poetry. He goes through some other pages. And realizes other pages are missing. He becomes infuriated. He sees--

Two feet.

Young Oxford CHARGES the tapestry, sword in hand. He THRUSTS the sword THROUGH the tapestry.

The man screams in agony as he falls. He doesn't just die, but screams and screams and screams.

Young Oxford steps back-- half in horror... half in triumph. The SOUND of APPLAUSE takes us to:

	Elizabeth had several children, Edward, not just yours. She was sixteen for the first. Bloody Mary was still Queen, and our future Gloriana was out of favor. No one thought her very important at all. Except my father, of course. And when her first child was born, a male, my father took it, and hid it. The grandson of Henry VIII, the foundling of course had to be reared a nobleman. John De Vere, the previous Earl of Oxford, agreed to accept the task.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JONSON>
<DIRECTION>
Jonson freezes, and looks back at Oxford's house, realizing there is another whole layer to all this; exactly what he can only guess.

INT. OXFORD STONE - OXFORD'S ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few hours later. Oxford has died in his bed. Anne watches as a doctor covers his face with a sheet.
</DIRECTION>
<JONSON>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I have done is yours; what I have to do is yours; being part in all I have, devoted, yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONSON>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A SMALL CHURCH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A casket is being interred into the family mausoleum. Anne is there, as are Oxford's children. So is Robert Cecil.
</DIRECTION>
<JONSON>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were my worth greater, my duty would show greater; meantime, as it is, it is bound to your lordship, to whom I wish long life... still lengthened with all happiness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONSON>
<DIRECTION>
Southampton is there as well. Watching. Tears roll down his cheeks.

INT. TOWER OF LONDON - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where we began.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bucket of water is DUMPED on Jonson. He regains consciousness and looks around. Somewhat confused he sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robert Cecil limping out of the dark towards him. Robert Cecil leans down, and very close to his ear, whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<CECIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can make all this go away, Jonson... To be but a dream. Like one of your plays... Or, I can bring you so much pain-- pain that were you given a thousand years, and a thousand quills, you could never justly describe...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CECIL>
<DIRECTION>
Cecil steps back.
</DIRECTION>
<CECIL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you have them. All his manuscripts. My sister saw you leave Oxford Stone with them under your arm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CECIL>
<DIRECTION>
Jonson takes a long time before answering. Will he betray Oxford?
</DIRECTION>
<JONSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They were destroyed... burned... by your own men...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONSON>
<DIRECTION>
Cecil doesn't know whether to believe him or not.
</DIRECTION>
<INTERROGATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's lying...
	</DIALOGUE>
</INTERROGATOR>
<JONSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My lord? Why would I lie? Is there a man alive who has reason to hate him more than I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONSON>
<DIRECTION>
Jonson stares directly at Cecil, knowing he is speaking about Cecil as well as himself.
</DIRECTION>
<JONSON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was something I could never be. An undeniable perfection... that plagued my soul... And to him I was... nothing. A messenger. Nothing more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONSON>
<DIRECTION>
Cecil stares into his eyes for a long moment, searching for the truth. Then he smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<CECIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let him go! He tells the truth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CECIL>
<DIRECTION>
Robert Cecil turns to leave, but then turns a last time.
</DIRECTION>
<CECIL>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And Jonson-- better him, won't you? Wipe his memory for all time. For you. And for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CECIL>
<DIRECTION>
Robert Cecil smiles at Jonson, who can only stare at him. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<JONSON>
<DIRECTION>
(sotto)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am afraid that this is not possible, my lord.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONSON>
<DIRECTION>
Robert Cecil's smile freezes and he leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF TOWER OF LONDON - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jonson is getting released. He walks away....a lonely figure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ROSE THEATER - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wide from above...Still smoking from the fire....All the sudden we make out Jonson searching through the rubble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - AUDIENCE CHAMBER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Set for a Court performance of a play. Courtiers bow as King James I enters the chamber, Robert Cecil two steps behind him. James takes his seat right in front of the stage, as Elizabeth used to.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ROSE THEATER - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jonson's eyes search the ground. And, eventually, he finds it--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE METAL BOX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
that seems to somehow have survived the conflagration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JONSON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
opens the box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE BOX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Are the manuscripts Oxford gave him. Jonson smiles, relieved. They are singed at the edges, but they are there. We hear--
</DIRECTION>
<PROLOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	O-- for a muse of fire... that would ascend the brightest heaven of invention...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROLOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN ACTOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
playing Prologue. He is the same actor who introduced the "play" at the beginning of the film. But now he wears Elizabethan clothing-- but again, all monochromatic and grey.
</DIRECTION>
<PROLOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A kingdom for a stage, princes to act, and monarchs to behold the swelling scene!

INT. WHITEHALL PALACE - AUDIENCE CHAMBER - NIGHT

And he is standing on the stage.

<PROLOGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let us, ciphers to this great accompt, on your imaginary forces work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROLOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
King James' watches enthusiastically, Robert Cecil right next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<JAMES_I>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We had seen some of this Shakespeare's plays in Edinburgh, Sir Robert. I must tell you, we enjoyed them immensely, and look forward to seeing many more, now that we are in London... I presume you are as avid a theater man as myself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAMES_I>
<DIRECTION>
Robert Cecil's smile remains frozen.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBERT_CECIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course, your majesty...

<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA moves away from them and we realize we are on the theater stage where we started.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BROADWAY THEATER - STAGE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Prologue" turns and addresses his audience (and us) in the modern theater.
</DIRECTION>
<PROLOGUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Robert Cecil remained the most powerful man in the Court of King James, though he could not prevent the public theaters from becoming ever more popular. William Shakespeare, however, spent the remaining years of his life not in the playhouses of London, but in the small town of his birth, Stratford upon Avon, as a businessman and grain merchant.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ben Jonson succeeded in his desire to be the most celebrated playwright of his time, becoming England's first Poet Laureate. And in 1623, he wrote the dedication to the collected works of the man we call William Shakespeare.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so... though our story is finished, our poet's is not. For his monument is ever-living, made not of stone but of verse, and it shall be remembered... as long as words are made of breath and breath of life.

The curtains close.

END CREDITS start to roll...

FADE OUT.
