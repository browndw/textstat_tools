The water is up to the top of the front tires: up to the hubcaps on the rear wheels. The headlights are underwater, spots of yellow glowing. They've stopped next to a lighted sign.

Tom climbs out and up on top of the truck.
</DIRECTION>

OUTSIDE THE TRUCK

Tom stands on top of the truck. In one direction, nothing but blackness. The other way he can see the lights of the town. But there are no cars coming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie looks over as Tom appears, upside-down, in the doorway.

<TOM>

	The town's been evacuated. We won't get any help from there.

Looking out as the Sheriff's car rolls past on the water- covered street. A HAND lets go of a curtain and it swings across the window.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DUSK IN THE SHERIFF'S CAR

The Sheriff motions Wayne to stop the car, then he grabs the radio mike and clicks it on as a megaphone.

<SHERIFF>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Henry, I saw you. Come on out.

Late 70s, step out onto their porch.

	That's illegal, Doreen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF>
<DOREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gonna arrest us, Sheriff? Hell, are you even sheriff anymore, Sheriff? Didn't you lose an election? I sure as hell know I didn't vote for you, and neither did Henry.

<HENRY>

	Doreen...

</HENRY>
<SHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't need to set traps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF>
<DOREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what they said in '73. When we got back, anything the bastards didn't steal they broke, just for the hell of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOREEN>
<SHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not happening this time.

</HENRY>
<SHERIFF>

	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF>
<DOREEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Soon as we finish setting the traps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOREEN>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff wants to say something more, but he's not about to argue with Doreen. He just nods and gets back into the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff climbs back in. He and Wayne watch Henry and Doreen go back into the house, Doreen still nagging at Henry.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God'll understand if you have to drown her in the basement, Henry.

EXT. ARMORED TRUCK - NIGHT

The water is creeping up the sloping hood of the truck.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We gotta get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about the money?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The money's safe; we're not. Water rose about a foot in the last twenty minutes. The National Guard isn't going to be here for another hour. You do the math.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Tom shrugs -- Charlie's right. They're about to get out when light washes up on them. They look out to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HEADLIGHTS OF A GMC SUBURBAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Approaching on the other side of the dip, a quarter-mile away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE AND TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Look at each other then get out of the truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SUBURBAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stops on the far side of the dip -- a hundred yards away. The headlights shine across the water. Doors open and MEN get out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM AND CHARLIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Come around the front of the truck. They can't see through the glare of the Suburban's bright headlights.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>

Charlie looks at Tom, relieved.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like we might just --

</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
THE SUBURBAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Headlights go on high beam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE AND TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Squint, blinded by the high beams.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why'd they do that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably so they can see better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or so we can't see at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie looks at him -- what does he mean? Tom puts his hand on his pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE WATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Assembled by the Suburban are...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM AND HIS MEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All holding guns. He speaks to them quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is my retirement fund, boys, and if any one of you screws up, I swear to God I'll kill you. Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
They start wading down into the dip in the road. Kenny carries a rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM AND CHARLIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom squints through the bright light.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Company dispatch and the National Guard are the only ones who know we're here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyone with a scanner from Radio Shack could've intercepted your call, Charlie.

	Jesus.

</JIM>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn down your lights!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll be right there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Tom starts to pull his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KENNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is fired up on adrenalin. He has his rifle up and is aiming it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom with his hand on his pistol, starting to pull it out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM AND CHARLIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie sees Tom going for his gun. He moves close to Tom, half in front of him, putting his hand on Tom's.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it easy, Tom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
KENNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stiffens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KENNY'S FINGER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Squeezes the trigger of his rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jumps at the sound of the rifle crack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is knocked back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yanks out his gun and starts shooting back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM AND HIS MEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Duck down in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shooting blindly, looks over and sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A horrible look on his face, blood coming out of his neck. He sinks into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KENNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shoots off another few quick rounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drops into the water, bullets plugging in around him. Just his hand and pistol are visible, shooting blindly back toward Jim and his men. THE SUBURBAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is hit by Tom's fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Runs out of bullets. A beat later we see Charlie start moving through the water -- Tom is pulling him.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	STOP SHOOTING!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
KENNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doesn't hear Jim and keeps firing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Aims his pistol at Kenny's head.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND THE ARMORED TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom comes up in the water behind the truck, gasping, holding Charlie. Tom rests his gun on the truck bumper.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Tom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Charlie's gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM AND HIS MEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim glares at Kenny, his eyes on fire.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was going for his gun!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wasn't gonna shoot, Kenny. Goddamnit!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes head, calls to Tom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We just want the money! Get away and we won't have to kill you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shuts his eyes, thinking, scared.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Tom opens his eyes. He looks down at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Floating in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What the hell is he going to do?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM AND HIS MEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim's men look at him. Jim motions them to wait some more.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got thirty seconds to get the hell away!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Jim and the others wait, but there's no answer from Tom.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The clock's running! Go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Still no response from Tom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All they can see is the front of the truck, in the light of the "Welcome" sign. They can't see the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM AND HIS MEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim nods to his men. They head for the truck, down into the deeper water at the bottom of the dip in the road. All have guns up and ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim sends Mr. Mehlor and Ray out to circle around. They all move quietly. The only sound is the rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gets to the truck and moves along its side, Kenny right behind him. Jim gets to the back of the truck, nods for Kenny to cover him, then steps out behind the truck, gun up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHARLIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is floating in the water, eyes of glass.

</JIM>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was going for his gun!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Mehlor, I believe we're gonna need your science project.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Mehlor nods and digs into his pack. Ray looks down at Charlie in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"I shall bring floodwaters upon the earth to destroy all that lives under the heavens and every creature that has the breath of life in it shall perish." Genesis 6:17.

<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were you a preacher or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Ray laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_MEHLOR>

</KENNY>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Obviously.

</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Mehlor laughs as he pulls something out of his pack. It's...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMALL EXPLOSIVE DEVICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A half-stick of dynamite with a timer, mounted on a magnet.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_MEHLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you hit the switch you've got thirty seconds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_MEHLOR>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You teach your students how to make things like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Mehlor puts the device on the back door.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_MEHLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You been to a high school recently, Ray? My students taught me how to make things like that. Ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_MEHLOR>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Something's wrong. Jim touches the handle on the door. It moves. Uh-oh. He raises his pistol, grabs the door handle and pulls. The door swings open. We don't need to see what he sees -- we can tell from the expression on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ON THE ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom is running hard through the knee-deep water, pulling a string of canvas money bags buckled together. The truck and "Welcome" sign are two hundred yards behind him. Tom hears an angry yell.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny is the one yelling.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up. Everyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
They quiet. The patter of the rain is too loud -- they can't hear anything. Jim scans the horizon, but sees nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now why'd he have to go and do a thing like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To stay alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off their looks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He thinks we'll kill him -- unless he knows where the money is and we don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<MR_MEHLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is another possibility.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off their looks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's thinking of keeping it for himself.

	There's always that. Either way, we got ourselves a sharp one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do we do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Jim is looking at something in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty soon the water'll be too deep for him to run. But for us it'll be just deep enough.

</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR AND BOAT DEALERSHIP - SHOWROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A glass window is smashed and water floods into the boat showroom. Jim and his men stride in. Kenny ogles a particularly nice cruiser. Jim stops at a smallish ski-boat.

	Shit, Jim, we're stealing. Can't we take anything we want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The water isn't very deep yet. We need something with a low draft. Mr. Mehlor -- find us some gasoline.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Mehlor heads off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KENNY
</DIRECTION>

Sees something else he likes. We don't see what it is.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROAD OUTSIDE CEMETERY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom comes out through the gates of the cemetery, splashing through the knee-deep water. He's running when he hears, from behind him, boat engines firing up. He turns to see...

Racing toward him over the water, a hundred and fifty yards back.

<DIRECTION>
Flanking the ski-boat, piloted by Kenny and Ray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom is running as fast as he can. He looks back, sees the ski-boat and jet-skis closing. They'll get him before he gets to town. He suddenly veers off the road toward...

The sign out front reads: GO WARRIORS!

There's a hole in a window large enough to climb through.

Wearing Kenny's hat and jacket.

RAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gives chase.

Comes around a corner, sees the open front doors ahead of him.

TOM'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wall of windows at the end. No way out. Trapped. Then...

<DIRECTION>
RAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is on his tail.

KENNY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fires, misses and is knocked to the side as...

<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hunches down on the jet-ski and crashes through the windows.

Jim and Mr. Mehlor are moving right outside the windows just as Tom blasts out of the school and races off into the dark.

Tom moves fast over the water. He yanks off his clip-on tie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM AND THE OTHERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chase Tom's light, behind by fifty yards, heading out into farm fields. They get closer and closer and then watch as...

TOM'S JET-SKI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Runs straight into a tree and explodes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM AND THE OTHERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Race up to find the burning, flaming wreckage of the jet- ski. Ray circles on the other jet-ski. Kenny, still bleeding from the head, is in the boat with Jim and Mr. Mehlor.

	Sorry to interrupt Bible study and all, but has no one but me noticed how completely screwed we are? We should be back in the motel room, counting out the money. Instead --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Jim lashes out with a fist, hard and fast, hitting Kenny in the chest, knocking him out of the ski-boat, into the water. Kenny comes up in the thigh-deep water, sputtering.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one likes this particular turn of events, Kenny, but we have a choice -- we can can either deal with it or we can walk away. There's a lot of money out there, so I choose to deal with it. If you want to go, that's fine -- start swimming. You want to stay, that's fine, too -- just stop your damn whining.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Jim pushes the throttle forward and the ski-boat takes off, leaving Ray on the jet-ski, with Kenny in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell's his problem? All the money in the world ain't worth a goddamn nickel if you get caught. It's not like there won't be other jobs.

Suddenly appear on the top of the wall and...

TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulls himself into view. He climbs over the wall, exhausted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND THE SANDBAG WALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gasoline-powered pumps are sucking up any rainwater. The sandbags have kept the floodwater at bay.

Tom comes out into the altar. He looks around, impressed. It's a beautiful church. Scaffolding goes up one wall -- the church is being restored. Tom is startled by a sound from above. He grabs a heavy silver candlestick as a weapon and looks up to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BIRDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fluttering up in the rafters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Takes a breath. Just as he relaxes, he hears a whooshing sound from behind him and turns to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LARGE CRUCIFIX

The Sheriff and Wayne are racing through a grove of half- submerged trees. There's a rushing sound above the sound of the engines. WHAM! and they're hit by the wall of water. Wayne falls out of his boat and is lost in the swirling water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEYWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim and his men are motoring down an alleyway when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WALL OF WATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rushes down the alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water hits him hard, knocking him off the jet-ski. He's swept away by the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON A FENCE LACED WITH CONCERTINA WIRE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The surge water shoots through it. And suddenly there's...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slammed up against the fence, pinned to it, water rushing over and around and by him. He yells as the wire cuts into him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHURCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Karen is pouring gasoline into the pumps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hears the rushing and looks up as the surge hits. Water shoots over the top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHERIFF'S STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom hears the sound and opens his eyes -- what the hell is that?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wall of water slams in hard, cascading over the sandbag wall.
</DIRECTION>

INT. SHERIFF'S STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM SITS UP, SWINGING HIS LEGS OVER THE SIDE OF THE COT. HE REACTS, LOOKS DOWN. HIS POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's two feet of water in the station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The building is like a rock in a stream, with the water rushing up high against one wall, roiling and swirling around the sides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHERIFF'S STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom looks over, stunned, to see... THE DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As a fine stream spits in through the keyhole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WINDOWS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Are heaving as the water rises up against them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gets to his feet, woozy and goes to get out of the cell. He remembers -- uh-oh: the cell door is locked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEYWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim pulls Ray, coughing, choking, bleeding, into the ski- boat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHERIFF'S STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water level inside is rising fast. It hits the wall sockets and there's a spit of sparks, then all the desk lamps go dark. Light still comes from overhead fluorescent panels. Tom sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO KEYS ON A KEY RING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laying on the Sheriff's wooden desk. They're four feet away -- too far to reach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHURCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Karen suddenly has a horrible thought and stops. She shakes it off -- doesn't want to think about it -- and mutters to herself.
</DIRECTION>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll get him out.

EXT. MAIN STREET
</DIRECTION>

Phil is clinging to the statue as the water surges by below him.

EXT. PARK AREA

Wayne gets back into his boat. The Sheriff realizes something.

</SHERIFF>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHERIFF'S STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom looks through the cell bars at wooden chairs bobbing in the water. The Sheriff's desk lifts up, starts floating. Tom gets an idea. He takes his belt off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEAR SHERIFF'S STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A telephone pole is half-submerged, being pulled along fast by the current.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHERIFF'S STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom holds one end of the belt and tosses the rest of it at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DESK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobbing in the rising water. He misses the keys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM AND THE DESK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom tries again. The belt lands on the desk top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom very gently starts pulling. Too hard; the belt starts slipping off the desk. He gets it just right and the desk starts moving toward Tom. He reaches out with his hand, stretching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS FINGERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Touch the top of the desk, start pulling it toward him, and he just gets a firm grip on the desk when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TELEPHONE POLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smashes into a window, bending in the bars on the window, shattering the glass, letting a torrent of water into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DESK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is moved by the rush of water, but not before Tom grabs...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE KEYS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And grips them tight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tries the keys in the lock. They don't fit. He looks at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CU KEYS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tag is emblazoned with the Ford logo.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great! I can drive out of here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Tom tosses the keys into the water and looks around at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WATER LEVEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rising very fast. A foot in ten seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Climbs up the cell bars, the water rising with him. He's running out of room between himself and the ceiling. Three feet. Two feet. He's being pushed up by the water toward...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLUORESCENT LIGHT FIXTURE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the ceiling, caged in a wire cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is terrified, about to die. The water rises up past his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM'S HANDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pull his Maglite flashlight from his belt. He takes off the lens and the battery cap, then shakes the batteries out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sticks the flashlight tube up through the wire grate over the light fixture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He blows out the water -- like clearing a snorkel -- then breathes. Reprieve for a few moments and then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reaches the top of the flashlight tube and starts to trickle in when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FLUORESCENT LIGHT FIXTURE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Goes dark. In the darkness, there's the sound of tubes breaking and metal being wrenched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looks up, astonished, to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FLUORESCENT FIXTURE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Being lifted up and away from above. Streetlight comes in, silhouetting...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FIGURE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing on the roof. The figure leans down and starts tugging at the wire cage over the inside of the fixture. In the light, Tom sees that it's...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAREN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And she's pulling as hard as she can, but the wire cage isn't budging. She pulls out a Swiss Army knife, unfolds a small knife and starts taking out the screws holding the cage in place. She gets two screws out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulls on the cage and it swings down. He climbs up it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SHERIFF'S STATION ROOF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom surfaces in a hole in the roof. There's a vent duct laying on the roof -- Karen must've kicked that over to get to the light fixture. Karen helps Tom up. She sits and he lays down on the roof, catching his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<DIRECTION>
Just then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PROPANE TANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Explodes. The fireball rips across the dark sky, illuminating everything, showing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM AND HIS MEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fifty feet away -- Jim, Mr. Mehlor and Ray in the ski-boat and Kenny on the jet-ski -- guns aimed at Tom and Karen.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
DARKNESS
</DIRECTION>

As the lightning passes, and in the darkness, the thunder rolls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM AND HIS MEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Switch on their lights and move forward. They pass...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Floating down the street with other debris. The cars have been damaged by the flood -- one is missing a door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM AND HIS MEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When they get closer to the Sheriff's station, what they see -- or don't see -- makes them stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom and Karen have disappeared. Karen's boat is still moored to the Sheriff's station roof, empty.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're in the water! Kenny, cut your engine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny shuts off the engine of the one remaining jet-ski. Jim shuts down the boat engine. They float in silence, scanning the water with their flashlights. There's no sign of Tom and Karen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom motions Karen to follow him. She's freaked and hesitates. Tom grabs her hand and pulls her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ski-boat and jet-ski are right above them, flashlights playing over the water.
</DIRECTION>

She's about to call out. Tom grabs her hard.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If they know where the money is, they will kill us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Before Karen can say anything, a flashlight beam comes swinging toward them and they have to duck underwater.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watches as his flashlight beam washes over the car. Nothing there. He guns his engine and heads off down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Floats off around a corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom and Karen surface, catch their breath. Quiet for a few moments as they both look around to see that Jim and his men are gone.
</DIRECTION>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what do we do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>

	They should be there pretty soon.

Karen nods. Tom looks at her. She's shivering.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cold?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm fine. The heater just kicked in.

Tom looks at her, gives a little grin. Their eyes meet for a second, then they look away.

Hear a sparking sound and look over to see...

<DIRECTION>
A TRANSFORMER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On a telephone/power pole close to them. Rain hits it, causing the sparking sound. The floodwater is inching up the pole toward it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water will reach the transformer in a matter of seconds. And while they're staring at that...

At the end of the street explodes as water hits it.

Dead fish start floating to the surface.

Laying on the floor, just below the window.

Henry stands on the roof of the back porch, steadying a small rowboat as Tom gets in. Doreen nags from the window.

<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If our resourceful young friend hears us coming, he'll electrocute us or sink us or one of you'll shoot him. Besides...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few moments pass, then Tom surfaces, holding a shotgun. Then he senses something behind him and turns to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A COW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Floating in the water, tongue out, eyes glassy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kicks away, horrified. And then he hears an engine. He looks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim's ski-boat is coming over the water. The engine cuts out and the ski-boat drifts, a hundred feet from Tom.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son, before you go underwater and do something tricky, there's something I'd like you to see!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>

A flashlight comes on, the beam swivels, illuminating...

<DIRECTION>
HENRY AND DOREEN

Standing in the ski-boat, blinking in the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slumps.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, I know it's your job to protect that money, and maybe you'd even be foolish enough to give your life for it. The question is, are you willing to give their lives for it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Jim puts a pistol to Doreen's head.

</DOREEN>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>

</HENRY>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it'd be best if we all stayed together.

</JIM>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You say all you want is the money? Prove it. Let them go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know if that's --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>

	Right. And before you went in, I deputized you, you dumb son-of-a- bitch! So when I say get down here, it's not a request, it's an order. So get down here! Now! I won't need you for long. And bring your gun.

	Bullshit. This is all bullshit.

</TOM>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew Charlie when we were both working construction for the Johnstown company. His middle name was McCarthy because his parents loved Charlie McCarthy on the radio. His wife's name was Mary.

Jim watches Tom's light rise. Tom comes up fast, takes a breath.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's gone.

</TOM>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like somebody beat you to it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh for Christs -- I'm gonna shoot him, Jim.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAY>
<DIRECTION>
Ray grabs pistol in his belt. Before he can pull it out, holes puff out of his chest, followed by blood and then the sound of the rifle-shots. Ray tumbles into the water. A half- second later there's...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAIL OF BULLETS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ripping into the ski-boat, water, trees, crypt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHERIFF'S BOAT, WAYNE'S BOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Are outside the fence, a hundred feet from the crypt. PUSH IN FAST on...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHERIFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To the rescue. He and Wayne and Phil fire their guns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ducks underwater.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulls his pistol, returns fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. MEHLOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Opens fire with a shotgun, shooting wild, yelling. Then he's hit and knocked out of the boat, dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE SHERIFF'S BOAT
</DIRECTION>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop! You'll hit Tom!

</SHERIFF>
<DIRECTION>
Wayne and Phil stop shooting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BY THE CRYPT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom is holding onto a coffin, out of view of the Sheriff. He hears a rush of bubbles and turns as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Comes to the surface, breathing deep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM'S GUN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Comes out of the water fast and the barrel goes to Tom's forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHERIFF'S BOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's an adrenal fire in the Sheriff's eyes. He starts his boat forward, Wayne following. Their lights find...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM'S BOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No sign of life. Then there's a sound and the lights sweep over to find...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM AND TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Climbing up on top of the mostly-submerged crypt. Jim is behind Tom with his gun to Tom's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHERIFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stops his boat. Wayne stops, too. They are thirty yards from Jim and Tom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAREN AND TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A look passes between them.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(to Sheriff)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, sir, I can imagine you'd love nothing more than to shoot me, but I caution you -- in order to do that, you're gonna have to shoot through young Tom here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHERIFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thinks for a second, then shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF>
<DIRECTION>
He raises his rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAREN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Realizes what is about to happen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM AND JIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Also clue in, but before they can move...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHERIFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Squeezes the trigger as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAREN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hits the gun with her arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE RIFLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is grazed in the arm by the bullet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHERIFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smacks Karen hard with his rifle and she tumbles out of the boat, unconscious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM AND JIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Throw themselves back off the crypt as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHERIFF AND WAYNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Empty their guns in their direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Returns fire, shooting blindly over the top of the crypt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHIL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reaches for Karen, floating limp in the water, but...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WAYNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is closer. He grabs Karen and pulls her into his boat, then grins at Phil.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM AND JIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Are behind the crypt. Tom holds his bleeding arm. Jim reloads.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that was unexpected.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he the one you thought was coming to your rescue?
	</DIALOGUE>

No answer from Tom, but the answer is clear.

The Sheriff, Wayne and Phil turn to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In his boat, right behind them, all dressed up in hunting gear, rifle at the ready.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Hank. That money I told you about? From the armored car? We're gonna keep it. Three million dollars. Four ways.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shoots at crypt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seven fifty apiece. You okay with that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF>
<DIRECTION>
Hank is stunned. He doesn't answer.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hank? You okay with that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF>
<HANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn straight I'm okay with that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANK>
<WAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
(grumbling, re: Hank)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't see what we needed him for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAYNE>
<SHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I guess you've never been hunting with Hank.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Hank)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got two behind that crypt. Get 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF>
<DIRECTION>
Hank nods. He motions for Wayne to go one way; he'll go the other. They start off. A blind shot comes from Jim behind the crypt. The Sheriff shoots back. Phil finally musters up the courage to say something.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I'm not okay with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<SHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on now, Phil.

</SHERIFF>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're gonna kill people?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<SHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're looters, Phil! They come and steal from an armored truck in our town -- they're looters.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(fires two shots)
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Tom? What about Karen? They're not looters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHIL>
<SHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, they're witnesses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff fires off a flurry of bullets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM AND JIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the crypt, bullets winging by. Jim looks over, sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Motor into view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM

Opens fire.

WAYNE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coming into view on the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looks at Jim, sees he's occupied in the fight with Hank. Then he sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Floating in the water, dead, pistol still jammed in his pants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thinks, decides, and reaches out for Ray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON JIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shooting at Hank. He hears gunfire from Wayne and is about to swivel to shoot in that direction when he hears a gun firing from right next to him. He turns to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shooting back at Wayne with Ray's gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WAYNE
</DIRECTION>

(slowly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three million dollars. Look at it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff reaches down into a forward storage area of the boat and pulls back a tarp revealing the bags of money.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A couple of those bags are gonna be yours, Phil.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF>
<PHIL>
	<DIALOGUE>

	I'm the what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF>

TOM AND JIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim looks at Tom, then hands Tom his pistol. Tom doesn't know what Jim's doing. Jim slips beneath the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whistles and gets Wayne's attention. He motions Wayne to try it again.

<DIRECTION>
WAYNE AND HANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Come around on both sides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Starts shooting at them with the two pistols.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAREN'S ARM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Draped over the side of Wayne's boat.

<DIRECTION>
Takes another shot at Hank but stops firing at Wayne.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON JIM'S SKI-BOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim's hand appears over the gunwale. He reaches in and grabs...

And pulls it out of the boat.

	Okay, Phil. But here's how it's gonna go. I'm gonna hear one of two things out of you. Either I'm gonna hear you say you're in with us, or...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(moves close to Phil's gun)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I'm gonna hear a bullet come out of that gun and go into me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF>
<DIRECTION>
Phil is incredulous. The Sheriff weighs his hands like scales.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF>
<DIRECTION>
(one hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars or...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(other hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...you kill me. Your choice.

The Sheriff weighs the hands a couple more times. Phil slumps, lowers the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There we go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERIFF>
<DIRECTION>
SOMETHING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flies through the air; lands in the water by the Sheriff. It's...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MR. MEHLOR'S PACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And it starts sinking in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND THE CRYPT

THE WATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Erupts in a huge geyser.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHERIFF, WAYNE, PHIL AND HANK

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Jim races through the tombstones, barely missing halfsubmerged stone crosses and crypt roofs.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really want that money?

<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Cause the only way you're ever gonna see it is if you help me get Karen.

</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Before Jim can answer, gunshots ring out behind them. They look back to see...

<DIRECTION>
KENNY

Lifeless and limp.

Looks at Kenny for a moment, then pushes his body overboard.

</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
No answer from Jim. Tom looks down.

<DIRECTION>
JIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is laying on the deck, unconscious. Just then... BAM! BAM! BAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Has his rifle resting on his boat's windshield and is firing off a clip on automatic as he, Wayne and the Sheriff close in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ducks down and tries to start the engine. No go. Again. It catches on the third try. Tom guns it and the boat tears off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE OUTBOARD ENGINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is wobbling, vibrating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keeps up his stream of gunfire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stays down, driving blind, as the bullets fly in, blowing holes in the windshield. He looks at Jim, at the engine and curses. He steers the boat toward...

JIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hits the cold water and comes to, sputtering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Jim's bullets plug into their boats. They circle back.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Dear Penthouse: I always thought your letters were fake, until the wildest thing happened to me. I'm a policeman in a small town. In the middle of the big flood last year, I was patrolling the streets in a boat, feeling kind of sorry for myself -- 'cause it was my birthday and all -- when I saw the front door to a house was open. I pulled my gun -- afraid it might be looters. Imagine my surprise when, instead of a looter, I find a young woman handcuffed to the railing of her stairs. Her name was Karen, and ever since she came back from college she'd made it clear she was too good for any of us local folk. Now here she was, in handcuffs! I said, "What the heck is going on here, ma'am?" And she said...

Wayne reaches into the water, undoes Karen's rain pants, yanks off her shoes, then pulls off her pants. He throws them over the banister. Karen remains passive, blank. Wayne takes off his holster; hangs it on the banister. Then he pushes his pants down to his ankles. His shirttail is long enough so that we don't have to see his wretched little pecker. He climbs on top of Karen in the water, brings his face close to hers.

KAREN

Wraps her legs around him, holds him close, pinning him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WAYNE

Finally breaks free. He tries to stop the bleeding with a hand, but the blood spurts through his fingers. He reaches for his gun in his holster on the banister, but just as he grabs it...

KAREN

<DIRECTION>
Lashes out of the water with her legs, kicking Wayne in the groin, pushing him back.

Tries to get his balance, but his feet can't move -- his pants are around his ankles. He falls back into the water, firing his pistol.

Blow chunks out of the wall next to Karen, hit the ceiling and...

Lands between Jim and the Sheriff, knocking them apart.

Is free of Jim's grasp. He shakes off the electrical cord and turns to shoot...

<DIRECTION>
Tom swims down into the living room. His light shows a couch, chairs, TV set. Books and newspapers are suspended in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE CHURCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The damaged ski-boat that Jim and Tom took to the church has slipped off the sandbag wall and is drifting. A peaceful scene. But then, from the distance, comes a rushing roar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHURCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Phil hears the roar. He looks around, lost.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CHURCH

The roar is building, getting louder. Phil sees something in the water and reaches for it, frantically. He gets it. It's...
</DIRECTION>

A BIBLE

And he clutches it to his chest as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FLOOD

<DIRECTION>
Hits the church.

Hanging on a hook on the back wall is a saw. Tom grabs it.

Hank unwraps himself from around the lamp post. He looks back.

There's an alleyway.

<DIRECTION>
HANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Swims for the alley.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ADVANCING FLOOD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roars through the town, pushing a rolling wave of debris, obliterating anything in its path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hank swims into the alley. Hank looks for something to climb up on, to hold onto. There's...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIRE ESCAPE LADDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the end of the alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Swims for it. He hears the rushing roar of the advancing flood. He expects the flood to blow by the end of the alley. Wrong.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WALL OF WATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Comes into the alley, banking high on the far wall before coming down and barreling toward Hank. And what makes it worse for Hank is that there's...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the front of the wave, being pushed by the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dives clear just as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smashes into the wall, right where Hank had just been.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Relief in his eyes. He gets to the fire escape and is climbing to safety when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PROPANE TANK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Comes into the alley, rolling in the flood, spraying propane from a torn hose. It explodes.
</DIRECTION>

HANK

<DIRECTION>
Barely has time to scream.

<DIRECTION>
INT. KAREN'S KITCHEN - BREAK OF DAWN

<DIRECTION>
Tom is threading his belt through the handle of the saw to secure it. He gets it done and starts to swim out of the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO KAREN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just Karen's lips and nose are above water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom is about to leave when everything starts to move -- rocking, from side to side, as if in a slow motion earthquake. Cupboards and the fridge open and bottles and food and plates tumble out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house has been hit by the flood. It's being pulled by the massive current, stretching overhead phone and power lines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KAREN'S HOUSE

Karen hears the groaning, ripping as the house tears free from water and sewer lines. She's looking down for Tom when there's a snap and the light above her goes out.

EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE

<DIRECTION>
The house is carried on the current, turning in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE KITCHEN

<DIRECTION>
Tom watches, astounded, as the room starts to turn around him. He kicks fast for the door to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom swims in, fast, toward the stairs when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Caves in and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HUGE TREE BRANCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smashes in, filling the room, blocking Tom's route to the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tries to get through the tangle of branches and leaves, but can't. He swims over to another window and slides it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAREN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keeps looking down for Tom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house is impaled on a tree, the current sluicing around it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Surfaces near the side of the house, gasping. The current starts ripping him past the house. He swims as hard as he can back to the house, reaches out and grabs onto a gutter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KAREN'S HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Karen doesn't have much time left. The water is washing over her mouth and nose. And just as she's about to go under...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Swims in with the saw. He starts sawing on the handrail. Everything's going fine. And then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SAWBLADE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Snaps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM AND KAREN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Look at each other. Oh no. Karen's going under.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sees something. He dives into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAREN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Can only watch and wait. What's he doing? Oh, Jesus. And then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Surfaces, holding Wayne's pistol. He puts the mouth of the barrel to the handcuff chain, shields Karen's face, looks away and pulls the trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A TREE IN WATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water swirls through the branches of a half-submerged tree.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. KAREN'S HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom and Karen swim out of a second floor window, grab the rain gutter. Tom pulls himself onto the roof then grabs Karen and helps her up. They crawl until they're clear of the edge. Only the sloped roof of the house is visible in the swirling water. They are just catching their breath when they are hit by...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And they look to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHERIFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In his boat, shining a searchlight on them with one hand, a gun in the other. He starts shooting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM AND KAREN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom pushes Karen toward the peak of the roof as the bullets plug in around them. Tom pushes Karen over the top then turns and dives off the roof and into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAREN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hears an engine behind her and turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BOAT

Racing toward the house. It's...

And at the controls is...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barely alive.

THE OUTBOARD MOTOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is wobbling, vibrating at the back of the boat, almost loose from its moorings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees Karen, crouched below the peak of the house, a bright light coming from the other side along with gunshots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM

Pushes the throttle all the way forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SKI-BOAT

Shoots forward.

Tom swims hard toward the Sheriff's boat.

Is shooting down into the water at Tom's moving shape.

With Jim at the wheel, comes racing straight toward the house.

KAREN

<DIRECTION>
Rolls to the side, just getting clear as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SKI-BOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hits the sloping roof of Karen's house and ramps up it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE OUTBOARD MOTOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Digs into the shingles of the roof and tears free from the back of the boat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHERIFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hears the sound and looks up as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SKI-BOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Comes over the peak of the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Surfaces to see...

THE SKI-BOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fly right over him, heading straight for...

THE SHERIFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Who ducks down, just in time as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SKI-BOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Misses him, landing just past him in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHERIFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Straightens up, grinning with glee that the boat missed him. And then he hears a piercing whine coming from behind him. He turns, just in time to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE OUTBOARD MOTOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flipping end over end, propeller whirring, heading straight for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHERIFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Starts to scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON KAREN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking over the peak of the roof in horror. She hears the Sheriff's scream and the scream of the propeller and then a horrible ugly ripping and both screams stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHERIFF'S BOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff is gone. The side has been smashed out of the boat and the boat is flooding with water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHERIFF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is just some misshapen thing trailing red, floating in the water.

Tries to restart the ski-boat but it's dead. He slumps forward.

Tom can tell Jim's anything but. Tom swims for the boat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tom swims up, pulls himself in. He pulls Jim back off the controls, sees the blood.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God. We gotta get you to --
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Jim looks at Tom. Tom understands -- Jim's not going anywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just saved our lives.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did? I just came for the money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Tom looks at Jim -- he knows Jim's lying.
</DIRECTION>
<KAREN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you need any help?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(grabs Tom's arm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Tell her to stay back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<TOM>
<DIRECTION>
(to Karen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Jim lets go of Tom.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to turn it in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry to disappoint you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, hell, then I guess I better take it after all. I figure the river'll carry me down to the Gulf of Mexico. If I catch the right currents, maybe I'll end up in... Belize?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Tom nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You come look me up. I'll buy you a drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<DIRECTION>
Jim grimaces as he's hit by a wave of pain. He looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Tom hesitates for a second.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Tom turns and slides into the water and swims away.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son, don't think too badly of your Uncle Charlie. He always said you were capable of remarkable things.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
There's a last look between Jim and Tom, then Tom swims away.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The rain's stopped.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(breathes deep)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The air after a rain...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Jim slowly topples forward and is still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Swims through the swirling current toward Karen's roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIM'S BOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sinks below the surface and is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOM AND KAREN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Karen is down at the water's edge with her arm extended to Tom. Tom grabs it, and as Karen pulls...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MATCH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHURCH - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Karen pulls Tom up onto scaffolding running along the edge of the new roof under construction. Tom holds a paper bag. He's wearing work gear -- tool belt, work boots, etc. Tom looks at the work being done on the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They got a lot done today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's coming along.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(re: bag)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd you get?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Barbecue chicken from Lilly's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yum.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want some? I wish you'd told me. I woulda got more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha ha.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<DIRECTION>
And as they sit down and start to eat, the camera begins to PULL BACK.
</DIRECTION>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I talked to Mikey. He says the flooring should be in by Friday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what he said last week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<TOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said if it wasn't here by Friday at six that you were going to go over and beat the crap out of him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOM>
<KAREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAREN>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
