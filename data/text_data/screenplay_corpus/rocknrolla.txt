CHECHNYAN 2 has ripped off his jacket, we can see his massive scar covered torso dripping in blood and sweat, he seems unstoppable. One Two gets confident and starts to run backwards egging CHECHNYAN 2 on, CHECHNYAN 2 is a good runner, but not good enough. Deep hate fills his eyes as One Two makes a fool out of him, CHECHNYAN 2 will remember this man. One Two is taking complete liberties, he almost stops and waits until CHECHNYAN 2 has caught up to him and then he tears off, the CHECHNYAN keeps coming.

One Two see's in the distance a tiny moped approaching from a distance, its CHECHNYAN 1 who completely out sizes the machine. However, he's moving and it's moving faster than One Two. One Two ducks off the tracks and over a wall, the moped gets nearer. At least when he gets over the wall, the moped won't follow right? One Two's over. He can hear the moped on the other side, One Two looks over his shoulder he can see the moped being lifted over the wall. "Oh shit." This is where One Two's "zone" comes into play.

The music is very loud, it's Russian. Archy and Danny make their way to it's source, up the stairs, to the bedroom door. The base thumps out. Archy tries the handle, it turns, he pushes the door open slowly. The music becomes clear as we reveal a horrible scene. Archy is shocked, but a little amused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tied to the bed, back to front with a pillow over his head is One Two. A large blade is resting on his back, a bottle of vodka is open on the side, One Two cries and wriggles uselessly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the floor facing the other direction is our pretty much naked Chechnyan doing a traditional Chechnyan dance, which involves lots of extended leg action.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is wearing military speedos and fuck all else apart from his military hat. He is "having much fun." His massive frame is still black and blue from the beating One Two previously inflicted. The other Chechnyan (similarly dressed), is digging into his bag of tools, extracting all sorts of horrible looking things. Archy looks on amazed by the show, he has a quick look at Danny who is also bemused. He hits the "off" button, the Chechnyans spin, looking distressed. Silence ensues.
