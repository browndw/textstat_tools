:SC: LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Five young women stand side by side, waiting to be judged -- breathless, hopeful. A name is announced. Four hearts break.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The camera ZOOMS across the smiles of the losers to find a winner. She bursts into tears, hugs the nearest runner up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Begin CREDITS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC -- quiet and melancholy -- plays over all the opening scenes, leading to the Title card.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Contest Winner cries and hugs the Runners-up as she has the tiara pinned on her head. Then -- carrying her bouquet -- she strolls down the runway, waving and blowing kisses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT REC ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A six-year-old girl sits watching the show intently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is OLIVE. She is big for her age and slightly plump.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She has frizzy hair and wears black-rimmed glasses. She studies the show very earnestly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, using a remote, she FREEZES the image.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Absently, she holds up one hand and mimics the waving style of Miss America. She REWINDS the tape and starts all over,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again, Miss America hears her name announced, and once again breaks down in tears -- overwhelmed and triumphant.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's two kinds of people in this world -- Winners... and Losers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RICHARD (45) stands at the front of a generic community college classroom -- cinderblock walls, industrial carpeting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wears pleated khaki shorts, a golf shirt, sneakers. He moves with the stocky, stiff-legged gait of a former athlete. His peppy, upbeat demeanor just barely masks a seething sense of insecurity and frustration. MUSIC continues underneath.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If there's one thing you take away from the nine weeks we've spent, it should be this: Winners and Losers. What's the difference?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Richard turns with a remote and clicks through a Power Point presentation, projected on the wall behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The slides mimic Darwin's "Evolution of Man" chart, except that they show a lumpy, hunched-over, sad-sack "Loser" evolve into a smiling, triumphant, arms-over-his-head "Winner".
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Winners see their dreams come true. Winners see what they want, they go out and they get it. They don't hesitate. They don't make excuses. And they don't give up. Losers don't get what they want. They hesitate. They make excuses. And they give up. On themselves and their dreams.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Richard puts down his remote for the big finale. In the dim half-light, it's a hushed, dramatic moment.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Inside each of you -- at the very core of your being -- is a Winner waiting to be awakened... and unleashed upon the world. With my nine step "Unleash the Winner Inside" program, you now have the tools, the know-how, the insights you need to put your losing habits behind you and make your dreams come true. No hesitating! No excuses! I want you to go out into the world... and be Winners!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Big smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE -- There are twenty STUDENTS in a classroom that could seat two hundred. They CLAP half-heartedly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then there's an awkward moment when everyone gathers their stuff. No one says anything. Chairs SCRAPE the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Yeah, I'm on my way now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A woman, SHERYL, 40s, is smoking and talking on a cell phone as she weaves through a strip-mall landscape. She wears office attire and a name tag that reads, "Sheryl".
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I don't know how long... I don't know...! Richard, he doesn't have anywhere else to go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a drag, listens with increasing irritation, then exhales. A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not smoking... I'm not! Look, I'm at the hospital...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'll pick up a bucket of chicken. Okay, bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
She beeps off her phone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl strides anxiously down a hospital corridor, fingering a small cross on her necklace, going from one room to another, checking room numbers. She finds the room she's looking for.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she tries to enter, a DOCTOR emerges. They nearly collide.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms. Harvey?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Sheryl nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your brother's fine...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl exhales, hugely relieved.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a wheelchair, parked against a wall, is Sheryl's brother, FRANK, also middle-aged. His wrists are wrapped in bandages.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With empty eyes, he listens to the muted VOICE of the Doctor coming from the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Keep him away from sharp objects: knives, scissors... If you have medications -- depressants -- in your house, keep them secured...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl listens to the Doctor.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd prefer to keep him, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, the insurance...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head and sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to see him...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl and the Doctor enter. Frank barely reacts.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Frank...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheryl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Fighting tears, she goes and hugs him.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so glad you're still here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. That's one of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two hands spill a brown powder onto a small mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A razor blade cuts the powder into lines.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A rolled-up dollar bill lowers. The lines are snorted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The snorter lifts his head up. He is a short, chunky, balding old man -- a Roz Chast kind of grandfather.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is GRANDPA, 80 years old.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits down on the toilet seat, rubs his nose, takes a breath and relaxes as the drugs flood his system.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DWAYNE'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DWAYNE is a handsome, skinny fifteen year old with a mohawk. He lies on his back in his bedroom, bench-pressing a barbell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bedroom is dominated by a huge portrait of Friedrich Nietzsche, painted on a bed sheet, hanging on one wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUMP CUTS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne does vertical sit-ups on a wall-mounted brace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne does vertical push-ups leaning against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne breathes heavily, having finished his work-out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks to a home-made calendar on the wall made from a long roll of computer paper. It is marked, "Enlistment."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the roll is a long grid of maybe a thousand squares. About half the squares have been filled in with magic marker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne uncaps a magic marker and fills in one more square.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl drives Frank home from the hospital. They say nothing. Sheryl sneaks glances at Frank. Hesitantly:
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to talk? Or no?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Frank stares at the road in front of them. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
She nods. They keep driving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLE: "LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC ENDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An empty kitchen. A phone and answering machine sit in the FOREGROUND. The message light is BLINKING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the background, through a doorway, the front door opens. Sheryl and Frank enter carrying several bags and suitcases.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
(calling out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello! Anyone...?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She leads Frank down a hallway. He follows passively.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Down here. We have you with Dwayne.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
She knocks and pushes open the door to Dwayne's room. Dwayne is on the bed, reading THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA. He sits up.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dwayne? Hi, Uncle Frank's here,
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Frank hesitates. He gives Sheryl a look: "You're kidding."
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He doesn't mind, Frank. We talked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Frank makes a half-gesture towards the rest of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't have you sleeping alone. The doctors said...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he looks at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I have to insist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne gets up and exits the room, pushing past them and avoiding eye contact. Sheryl enters the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DWAYNE'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl goes and brushes off a cot. Frank remains outside.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll get along fine. He's really quiet. Look, I set up a cot.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he hesitates)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, Frank? Please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Very unhappily, Frank enters the room and just stands there.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. I gotta start dinner. Come out when you're settled? And leave the door open. That's important.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad you're here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
She gives him a kiss on the cheek, then departs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank sits on the cot in his nephew's bedroom. On it is a Muppet sleeping bag with the Cookie Monster eating a cookie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank glances at the sleeping bag, then averts his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is pretty much the worst moment of his life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne is at the dinner table, reading. Sheryl walks by.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dwayne, honey, there's a bucket of chicken in the car. Can you get it and I'll make a salad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne silently gets up and departs, and the chaotic ballet of dinner preparations in the Harvey household begins. Sheryl opens the door to the downstairs rec room and shouts.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Olive?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>

</OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl enters, opens the refrigerator, and begins pulling out stuff to make a salad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abruptly, from the kitchen side door, Richard enters.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. Frank's here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Did Stan Grossman call?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Check the machine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
He walks over and hits the answering machine.
</DIRECTION>
<MACHINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello. You have one message.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACHINE>
<DIRECTION>
It rewinds. Dwayne enters holding a bucket of KFC.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just put it on the table, hon. And can you set the table? We'll do paper plates tonight. I'll get cups and napkins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne nods and departs. Sheryl exits in the other direction. The phone message begins.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheryl, hey, it's Jeff. Listen, great news. You know, when Olive was down here last month, she was runner up in the regional Little Miss Sunshine...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
(calling to Sheryl)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's from Jeff.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
He stalks off. The MESSAGE plays to the empty kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (filtered)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Well, they just called me and said that the girl who won had to forfeit her crown. I don't know why -- something about diet pills -- but anyway, that means Olive won the regionals, so now she has a place in the State contest in Boca. They want to make sure she can make it, so I said you'd call them...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl re-enters. She tries to listen to Jeff's message.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...The woman's name is Lauren Henderson and her number...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
BEEEEP. The machine cuts him off. Sheryl, not understanding, shakes her head and returns to making her salad. Richard re- enters, picks up the phone and dials. Over the following, Dwayne comes in and out, picking up stuff to set the table.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richard Harvey for Stan Grossman. Can you reach him...?! Yeah, tell him I want to know this thing is done -- I'm waiting for the numbers. No, I understand that. I understand. Look, he has my cell, if he could just call me anytime over the weekend and let me know we're on, I'd be very, very grateful. Okay. Thank you. Bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richard...! So what happened with Stan Grossman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's still in Atlanta.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So why hasn't he called you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you let me worry about this?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl exhales, goes back to her salad. Dwayne comes in.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dwayne, can you check on Frank? Tell him it's dinner time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne nods and heads off. Sheryl walks back to the door to the downstairs rec room and opens it again.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Olive?! Dinner time!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DWAYNE'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank sits on the cot, staring at a photo in his wallet (we can't see it). FOOTSTEPS approach. Frank puts the photo away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne appears in the door, knocks, and mimes eating.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dinner?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Dwayne nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? You don't talk anymore?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Dwayne shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne rolls his eyes and half-shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can talk. You just choose not to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne nods. Then he points to the bed-sheet painting of Nietzsche hanging on his wall. Frank turns and looks.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that Nietzsche? You don't speak because of Friedrich Nietzsche?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne nods, turns and leaves. Frank considers this.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Far out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DINING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne sits in his chair, folds his arms, and -- scowling -- waits for everyone else to arrive. Frank tentatively follows. Sheryl comes out and puts her salad on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank, you can sit here, next to Dwayne. Here's the salad. I'm gonna run get Sprite for everyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
She walks off, pausing to open the rec room door again.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Olive! Come on! Dinner time!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Coming!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl disappears, leaving Dwayne and Frank alone. Frank sits. Dwayne scowls at the table in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank looks at his place setting -- a paper plate and a Big Gulp cup with the Incredible Hulk on it. He picks up the cup and examines it dispassionately. He puts it down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne doesn't move. Frank glances at Dwayne, not knowing what to do. He seems to have met someone who is at least as unhappy as he is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This intrigues him. He ventures:
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got a girlfriend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne looks at Frank, then shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boyfriend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne gives Frank a look.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kidding. Kidding. I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So who do you hang out with?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one? There must be someone...!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Dwayne shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't hang out with anyone? Oh come on. You must have one friend!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne reaches in his back pocket and pulls out a palm-sized pad of paper. He flips it open and scribbles a note.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shows it to Frank. It reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"I hate everyone."
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone? What about your family?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne scribbles again. He shows it to Frank. It now reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"I hate everyone!!!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's underlined "everyone" three times. Frank looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hate me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne considers this. He scribbles a new note. It reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Not yet."
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fair enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
They go back to sitting in silence. Richard comes out.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank. Good to see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richard...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
They shake. Richard sits down. Silence. Richard stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna get Olive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
He walks to the downstairs doorway and shouts.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad! Olive! Come on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (shrieking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're coming!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl enters with a big bottle of Diet Sprite.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys, go on and start. Frank, some Sprite? I want everyone to have at least a little salad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Sheryl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
She pours him a cup, sits down, and starts opening containers of cole slaw and mashed potatoes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard returns to the table, sits, and grabs a piece of chicken from the bucket. Dwayne follows suit, as does Frank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The meal begins. Three seconds of silence.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Sheryl... I couldn't help notice Dwayne has stopped speaking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh! I'm sorry. Dwayne's taken a vow of silence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've taken a vow of silence?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne nods.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's gonna join the Naval Academy and become a fighter pilot. He's taken a vow of silence until he reaches that goal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(to Dwayne)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're kidding...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne stares at Frank. He's not kidding. Olive enters the dining room, with Grandpa following.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Uncle Frank!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Olive. Boy, you're gettin' big!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Sheryl)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is she big for her age?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl nods. Olive, unprompted, walks over and gives him a kiss on the cheek. She sees the bandages on Frank's wrists.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to your arms?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Olive...

</OLIVE>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When're you gonna let us see it?

</RICHARD>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dunno. It's up to Grandpa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<GRANDPA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A couple of days. It needs a polish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDPA>
<DIRECTION>
Olive sits. Grandpa walks to the table.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDPA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this?! Chicken?! Every day it's the chicken! Holy God almighty! Is it possible, just one time, we could have something for dinner except the goddamn fucking chicken?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDPA>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl ignores him. Richard tries to cut him off.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad... Dad... Dad... Dad!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<GRANDPA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just saying...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDPA>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you want to cook or buy your own food, you're more than welcome...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<GRANDPA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ. Y'know, at Sunset Village...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDPA>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you liked Sunset Village so much maybe you shouldn't have gotten yourself kicked out of there...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<GRANDPA>
<DIRECTION>
(waves dismissively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahhhh...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDPA>
<DIRECTION>
He takes out a piece of chicken and starts eating. A tense silence. Frank tries to get things going again.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When did you start? With the vow?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne shrugs. He doesn't care to comment.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been nine months. He hasn't said a word. I think it shows tremendous discipline.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richard...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm serious! I think we could all learn something from what Dwayne's doing! Dwayne has a goal. He has a dream. It may not be my dream, or your dream, but still... He's pursuing that dream with focus and discipline. In fact, I was thinking about the Nine Steps...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<GRANDPA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, for crying out loud...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDPA>
<RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
(evenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...About the Nine Steps, and how Dwayne's utilizing at least seven of them in his journey to personal fulfillment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richard. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just saying! I've come around! I think Dwayne deserves our support.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Frank looks at Dwayne. Dwayne rolls his eyes. Olive addresses Frank.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did it happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did what happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your accident...
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head: "Don't go there."
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's okay. Unless you object...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm pro-honesty here. I just think, you know... It's up to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be my guest...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Olive, Uncle Frank didn't really have an accident. What happened was: he tried to kill himself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did? Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think this is an appropriate conversation.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Olive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's leave Uncle Frank alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Olive has stopped eating.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you want to kill yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank. Don't answer that question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Frank stares at Richard. He turns back to Olive.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tried to kill myself because I was very unhappy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
(overlapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't listen, honey, he's sick and he doesn't know what he's...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richard... Richard... Richard...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?! I don't think it's appropriate for a six year old!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's gonna find out anyway. Go on, Frank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why were you unhappy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
Frank glances at Richard -- deadpan victorious -- and continues.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, there were a lot of reasons. Mainly, though, I fell in love with someone who didn't love me back...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One of my grad students. I was very much in love with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Him? It was a boy? You fell in love with a boy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I did. Very much so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
This is new to Olive. She thinks it over.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's silly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. It was very, very silly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<GRANDPA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's another word for it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDPA>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad....
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So... That's when you tried to kill yourself...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, no. What happened was: the boy I was in love with fell in love with another man, Larry Sugarman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's Larry Sugarman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Larry Sugarman is perhaps the second most highly regarded Proust scholar in the U.S.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's number one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That would be me, Rich.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So... That's when you tried...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, no. What happened was: I was a bit upset. I did some things I shouldn't have done. Subsequently, I was fired, forced to leave my apartment and move into a motel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. So that's when...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(hesitates)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, no. Actually, all that was okay. What happened was: two days ago the MacArthur Foundation decided to award a "genius" grant to Larry Sugarman.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(deep breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's when...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<GRANDPA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...You tried to check out early.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDPA>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. And I failed at that as well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Olive, what's important to understand is that Uncle Frank gave up on himself. He made a series of foolish choices, and then he gave up on himself, which is something that winners never do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Frank looks like he could leap across the table and strangle Richard. Sheryl intervenes.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that's the story, okay? Let's move on. Olive, how's your new routine coming?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. I told you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
Over the above, Frank turns and asks, regarding Richard:
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he always like this?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Dwayne nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you stand it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne writes a note, shows it to Frank. It reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"I can't."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank nods. Richard addresses Olive.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, tell Frank why you're doing your dance routine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Olive. Why are you doing a dance routine?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For Little Miss Crab-Cakes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(arch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A-ha! Just as I suspected...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, tell him what Little Miss Crab-Cakes is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Little Miss Crab-Cakes is a beauty contest for everyone in Maryland. But you have to be six or seven years old and you have to be a girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
Frank looks skeptically at Sheryl.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't look at me! This is Jeff and the new step-Mom. It's big down in Florida
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(to Olive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what do you think your chances are?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Olive takes the question like a pro.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I can win. 'Cause a lot of the new girls -- they don't have the experience.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, good luck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not about luck. Luck is the name that losers give to their own failings. It's about wanting to win. Willing yourself to win. You got to want it badder than anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you? Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat; she nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you're gonna be a winner!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles. Dwayne shakes his head and keeps eating.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richard...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?! It's true!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was runner up in Florida!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When were you in Florida?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spring break. Jeff had custody for two weeks. Olive made it to the top of the Regionals down there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was second place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sher, y'know, there's a message from Jeff on the machine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, Did you hear what it was?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, it was something about Little Miss Sunshine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Little Miss Sunshine? What?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
She runs off. Sheryl follows Olive into the kitchen.

Olive and Sheryl listen.

<JEFF>

(O.S.) (filtered)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Something about diet pills, but anyway that means that Olive won the regionals, so now she has a place in the State contest in Boca...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
BEEEP. Over the above, Olive reacts with involuntary spasms of shock, disbelief, and then pure, unadulterated euphoria.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She waits -- trembling to hear the whole message. When it ends, she puts her hands to her temples:
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaahhhhhhh!!! Aaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!!! Little Miss Sunshine! Little Miss Sunshine! Little Miss Sunshine!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
She goes running out into the dining room.

Sheryl closes her eyes.

<GRANDPA>

</GRANDPA>
<SHERYL>

	Apparently, the girl who won Regionals was disqualified. So Olive has her place in the Finals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When are they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>

	I'm calling Jeff right... Jeff! Yeah, we just got it... Yeah, she basically went crazy. No, I didn't get that, the machine cut you off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs Dwayne's pen and pad. She scribbles.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh-huh. In Boca Raton. This Sunday?! Can you take her? You can't put it off? No, it's just... We have to figure this out. No, I'll give this lady a call and we'll figure it out. Right. Bye.

We TRACK with Olive as she runs down a half-flight of stairs and races around, picking up clothes and shoes that are scattered about.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl enters carrying the bucket of chicken, the half-filled containers of potato salad and slaw, and used paper plates.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard follows Sheryl. Grandpa follows Richard.

<SHERYL>

Sheryl exhales, grits her teeth, shakes her head.

	Okay, we'll drive down.

Having put away the leftovers, Sheryl opens the freezer and pulls out a Jumbo Pak of popsicles.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll fly down.

She sits, rips open a popsicle and takes a bite. Silence.

Dwayne and Frank glance at each other, then tentatively take popsicles for themselves. Richard takes a deep breath.

Everyone stares at him. Dwayne takes his pad out and writes. Frank reads over his shoulder as it comes out.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This... is... unfair... All... I... ask... is... that... you... leave... me... alone."

	Dwayne: Flight school. I'll give permission. Come on. It'll be fun. You can go to the beach.

Dwayne looks at her. FOOTSTEPS start coming up the stairs. Finally, he offers his hand. Sheryl shakes. Everyone is relieved. Dwayne scribbles another note. Frank reads it.

</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Olive walks over and sits next to Richard.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now there's no sense in entering a contest if you don't think you're gonna win. Now, do you think you can win Little Miss Sunshine?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl starts to object, but Richard raises his hand, cutting her off. Olive doesn't seem so sure.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes or no, Olive. Are you gonna win?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Olive thinks it over. Then, with white-hot determination:
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes!
	</DIALOGUE>

Richard smiles and slaps the table.

Dwayne is wearing a T-shirt that says, "Jesus Was Wrong".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olive wears a large set of headphones that completely cover her ears. She does little half-dancing moves to the music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No one says anything. They've been driving a while.

Grandpa's arms hang limply by his side.

Olive is oblivious.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I give you some advice?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Dwayne shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll do it anyway. I don't want you making the same mistakes I did when I was young.

</GRANDPA>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. I can't wait to hear this,

Dwayne shakes his head. Frank, amused, can't help but turn around to watch this conversation take place.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDPA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus! You're, what? Fifteen? You should be gettin' that young stuff. There's nothing in the world better than the young stuff!

	Okay, Dad, enough. Stop it!

	What happened at Sunset Village?

</GRANDPA>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<GRANDPA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me?! I'm old! You get to be my age -- you're crazy not to do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDPA>
<DIRECTION>
Frank looks at Sheryl -- You're letting this happen? Sheryl waves her hands, exasperated.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've tried, believe me! He's worse than a two year old. The intervention was a fiasco.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we please talk about something else now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I take it you didn't like it at Sunset Village?

</FRANK>
<GRANDPA>

<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't there other places?

</FRANK>

	Motherfuckers.

<DIRECTION>
(to Frank)
</DIRECTION>

<FRANK>

	You must've been pretty busy.
	</DIALOGUE>

Olive sees Frank grinning at Grandpa. She takes off her headphones and turns around.

<OLIVE>

<GRANDPA>

</OLIVE>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd say four dollars. Anything under four.

Olive nods. A WAITRESS arrives.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>

	Yeah. Number five. And coffee.

	Fruit plate. And you have chamomile? With honey. Thanks.

	Garden salad? And you?

<OLIVE>

</OLIVE>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take your time...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't apologize, Olive. It's a sign of weakness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Frank rolls his eyes. Olive sees something.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, oh! I want waffles. And... what does "A la mod-ee" mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It means it comes with ice-cream,
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay! A la mod-ee!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Olive. For breakfast?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said, "Four dollars"!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, fine. You're right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay! Be right back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<DIRECTION>
She departs.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, Olive...? "A la mode" in French translates literally as "in the fashion". A... la... mode. Mode is derived from the Latin "modus", meaning due or proper measure. There's kind of a funny story about...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
(cutting in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank...? Shut up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richard...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Frank waves Sheryl off: don't bother. Richard turns to Olive.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Olive, can I tell you something about ice-cream?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ice cream is made from cream, which comes from cow's milk. And cream has a lot of fat in it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richard...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? "She's gonna find out anyway." Right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Find out what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, when you eat ice-cream, the fat in the ice-cream becomes fat on your body...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richard, I swear to God...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? What's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing, honey. Nothing's wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So if you eat lots of ice-cream, you're gonna become big and fat. But if you don't, you'll probably stay nice and skinny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl puts her head in her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDPA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Olive, Richard's an idiot. I like a woman with meat on her bones.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDPA>
<DIRECTION>
Olive is confused.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't... Mom! Why is everyone so upset?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not upset, honey. I just want you to understand: It's okay to be skinny, and it's okay to be fat, if that's how you want to be. Whatever you want -- it's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Richard rolls his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, but, Olive, let me ask you: the women in Miss America...? Are they skinny, or are they fat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... They're skinny, I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay! So they probably don't eat a lot of ice-cream. Do they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, the waitress arrives with a tray.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay: Coffee, coffee, grapefruit, chamomile. And here's your ice-cream. A la mod-ee, right? I'll have your waffles in a sec!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<DIRECTION>
She departs. Olive stares at the ice-cream. Finally :
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does anyone want my ice-cream?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl just closes her eyes. Grandpa jumps in.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDPA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'll have a bite. You mind? Dwayne? Frank? Olive's giving away her ice-cream here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDPA>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne and Frank quickly snap to.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mind if I have a little?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Olive shakes her head. Frank and Dwayne dig in. Even Sheryl gets in on the act. Richard is not amused.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDPA>
<DIRECTION>
(loudly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy, this is good ice-cream! I feel sorry for the people at this table who aren't enjoying delicious ice- cream early in the morning. Olive, you're not givin' away all your ice- cream? What about your waffles? You can't eat waffles without the ice- cream! You'll have lonely waffles in your stomach! C'mon, have a bite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDPA>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. Don't take it all! Stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
Olive picks up her spoon, fights them off. She takes a bite.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Olive...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richard...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
She glares at him, ferocious. Richard shuts up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard -- anxious -- listens to a greeting on his cell phone. A small BEEP.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stan! Richard! Look, I know you're busy, but we're dying to hear what kind of numbers you came up with in Atlanta. Call when you can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
He clicks off as Sheryl, Olive and the others exit the diner. They trudge across the parking lot to the VW van.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You get him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't get a signal out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long 'til we get there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, but... how long?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're doing six hundred miles today, and two hundred tomorrow. It's a lot of driving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, I'll drive a while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's okay...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>

INT. VW BUS - PARKED - DAY

Sheryl is trying to back up the bus. She's grinding gears.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Push the stick down hard!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm pushing hard!

<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put the clutch in all the way!

<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's on the floor!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
JUMP CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
Richard tries. He keeps grinding gears as well. It's a horrible sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SERVICE STATION GARAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard and Sheryl talk to a MECHANIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them, Olive and Grandpa are playing that game where you try to slap the other person's wrists. When Grandpa gets hit, he reacts with cries of pain -- much to Olive's delight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the background, across the lot, Dwayne and Frank sit on a cinderblock wall, waiting for the situation to resolve itself,
</DIRECTION>
<MECHANIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you got a problem. Your clutch is shot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MECHANIC>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we get a new one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<MECHANIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I tell you what: These old buses? We'd have to order it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MECHANIC>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long'd that take?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<MECHANIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's the weekend, so... Maybe Thursday?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MECHANIC>
<DIRECTION>
Richard and Sheryl react.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SERVICE STATION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank and Dwayne sit silently. Dwayne watches bitterly -- this is just one more fiasco he's been dragged into.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank looks on wistfully as Sheryl -- thirty yards away -- glances worriedly between Richard and the Mechanic. Frank notices Dwayne's stare. He speaks without looking at Dwayne.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know if you know this, but growing up? Your Mom was the cool one. She turned me on to Proust. She could've done anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne looks at Frank -- he can't quite believe this. He takes out his pad, half-smirking, and writes:
</DIRECTION>
<What_happened>
<DIRECTION>
Frank looks at the pad, then at Dwayne.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She had you, Dwayne.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
He pats Dwayne on the leg, gets up, and walks back towards Richard and Sheryl. Dwayne is left alone, taking this in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SERVICE STATION GARAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank wanders in as Richard presses the Mechanic. Grandpa and Olive stop their game and join the conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, looks we've come two hundred miles... Is there a dealership around here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<MECHANIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you could call over to Clarksville, but they're probably closed. Y'know, it's the weekend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MECHANIC>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, we're all aware of that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. The Mechanic feels bad for them. Dwayne re-enters,
</DIRECTION>
<MECHANIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I tell you what: these old buses? You don't need a clutch to shift from third to fourth. You just ease up on the gas. You only really need the clutch for first and second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MECHANIC>
<DIRECTION>
Richard doesn't understand what he's getting at.
</DIRECTION>
<MECHANIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I'm sayin' is: as long as you keep parkin' on a hill, you get yourself goin' fifteen, twenty miles an hour, and you just start up in third. Then you shift between third and fourth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MECHANIC>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you can drive like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<MECHANIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah. The problem's just getting up that speed up. As long as you keep parkin' it on a hill, you're fine. My brother and I once drove from here to Canada...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MECHANIC>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if you're not on a hill?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<MECHANIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MECHANIC>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, it's sitting here right now. There's no hill. How do we...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
The Mechanic considers this. He squints his eyes and runs his tongue back and forth across his teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<MECHANIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I tell you what: You get enough people -- you just get behind there and push. Just push it up to ten, fifteen miles an hour, and you just go. Everybody jump inside, and you just go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MECHANIC>
<DIRECTION>
They all stare at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard's at the wheel of the bus. Everyone else, including the Mechanic, is behind the bus. The sliding door is open.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, ready?! Olive, Dad: I want you in the car first.

	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, go! Push!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
They all push. The van starts rolling, slow at first, then faster and faster. Finally, they're all running behind it.

The VW cruises down 1-95. Signs pass. Scenery goes by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the bus, everyone just stares out the windows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Later, Grandpa is doing magic tricks for Olive. He produces a quarter from behind her ear and gives it to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Later, everyone is playing rock, paper, scissors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still later, everyone is back to doing nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VW BUS - ON THE ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard is pitching his business to Frank, who is bored, but not as bored as he would be doing nothing. He is slouched down, barely moving. Richard, however, is in full sell mode.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...So I start pitching "The Winner Inside" to Stan... Two minutes in, he stops me, says, "I can sell this."
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the guy who broke Tony Robbins! He knows how to do it -- start with the book; media tour; then corporate events, consulting, videos series, direct buys on TV... There's a science in how you roll these things out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Interesting...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So now he's at the Expo in Atlanta -- he's been hyping it up, building the buzz -- he's gonna send it out, do a ticking clock auction.

</RICHARD>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about that...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I can detect that note of sarcasm, Frank...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What sarcasm?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...But I just want you to know -- I feel sorry for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do? Good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because sarcasm is the refuge of losers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is?! Really?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sarcasm is just the sour grapes of losers trying to pull winners down to their level. That's one of the lessons of Step Four.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow, Richard! You've really opened my eyes to what a loser I am! Say, how much do I owe you for those pearls of wisdom?

	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>

He listens. Gradually, his face falls.

</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna get a drink. You guys want anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne shakes his head, but Grandpa pulls out his wallet.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDPA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Get me some porn. Something really nasty. None of that air-brushed shit, alright? Here, here's a twenty. Get a little treat for yourself too, if they got any fag-rags in there.

	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
By the front window, a good-looking YOUNG MAN is perusing the newsstand, cradling a grocery bag. He stops and stares.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>

Frank turns. They are startled to see each other.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God! What are you doing here?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Frank puts his arms behind his back, hiding his bandages.

<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm... on a trip. What about...? I thought you were...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>

</FRANK>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, great. That's great,

</YOUNG_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Proprietor puts three porn magazines and a grape Slushee on the counter and rings them up for Frank.
</DIRECTION>
<PROPRIETOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	$15.94, please, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROPRIETOR>
<DIRECTION>
The Young Man glances at the magazines, then at Frank. Frank keeps his hands behind his back. An excruciating pause.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, great seeing you again.

</YOUNG_MAN>
<FRANK>

The Young Man turns and exits. Frank hands over a $20 bill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He watches the Young Man walk off while the Proprietor puts the magazines in a brown wrapper and hands Frank his change.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank takes a few steps and peers out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV -- The Young Man gets into a Jaguar convertible driven by a distinguished-looking BEARDED MAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Young Man says something and points back at the store. The Bearded Man turns and cranes his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank, in the store, ducks out of view. The Young Man and the Bearded Man exchange a few words, then shrug and laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then they drive off. Frank watches, heartbroken. Behind him, the Proprietor picks up the Slushee and waves it.
</DIRECTION>
<PROPRIETOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay! Don't forget your Slushee!

	He's not getting it. Christ.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDPA>
<DIRECTION>
He and Dwayne share a look. Grandpa turns away, troubled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank walks stiffly back to the bus with his Slushee and the wrapper. Without looking, he hands the wrapper to Grandpa.

<SHERYL>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I tried! I tried everything! What do you think...?! Let's just go, okay? Let's get out of here!

</RICHARD>

He starts the car. She stares at him. He won't look at her. Finally, he turns and yells:
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Furious, she goes and gets in the bus, slamming the door.

Everyone else gets in. Richard releases the brake and they drift down the hill.

As the van rolls away, Richard shifts and GUNS the engine.

</GRANDPA>
<RICHARD>

<DIRECTION>
She's on the verge of tears. He takes her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<GRANDPA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa, whoa, back up a second. You can't lose. You know why? Because a real loser isn't someone who doesn't win. A real loser is someone who's so afraid of not winning they don't even try. That's not you! You're in the contest! You're gonna dance! So even if you win, or you don't win, you've already won! See? You-see-you- see-you-see?

Frank re-enters from the bathroom wearing monogrammed silk pajamas, a sleeping mask on his head. Dwayne is in bed reading THUS SPOKE ZARATHUSTRA. Frank climbs into bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne sits up, looks at Frank,
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne shows his pad of paper to Frank. It reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Please don't kill yourself tonight"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not on your watch. I wouldn't do that to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne nods, relieved. Frank pulls his sleeping mask over his eyes, lies back. Dwayne leans over, turns out the light.

INT. MOTEL BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grandpa enters and locks the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens his shaving kit and takes out a small mirror and a tiny ziploc baggie filled with light brown powder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL ROOM ELEVEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard and Sheryl sit on opposite sides of the bed, not facing each other. It's quiet. They've hit rock bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we should try living apart. Just for a while,
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Richard closes his eyes. This kills him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abruptly, Richard stands, gathers his keys, wallet, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you doing? Richard...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna fix this.

<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna fix this. Don't worry.

</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs his coat and exits, very determined. Sheryl, left behind, flops back on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard strides to the VW bus, parked parallel on the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small crowd of TEENAGERS is hanging out, smoking and drinking. Three Teen Boys are puttering around on mopeds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard -- on a mission -- climbs in the VW's driver's seat and starts it up. He shifts into third and REVS the engine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The VW doesn't move. He REVS it very high and loud, jostling in his seat to try to get the bus going. It stays still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard takes his foot of the gas, slumps back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Teens stop chatting and stare at him. Richard, at the end of his rope, turns and looks at the Teens and their mopeds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUMP TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard walks up to the Teens on their mopeds. They are wary. Richard smiles, tries to be friendly.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! How would one of you guys like to make twenty dollars?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
The Teens look at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<TEEN_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck off, fag.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEEN_BOY>
<DIRECTION>
This amuses the other Teens. Richard -- undeterred -- pulls out his wallet, opens it up to see how much cash he has.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, look...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY ENTRANCE - NIGHT - LONG SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An empty highway entrance, lit by streetlamps. Interstate traffic flies by at 70mph -- cars, SUVs, eighteen wheelers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Into the frame and down the entrance ramp rides Richard, balanced precariously on a borrowed moped, pushing 35mph.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He edges into the break-down lane and drives parallel to the SWOOSHING traffic, a look of grim determination on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He passes a sign that reads, "Atlanta, 23 Miles."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MOTEL PLAYGROUND - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's quiet. An empty children's playground sits near the motel, lit by a single streetlamp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl lies on a platform swing, rocking back and forth, smoking a cigarette, staring up at the stars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at her wedding ring, jiggles it with her thumb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN the WHINE of a moped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard pulls into parking lot of a large chain hotel. A marquee out front reads, "Life/Styles Expo. Welcome!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard comes in a side exit and strides down a long, carpeted hallway. Empty conference rooms line the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside each conference room is an easel with a foam board mock-up of a self-help book cover. Richard walks past face after face of aspiring self-help gurus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard -- windblown, still in shorts and sneakers -- strides into a well-appointed lobby. A female CONCIERGE is on late- night duty. He walks to a courtesy phone, picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stan Grossman, please. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Through the receiver, we hear RINGING. Then VOICE-MAIL.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_MAIL>
<DIRECTION>
(via phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The hotel guest you're calling is not available. Please leave a message at the tone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_MAIL>
<DIRECTION>
BEEP.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stan, it's Richard...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(at a loss)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know where the fuck you are. I'm at your hotel. Call me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up and looks around, exasperated. He takes out his cell phone and dials. He puts the phone to his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the phone RINGS in his ear, we hear the synchronized BLEATING of a cell phone from the hotel bar nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It takes Richard a second to make the connection. He turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the bar/lounge, a boisterous group of CORPORATE TYPES -- prosperously attired men, meticulously groomed women -- are seated around a booth, drinking and laughing together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holding court is Stan Grossman, a swarthy mid-3Os go-getter wearing khakis, loafers, and a cashmere V-neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard watches as Stan pulls out his cell phone, checks the caller ID, shakes his head, puts the phone away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard -- phone in his ear -- walks over and stands behind Stan Grossman, staring down at him. The Corporate Types stop laughing. Stan turns, looks up at Richard. Richard smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Stan!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard and Stan argue next to a dumpster in the parking lot behind the hotel. Richard's borrowed moped is parked nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said it would sell...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<STAN_GROSSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I thought! At the time!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN_GROSSMAN>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it's a great program! You said yourself! I don't understand...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<STAN_GROSSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not the program, Richard, it's you, okay? No one's heard of you. Nobody cares.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN_GROSSMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Richard exhales, shakes his head, gathers himself.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's the next step?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<STAN_GROSSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is none. We had our shot. It didn't fly. We move on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN_GROSSMAN>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean give up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<STAN_GROSSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richard...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN_GROSSMAN>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One set back, you're ready to quit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<STAN_GROSSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richard, listen -- I pushed this thing hard, okay? I rammed it down their fucking throats, all right? No one bought it. Now, I know the market. It's time to move on. You're not gonna win this one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN_GROSSMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Richard stares at Stan, absorbing this. Then he speaks with a strained nonchalance, nodding and smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay...! Good! I'm glad. You know why? This is what the Nine Steps are all about...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<STAN_GROSSMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richard! Jesus...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STAN_GROSSMAN>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You blew it, Stan. You're out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Richard turns and walks off. Stan can't believe it. He watches Richard, shakes his head and re-enters the hotel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard strides to the moped, looks both ways, climbs on and pedals furiously. The moped sputters to life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard, grim, rides his borrowed moped along the breakdown lane as cars and trucks ROAR past him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is -- hands down -- the worst moment of his life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then there's a FLASH of lightning and a CLAP of thunder. It starts to rain. Richard keeps riding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A darkened motel room. We hear the WHINE of the moped as it pulls into the parking lot and up to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and Richard -- dazed, soaking wet -- steps in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He closes the door behind him, walks over, lies on the bed -- fully clothed -- and stares up at the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl, sleeping, wakes up and sees Richard.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Y'okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
He nods. Sheryl rubs his arm, rolls over, goes back to sleep. Richard stares up at the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>

FADE TO BLACK

INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard opens his eyes. Olive is standing next to the bed. The blue light of dawn is coming through the windows.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it, hon...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grandpa won't wake up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
Richard takes this in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AMBULANCE ROOF - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are behind the lights of an ambulance as it speeds down a commercial strip. The LIGHTS FLASH and SIREN BLARES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL WAITING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone sits silently in a waiting room, waiting for news.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olive, bored, goes through a rack of medical flyers. She takes one and approaches Dwayne.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to take an eye test?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Dwayne shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uncle Frank? You want to take an eye test?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Olive, come here. Put that away. We're gonna have a family meeting. Dwayne? Family meeting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richard...! Let's just do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a breath. She turns to the kids.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First of all, the doctors are doing everything they can to help Grandpa right now. He's had a long...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(searches for words)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...eventful life, and I know he loves both of you very much. But if God wants to take him, we have to be ready to accept that, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(they nod)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, I think you guys know we've been having money problems lately, with Richard's venture and everything... Things haven't really gone the way we hoped. So it looks like when we get home we might have to make some changes in the way we live. We might have to move out of our house. We might have to declare bankruptcy. I don't know. I have to talk to a lawyer about all that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at Richard, the kids. Her voice becomes shaky.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But whatever happens -- we're a family. What's important is that we love each other. I love you guys so, so, so much...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
She turns away, starts to cry. Frank puts his hand on her shoulder. Sheryl grasps it. Olive and Dwayne watch Sheryl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne writes a note, shows it to Olive. It reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"Go hug Mom!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olive goes and hugs Sheryl. Sheryl, crying, picks up Olive and holds her in her lap, hugging her. Dwayne gets up, goes across the waiting room and stares out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUT THE WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A second floor view. It's a banal suburban landscape. Cars go busily back and forth on a distant road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne just stares out the window with a blank face. Behind him, a DOCTOR enters the waiting area.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you the family of Edwin Harvey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone is gathered in a smaller room. The Doctor closes the door behind him. He turns to face them.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. We did everything we could. He was... It was too much. He probably fell asleep and never woke up. I'll have someone come talk about handling the remains.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. Appreciate it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
The Doctor opens the door and calls down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Linda...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
He gestures, then departs. Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is Grandpa dead?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, honey. He's passed away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Olive nods, says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hospital administrator, LINDA, comes in with a sheaf of papers. She is overburdened and all business.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm your bereavement liaison, Linda. My consolations for your loss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Linda.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Linda hands Richard her sheaf of paperwork.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
(fast, indifferent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. These are the forms you need to fill out -- death certificate, report of death and the M.E. pink slip. Try and be as detailed as possible. This is a brochure for our Grief Recovery Support Group that meets Tuesdays. If you'd like, I can refer you at this time to a funeral home so you can begin making arrangements.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
Richard and Sheryl glance at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um, actually, pre-arrangements have been made with a home in Maryland.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In Maryland...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, we're passing through. Y'see, we're trying to get to Boca Raton...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay -- if the body is crossing state lines? You're gonna need a Burial Transit Permit from the County Registrar...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, fine, but here's the thing -- we're trying to get to Boca Raton by three o'clock this afternoon...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three o'clock? Today?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(checks her watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That ain't gonna happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's for my daughter. This is really important.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It may be important, but you still have to fill out this paperwork.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I know this is unusual... Is there a way we can go and come back? I mean, can we do paperwork later?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't abandon the body...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not gonna abandon the body. I just want to go and come back. We just need to get to Boca and then we'll back! We'll come back!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Otherwise the hospital
	</DIALOGUE>
<becomes_responsible_Sir>
	<DIALOGUE>
	there's a way these things need to be done. Sir? come Sir...? Sir!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, this may surprise you, but you're not the only one who's had someone die here today, all right?! Now we have a way of doing things around here, and I'm gonna ask you to respect our rules and procedures!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Richard stares at the floor, seething. A pause. Richard speaks with great restraint.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you...? Is there a way we could view the remains?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
(nods, also restrained)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll show you, yes. We haven't had a chance to move him downstairs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<DIRECTION>
She leads them out.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Linda stops in front of an intensive care room.
</DIRECTION>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's in here. Now someone may come by in a few minutes to take him to the basement, but just tell them who you are. They'll wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDA>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<LINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you're done with the paperwork I'll be in the nurse's station.
	</DIALOGUE>

	Okay. Great. Thank you, Linda.

</RICHARD>

She departs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. INTENSIVE CARE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They enter. It's quiet. There's a body under a sheet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard walks over and peers under it, then puts it down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns away and faces the wall. He starts hyperventilating -- choking down the emotion. He doesn't want to lose control, and he's not comfortable showing his feelings.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
(under his breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn it, Dad. Goddamn it,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stupid, stupid, stupid...!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes his head and takes a few sharp breaths, getting himself under control -- still facing the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl hugs Olive, stroking her hair. Olive is dry-eyed -- this is all new to her. Sheryl bends down and whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll do Little Miss Sunshine next year. Okay, honey? Next year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Olive nods. No one says anything. Finally, Richard turns around. He is very determined.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. We've come seven hundred miles. I'll be damned if I'm not making that contest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey... We can't leave him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not going to leave him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Richard dumps the paperwork in a wastebasket. He opens the door, glances into the hallway. He closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
He looks desperately around the room. He sees the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to the window, opens it up.
</DIRECTION>

Richard peers out the window. He's at the back side of the building, seven or eight feet above a near-empty parking lot.

<DIRECTION>
INT. INTENSIVE CARE ROOM - DAY

Richard ducks back in. He tosses his car keys to Dwayne.

<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>

	No, Richard. No. That's not going to happen.

	We'll be there in two hours! I'll have a funeral home meet us as soon as we arrive!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(never say die:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, everyone. If there's one thing Grandpa would've wanted, it's to have Olive perform at the Little Miss Sunshine pageant. I believe we'd be doing a grave disservice to his memory if we gave up now. There's two kinds of people in the world; winners and losers. And what's the difference? Winners don't give up. So what are we here? Are we winners? Or losers?

Frank, Dwayne, Sheryl and Olive stand under the window, trying to look inconspicuous. Frank gestures -- Wait.

Across the lot, two NURSES stroll toward the hospital.

Richard disappears for a second, then reappears with a big bundle wrapped in a sheet. He hoists it into the window.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Careful... Careful...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
He edges the bundle off the window ledge. Frank and Dwayne gently lower the bundle to the ground. They glance around.

<FRANK>

	Okay! Here we go! One, two...

Frank, Dwayne, Sheryl and Olive lift the bundle together and scuttle across the parking lot to the VW bus fifty feet away.

An ELDERLY COUPLE walking fifty yards away observes them.

Dwayne whips open the VW's back door (a hatchback that hides your luggage) and they hoist the bundle in. Frank slams the door closed. Richard comes sprinting into the parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, let's roll! You ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any time, Rich!

Richard starts up the bus, gets out and helps them push.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They get the bus rolling. The lot is at a slight incline, which helps. Finally, Richard jumps behind the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I'm putting it into gear...!

Sheryl and Olive jump in the side door.

<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I mention I'm the pre-eminent Proust scholar in the US?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Richard REVS the engine and puts it in third. The bus begins picking up speed. Dwayne and Frank sprint along side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This time, Dwayne is prepared to push Frank up along-side the bus. Frank lunges in. Dwayne jumps in after him.

Dwayne slides the door shut. They're giddy and breathless from the escape. They quickly sober up.

Olive is thinking.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad? What's gonna happen to Grandpa?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, as soon as we get to Florida, I'm gonna call a funeral home in Maryland and they'll take care of everything. Your Grandpa was smart and planned ahead. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Olive nods. That's not really what she was asking about. Sheryl sees this.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, Grandpa's soul is in Heaven now. He's with God. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>

Olive nods. She turns and looks out the window.

The passing landscape of the road leading back to the Interstate. It seems a long way from God.

The dialogue below plays over the following shots.

<DIRECTION>
The family drives in silence, each looking out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard drives -- stoic, determined.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl is pensive. She sneaks glances at Richard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank, subdued, watches Sheryl. He rubs Olive on the head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olive, headphones around her neck, stares out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne lies across the back seat, staring up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DWAYNE'S POV Passing power lines undulate against the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the back, we see the highway passing as each person is lost in a reverie.
</DIRECTION>

Sheryl, in the front, looks at Richard, reaches over and rubs Richard's neck. Richard glances at her, keeps driving.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's an excellent question, Olive. Actually, the Hindus believe that you get as many lives as you want. Buddhists believe that you live many lives but at a certain point you reach Nirvana and cross the finish line. Christians believe you only get one life -- they don't believe in do-overs.

They are cruising. Olive has her headphones back on, though she's not bouncing anymore -- just nodding her head. Sheryl points to a passing sign, "Boca Raton -- 61 Miles."
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>

	Sixty one miles. What time is it?

A car cuts in front of him. He brakes.

	Look out! Asshole!

He HONKS the horn loudly at the guy.
</DIRECTION>

	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He cut me off!

The horn keeps HONKING intermittently.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. You can stop now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not me! This thing is stuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to pull the horn button up. Instead, he gets a long continuous HOOOONK. He lets go. It stops.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, just leave it...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Then a HONK. Another silence. HONK, HONK.

She tries to lift up another part. HOOOOONK. She stops.

</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>

Silence. HONK! Silence. HONK! HONK! Silence. Dwayne puts his head in his hands. He can't stand it.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many days 'til you enlist?

Dwayne pulls out his pad and writes. He shows it:

<DIRECTION>
Frank contemplates this.

He pulls onto the breakdown lane and stops. The HORN continues HONKING intermittently. The Trooper, a 50-ish good ol' boy, gets out and approaches.

Richard ignores him.

Richard shuts up. The Trooper sees him glance at the trunk.
</DIRECTION>
<TROOPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have something in your trunk?

</TROOPER>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Nothing! There's nothing. It's just... Don't open it.

</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
The Trooper is incredulous.
</DIRECTION>
<TROOPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, you realize you've just given me probable cause to search your trunk? Put your hands on top of your vehicle. Now don't move.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TROOPER>

He shakes his head and walks back towards the trunk,

<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please! It's not illegal, it's...

</RICHARD>
<TROOPER>
	<DIALOGUE>

The Trooper opens the trunk.

<TROOPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa! Goddamn!!!

Richard opens his eyes, shakes his head -- this is the end.

<TROOPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, would you come here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TROOPER>
<DIRECTION>
Richard walks back. The Trooper bends down behind the bus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rounding the corner, Richard sees the Trooper picking up Grandpa's porn magazines, which have spilled onto the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bundled sheet sits in plain sight. The Trooper, distracted, gathers the magazines and stands. He grins.
</DIRECTION>
<TROOPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, I ain't gonna bust you.

He looks in the bus, smiles and waves at Sheryl and Olive.

The Trooper tidies the magazines and, grinning, shuffles through them with a connoisseur's eye -- Swank, High Society, Black Tail. The next magazine: Honcho.
</DIRECTION>

A beefy, moustached stud gazes smolderingly from the cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Trooper stops grinning. He looks at Richard. Richard shrugs and laughs nervously.

They are cruising. The horn HONKS in occasional spurts. Everyone ignores it. Olive plays with an eye chart she got at the hospital. She points at a diminishing set of "E"s.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne is in the back seat, holding a hand over one eye and pointing his finger up, down, or sideways to correspond to the rotation of the "E". Dwayne makes it through the chart.

In the back, Olive pulls out a new flyer.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, now I'm gonna test if you're colorblind. What letter is in the circle?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
She holds up a chart with a green circle. Inside the circle, in a mosaic pattern, is a bright red letter "A". Dwayne makes a gesture, "There's nothing there."
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, inside the circle! Right there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne shakes his head again. Olive glances at Frank.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's an "A"! Can't you see it?! It's red! See? Right there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne takes the chart and stares at it.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't see the "A"? It's bright red. Can you see the difference between the green and the red?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne shakes his head helplessly. Frank turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne looks at him. He pulls out his pad and writes:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"What?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank doesn't say anything. Dwayne points violently at the pad. Frank looks at him. Quietly:
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dwayne. I think you're colorblind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne doesn't understand. He points at the pad again.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't fly jets in the Navy if you're colorblind.

Dwayne does nothing. Then he seems to implode in on himself, curling up in a ball. Frank shouts towards the front.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bus pulls into the break-down lane beside the highway.

The door slides open and Dwayne gets out onto the grassy slope by the side of the road. He walks off with his head in his hands. This is the first time we've heard his voice.

<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Jesus. Oh, no.

</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Thirty yards away Dwayne falls to his knees, buries his hands and face in the grass, and SHRIEKS like a wild animal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's an out-of-control quality to his behavior that is scary and disturbing. Finally, Dwayne rolls to a sitting position, his hands covering his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits there crying. The others don't know what to do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard glances at Sheryl. He points at his watch and shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's give him a second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
In the background, the VW keeps HONKING like some demonic beast -- mocking Dwayne's helplessness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, Sheryl approaches Dwayne.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dwayne? Honey? I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
He says nothing. She sighs.

</DWAYNE>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dwayne... For better or worse: we're your family...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne stands up and screams at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not my family! I don't want to be your family! I hate you fucking people! I hate you!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he points at them)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Divorce! Bankrupt! Suicide! You're losers! You're fucking losers!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone is stunned by this outburst. Dwayne puts his hands over his eyes and sits down again.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just leave me, Mom. Please? Just leave me here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl gets up and walks back to the others.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're gonna be late. Can we leave somebody here with him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll stay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, we're not doing that.

</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Olive, you want to talk to him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Richard. There's nothing to say. We just have to wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Then Olive walks over and sits down next to Dwayne.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne's face is red and snot is dribbling from his nose. He has a piece of straw and he's poking some ants in the grass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She puts her arm on his shoulder and watches him poke. The ants climb busily over the grass. They sit quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Dwayne stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
He walks back to the others. His voice is automatic.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I apologize for the things I said. I was upset. I didn't really mean them.

(to Dwayne)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay. Let's just go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
They all start pushing the bus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VW BUS - ON THE ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard is weaving through traffic -- the engine's REVVING VERY HIGH. Richard, Sheryl, Olive, and Frank are looking ahead intently. Dwayne is slouched in the back, staring at "nothing. The horn has tapered off to an occasional HONK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank checks his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	2:50...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're gonna make it! Olive, don't worry! We'll be on time!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
JUMP TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same. Frank checks his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	2:55!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just look for the exit! It's coming up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
JUMP TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The same. Frank checks his watch again.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	2:58!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
No one says anything. Then Richard points.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There! That's it! Can anyone see a Holiday Inn?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Olive points.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There! Little Miss Sunshine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
As they ride up the exit ramp, the sign in front of the Holiday Inn reads, "Little Miss Sunshine."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard comes off the ramp onto a four lane commercial road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a maze of service roads and parking lots between him and the Holiday Inn. Richard is baffled.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How the fuck do you get over there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn here! Turn here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Richard takes a right into a service road.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you slow down?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't! I'm in third gear!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	2:59PM!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does anyone see a turn-off? How the fuck do you get over there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
They drive past the Holiday Inn -- a few hundred yards away.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad! You drove past it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no place to turn in!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn around! You gotta turn around!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, hold on, everybody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
The VW screeches around in a wide arc across four lanes of (luckily empty) traffic. Richard guns the under-revving engine. They again drive past the distant Holiday Inn.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can anyone see a way in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go over there, then cut across!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, hold on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
The VW squeals around a left turn onto another service road,
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no way in! What the fuck?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad! You're driving past it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There! Into the parking lot!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
She points. Richard turns into an enormous empty parking lot. He drives towards the Holiday inn in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's still no clear path on how to get there.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a dead end!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, go over there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the same! There's no way...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
He turns the wheel and they begin tracing a wide loop -- bombing around the parking lot at 35mph in a holding pattern.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three o'clock!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go back out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We tried that! There's no way in!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So we just keep going in circles?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Richard says nothing. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay: Hold on, everybody! Olive, put your seat belt on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
He comes out of a wide arc and heads straight for the median strips separating him from the Holiday Inn.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on, everyone!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
He guns it. As soon as he hits the first median, the HORN goes off and doesn't stop. They're in a new parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Richard goes SCREECHING past several parked cars. They're one median strip away from the Holiday Inn parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One more! Here we go! Hold on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
They hit the median hard. A big bump. They've made it into the Holiday Inn parking lot. The whole van sags to the rear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank looks out the rear window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tire is wheeling off across the parking lot by itself.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We lost a tire, Rich!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll get it later! Here we go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
They come gliding into a parking space, HORN BLARING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank yanks open the sliding door. It slides back, slams into the end of the track and derails. The whole door falls off the side of the van and into the parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank doesn't even look back. He sprints across the lot towards a distant banner marked "Little Miss Sunshine."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the others -- except Dwayne -- sprint after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REGISTRATION HALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A big carpeted hotel lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors open and Frank comes in, breathless. He stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is crawling with tiny blond girls and their stressed mothers. The girls are dressed, coifed and made-up to within an inch of their life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nearby, a CONTEST OFFICIAL is packing up her things behind a table with a "Registration" banner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank sprints up to her. The others catch up and stand, looking on -- desperate, disheveled, breathing hard.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, we're here to register!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, we're closed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICIAL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we have an entrant. Right here. We just need to check in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Registration ended at three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICIAL>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's three now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICIAL>
<DIRECTION>
She points to a clock on the wall. It's 3:04PM,
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, have a heart! We're four minutes late! We just drove all the way from Maryland...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you should have been here by three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICIAL>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to leave. Richard stops her.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, wait, wait! How can we make this work?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone else was here before three. I'd be giving unfair advantage...
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICIAL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not asking for an advantage! We just want to compete!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't yell at me, sir. I didn't make you late. We've settled on the schedule of the show and we've turned off our computers. Now the show starts in twenty minutes, I have a hair check to do, I'm sorry you're late, but I can't help you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICIAL>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to leave but they block her way. Richard gets on his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please! You don't know what we've been through...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SOUND_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, Ms. Jenkins...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOUND_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
They all turn. There's a SOUND GUY -- a very portly young man with a high voice -- who's clearly just heard the story.
</DIRECTION>
<SOUND_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can put 'em in the system.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOUND_GUY>
<OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Kirby, you don't have to!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICIAL>
<KIRBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's okay. It's five minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRBY>
<OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... It's your time. 'Scuse me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICIAL>
<DIRECTION>
She pushes past them. Frank leaps up.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello! Everyone?! We've just witnessed a great act of compassion and human kindness! Exhibit A: we've got Eva Braun here -- making the trains run on time, and B: Kirby! My man! Currently the greatest human being on the planet! Applause, please!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
He leads the others in applause. Everyone else in the lobby ignores them. Kirby smiles, flips on the computer. They crowd around.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you so much! You don't know what this means...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<KIRBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. It's five minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRBY>
<DIRECTION>
He glances in the direction of the Official, who has departed, and shakes his head. Quietly:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ain't working for these people again. These people are crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Olive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what's your name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRBY>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Olive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<KIRBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Olive. That's a nice name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRBY>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles. He starts tapping away at the computer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olive glances away and freezes. Across the room is Miss Florida, sitting behind a table, signing photos for kids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olive is in awe.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom! It's Miss Florida! Look! It's really her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to say hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Olive shakes her head, intimidated -- it's like meeting a god.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, she looks nice. We'll just say hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Richard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Richard nods -- I'll take care of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl drags Olive to the back of the line -- a half a dozen girls and their mothers. The GIRL in front of them turns and stares at Olive -- sizing up the competition. Olive smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
The Girl quickly turns back around, not saying anything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olive takes this in stride. Frank and Dwayne approach, carrying the family's luggage and a Sunday NY Times.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. I'm getting a room. We'll set up a base camp.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, we'll come find you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Frank and Dwayne walk off. Olive watches them go, then turns and looks at the other girls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again, they're all miniature Barbies with expensive clothes and hair. All of them are several inches shorter than Olive, who is still dressed in her traveling clothes -- denim cut- offs and black Converse high-tops. She stands out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two TWIN GIRLS are chasing each other around, giggling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olive watches. Eventually, the Twins see Olive watching them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They whisper to each other and giggle. Olive gives them a friendly half-smile. Finally, the Twin Girls approach Olive.
</DIRECTION>
<TWIN_GIRL_ONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you on a diet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWIN_GIRL_ONE>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<TWIN_GIRL_ONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you on a diet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWIN_GIRL_ONE>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<TWIN_GIRL_TWO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't think so!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TWIN_GIRL_TWO>
<DIRECTION>
They dissolve into giggles and run away. Olive is disturbed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl is steamed but doesn't know what to do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS THE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirby finishes up with Richard -- having him sign a release.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And sign...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Richard signs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...And you're done! Here's your receipt; tickets; sash; tiara. Anything else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRBY>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Is there a funeral home around here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOLIDAY INN ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A quiet, empty room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank and Dwayne enter, dropping the luggage on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne immediately walks to a bed in the corner of the room and lies facing the wall. Frank surveys the room with a jaundiced eye. He walks over, peers out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank turns, looks at Dwayne lying on the bed. He walks over, settles into a chair, pulls out his NY Times.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you know, facing the wall like that...? There's no way you gonna stop me from killing myself. No way! I could be out the window before you even turn around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. He opens up a Sunday New York Times.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at Dwayne for a few beats, then shakes his head and opens up the Book Review section.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BOOK REVIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is a full-page ad for Understanding Proust by Larry Sugarman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A banner reads, "The Surprise Bestseller from America's # 1 Proust Scholar!" There's a photo of Larry Sugarman, in a beard and glasses, looking very serious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank stares at the ad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOLIDAY INN BALCONY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank opens a sliding door and steps on to the tiny balcony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks to the edge and looks over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's eight floors down to the parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank considers the drop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he pulls out his wallet and takes out the photograph.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE PHOTO shows Frank and the Young Man from the convenience store at some chic party, wearing tuxes, smiling, and drinking Champagne.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank stares at the photo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up and surveys his surroundings -- a rather grim landscape of Burger Kings and Jiffy Lubes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quietly, he puts the photo away and turns back to the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard approaches the VW bus with two funeral home WORKERS in jumpsuits who affect a bored, seen-it-all demeanor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WORKER ONE, 40s, is an old pro. WORKER TWO, 20s, is a fresh- faced rookie. A FUNERAL HOME VAN is parked in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...We're driving five, six hours -- we thought he was napping. By the time we figured it out it was too late.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<WORKER_ONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Too late. So where's the body?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WORKER_ONE>
<DIRECTION>
Richard turns, pops the trunk, averts his eyes, and opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Workers look in the trunk. Then look at Richard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

But Olive is not quite ready to move on.

<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ummm... Miss Florida?

</OLIVE>
<MISS_FLORIDA>
	<DIALOGUE>

</OLIVE>
<MISS_FLORIDA>
<DIRECTION>
(perplexed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes! I love ice cream! My favorite flavor is Chocolate Cherry Garcia. Although, technically, I think that's a frozen yogurt. Okay?

</MISS_FLORIDA>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, thank you, Bonnie! Bye!

EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard signs an invoice. Worker Two closes the rear doors of the van, climbs in the driver's seat and starts the engine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard hands the clipboard to Worker One. He hands Richard a cardboard box containing a wallet, glasses, a keychain, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<WORKER_ONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The personal effects...

</WORKER_ONE>
<RICHARD>

<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You too. Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Worker One gets in the van and slams the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The van pulls out, drives to the edge of the parking lot and puts on its turn signal. Richard watches. The van pulls into the street and drives off, disappearing into traffic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard is left alone, holding the box of Grandpa's stuff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOLIDAY INN ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl and Olive enter. Dwayne is still on the bed facing the wall. Frank is slumped in a chair, staring at nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank...? How're you guys doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl silently points at Dwayne. Frank shrugs. Sheryl goes and starts opening luggage. She pulls out a bathing suit.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Olive. Let's put on your swimsuit. Here. You want to change in the bathroom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Olive takes the swim-suit and goes into the bathroom. Sheryl begins gathering up Olive's costumes.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dwayne, I know you hate all of us and want to kill yourself. But since we're here anyway, why don't you guys go to the beach?

<DIRECTION>
INT. HOLIDAY INN BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olive finishes putting on her swim-suit. There's a full-length mirror on the back of the bathroom door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olive turns around and reaches for the door knob. She stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She steps back and looks at herself in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns sideways. She sucks her stomach in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is the first time she's ever done this.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

She's not happy with what she sees -- also the first time.

<DIRECTION>
(to Frank)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank, do your best!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
They exit. A beat. Dwayne sits up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's depressed, but no longer catatonic. He looks at Frank.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get out of here.

</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOBBY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard -- holding the box of Grandpa's stuff -- finds a bench and sits down. He seems shaken,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Around him, the pre-pageant hubbub is at a fever pitch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He flips through Grandpa's stuff -- keys, glasses, gum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up and surveys the frenetic activity -- mothers combing their daughters' hair, little girls practicing ballet moves, girls crying, girls laughing and chasing each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, across the lobby, the elevator doors open and Sheryl and Olive step off carrying garment bags and travel cases.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard gets up and intercepts them. Sheryl sees him coming.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. D'you take care of...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I did. Wait a sec. Olive, come here. Time for a pep talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richard, we're late already...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is important! Olive, come here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to him. He hunches down, takes her hand, searching for words as if the very meaning of his life were at stake.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Olive... I know you and Grandpa worked on this together. I know how much it meant to him. We drove nine hundred miles to get here. Our car broke down. We've been through a lot. But I think it'd all be worth it... if you won tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Richard! Jesus! Olive, come on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to pull Olive away but Richard holds on to her.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Olive? Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Olive stares. She really wants to please him. She nods.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good girl! Go knock 'em dead!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl shakes her head and pulls Olive off towards the backstage area. Richard watches them go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BACKSTAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl and Olive wander past one little girl after another -- each being primped to perfection by her Mom or a Groomer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DRESSING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl finds a tiny empty dressing room in back and hangs a garment bag of Olive's costumes on the door.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, we have about one minute. You want to do hair or make-up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Olive thinks. It's like the fate of the free world is at stake. Finally?
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make-up...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
Kirby pokes his head in the door,
</DIRECTION>
<KIRBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. I need your music!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRBY>
<DIRECTION>
Olive goes to her bag, digs in, hands him a disc.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<KIRBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This? Did you choose this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRBY>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My Grandpa did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<KIRBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your Grandpa? What track?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRBY>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twelve. Oh, one thing...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
She glances at Sheryl, then goes and whispers in Kirby's ear. Kirby smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, you got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRBY>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Kirby!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<KIRBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be looking for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRBY>
<DIRECTION>
He departs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard finds his reserved seats -- four seats on the aisle. He sits in the fourth seat and lays his jacket across the other three, saving them for Sheryl, Dwayne, and Frank,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guy next to him is a grizzled BIKER sitting impassively with his arms folded. Richard tries to be friendly.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
The Biker glances at him and nods. Richard persists.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got a kid in the show?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
The Biker looks at him. He takes an earplug out of his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<BIKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIKER>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got a kid in the show?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
The Biker stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<BIKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIKER>
<DIRECTION>
Richard nods -- Yeah! The Biker nods -- Figures. He puts the earplug back in his ear and resumes his impassive stare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard is unnerved. The LIGHTS DIM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Onstage, an MC steps up to a microphone. A DRUMROLL.
</DIRECTION>
<MC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the 14th annual Little Miss Sunshine pageant! Let's welcome the contestants!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MC>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC. Big APPLAUSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Twenty-five little girls parade out on stage in swim-suits. Twenty of them are blond -- some bleached. They've been arranged from shortest to tallest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olive -- at least two inches taller than everyone else -- is at the end of the line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girls parade around in a loop, waving and smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They end up in a line running across the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<MC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have twenty five contestants from all over the State of Florida. At the end of the evening, one of these girls will be crowned Little Miss Sunshine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MC>
<DIRECTION>
Richard, in the audience, claps enthusiastically. The Biker claps without enthusiasm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A glorious, sunny day. The ocean stretches out to infinity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne and Frank, in swim trunks, are at a surfboard rental shop on the beach. The ocean's dead calm. Frank is handing money to a DUDE at the shop. Dwayne looks out at the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no waves, Frank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't need waves. We'll just paddle out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MC is up on the stage. Another DRUMROLL.
</DIRECTION>
<MC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Let's hear a big round of applause for the evening wear!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MC>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC. Big APPLAUSE. The same girls -- in precocious evening- wear -- come out in the same order and do the same little loop around the stage. Olive's on the end again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard, in the crowd, applauds -- a little less heartily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ON THE WATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank and Dwayne paddle straight out into the ocean. It's calm, but the shore is a long way away. Dwayne looks back.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How far are we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dunno. Quarter mile?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanna stop?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Frank shrugs. They stop. Frank looks down into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. Think you can touch bottom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How far is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must be ten, twelve feet. Come on! Y'ready? On your mark, get set...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
They dive down into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's about fifteen feet to the white sand on the bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne swims all the way down to the bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank swims down more slowly. He finally makes it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comically mimes that he's drowning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he and Dwayne come back up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ON THE WATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They resurface.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Victory! Yes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
They rest on their surfboards, breathing hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, without waiting, Dwayne dives down in the water again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UNDERWATER - DAY - MONTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shots of Frank and Dwayne swimming in the blue water with white sand and shafts of sunlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They do flips, twists, spins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne swims down to the bottom again. He stays, looking up at the surface, Frank's legs, his empty board, the sunlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he swims back up to the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MC is up on stage. Another DRUMROLL.
</DIRECTION>
<MC>

	And now! The moment you've been waiting for! The talent competition! Ladies and gentleman, please welcome Amber Tiffany Harper, who'll be singing a tune from the Broadway show, "Annie." Amber...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MC>
<DIRECTION>
A little girl walks out -- very stagy -- and begins
</DIRECTION>
<AMBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"The sun'll come out... tomorrow..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMBER>
<DIRECTION>
Richard sits in the audience. He's growing uneasy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ON THE WATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They sit on their boards and look out to sea.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, it's beautiful out here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know if I believe in God, but the ocean -- it's always here for you: infinitely bigger than you are, and completely indifferent. So... My version of God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Frank looks over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd it feel like when you cut your wrists?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Frank takes a breath.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I wish I could tell you I felt bad. But I didn't. I was... Outside the world, y'know? It was very peaceful.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, I'm feeling that way now, too, so...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
He shrugs. Dwayne nods. He looks out to sea.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes I wish I could just go to sleep until I was eighteen. Just skip all this crap -- high school and everything. Just skip it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Y'ever hear of Marcel Proust?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's the guy you teach?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. French writer. Total loser. Never had a real job. Unrequited love affairs. Gay. Spent twenty years writing a book almost no one reads. But... he was also probably the greatest writer since Shakespeare. Anyway, he gets down to the end of his life, he looks back and he decides that all the years he suffered -- those were the best years of his life. Because they made him who he was. They forced him to think and grow, and to feel very deeply. And the years he was happy? Total waste. Didn't learn anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne grins.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, if you sleep til you're eighteen...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(scoffs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Think of the suffering you'd miss! High school's your prime suffering years. You don't get better suffering than that! Unless you go into academia, but that's a different story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
They share a smile. Dwayne gazes out to sea. A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Frank looks over)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck beauty contests. It's like life is one fucking beauty contest after another these days. School, then college, then work. Fuck it. Fuck the Naval Academy. Fuck the MacArthur Foundation. If I want to fly, I'll find a way to fly. You do what you love and fuck the rest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Frank stares at Dwayne, impressed. Dwayne glances at Frank, who tries to play it cool.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad you're talking again, Dwayne. You're not nearly as stupid as you look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne smiles. Frank looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So now what do we do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got me, Frank. Maybe we can stay out here forever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. They look at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We should go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
They begin paddling back to shore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tiny girl in a COWGIRL outfit -- smiling like crazy -- taps her way through a tap-dance routine. She's fantastic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard's smile is fading. He's really starting to worry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOARDWALK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank exits a T-shirt shop and throws a shirt to Dwayne.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe we found these. I hope they fit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
As they stride up the boardwalk, he strips off his shirt and puts on his new T-shirt. In big block letters, it says:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"LOSER"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne puts on his. It's the same. Frank looks at him.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're every mother's dream, Dwayne. Come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
They head off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another TINY BLONDE GIRL sings while flouncing and prancing across the stage, blowing kisses and twirling a parasol.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She skips around the MC, flirting and batting her eyes,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The audience -- charmed -- starts clapping along. As she finishes, the audience rises as one in a standing ovation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard is the only one to remain seated. His face sinks as reality finally hits him -- there's no way Olive will win.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HE GETS UP AND DEPARTS,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOBBY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank and Dwayne enter and stride towards the doors of the auditorium. A pant-suited GRANDMA is sneaking a smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it over?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<GRANDMA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRANDMA>
<DIRECTION>
They open the door and walk into a BLAST of syrupy singing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door shuts. The door reopens. Frank and Dwayne stagger out. They look at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going backstage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. See ya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne heads off as Frank leans against a wall, recovering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BACKSTAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne strides through the backstage, looking for Sheryl and Olive. With his wet Mohawk and LOSER t-shirt, he stands out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PAGEANT OFFICER tries to stop him.
</DIRECTION>
<PAGEANT_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me? You authorized to be backstage?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAGEANT_OFFICER>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
He continues walking. Everywhere there are little blond girls crying, whining, or lolling about. All the mothers are over- dressed, over-coifed, and over-stressed. It's depressing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops, turns to a little PRINCESS slouched on a sofa.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. Where are the dressing rooms?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<PRINCESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you allowed to be here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRINCESS>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just tell me where the dressing rooms are.

<PRINCESS>

</PRINCESS>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne rolls his eyes, moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BACKSTAGE, DRESSING ROOMS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard wanders through the backstage. He spots Sheryl and Olive in a small dressing room in the back. He approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olive is sitting in a make-up chair, wearing gold hot pants and a red top. It's a slightly bizarre ensemble, given her girlish plumpness. Richard hesitates. Sheryl sees him.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. What're you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came to wish Olive good luck.

<DIRECTION>
(to Sheryl)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I talk to you a sec?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
She nods. They wander a few steps out of Olive's hearing range. Richard is agitated, troubled.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
(hesitates)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want Olive to go on.

</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
(can't believe it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you kidding...?!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not in Maryland anymore, all right? She's out of her league here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheryl...! She's not gonna win. There's no fucking way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't matter...!

</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It does matter!

<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't matter!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It does!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, all Richard's emotions rush to the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want her to lose. I know what that feels like. It's not good. We can't let that happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at him. It's the first time he's admitted to any kind of vulnerability or weakness. She takes his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They look at each other. This is the first honest moment we've seen between them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Unfortunately, they are interrupted by Dwayne, who enters -- a determined look on his face. Sheryl sees him coming.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. How're you feeling?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better. Where's Olive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the dressing room. What's up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DWAYNE>

(hesitates, then sotto)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want Olive doing this.

	Oh, my God...!

<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom, look around! This place is fucked! I don't want these people judging Olive! Fuck them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly! Fuck them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne glances at Richard, unnerved by his agreement.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Dwayne. It's too late...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not too late! You're the Mom! You're supposed to protect her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl stares at him. A clipboard-wielding, head-set wearing ASSISTANT passes by and calls out.
</DIRECTION>
<ASSISTANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Olive Harvey! Two minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASSISTANT>
<DIRECTION>
He walks on. They watch him go. Dwayne and Sheryl face off.

	She's not a beauty queen, Mom...

Olive stands near the doorway, listening. Her face betrays nothing. Dwayne's VOICE is faint but clear.

<DIRECTION>
Sheryl puts a hand on Dwayne's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...We can't take it away from her. We just can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne closes his eyes, hangs his head. Sheryl hugs him.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you want to protect her, but... We gotta let Olive be Olive. For better or worse...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
The clipboard-wielding ASSISTANT returns.
</DIRECTION>
<ASSISTANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Olive Harvey? Are you the Harveys?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASSISTANT>
<DIRECTION>
They nod and return -- en masse -- to the dressing room. Olive is seated in her chair, staring dumbly at the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Olive? Time to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Olive doesn't move. Sheryl goes to her.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Olive...? Honey, are you okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Olive won't look at her. Sheryl glances at Richard.
</DIRECTION>
<ASSISTANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Urn... We need to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASSISTANT>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hang on.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Olive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey...? Olive, look at me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Olive looks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to do this if you don't want. If you want to sit this one out, that's fine. We're proud of you anyway, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. The Assistant checks his watch,
</DIRECTION>
<ASSISTANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASSISTANT>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olive stands up. She walks to the Assistant.
</DIRECTION>
<ASSISTANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASSISTANT>
<DIRECTION>
He takes her hand. They stride off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne, Sheryl, and Richard stand together and watch -- mutually powerless -- as Olive is lead off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING BACKWARDS with Olive. She's got her game face on -- a mask of fear and determination. Sheryl calls after her.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good luck, honey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Olive keeps walking, not looking back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AUDITORIUM LOBBY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank re-enters. Dwayne and Sheryl are coming the other way.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is she going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's going on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<DIRECTION>
They enter the auditorium together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yet another LITTLE BLOND GIRL is onstage, taking her bows to polite APPLAUSE. Richard leads Sheryl, Dwayne, and Frank to their seats. The MC comes on stage.
</DIRECTION>
<MC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very nice. Thank you. Okay, you've been a patient audience tonight...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MC>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE WINGS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olive stands next to the edge of the curtain watching the MC.
</DIRECTION>
<MC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...We have one more contestant and then we'll be crowning the winner. So please welcome, from the Fort Myers district, Olive Harvey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MC>
<DIRECTION>
APPLAUSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE FOLLOW Olive out onto the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The LIGHTS are blinding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The AUDIENCE is hidden in darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a crowd MURMUR because of her hot-pants get-up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne, Frank, Sheryl, and Richard applaud nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard takes Sheryl's hand, squeezes it. They share a look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olive waves over the MC. He walks over to her and holds the mic down for her to speak. She takes a breath.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to dedicate this to my Grandpa, who helped me do this routine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<MC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's sweet! Is he here? Where's your Grandpa right now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MC>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's in the trunk of our car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
The MC doesn't know how to react.
</DIRECTION>
<MC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay! Well! Take it away, Olive!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MC>
<DIRECTION>
He retreats. She is alone on stage. Some 12 YEAR OLD BOYS in the audience decide to be cruel. One of them "moos".
</DIRECTION>
<BOY_ONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Moooo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY_ONE>
<DIRECTION>
GIGGLES and SHUSHES. Another boy chimes in.
</DIRECTION>
<BOY_TWO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Arf! Arf! Arf!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY_TWO>
<DIRECTION>
More GIGGLES and SHUSHES. Miss Florida, at the judges table by the stage, looks around sternly. She feels bad for Olive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olive is confused. She doesn't understand these noises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne hangs his head. Frank looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are those fuckers?! I'll kill 'em!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Then Olive finds what she's looking for:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirby, in the sound booth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He nods at her. She nods at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Olive turns around, her back to the audience.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirby turns a VOLUME knob up to "6". He hits "play" .
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music clearly depends on the rights. For specificity, we'll use "Peach" by Prince.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BLAST of hard rock 12 bar blues comes out of the speakers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone is surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music is hard-driving and nasty. It is completely different from the other pageant music we've heard so far.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For the first four measures, with Prince saying, "Here she comes," and "She got them gold hot-pants on again," Olive barely moves, rocking her shoulders and hips to the beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne, Frank, Sheryl, and Richard all glance at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is not what they expected.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No one knows what to make of Olive rocking, her back turned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
However, when the first verse begins, Olive turns and strides up the stage -- hands on hips, shoulders swinging -- with an absolute and spectacular physical self-confidence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She rocks out, busting crazy moves this stage has never seen: shakes, shimmies, twirls, dips, undulations -- a melange of MTV rump-shakin', Solid Gold Dancers re-runs, and out-of- left-field inventions of her own. Other moves are clearly drawn from Grandpa's sixty-year career of strip-bar patronage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She dances with a total command -- an exuberant, even witty mastery of her body, the music, the moves, everything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Most of all, she's doing it for herself -- for her own sense of fun -- and the judges are instantly irrelevant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The audience is stunned. No one moves. Mouths hang open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl, Frank, and Dwayne gape. Richard is baffled.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's she doing? What the hell is she doing?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
When the first verse ends, Olive punctuates the 12-bar vamp with a series of violent pelvic thrusts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone is totally shocked. No one knows how to react.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my God...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
Abruptly, Frank starts laughing in disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands and begins cheering Olive, pumping his fist and grooving to the music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard stares at Frank. Cautiously encouraged, he stands and cheers along with Frank -- tentative at first, then more and more unselfconsciously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl and Dwayne join in, relieved and amazed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grandpa was right -- she's blowing them out of the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the second verse ends and the guitar solo begins, Olive punctuates the vamp with another series of thrusts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is too much for the contest Official from the registration desk, who sits near the stage at the table of contest JUDGES, including Miss Florida. She looks around and spots Sheryl, Richard, Frank, et al, standing and cheering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Official gets up, walks up the aisle and yells at Sheryl.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is your daughter doing?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICAL>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl -- taken aback -- shrugs. Richard leans in.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's kicking ass, is what she's doing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
The others smile and nod. The Official is incensed. She turns and walks back to the sound booth. She yells at Kirby.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn it off!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICIAL>
<KIRBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRBY>
<OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn the music off!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICIAL>
<KIRBY>
<DIRECTION>
(fake deaf)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What...?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRBY>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles and cranks the music up to "8". Mothers and children in the audience clap their hands over their ears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The audience polarizes -- some (the Grizzled Biker; Miss Florida) stand and cheer while others sit dumbfound or frown disapprovingly, shaking their heads. Still others flee for the exit, heads down, hands over their ears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Official, furious, leaves Kirby and stalks down the aisle to the stage. Sheryl watches with growing worry.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERYL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's she doing? Look...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERYL>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes Richard, points.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Official goes to the MC -- at the side of the stage -- waves to him. He bends down, listens. He nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MC walks onstage and tries to stop Olive from dancing, grabbing her arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olive doesn't know what he's doing, but she won't let him break her routine. She wiggles away and keeps dancing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard -- outraged -- races to the front of the auditorium, leaps on the stage, jumps on the MC's back and rides him -- piggy-back -- into the wings. They crash to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olive stops dancing, turns and looks at Richard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard, grappling with the MC, waves her on.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep dancing, Honey! Just dance!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Olive turns and stares at the audience.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwayne, Frank and Sheryl are gesturing -- "Keep going!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olive -- hearing the music, seeing Sheryl, Frank, and Dwayne cheering her -- starts to dance again, fluid and relaxed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard disentangles himself from the pissed-off MC as STAGEHANDS step in and pull them apart. Richard shrugs off their restraining hands, then turns to watch Olive dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Contest Official steps forward and angrily confronts him.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get your daughter off stage now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICIAL>
<DIRECTION>
Richard -- taken aback -- hesitates. She presses him.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICIAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you don't stop her, she'll be disqualified!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICIAL>
<DIRECTION>
Richard stares at her. Then he nods.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and walks out on stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olive, seeing him, is confused. He steps up behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Richard starts dancing. They dance together: Olive in front, Richard backing her up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard looks at the Official with a defiant, fuck-you smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl, Frank and Dwayne, watching, can't believe it.
</DIRECTION>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(to Sheryl)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You married that guy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl shakes her head -- she can't believe it either.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank runs down the aisle, jumps on stage, and dances next to Richard -- a surprisingly competent set of butt-wagging, party-music moves. Dwayne follows Frank up on stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl pauses a moment and watches her family.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard waves to Sheryl to join them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Then Sheryl walks, then runs, and jumps up on stage. Richard helps her up, and they dance together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirby cranks it to "10". MUSIC is overpowering everything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the songs winds up, Sheryl lines up next to Olive for a unified series of thrusts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the final cymbal crashes, Olive pulls up her shirt to reveal "Peach" is written on her tummy with magic marker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Audience MEMBERS respond with a standing ovation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank and Dwayne strut around with their arms in the air, like victorious professional wrestlers,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard picks up Olive, swings her in the air. Sheryl walks over and hugs Richard and Olive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK AND SILENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard, Sheryl, Olive, Frank, and Dwayne sit -- dazed -- in a drab office. They're all handcuffed together, except Olive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing's happening. Flourescent lights HUM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank and Dwayne are still wearing their "LOSER" T-shirts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Boxes of pageant materials -- trophies, sashes, tiaras -- are stacked around them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl quietly eyes Richard, slouched next to her, and smiles to herself. Her eyes drift to a nearby carton of tiaras.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A door OPENS. They all look over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A COP appears, starts taking off their handcuffs.
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. You're out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're free?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're dropping charges. On the condition that you don't enter your child in a beauty contest in the State of Florida ever again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COP>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(hesitates)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we can live with that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOLIDAY INN LOBBY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard, Sheryl. Olive, Frank, and Dwayne step into the lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's deserted. Decorations and banners litter the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They wander out, dazed, rubbing their wrists.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheryl approaches Richard, takes a tiara from behind her back, places it on his head. Richard accepts it wryly.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. Thank you very much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles. Richard turns to Olive with the tiara.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here. I think this is for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
She struggles to articulate something. Finally, she shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just like dancing...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you were great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were beyond great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DWAYNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were incredible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWAYNE>
<OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
(shy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
They all smile at her. Then Richard looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get the fuck out of here...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO BLACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUNDS of cars on a distant highway.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...So it's two in the morning...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. REST STOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone is seated at a picnic table at a road-side rest stop. Cars WHIZZ by on a highway in the far background.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They've finished eating -- an empty bucket of KFC and bottles of Diet Sprite litter the table. Richard is telling a story.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone is relaxed -- smiling and listening.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...He's down on his knees in this dumpster behind the racetrack... And it starts to rain.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's wet... It's hot... He's crawling around in this garbage, cursing like a pirate -- looking for this ticket that I threw away -- and all of a sudden he goes, "Richard, don't drop the light!" And I go, "Don't what?"
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(mimes holding light)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he goes, "Drop the fucking light!!!" So I go...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(mimes dropping light)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right in the water! He's like...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(mimes electric shock)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahhhaahhhaahhhaahhhhhh!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(appalled laughter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I run back, unplug the light, run to the dumpster -- he's lying there, rain is pouring down... And he's got the ticket! This twelve hundred dollar trifecta ticket! And I'm like, "Dad! Dad, are you okay?" And he looks at me and all he says is: "Richard... Don't ever have children."
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone bursts out laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To me, he says that! To me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
The mirth tapers off. They glance at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank holds up his bottle of Diet Sprite.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's to Grandpa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<EVERYONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's to Grandpa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EVERYONE>
<DIRECTION>
They clink and drink. Richard nods to a snack shack nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So... Who wants some ice-cream?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO BLACK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
