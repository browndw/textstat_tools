Oliver carries Arthur, they all enter a costume party, making their way through the crowd of people in all kinds of disguises, music blaring, Oliver slides into the less populated kitchen. A woman rushes up to Oliver, surprised to see he has a dog.
</DIRECTION>
<FEMALE_PARTIER>

Oliver picks up Arthur and escapes the kitchen. The Rosenberg's are still watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER... Oliver and Arthur sit in a chair next to a couch where a man dressed as a witch, complete with green face and long black hair, is lying back as if in a traditional analysis session.
</DIRECTION>
<LONG_HAIRED_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I didn't ask for this. Who would ask for this? This color. This nose. This cheek, this chin. You know, this is my life. This isn't a story. This isn't a joke...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LONG_HAIRED_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Oliver is playing along, but he's really not emotionally ready for this party. He feels very far away.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.

</OLIVER>
<DIRECTION>
The witch moves on. Oliver sits with Arthur in his lap, alone, lost in all this joviality. We see that the woman dressed as Julius Rosenberg is watching him. Just as Oliver is about to get up, she plops herself down onto the couch, ready for her session.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVER_V_O>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I was just- I was gonna take a break, actually.

</DIRECTION>
<OLIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well then your father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVER>
<DIRECTION>
She mimes shooting herself in the head and dying.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't understand. You can't talk? Is it a mental problem? Do you need analysis?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVER>
<DIRECTION>
She writes on her pad: "I have laryngitis"
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a physical problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVER>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles at him, looks at him a little too long, Oliver is more and more pulled in by her playfulness - she writes: "Why are you at a party if you're sad?" CU on Oliver, surprised and impressed by her observation.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was doing such a good job of hiding it. How could you tell?

</DIRECTION>
<OLIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you like to dance?

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JUMP CUT THROUGH THE NIGHT: Oliver, "Julius", Elliott and Shauna are talking to a magician. "Julius" picks a card, the magician mixes it into the full deck, pops a card into the air, it is hers.
