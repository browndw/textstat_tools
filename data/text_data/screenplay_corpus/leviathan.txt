THE SURFACE OF THE OCEAN

sunny and placid then slowly WE BEGIN DESCENDING UNDERWATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving down from the bright surface waters, through layers of fish and marine life...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A school of vibrantly colored fish move with the current, their numbers are enormous, their movements in unison. Suddenly out of the darkness a barracuda cuts through the school, taking out four or five before disappearing into the shadows. The school moves on as if nothing happened, quickly closing ranks where the missing ones swam only seconds before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE MOVE DEEPER AND DEEPER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fish disappear, darkness envelopes us. Cold and lifeless where light has never penetrated...Five thousand feet, ten thousand. Deeper, where only strange, self-illuminating echoniderms move eerily through the currents. Then suddenly WE HEAR STATIC from RADIO TRANSMISSION. THEN VOICES...

<DIRECTION>
A light flares out of the darkness, suddenly illuminating an IMMENSE SHAPE--fifteen hundred pounds of hardened metal nearly seven feet tall. It is a motorized diving suit and we see the stenciled name, WILLIE across the front breastplate. As it pivots we see the stationary worklights around the base of a large underwater mining operation, THE SHACK. Then a woman's voice.
</DIRECTION>

INT. THE SHACK/ CONTROL ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
littered with papers, half-full coffee cups, and a confusion of wires and very low-tech, high-tech equipment BECK sits at the monitor controls. He is younger than we expected, twenties, clean cut good looks. He'll be a hell of a good- looking man at thirty-five, he just needs to be hardened. From the looks of the coffee cups around him he's on his way.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK_S_VOICE_RADIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Six, let's wrap this container and call it a day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK_S_VOICE_RADIO>
<DIRECTION>
Above him a bank of monitor screens. Each one labeled with a crew member's name and providing a video picture from a camera mounted on their helmet. Beck reaches above him and throws a console switch which activates another monitor labeled ROV. With a joystick he manipulates an outside camera(the ROV), its picture we see on the monitor. It is moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILLIE'S POV The inside of her helmet is a grid of LED gauges monitoring air reserve, body temperature, atmospheres, heart rate, blood pressure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stops next to a pair of railroad-like tracks and removes the tool attached to the end of her arm. The move is practiced and professional, like a cook changing the tool on a set of egg beaters. First, she inserts the existing tool into a lock on her opposite arm which holds it while she disengages the tool. Next, she selects the next tool from the storage compartment at her waist and punches it into position. Sixpack's voice comes over the radio.
</DIRECTION>
<SIXPACK_S_VOICE>

</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
OVER THE RADIO WE HEAR other men's voices laughing. They like Willie and cheer her on. "Tell him, Willie," "Atta girl," etc...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie CLICKS in her last tool and turns. Expertly she hooks a large dumpster-like container, the container to what looks like an underwater parachute--A CONTAINER TRANSPORTER--which when filled with oxygen it lifts the massive container onto the tracks where it can be hauled-in by a winch.

UNDERWATER MACHINERY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Halogen lights illuminate bits and pieces of dredges and dumpsters squatting in the gloom. A winch begins grinding and the big, newly hooked container lurches down the tracks. It comes to the end where a winch fits it into place with several others to complete a set. We hear BECK'S VOICE.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK_RADIO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok, that's it. Come on in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK_RADIO>
<DIRECTION>
More motor suited DIVERS appear, their helmet lights glaring. Their breastplate names catch in the dim lights: COBS, BOWMAN, WILLIE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they approach the UNDERWATER LOCK, where an elevator will transport them up into the Shack, we see signs of human life: a basketball goal attached to the side of the building; stickers and signs: "No Bozos," etc. A formal sign towers over the entrance. It says: TRANSOCEAN CORP. SHACK 6.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ONE OF THE CREW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves behind the others. Suddenly he freezes in his tracks and slowly rotates his helmet--on his shoulder in the glare of his helmet beam WE SEE the a hideous looking SEA SPIDER. It's thick legs moving eerily down his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carefully, so as not to disturb the creature, a mechanical motor hand moves into position below it, and in one quick movement, snares it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON METAL WAIST POCKET. The latch opens and the writhing sea spider is shoved inside. From the pocket WE MOVE UP the diver's suit until we see the name SIXPACK on the breastplate. He looks around to see if anyone has noticed then continues on toward the shack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TWO DIVERS(JONES AND DEJESUS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They walk together to the Shack. A Latino VOICE, DEJESUS, comes over the radio singing an old Miller Beer jingle in an exaggerated accent.

<DEJESUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When it's time to relax.... One thing stands clear...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEJESUS>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE ON BECK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he listens to the singing over the tinny speaker, we see he aches to be a part of their comaraderie, but is alienated by age and rank. He is the shack boss, management. He listens as a BOOMING BLACK VOICE joins in off-key.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JONES' VOICE(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mil-ler's tastes too good to hurry through...
	</DIALOGUE>

As the singing continues, Beck looks over at an empty chair in front of a bank of equipment monitors. The vital signs of each miner and his equipment are registered on this console. The chair in front of them sits conspicuously empty. This doesn't please Beck, neither does a hand written sign under the console which states: THE DOCTOR IS OUT.

ON DEJESUS He is forced into the LOCK, the underwater elevator room is eerily lit. His readout continues inside his helmet...5, 4, 3...DeJesus screams.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DeJesus' scream comes over his radio in the control room. Beck hits the elevator switch--nothing happens. He hits it again harder and suddenly DeJesus voice is drowned out by the SCREAMING VACUUM PUMPS of the elevator. It's moving! Beck looks up at the monitor of the interior Lift Lock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIFT LOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE DeJESUS'S SUIT dripping wet. It stands inside the Lift Lock, ankle deep in greasy bilge water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON HIS EYES, for a moment they remain closed, then suddenly they flutter. He's alive!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MESS - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blackboard prominently displayed on the wall of the Mess features neatly stenciled letters that say: "DAYS TILL PICKUP". The number scrawled on the chalk-smudged board obviously changes daily. Right now, it's a "3"...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CLUNK, CLUNK and a Coke can rolls out of a compact COKE MACHINE. A big, sandy-haired man, SIXPACK, takes the soft drink, pops the top and downs it in one long pull while he looks over an arguing group of deep sea miners: JONES, Black, athletic, 30's; COBB, 50's, a career miner with a mouthful of gum; BOWMAN, 35, attractive, hardened woman, she has seen more of the world than any of them; WILLIE, twenties, fresh good looks, master electrician, optimist. DEJESUS, Latino, wiry muscles, he keeps his head down, still shaken from his experience.

Beck glares, ready for an argument, but as WE PULL BACK we see he's talking to the mirror, in his tiny quarters.

Apparently he fails to convince himself because his hard look fades and he mutters unhappily as he turns away.

He turns around to face a smiling picture of himself at college graduation with his Eastern establishment looking father. Leadership "how-to" books like The One Minute Manager, etc. line his bookshelf with technical manuals on underwater mining.

He opens his door to leave when SUDDENLY A LOUD METALLIC GROANING NOISE stops him cold. The entire Shack seems shifting, like a giant waking from a nap.

She turns off toward the Swamp, leaving Beck with the tiny, but honest compliment. He savors it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SWAMP - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The "Swamp" (where DeJesus came up), is ankle deep in greasy bilgewater. The door slides open, Willie enters, and switches on a bank of fluorescent lights. The room is spooky even with the lights. The giant machine suits, we saw earlier outside, hang from racks like sleeping monsters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie straps on a utility belt and checks her tools--a motorized screwdriver, a power wrench, a long-necked, laser-tipped soldering iron(looks like a long-necked screwdriver)--then splashes through the bilge water to the control switch and hits the START button.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NNNNNNNNNN. A motor moves one of the suits along the track toward Willie. As it turns the corner toward us we see it says: DEJESUS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOC'S OFFICE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beck opens the door to Doc's quarters and we see Doc putting on a fresh shirt. A man in his 50's, he must have once been quite handsome and intelligent, but has now gone to seed.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must have dozed off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
Beck looks on the cabinet and sees a bottle of Old Granddad Whiskey. He picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOC(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Snakebite medicine...Never pack my bag without it.
	</DIALOGUE>

Beck doesn't smile. He puts the bottle back down and Doc watches him in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>

</BECK>
<DOC>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
The Doc stops buttoning his shirt and locks eyes with Beck.
</DIRECTION>
<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got something to say to me, son?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOC>
<DIRECTION>
Beck definitely has something to say, but confronted, he falters.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I...I think it's important to have the second officer on deck.

Doc smiles, and goes back to buttoning his shirt.

<DOC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll keep it to nine holes in the morning.

<DIRECTION>
THE DORMITORY - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Small but functional. The bunks can be closed-off with a privacy door. Photographs and bumper stickers on the walls of the bunks provide the only personal touches in an otherwise sterile environment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Willie's bunk is wallpapered in detailed interplanetary maps; Sixpack's privacy door has a bumper sticker which proclaims: "I MAY BE FAT, BUT YOU'RE UGLY AND I CAN DIET." DeJesus' has posters of the Alps, and the Rockies; Bowman's has clipped pages from "Gourmet" of meals she dreams for; Cobb's has nothing, as if perfectly content to be where he is instead of somewhere else. Inside Jones' bunk is an indoor basketball goal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bowman and Sixpack scrub down the walls of the dorm with a sponge and pail. Sixpack pauses and smirks, his eyes on Bowman's chest.

</SIXPACK>
<DIRECTION>
CORRIDOR "A" - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jones and Cobb are kneeling in a corridor, unfastening a big plate on the floor with a power wrench. Overhead a huge plexiglass conduit flows with water from the desalinization system. The interior wall of the corridor is meshed wire exposing the throbbing machine floor of the Shack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cobb removes the last bolt and Jones lifts off the floorplate exposing the guts of the shack--the BILGE--dark and wet. Without the plate the RATTLE in the air system is much louder and sinister.
</DIRECTION>
<JONES>

	Listen to it for Christsake.

	</DIALOGUE>
</COBB>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls a retractable ladder from inside the hole and drops it down into the wet darkness, without hesitating he climbs down, stopping at the bottom to look up at Jones. Jones seems in no hurry to accompany him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COBB(cont'd)

Jones reluctantly starts down after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BECK'S QUARTERS - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beck in his quarters. He seems to be talking to himself but as we move around him we see he is talking to a video monitor. On screen we see MARTIN, 30's, a slick bureaucratic executive with TransOcean Corp. whose face is all we see on the video monitor.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>

Beck stops. Martin notices his concern.

	Don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'Know what I mean?

CLOSE ON A BOOM BOX/ LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boom box sitting on a wall pipe is blaring John Denver's Rocky Mountain High.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DeJesus is singing along loudly in his thick accent as he works on the intercom system. He finishes, closing a metal box which says: ONBOARD COMMUNICATIONS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SWAMP - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON WILLIE She has connected DeJesus' suit to the diagnostic computer and is going through the computerized checkpoints--an electronic list of literally hundreds of possible problems.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably a short.

Suddenly, the computer pauses on one: It says: Electrical Short.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILLIE(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good guess, Williams.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She types in a "help" command and the computer screen displays an electrical circuit pattern that would leave most Electrical Engineers baffled. Willie hardly bats an eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILLIE(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Piece of cake.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She immediately opens the circuit panel on DeJesus' suit and pulls the laser soldering iron out of her tool belt. With two quick spot welds she repairs the short, then replaces the panel. Finished, Willie presses the control switch and the suits begin to move along the track. A new suit rounds the corner toward us. It says SIXPACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BILGE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The walls are dark and moist. Water drips from the pipes. The rattle in the air system continues loudly as Jones leans over and hands Cobb another tool. Crouched in the humming machinery, Cobb spits his wad of chewing gum into a greasy hand, kneads it a couple of times, then grins at Jones.
</DIRECTION>
<COBB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, watch this..
	</DIALOGUE>
</COBB>
<DIRECTION>
THE SWAMP - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The monotonous clatter of the air system is the only sound in the gloomy SWAMP as the huge suit labeled SIXPACK stops directly in front of Willie. She reaches up to open the pocket latch when she stops...listening. THE NOISE IN THE AIR SYSTEM HAS STOPPED.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BILGE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jones looks incredulously at Cobb. He can't believe that's all it took. Cobb starts gathering up the tools.

THE DORMITORY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bowman looks at DeJesus who comes to the door, then to Sixpack who convulses with laughter against the bulkhead.

Willie watches the Sea Spider move in the water toward her as Beck's words come over the P.A. Ignoring Beck she watches the spider right as it moves to her feet then brings the soldering iron down into the water with a LOUD HISS skewering it. She presses the intercom button and lifts the skewered sea spider out of the water.

BOWMAN sits at a portable computer terminal and watches stock prices scroll across the screen. Every so often she freezes a stock and types the command: INFO. The screen immediately changes to a financial report of the company in question as if prepared by a broker. In a matter of seconds Bowman can learn all the major aspects of the company.

Across the room from her, Willie exercises with dumbbells while she studies an astronaut training manual. She looks up at Bowman.

SIXPACK'S BUNK He closes his privacy door and hesitates as if listening for the others, then he removes a silver flask with Cyrillic lettering--the silver object he palmed in the Swamp--and smiles as he takes a long pull. Suddenly WHAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Privacy door to Sixpack's bunk is slammed open. Startled he turns startled to see--BOWMAN.

ON WILLIE She is jogging through the corridors. Suddenly there is a GREAT GROANING NOISE. Willie stops and looks through the steel mesh wall into the machine floor. The dark shapes of the machines move monstrously in the dim light. The GROANING ends and she jogs on to the Swamp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she passes the door she notices the light and stops. Beck stands with a clipboard by an equipment cabinet filled with the parachute-like Container Transporters we saw outside. He sees her.

Beck ignores them and goes to the control rack which sends the suits around the room and pushes number 8--his suit. DeJesus and Jones share a look. Bowman and Willie watch him carefully. As Beck's suit stops in front of him the room is quiet, they can't believe their eyes. Awkwardly, Beck tries to get into his suit. Cobb breaks the silence.

	Please, Doc...I'm cold...I hurt...

<DOC>

	I'm just going to take a tiny piece of skin to look at under the microscope...Afterwards I'll give you a sedative.

An enlarged view of the cells in alarmingly hyperactivity. We see it literally spreading before our eyes.

<DIRECTION>
ON DOC

He leans back from the microscope. There is awe on his face for the first time since first year medical studies--and there is fear of the unknown. He looks over his shoulder at Sixpack, his shivering has stopped, he lies still on the table.

Lights move in the blackness, but there is an order to the actions and a crispness to the voices. People doing work that is moving sharply. Pride in what they're doing.

SWAMP ROOM - LATER

SICK ROOM

As Beck enters, masked, Sixpack's back is to him under the sheets. Slowly he pulls back the sheet and recoils from the sight. The black splotches have nearly all grown together. His fingers have lengthened and become more webbed. Most dramatically the sores on the sides of his neck have become flared and elongated. Though not bleeding, the open veins are visible.

Sixpack's body lies under a sheet in the Sick room. The door opens and Jones looks in, sees Sixpack but in the dim light, doesn't realize the sheet covering him, covers the body totally. Jones smiles.

The water continues to run. No answer. Carefully, Doc opens the shower door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT HE SEES: Bowman. Dead. Her wrists have been cut and blood swirls down the drain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doc sadly squats down beside her. The death effects him greatly. He feels helpless, then suddenly his eyes widen and he carefully reaches out and takes Bowman's limp arm, turning it supine. There, running the length of the arm, WE SEE the black scales.

<DIRECTION>
Carefully he enters the Infirmary and WE SEE the examination table is empty! Beck goes to the Sick room and stops in the doorway. Jones moves behind him and his eyes suddenly widen.

Dressed in their rubber latex suits Cobb, Jones, DeJesus, Beck, and Willie carry the body of Sixpack and Bowman in the zippered bodybag. Now, well over three hundred pounds, the bodies strange shape and dead weight make it difficult to transport.

<DIRECTION>
The group turns into the Swamp where Doc waits for them by the Lift Lock. Rounding the corner Cobb bangs into the side of a bulkhead and drops his corner of the "package." Like dominoes, Willie also looses her grip, then DeJesus. The bodybag splashes into the grimy bilge water making it even harder for everyone to get a handhold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BECK(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon...Lift!

The group struggles to raise the bodybag and just get it to their shoulder when suddenly we go tight on DeJesus's face.

</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
But Cobb grabs the zipper and starts to unzip the heavy bag. Beck tries to stop him when suddenly, WHAM! a DARK APPENDAGE RIPS through the zipper and flails like a pressurized firehose. It beats wildly for several second, then lashes out at Cobb--ripping a gash on his forearm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While Cobb screams in pain, Beck yanks the appendage off Cobb's arm revealing a mouth full of needlesharp teeth and a sharp tongue-like proboscis which has stabbed Cobb like a dagger.
</DIRECTION>
<COBB>

	It bit me! It bit me!

While Beck and Willie wrestle the strong flopping appendage, Doc rushes to the Lift Lock.

DeJesus and Jones struggle to force the lurching bodybag into the Lift Lock.

<JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Push Hazy!

<DIRECTION>
The bodybag shudders like a huge cocoon about to lose its occupant. Jones digs his shoulder down into the task just as the bag suddenly RIPS in several places. A tear RIPS OPEN next to Jones' head revealing the head of BOWMAN, her vacant eyes only inches from Jones' face.

	Oh, Jesus Christ! I ain't never gonna sleep again!

NNNNNNN! The Lift Lock door whines closed and a horrifying SCREAM rises from the Lock.

CLOSE ON THE LIFT LOCK

The end of the appendage is severed in the closing door, disappearing unseen into the greasy bilge water.

BECK(cont'd)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Flush it!

Doc flips a switch and the SCREAM OF THE VACUUM PUMPS drown out the SCREAM in the Lift Lock, the wails of Cobb, and the splashing sounds of the severed three-foot section of gory muscle which slip silently and undetected under the workbench.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A second later the elevator returns empty, silent, bloodstained.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beck turns on the video monitor of the exterior Lock. The exterior worklights illuminate millions of bubbles from the flush and the struggling movements of the bodybag before it grows still once again and disappears beyond the range of the Shack lights...into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beck turns and looks at his savaged crew. Willie, Jones, DeJesus, Doc look like wet-suited butchers. Splattered in blood, numbed by the experience, they are brought together by having simply survived. Jones holds up Willie. DeJesus leans against the bulkhead. In the far corner Cobb sobs quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOWERS - LATER

Clouds of steam. Vaguely seen through the steam, Willie is scrubbing herself almost desperately, as though the spattered blood of the creature had penetrated into her skin. Finally she gives up almost in tears and rests her head against the wall of the shower stall.

Doc and Beck replay the tape of Willie's search for Sixpack on the Russian ship. On the monitor screen we see Willie's POV of the infirmary. The light dances off the broken glass as she turns, then the flash of white we saw before as the light moves out into the corridor.

SWAMP

<DIRECTION>
They enter the quiet Swamp. The suits hang silently like sleeping monsters. Beck steps into the equipment room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jones walks along the suits which hang in front of him. Their empty masks stare at him hauntingly. He reaches the end and stands in front of the ladder where we earlier saw Willie doing chin-ups. He looks down and sees her headband floating in the bilgewater.

Jones, Willie and Beck move quickly. Beck pulls a portable laser drill which fits into the arm of the mechanical suits and attaches a portable power unit to the back. Turning it on it becomes a sinister close-range weapon.

Willie opens an equipment cabinet and reveals deflated container transporters. Beck notices and then looks up at Jones who opens a locked cabinet and takes out the bicycle pump/earthquake device we saw Willie use earlier.

Doc leaves his office and slowly goes into the Infirmary to the storage counter across the room--where the blood is stored. WE SEE what disturbed him...the door to the refrigeration unit is ajar. Doc opens the door to the cabinet. The plastic bags are now empty. Each one has been drained.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOWER RING CORRIDOR - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cobb moves out of the Infirmary, carefully down the eerie corridor, his mining tool in front of him for security. There is a sinister feel to the place. Each step only reveals a little bit of space ahead of him. Suddenly he stops. In front of him across the hall a cabinet which says: ONBOARD COMMUNICATIONS, is torn open. It is where DeJesus fixed the intercom the day before.
</DIRECTION>

The door is shattered. Carefully, Cobb opens the door and WE SEE the guts of the wiring have been torn out--the entire system has been disabled.

Cobb carefully examines the damage WHEN SUDDENLY A SCALY HAND-LIKE APPENDAGE slams into the cabinet door trapping COBB and sending his weapon to the floor. Cobb turns directly into

THE LEECH-LIKE MOUTH! It's sharp teeth shine in the light, poised to strike.

Cobb's eyes closed, screams like a maniac, waiting for the tentacle to attack. Then suddenly an UNGODLY SCREAM echoes in the corridor.

COBB opens his eyes to see the tentacle gone. Doc is holding the smoking mining drill, his eyes glazed, as if he has seen the devil itself.

</JONES>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY THERE IS A TREMENDOUS BANGING ON THE DOOR! LIKE A HUNDRED SLEDGEHAMMERS POUNDING THE HEAVY STEEL DOOR TRYING TO BREAK IT DOWN. Jones readies his weapon but just as suddenly, the BANGING STOPS. Beck, Willie and Jones all nervously exchange looks.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>

Beck slides behind the Console and quickly types in a message. WE SEE IT ON THE SCREEN. "SHACK SIX REPORTING. PLEASE DISREGARD PREVIOUS MESSAGE---"

CONTROL ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jones sits near the vent sound asleep, his weapon across his stomach. Near him Willie lies still, eyes open. She watches Beck across the room, standing at the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares outside into the darkness for a moment, then as if a thought suddenly occurs to him he looks at the blank computer screen.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON COMPUTER SCREEN

She moves into Doc's seat in front of the console and calls up the stock market program that Bowman was monitoring earlier.

She scrolls forward in the report and suddenly freezes the words.

<DIRECTION>
THE SCREEN: "...accident took place in Shack Six, Southeast Sector of Pacific Zone 10...Seven dead. All bodies missing." Their names follow.

ON WILLIE as her name comes up she shivers.

	Welcome to the union, boss. We're all expendable.

</JONES>
<DIRECTION>
He is now awake. He sits up against the air vent. Suddenly, Beck listens, the room is deathly silent. He looks over to the air vent. Jones is listening also.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The air's stopped.

WHOOP! WHOOP! Suddenly a KLAXON HORN sounds hysterically. A blue light on the console blinks on and off. It says "AIR." Beck turns to the instruments.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're on backup air.

</BECK>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much time does that give us?

<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>

SUDDENLY WE HEAR A SOUND WE HAVEN'T HEARD IN A LONG TIME. The RATTLE THAT JONES AND COBB FIXED. Jones and Beck home in on the tell-tale noise.

<WILLIE>

Willie watches them a moment then picks up one of the mining tools, the laser-drill, she powers-it up to check it. Her action stops both men and she catches their looks.

Carefully the three move into the Lower Ring Corridor. As they move we suddenly hear a new sound, DEEP, LIKE DISTANT THUNDER. The sides of the shack tremble slightly.

	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
Jones moves to the lead and turns down Corridor "A."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CORRIDOR "A"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SOUND of the power-wrench removing the bolts from the flooring. The cover is removed and Beck and Jones peer down into the darkness. Willie stands guard with the flame- thrower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON JONES He peers into the darkness below. He wasn't a big fan of the bilge even before the Creature, now he's scared shitless.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll go first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
Before Jones can protest Beck drops the ladder and climbs down into the dark bilge. Jones waits till he's at the bottom, then starts down behind him. Willie looks back.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't spend all day down there.

</WILLIE>
<JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>

</JONES>
<DIRECTION>
BILGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From somewhere in the darkness we hear the HISSING SOUND OF ESCAPING OXYGEN and the FAMILIAR RATTLE OF THE AIR SYSTEM. As soon as Jones reaches the bottom rung Beck shines a light into the eerie underground area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pipes run overhead and on the walls. A broken electrical conduit sparks over their heads. The floor is ankle deep in greasy water. They start toward the noise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON WILLIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her back is to the solid wall(outside wall). Her eyes move from one end of the corridor to the other, not lingering long enough to distract her. Sweat runs down her face and we hear another tremor in the Shack.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(to herself, calming herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Williams...let's hear a tune.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat, quietly at first)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Off we go...into the wild blue yonder..."
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER RUMBLE FROM THE SHACK causes her to pause. She catches her breath and starts again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILLIE(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"...flying high into the sky..."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She suddenly looks into the Main machine area (behind the wire mesh of the other wall). Was it something moving?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BECK He moves around a corner we recognize from before with Jones' and Cobb's repair. Beck floods the area with light and the break in the line is visible. The pipe has been torn from the wall, it is totally unreparable. What's worse, electrical wires hang down, showering sparks into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you fix it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think! Can we stop it?! Block it up?! Shut down the line somewhere?! Think!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am thinking, man! You think I want to die! I am thinking! I--
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly his eyes widen. Beck sees this and turns. In his light WE SEE THE GLINT OF LONG TEETH AND THE HUGE BLACK FRAME OF THE COBB/DOC CREATURE! It's leech-like appendage whipping in front of it like an excited cat's tail. Before it can strike, Jones pushes Beck out of the way and fires a blast of flame from his flamethrower. The CREATURE SCREAMS and disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Beck falls his light lands in the bilge water and goes out sending the bilge into greater darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hit it. But I can't see it! Can you see it?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<BECK>
<DIRECTION>
(standing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
Jones looks back at the ruptured pipe and suddenly has a thought.
</DIRECTION>
<JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Swamp. There's an over- ride switch in the Swamp.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<DIRECTION>
They start for the ladder when WWWWHHHHHHHHIP! out of the darkness the appendage wraps like a bullwhip around Jones' arm. The deadly proboscis, which stabbed Cobb, is poised like a dagger about to be plunged into the black man's thigh.
</DIRECTION>
<JONES>
<DIRECTION>
(screams)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahhh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<DIRECTION>
Instinctively Beck whips out the mining saw and severs the tentacle. The unseen Creature's SCREAM echoes through the Bilge. Beck grabs Jones by the arm and pulls him toward the ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hurry...Get out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
Quickly they slosh toward the ladder and hole in the floor fifteen feet away, moving closer...ten...eight....then suddenly ANOTHER APPENDAGE thrusts between the rungs of the ladder at them. Beck ducks and leaps to the side. He is less than six feet from the Creature. In the dim light WE SEE it wickedly bare its teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beck's eyes go to the walls from one side to the other and spot the exposed power cable. The Creature steps forward directly under the hole in the floor. It is about to lunge when a voice from above distracts it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILLIE'S VOICE(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature looks up and sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON WILLIE STANDING OVER THE OPENING, HER FLAMETHROWER POINTED STRAIGHT DOWN. SHE FIRES, SENDING A SEARING BLUE FLAME INTO THE BILGE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BECK watches the flame roar down on the monster and it gives him the moment of distraction he needs. He leaps out of the bilge water and onto a pipe on the wall then rips the broken power cable from the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jones! Get your feet out of the water!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
Jones jumps up and grabs a pipe running overhead as Beck thrusts the sparking cable into the water at the Creature's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN A BLINDING FLASH OF ELECTRICITY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The current surges through the Cobb/Doc Creature sending it instantly rigid. A second later it crashes forward into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving hand over hand toward the ladder Jones quickly climbs out, followed by Beck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHACK CONTINUES TO SHAKE, EACH JOLT STRONGER THAN THE LAST. As they emerge Willie helps them.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, the Swamp!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
They start for the Swamp down Corridor "A" when an enormous shudder goes through the Shack, causing the lights to blink and the floor to open beneath Beck. The jolt knocks him back into the bilge. Only grabbing onto the pipes just above the water stops him from falling back in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JONES stops and looks back over the missing grating.
</DIRECTION>
<JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<DIRECTION>
Jones moves instinctively back for him, but another jolt only widens the gap. Beck yells to be heard over the din of the collapsing Shack.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's an order!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck your orders!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<DIRECTION>
He leaps across the gap onto a remaining grating and thrusts his hand down into the darkness. Beck lets go of one hand, then the other, to grab Jones' extended arm. In one Herculean effort Jones pulls him out of the bilge. Together they leap across the chasm as the Desalinization Conduit collapses over their heads and water floods into Corridor "A" behind them. They have to go around the other way!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AS THEY RUN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KLAXON HORNS SOUND and a RECORDED FEMALE VOICE warns: "Five minutes until implosion..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH CUTS OF:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LIGHTS FLICKER AND FAIL, CAUSING THE EMERGENCY LIGHTING TO GO ON, AND CASTING AN EERIE STROBE EFFECT ON THE ESCAPING THREE CREW MEMBERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FALLING CEILING BEAMS CRASH DOWN IN FRONT AND BEHIND...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEAMS BEND UNDER THE STRAIN, RIVETS POP...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STRAINING MACHINES SEND SCALDING GEYSERS OF STEAM INTO THE CORRIDORS...AND SUDDENLY THE FLOOR GIVES WAY BENEATH WILLIE! She leaps up and grabs an overhanging pipe and swings to the firm ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JONES LEADS THE WAY TOWARD THE SWAMP, WITH WILLIE BEHIND HIM, AND BECK COVERING THE REAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEY reach the end of the corridor and Willie and Jones turn into the Swamp Annex. Willie hits the door opener. RRRRRR IT DOESN'T BUDGE. The pressure has bent the door frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BECK ARRIVES
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's jammed!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Immediately Beck backtracks to the corridor and pulls a hand held spreader--like a "Jaws of Life"--from the wall. He turns back to the Swamp when a BLACK SCALY ARM SUDDENLY BURSTS THROUGH THE WIRE MESH OF THE MACHINE FLOOR AND PULLS BECK AGAINST THE WIRE! IT IS THE DEJESUS CREATURE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His head held in place by the powerful arm, Beck looks almost directly into the dark eyes of the Creature. Its gill-like slits flare. Its mouth opens and we see a flash of its razor sharp teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before Beck can move the leech-like appendage ruptures the steel mesh and its razor-sharp proboscis plunges like a knife for Beck's face. At the last instant Beck move his head and the proboscis slams into the steel mesh. The mesh loosens the creature's grip and Beck manages to reach a mining drill from the tools on the wall. As the appendage starts to strike again Beck buries the whining tool into the Creature's tentacle and breaks free.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scooping up the spreader Beck rushes to the Swamp door where Jones and Willie are trying vainly to hand crank the door open.
</DIRECTION>
<JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where the hell've you been?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got hung up! Try this!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
Willie stands back and Beck thrusts the Spreader into the tiny crack in the door the hand crank had made. With Jones' help the two men force open the door and all three rush inside the SWAMP. Beck closes the door behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE INTONES: "Five minutes to implosion." And we feel it happening:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BILGE WATER ON THE FLOOR OF THE SWAMP RIPPLES WITH THE VIBRATIONS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WALLS SHAKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HUGE METAL SUITS ROCK LIKE CLOTHES ON A CLOTHES LINE. ONE FALLS AND CRASHES INTO THE WATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JONES throws open the control panel and grabs the red handled emergency air switch, but he can only move it half way! It is jammed by the pressure.
</DIRECTION>
<JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It won't go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<DIRECTION>
Willie grabs it with him, but even together it is not enough. THE HANDLE BREAKS OFF IN THEIR HANDS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STEAM JETS WHIP DOWN ON THEM FROM ABOVE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WATER AT THEIR FEET NOW BOILS FROM VIBRATION!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FEMALE VOICE INTONES: "Four minutes..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BECK TURNS AND SEES THE SUITS IN THE LOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs Willie and pushes her toward the Lock where her suit hangs.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The suits! Get in them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
Willie moves quickly but Jones doesn't.
</DIRECTION>
<JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The suits! Are you crazy! How're we going to get to the surface?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<DIRECTION>
Beck yanks open the equipment locker revealing TANKS OF COMPRESSED AIR AND DEFLATED CONTAINER TRANSPORTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up at Jones who grins with renewed hope and they begin pulling the equipment out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BECK(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get them in the Lock!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jones and Beck drag the tanks and the parachute-like Container transporters to the lock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON WILLIE She climbs into her suit and activates her generator. Instantly her Vital Signs spring to life around the perimeter of her helmet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FEMALE VOICE TREMBLES FROM THE VIBRATIONS..."Three minutes...to...implosion..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beck and Jones throw the last of the supplies onto the elevator and Beck holds out the SEISMIC TOOL Jones tried to arm himself with earlier. He takes the tool from Beck and sticks it in the vest of his wet suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then suddenly he sees that there are only two suits in the Lock. Beck will have to wait on his to move along the track to the Lock.
</DIRECTION>
<JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your suit, Becky!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just get in yours!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
Jones climbs onto the Lock platform and slides into his suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beck hits the Suit track button and his suit begins moving along the track toward the Lock. A suit turns the corner from the storage room followed by one labeled BECK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beck looks at the walls, they're shaking harder. He moves along the suit rack when suddenly THE CREATURE BURSTS FROM BEHIND THE SUITS SHATTERING THEM LIKE AN EXPLOSION! A HUGE TENTACLE HURLS TOWARD BECK LIKE A SPEAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BECK ducks just in time, grabbing a fire ax and chopping off the appendage. Another tentacle jabs for Beck.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(screams)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
But it is too late. It knocks the ax from Beck's hand and sends him to the floor. Beck looks up at the Lock in time to see Jones seal himself into his suit.
</DIRECTION>

Beck looks at the others one last time.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go, now! That's an order!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
Jones hits the elevator button and the Lock closes as the elevator sends them down without Beck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BECK stands and arms himself with a mining drill, which he swings at the Creature driving it back. As Beck gets the upper hand, the Creature turns its hideous face and Beck freezes. There attached to the back of the Creature's head is the grotesque face of DeJesus!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DeJesus' eyes suddenly blink. He's still alive! His lips tremble in agony.
</DIRECTION>
<DEJESUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill me...Kill me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEJESUS>
<DIRECTION>
Beck, momentarily stopped by the face, lunges forward with the drill and embeds it in the side of the Creature.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the Creature falls back hurt, Beck looks up at the lock elevator as it returns--IT IS EMPTY--The others have made it out! His suit continues down the track and stops in the Lock. He still has to make it, if he can just get there!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE SOUNDS: "One minute to implosion..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beck races to the Lock and starts to climb into the suit. His arms slide into place, his legs drop into the heavy metal shell and as he seals up the back he activates the generator.

BECK'S POV. His vital signs light up around the perimeter of his helmet, but he sees something else--the Creature charges toward the Lock--its arm reaches out to yank Beck out of the elevator! Instinctively, Beck swings his motorized leg into the Creature's snarling mouth, knocking it backwards and stunning it long enough for Beck to hit the elevator button. BUT IT DOESN'T WORK!
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
He hits again, still nothing!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE RECORDED FEMALE VOICE..."Nineteen, eighteen..." Her voice begins to quiver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BECK POUNDS ON THE BUTTON AND LOOKS UP JUST AS THE CREATURE DIVES FOR HIM, ITS HUGE SCALY HAND GRABBING HIM AROUND BECK'S LEG!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE ELVATOR BUTTON Beck pounds it one last time and NNNNNNNNNNNN!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LOCK CLOSES, CRUSHING THE CREATURE AS IT FLUSHES BECK OUTSIDE SECONDS BEFORE THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE COLLAPSES WITH IMPLOSION AND SUDDENLY EXPLODES IN A HUGE SHUDDER OF ENERGY!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOSH! A parachute-like Container Transporter zoom toward the surface. A heavy-suited crew member flashes past us. Its helmet light pierces the darkness, then disappears. A moment later another Transporter follows, racing out of the darkness after the first.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BECK'S POV We see the vital signs lit in a ring around his helmet. The depth gauge races past with blinding speed as he moves closer to the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILLIE'S POV She tilts her head upwards. She snaps off her light and sees instead of black, a lighter gray, then suddenly faint traces of light in the water above her. At first it seems like her eyes are playing tricks on her, then we see it again--a glimmer of light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILLIE(RADIO)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Light. Beck, I see light!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ON BECK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He follows her look. Light is coming fast, brightening as they rise. The LED numbers inside their helmets click off..."125, 100, 75..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BECK(RADIO)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait till you reach thirty- five before you blow your suit...

WILLIE'S POV Her numbers count down "....70, 60, 50, 40..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILLIE(RADIO)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ejecting.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She yanks at the handle on the chest plate and WHOOSH! The plate bursts open and reveals a second interior handle. Her hand gropes for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUNLIGHT IS STREAMING DOWN THROUGH THE WATER AS SHE RUSHES UPWARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOSH! The helmet and torso of the suit are blown open as she pulls the second lever detaching her from the balloons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No longer oxygen supported or being pulled upward, Willie frees herself from the heavy suit and swims to the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY SHE BREAKS THE SURFACE AND CATCHES A GLIMPSE OF THE SUN, DAZZLING THROUGH A MILLION DROPLETS OF WATER AS A HUGE SWELL CARRIES HER UP EVEN HIGHER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she's underwater again, struggling desperately to pull the tab on the life jacket around her neck. Suddenly a MALE HAND GRABS THE TAB FOR HER AND PULLS. She looks up at Beck.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We made it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Jones?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
Holding onto each other Willie and Beck ride a swell. At the crest WE SEE JONES in the trough below, face down. Beck breaks away from Willie and swims through the waves to reach Jones. Reaching him Beck pulls his face out of the water and inflates his life jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Beck lays Jones head back against the life jacket. For a moment. Jones seems lifeless, then his eyes blink and squint against the sunlight. Beck turns back to Willie and as he and Jones ride the next crest he gives her the "thumbs-up."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILLIE(cont'd) (jubilant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The sun! The sun!

Jones looks at Beck and grins.

CALM SEA - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BECK, WILLIE AND JONES cling to each other as they search the horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure you saw something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many times I got to tell you. I saw a ship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, why haven't they answered our flares?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll fire one more, that leaves us one last one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
BECK pulls the flare off his latex wet suit and fires it into the sky casting a comforting yellow glow over the dark water. The light fades, Willie looks at Jones.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you okay, Jonesy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<JONES>
<DIRECTION>
(weakly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tip top, Willie...tip top.

<DIRECTION>
(tired, but with fight)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jameson? Who are you trying to con...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<DIRECTION>
They both manage a weak laugh, then Beck sees something.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be damned. Look!...A flare!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
As a small swell lifts them up we can see a tiny flare just fading against the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It saw us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Answer them and quit kicking me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not touching you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOOOOOOOSH! Beck fires another flare into the sky. As the flare arcs downward, Willie feels another bump and for the first time sees the SHARKS CIRCLING THEM.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...no, no, no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
The SHARKS tighten the circle as the flare fades.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. U.S. COASTGUARD SHIP'S BRIDGE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CAPTAIN watches the flare fade through his binoculars and speaks to someone O.S.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you said you'd combed this area?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
He lowers his binoculars AS WE WIDEN TO REVEAL MARTIN standing on the bridge. He also lowers his binoculars and smiles coolly as he lies.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We did....Many times.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at Martin then to a Lieutenant)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Initiate rescue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
We hold on Martin's face as from
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FORE DECK OF THE SHIP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A rescue chopper with pontoons lifts off the deck and banks off toward the fading flare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OCEAN - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jones, Willie and Beck stay bunched close together. Suddenly Willie feels another bump.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(panicky)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It hit me! Where are they?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't see them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he is bumped by a shark. Willie sees one only two feet away. They are surrounded. Suddenly Jones stare to taunt the sharks aggressively.
</DIRECTION>
<JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right! I've had enough of this shit! You want meat, motherfucker? Come on, eat me, sucker, try some dark meat!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes away from the group despite Beck's attempt to stop him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JONES(cont'd) (taunting sharks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong you snout-nosed bastards? My meat too tough for you?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Amazingly the sharks begin to disappear. Willie and Beck watch stunned. Even Jones is surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JONES(cont'd) (to Willie and Beck)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa! Did you see those fools run? They know whose boss.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He jabs his arm upward in triumph and for the first time WE SEE a gash across his forearm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Jones crows triumphantly, WE SUDDENLY SEE HIS WET SUIT RIPPING ALONG HIS THIGHS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SURFACE/OCEAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jones is chortling, suddenly his smile vanishes, something is happening...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE hear the DRONE OF THE APPROACHING HELICOPTER...THUMP, THUMP, THUMP...The blades of the helicopter sound out over the waves. It's lights are visible. Willie and Beck wave frantically as Jones drifts closer to them!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JONES' LEGS His wet suit is now completely split open and WE SEE THE BLACK SCALES SPREADING!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HELICOPTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
hovers over the group below and lands on the water. Its blades beat the surface into waves. The WINCH OPERATOR hurls out a rescue harness and Beck helps Willie into the ring. He CLICKS the fastener and suddenly they both lock eyes. Before Willie can say anything Beck falls back and signals the Winch operator who begins hauling her to safety. Immediately Beck locks back at Jones and extends his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jonesy...Give me your hand!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
WILLIE reaches the helicopter and quickly climbs out of the harness. The Winch operator throws it back across the water where
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BECK grabs the harness.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Jones!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
Jones reaches out his hand. He is almost there WHEN SUDDENLY RISING OUT OF THE WATER BEHIND THEM IS THE SIXPACK/BOWMAN CREATURE IN ALL ITS HIDEOUS GLORY! HUGE AND GRUESOME, ITS LONG TEETH GLIMMER IN THE LIGHT. IT GOES FOR BECK BUT JONES MOVES BETWEEN THEM.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jonesy, No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<JONES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out of here, Becky!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JONES>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature grabs Jones and pulls him violently under. Beck watches horrified as his friend disappears. Numbed he clips the rescue harness around him when suddenly, WE SEE a boiling of water where Jones disappeared...bubbles rising...and then Jones' bloody and tattered life vest bobs to the surface several feet away from Beck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beck reaches out for it just as the Creature appears again! It turns and focuses on Beck. Beck keeps going for the life vest as the Creature starts for him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON HELICOPTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Winch operator and Willie watch in horror as the Creature bears down on Beck.
</DIRECTION>
<WINCH_OPERATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he in the harness!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINCH_OPERATOR>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON JONES' TATTERED VEST Beck reaches it. His fingers wrap around the bicycle pump-like, seismic tool in Jones' vest pocket. The Creature is right on top of him!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHUNK, CHUNK, Beck cocks it like a pump shotgun as tentacles rise wickedly out of the water and wrap around Beck's body in a death grip. It's horrible mouth starts to open.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, motherfucker open up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
The Creature's mouth widens and as it starts to strike Beck thrusts the seismic tool into its gaping maw and is suddenly pulled from behind--out of the creature's grasp! The rescue cable is taut! The helicopter is taking off!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BECK'S POV/ RISING SHOT. Beck rises suddenly out of the water, the Creature growing instantly smaller below him until BOOM! the Seismic device explodes in the Sixpack/Bowman Creature, blowing it to bits across the ocean surface! The shock wave sends the helicopter banking off toward the ship with Beck safely attached by cable below it. The winch operator pulls him in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COAST GUARD SHIP - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beck, dressed now in crisp white clothes, stands on deck of the ship. He glances occasionally at a door nearby marked INFIRMARY, then looks up as the Captain approaches and shakes his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Beck, I understand you passed your physical with flying colors. And Ms. Williams?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<BECK>
<DIRECTION>
(worried)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know yet, she's still in there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you'll be glad to know you have a friend onboard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Beck looks up surprised as suddenly Martin joins them.
</DIRECTION>
<MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
(excitedly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beck! I told them you'd make it. No one back at TransOcean believed me, but I never gave up on you once.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, how are you feeling?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARTIN>
<DIRECTION>
Beck looks at Martin for an instant then hauls off and in one incredibly smooth punch knocks Martin on his can across the deck.
</DIRECTION>
<BECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better...A lot better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BECK>
<DIRECTION>
Just then the door to the infirmary opens and Willie appears with a new outfit on. Smiles at Beck.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm fine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Beck lets out a slight sigh of relief as a STEWARD approaches with a tray of WHOLE COOKED FISH, HIDEOUS LOOKING THINGS LIKE ANGLERS, LOBSTERS, CRABS...MINIATURE LEVIATHAN. The sight is almost too intense for Beck and Willie. The Captain notices.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought we might have some wonderful seafood. But, if there's something else you'd rather have...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Willie stares at the tray of seafood uneasily then looks at the Captain and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about a burger and fries?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIE>
<DIRECTION>
She and Beck laugh as they sit at a finely set table on the deck with the Captain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AS WE PULL BACK the ship becomes smaller and smaller in the distance and WE ARE AT THE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SURFACE OF THE OCEAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
riding the swells, rising and falling before slipping beneath the waves and descending again into the cold depths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
