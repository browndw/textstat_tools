EXT. A DITCH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A light rain and crickets CHIRPING. Somewhere in the night, DANCE MUSIC is blaring, but here it's only a whisper with a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Water trickles out of a jagged pipe. Splashing up mud, the riverlet weaves through hamburger wrappers and sunbleached beer cans, spent condoms and an old Spin magazine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tiny stream ripples past glass and trash and the body of a woman. Face up, breathing. Dead grass caught in her braids. Her name is RONNA MARTIN. She's eighteen and bleeding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bleeding a lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to push herself up, but the dirt around her crumbles. Her legs are useless. Despite it all, there's a smile of perverse joy to her face, like she's just remembered the punchline to a favorite joke.

INT. SUPERMARKET - DAY

<DIRECTION>
A cash drawer slides shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the far side of the checkout stand, a STRINGY HAIRED WOMAN counts food stamps. Her eyes are sunken, black. She's got a screaming BABY on her arm and two rambunctious BOYS in the cart. They're wearing pajamas and raincoats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's five a.m. and the store is almost empty.

Containers of frozen orange juice spin endlessly on the conveyor belt. Ronna Martin -- the girl in the ditch -- is bagging groceries.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark and dusty, packed floor to ceiling with crates and palettes. Offscreen, a SOAP OPERA plays on TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronna comes around the corner, a thundercloud of anger and frustration. She passes by CLAIRE (19) and the British SIMON (21) at the phone, sorting through a crumpled list.

Simon's eyes track Ronna as she passes.

At her locker, Ronna misdials the combination. Frustrated, she POUNDS the locker, then re-dials.

</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
Claire looks over, looks away. Ronna heads for the door leading outside.

The Beast is Mannie's pride and joy, a late-70's Toyota held together with duct tape and prayer. It's outfitted for the season with Christmas lights lining the windshield and back window. Santa has replaced Jesus on the dashboard.

</CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at Mannie. He shrugs, unsure.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok, listen up. If Simon were here -- which he's not -- he would charge fifteen, when I know he gets it for ten. Times twenty hits, that's a hundred bucks I'd be pissing out my dick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<MANNIE>

Ronna pockets the cash. Mannie's about to say something when she stops him.

<RONNA>

	Both of you chill the fuck out. It's just once. When Simon gets back, we can still overpay for quarters if it makes you feel all warm and happy. But this is my deal, so just sit back and watch.
	</DIALOGUE>

Mannie and Claire remain unconvinced. Ronna reaches for the keys, CRANKING the ignition even though Mannie's driving. The ENGINE purrs.

Shades drawn, the room is completely insulated from reality. The light bulbs have been markered over, casting eerie pools of red and green light. Broken CD's dangle off a tiny Christmas tree by the stereo. Slacker seasonalism.

<GAINES>

(O.S.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't let the cat out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>

Ronna closes the door behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD GAINES emerges from the darkened bedroom, tying the string on a pair of sweat pants. That's all he's wearing.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't wake you up, did I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<DIRECTION>
He settles into an overstuffed couch and lights a Marlboro. Adjusts himself in the crotch. Motions for her to take a chair. She's more nervous than she wants to let on.
</DIRECTION>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you were still buying quarters off Simon. Least what Simon pretends are quarters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I keep him honest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At that level you're supposed to pinch. It's the economics of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE BACKGROUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WOMAN with a ballerina's body comes out of the bedroom. She tucks an unrealistically large breast down into her tight top.
</DIRECTION>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You leaving?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<DIRECTION>
She leans over the back of the sofa for quick, tonguey kiss. In a sneak attack, she shoves a Santa's hat down to his ears. He bats the white pom out of his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<DIRECTION>
The woman is out the door without a word. Gaines looks back over at Ronna, not the least bit self-conscious about the hat.
</DIRECTION>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I take it this is not a social call.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need a favor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A favor? Wow. I didn't know we were such good friends, Ronna. Because if we were, you would know I give head before I give favors. I don't even give my best friends head, so the chance of your getting a favor right now are pretty fucking slim.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You might try just telling me what you want to buy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty hits of ecstacy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a deep drag on the cigarette, looking at her. Blows the smoke out. He picks up a remote control. Aims it at the stereo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The volume meter, climbing fast. Out of the green, into the red. The MUSIC is deafening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON GAINES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On top of Ronna, face in her ear. His hand wraps around her head, holding her tight. We can't HEAR what he's saying. Ronna's eyes betray her fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He backs off. She looks confused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He nods. Do it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MUSIC still BLARING, she stands and slowly unbuttons her shirt. Takes it off -- very self-consciously. Pulls her t- shirt off over her head. Just her bra underneath. He motions for her to turn around. She does, then back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her hands are shaking. She holds them together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gaines aims the remote at the stereo. The MUSIC retreats.
</DIRECTION>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You come here out of the blue asking for twenty hits. Just so happens twenty is the magic number where intent to sell becomes trafficking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Todd, I would never fuck you like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How would you fuck me? Would you strap it on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<DIRECTION>
He climbs over the sofa to a dresser. In a drawer, he digs down through a pile of socks to find a wide-mouthed bottle. And an empty Tylenol bottle. Blows out the dust.
</DIRECTION>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the occasion?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's this big Christmas party thing. Warehouse, you know. A bunch of us are doing sort of a pre-party thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Friends of yours. You're not going to go and try to sell this on me, are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not dealing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Swear to God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
He transfers pills from the big bottle to the Tylenol bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the real thing. Pharmaceutical grade, not that crunchy herbal rave shit. Don't let anyone double dose or you'll be frying eggs off `em in the emergency room. One hit per headbanger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Understood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
He snaps the cap on tight.
</DIRECTION>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty at fifteen is 300.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifteen? I was thinking more like ten.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You already did strap it on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just that I know you charge Simon ten.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Inflation's a bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<DIRECTION>
He offers it to Ronna, who doesn't reach out for it.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's the deal. There's 20 of us. I need all of this. But I only have two hundred. I mean, that's all I have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
Gaines undoes the cap of the Tylenol bottle, starts pouring the pills back out.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, hear me out. This two-hundred is like a downpayment. You give me the stuff, I get the extra hundred from them, then I come right back and pay you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, that would be doing you a favor, and you know how I feel about favors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could leave something with you. Collateral.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
He gives her a quick look over.
</DIRECTION>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I already got a fucking Swatch. I need something I know you'll come back for.
	</DIALOGUE>

Ronna looks at the Tylenol bottle in his hands. Thinking...

EXT. THE BEAST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronna kneels down beside the passenger window. Knocks on the glass. Claire rolls down the window. MUSIC spills out.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claire, could you come up with me for a sec?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOORSTEP - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The release BUZZER stops as Ronna pulls open the door to the stairs. Claire just stands there, disbelieving, making no motion to go in.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forty-five minutes. Hour, tops. You just have to sit there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello! He's a drug dealer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, Claire. Don't get 818 on me here. How much shit have I done for you? This is nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No! You're making me an accessory.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claire. That bracelet of mine you're wearing is an accessory. You are just some chick who's sitting in an apartment. That's it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
It's not just the matter at hand, but years of minor adjustment and one-upsmanship. Ronna finally drops the bravado.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, no bullshit. I need this. I don't get this money, I get evicted. My ass is out the street.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<CLAIRE>

	You could...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
(stopping her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Claire. I don't have anyone else to go to. I am coming to you and I am asking for your help. Please. Help me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forty-five minutes. That's like eight o'clock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll be back by eight, I promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>

Ronna holds the door as Claire reluctantly steps inside.

The clock on the dashboard reads 8:04.

<RONNA>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this it? Are you sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
ENGINE running, The Beast is parked along a residential street in Venice. In the driver's seat, Mannie looks for an address.
</DIRECTION>
<MANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Six-forty-four. Jesus, next time ask for directions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
He kills the engine. Ronna does a quick face-check in the rear view mirror. She's out the door, moving a hundred miles an hour.
</DIRECTION>
<MANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ronna!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks back in. Mannie shakes the Tylenol bottle she forgot. Tosses them to her.
</DIRECTION>
<MANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a pro.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANNIE>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a top-seeded amateur.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
She pockets the bottle. SLAMS the door. Mannie tracks her as she circles the car.
</DIRECTION>
<MANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'm a very happy man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
In his palm, two tablets. He works up a good gob of spit, then swallows them both. They're bitter as hell.

INT. VENICE HOUSE / MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

A beefy guy named BURKE HALVERSON reaches out a hand.

</BURKE>
<RONNA>

	Ronna. When I heard Philly got snowed in, I thought we were fucked for sure. Glad we found you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<DIRECTION>
Her PAGER goes off, a shrill CRY. She quiets it, checks the number. Burke smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Work work work. Friday must be a busy night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was just a friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
Only now do we TURN to see Adam and Zack standing nearby, trying to look cool. Their house is spartan even by frat-boy standards, just goodwill furniture and as-is Ikea.
</DIRECTION>
<BURKE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. What can I get you to drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<RONNA>

Burke does a hepcat swing through the kitchen door, leaving Ronna alone with Adam and Zack.

<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So this party tonight sounds like it's gonna be huge.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Massive.

</ADAM>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That would be a synonym for huge.

</ZACK>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>

Adam looks at Zack. Ronna catches it.

<BURKE>

(back thru door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cerveza?

</BURKE>

He hands her a beer.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah. Hey. We bought a whole bunch of orange juice. It's in the car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON RONNA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watching them with a lion tamer's concentration. Burke looks back over at her.
</DIRECTION>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, Zack tells me you got 20 at 20, is that right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got a bathroom?

</RONNA>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Down the hall on the right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me show you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
He moves at Ronna strangely. It freaks her out.
</DIRECTION>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we could do this first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<DIRECTION>
Burke shoots Adam a look. Ronna's already headed down the hall. They wait silently until Ronna's out of earshot.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We said Chicago, you said Philadelphia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MONITOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In black-and-white VIDEO, we're looking down on wide-angle view of the entire room -- a surveillance camera. We can see the reflection of someone watching.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(FILTERED)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe she didn't notice.

</ADAM>
<BURKE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Just wait here. Keep it calm.

Burke walks off camera, headed for the hall. Zack hangs his head. Adam looks up at the camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP: Ronna locks the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She leans back against the frame, panicking. She turns on both faucets. She checks the window. Nailed shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at herself in the spotless mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're fine. You're fine.

A KNOCK on the door.

Ronna's heart is in her throat.

<DIRECTION>
CU: The handle, rocking back and forth, locked.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
She struggles with the cap. Child safety.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It finally POPS open. A few pills scatter on the carpet. She dumps the contents into the toilet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLUSHES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burke hears it. Freaks out. He rifles through the keys on his belt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

Ronna's on all fours, searching for spilled pills. She tosses them into the swirling water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
CU: The hole in the center of the door knob. A thin allen wrench slips in.
</DIRECTION>

Burke forces the door open to reveal

RONNA

standing with her beer, cool as an Eskimo.
</DIRECTION>

She pushes past him into the hall.

INT. MAIN ROOM - NIGHT

Ronna is headed for the front door. Following behind her, Burke waves at Adam -- BLOCK THAT DOOR!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam steps in her way.
</DIRECTION>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ronna, hun, do we got a deal here or not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
(turns, backing away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No, see we don't. That's what I came here to tell you. I couldn't get anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
She bumps back into Adam at the door. Burke is closing in.
</DIRECTION>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, resourceful girl like you? I don't believe it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's true.

BACK TO COLOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON Burke, dumbstruck. He nods at Adam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam steps away from the door.
</DIRECTION>

Ronna backs her way out the door, never taking her eyes off them. The door CLOSES.

A BEAT. Adam and Zack await the fury. Burke looks back to the hallway.

The car is parked on the side of another residential street.

	I think it was Simon they were after. He deals all the time out of the store. I mean, he makes change out of the fucking register.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<MANNIE>

	They didn't know who was dealing, just that it was someone at the store?

Ronna's PAGER goes off with a shrill BEEPING. She checks the number.

	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
A long silent beat as both put on their thinking caps. Mannie tries to beat down a smile that curls the edges of his lips. He clenches his jaw, trying to keep it in.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
She turns his chin to hold his eyes to the light. They're wild and dilated. And his smile resurfaces despite his best efforts.

<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You took one, didn't you? Fuck you, Mannie! How could you do this to me? I need you now.

A sign over the entrance reads "Yule Save More." Christmas MUSAK blares "Jingle Bell Rock" overhead.

The automatic doors slide open to reveal Ronna and Mannie, who split up. We follow Ronna, who is now wearing Mannie's black trench coat. The store is almost empty, with STOCKMEN beginning to unload palettes.

Ronna turns down an aisle marked "Soap/Shampoo/Drugs."
</DIRECTION>

INT. AT THE MANAGER'S COUNTER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mannie scans his hand on a UPC register, watching the laser on his fingers, listening to it BWOOP. He smiles broadly at an idle REGISTER WOMAN, who doesn't even look up. He then ducks down behind the counter.

A CRAPPY CD PLAYER

Ronna looks both ways. She's alone.

comes ROARING by behind her, heading for the front. She tries to duck away, but he's too steamed to even notice her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronna does a quick check to see if she got everything. Hurrying down the aisle, she swipes a bottle of Evian.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. END OF ANOTHER AISLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two stockboys give a wide-eyed, Spielberg stare...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We MOVE to the next aisle, where the Coupon Woman is staring at the same thing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We MOVE again to Ronna at the end of her aisle. She just now sees it...

<DIRECTION>
INT. FRONT OF THE STORE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON Mannie. He sticks his hand out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON the Register Woman. She sticks her hand out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their palms meet. Their hips come together. And they dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What starts as a tango, spirals into a STAR SEARCH-y routine of dips, spins and Arthur Murray nightmares. Torville and Dean on linoleum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stockboys watch, horrified but transfixed. The Coupon Woman taps her shoe against the wheel of her cart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MANNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
dancing his heart out. His face is red and dripping sweat. He's too out of it to notice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a JET ENGINE ROAR, swirling light. The MUSIC is stacked up on itself, overlapping and bizarre. For just a moment, horrifying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MANNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
he stops mid-twirl. Holding himself against a magazine rack. Ronna takes him by the shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MANNIE'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronna leans into a fish-eye swirl. The ROAR grows louder, continuing as we

CUT TO:

INT. THE BEAST / DRIVING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the wheel, Ronna's ripping open boxes of medication. Cracking open jars, she spills the tablets out on her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNA>

	Were they round or oval?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Round. White. Like aspirin. Like baby aspirin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
She digs through the pockets of the coat, seeing what else she grabbed. Her BEEPER goes off. She hits it to make it stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pops an allergy pill out of its blister pack. Compares it to another pill, almost the same.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
(holding them up)

<DIRECTION>
Making a decision, Ronna starts popping the rest of the pills out of the blister pack, dumping them into the Tylenol bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her BEEPER goes off again.

<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop fucking paging me, Claire!

Mannie nurses the Evian bottle.

Gaines picks up the receiver, clicking the remote to mute the CD player. He's still shirtless and wearing the Santa Claus hat.

	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<DIRECTION>
Claire is sitting in the corner, holding herself very still.

She digs a postcard-ish invite out of her purse. He snaps his fingers. She hands it over.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe...Yeah, well save a load for me big boy...Whatever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up. The CD player is still muted. The silence is vast. Gaines scratches an armpit. Checks his watch. Claire looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want for Christmas, Claire?
	</DIALOGUE>

<CLAIRE>

</CLAIRE>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>

</GAINES>

He gestures like he's going to click on the CD player, but instead points it at her.
</DIRECTION>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you a virgin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</CLAIRE>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Claire. Answer the question. Answer the question, Claire.

She doesn't say anything. Gaines laughs his ass off.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Breakfast Club. I get it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at me. I want to show you something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<DIRECTION>
She looks back over at him. He slowly undoes the drawstring to his sweat pants. Starts to reach inside. Claire watches, revolted and disbelieving. A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm kidding!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<DIRECTION>
His hand reaches between the cushions of the couch, where he pulls out a 9mm handgun.
</DIRECTION>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not kidding. Where the fuck are they, Claire?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<DIRECTION>
The gun pointed at her, Claire is losing her shit. Her face squeezes tight, like her head's being sucked through a tiny hole. Just when she's about to pop...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BUZZER sounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Saved by the bell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gaines pushes the TALK button on the intercom.
</DIRECTION>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>

</GAINES>
<FILTERED_VOICE>

Smiling, Gaines hits the DOOR button. Claire collects her wits.

Ronna looks back to Mannie.

<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>

</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
He nods, wiping a finger across his forehead to squeegee off the sweat.

<DIRECTION>
INT. GAINES' APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gaines sits pensively on the edge of the couch, then smiles warmly.
</DIRECTION>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's no problem. These things happen, I understand that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<DIRECTION>
Claire smiles, relieved. Mannie stands behind Ronna, his gaze carefully fixed on the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<GAINES>
<DIRECTION>

	Let me just fill out a return slip here, and I'll have the manager give you a refund.

<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Todd, I'm trying to explain what happened. They had already gotten stuff from somewhere else. It was just a case of miscommunication, I thought...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
Ronna's VOICE fades to nothing as we PUSH IN on Mannie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SIAMESE CAT

lays down on a table in front of him, staring at him.
</DIRECTION>
<HUXLEY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Mannie snaps back, eyes panicked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a few minutes later. Everyone's in different places, different moods. Mannie hasn't moved at all.
</DIRECTION>
<GAINES>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm keeping fifty. Call it interest.

</GAINES>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's fine. Todd, I'm really sorry about all this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
Ronna steers Mannie towards the door, trying to keep his back to Todd. But at the last moment...
</DIRECTION>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Ronna.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Todd shakes the pill bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just gave you a favor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
(a smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And here I thought you just gave me head.

</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
They trade a look as she exits. Gaines picks up the cat, gives it a scratch. Silly humans.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIELD PARKING LOT - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Mannie lies on the roof of The Beast, arms spread wide, cigarette in his fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BEAST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronna and Claire stare at each other, a competition, neither wanting to exhale first.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hands waving, Claire struggles to keep herself from laughing and choking. Finally she gives in, coughing up smoke and snot. Ronna blows out a cool ribbon of smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hands over a wreath of plastic holly.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pin me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
She leans down to let Claire pin the holly in a crown around and through her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, at the risk of sounding like. You know. Me. What are you going to do about getting evicted? You're still short, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
Mannie's hand flops down to the window. Claire hands him the joint.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From RONNA'S P.O.V., we see the floor is still littered with dozens of boxes of medicine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. She picks up a box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An idea forming, Ronna sits back up. Smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIELD / PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronna and Claire weave through the densely packed lot, where RAVE-GOERS party in and around their cars, drinking and smoking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they walk, Ronna pops allergy medicine out of a blister-foil pack. She tosses the box away. Scanning the lot, she points to a mini-van.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AT THE MINIVAN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronna knocks on the window. A NERVOUS TEENAGER rolls it down, releasing a cloud of smoke. Ronna smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNA>

	Hi. I'm Kelly, and this is Donna. We were wondering if you might want to hang out.

Ronna and Claire are packed in tight with three VALLEY HIGHSCHOOL COUPLES. The guys are stoned, the girls uptight. They're all breaking curfew.

A look from Claire -- why are dragging me into this? But she goes for it.

	You gotta try it. Shit, I'll buy for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FILA_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls out his wallet and hands Ronna a twenty. She gives the Anorexic Girl a tablet, who downs the pill with a swig of Diet Coke.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you know what makes it even better? If you smoke a lot of pot. I mean a lot of it.

Fila Guy nods, firing up the mini-bong again.

Mannie leans against a wall, pale and out of it, a nauseated smile on his face.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe you are selling allergy medicine.

A SKATE-PUNK GUY comes up to them, money in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<SKATE_PUNK_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. People are saying you have some really good stuff.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKATE_PUNK_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Ronna takes the money, looks him over.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Show me your tits.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. He pulls up his shirt to show his skinny white chest. Deeming him worthy, Ronna hands him a pill and sends him on his way. She adds the twenty to her stack.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much have you made?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four hundred.

</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
The opening RUMBLES of an industrial ANTHEM rise as we cut to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GAINES' APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC builds throughout.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing at the dresser, Gaines cracks open Ronna's bottle. Pills spill out on a plate. He counts them, pushing them aside in groups with a card. Stops. Picks one up. Looks at it more closely...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulls open a drawer full of socks. Digs out the wide-mouthed bottle. Shakes out a pill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flicks on a desk lamp. Looks at both pills in his hand, comparing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fuck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He flips over the card on the dresser. Mary Xmas. The invite Claire gave him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a sudden RAGE, he WINGS the plate against the far wall. It SHATTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music EXPLODES and we're...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAREHOUSE / MARY XMAS SUPAFEST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A grinding, sweating sea of humanity. In the mosh pit, SKINHEADS and coked-up POSEURS run in blind circles. A stringy- haired EYELINER BOY crashes into
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RONNA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
who had her own groove going. She shoves him back into the wheel, a foot on his ass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claire, behind her, YELLS something in her ear. We can't hear a thing. Ronna downs the rest of her drink, hands Claire the cup. That's not what Claire meant -- she's a little pissed -- but Ronna is oblivious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both hands free, Ronna pushes her way deeper into the eye of the storm. She adjusts her holly crown. She's sky high and loving every minute of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The line to get in is longer still, snaking down the wall. Fila Guy is talking to a friend in a SPIDER MARINE shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<FILA_GUY>

	This girl inside. She and her friend have it.

<DIRECTION>
We look past Fila Guy to see Todd Gaines, who's been listening. Seething.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BY THE ENTRANCE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sweating hard, Mannie is pressed back against a pole, shirt over his head. Two nose-ringed RIOT GRRRLS are drawing a Christmas tree on his chest and stomach with a fat magic marker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking over at the entrance, he watches some GAPSTERS move past the BOUNCERS. And behind them,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD GAINES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mannie's drugged eyes go wide with panic. He hunches down. Gaines starts looking around the edge of the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mannie works his way into the mob.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STROBES fire overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronna dances on, oblivious... Gaines circles, searching... Mannie fights his way through the outer ring of MOSHERS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the crowd, we see Gaines looking in... Mannie grabs Ronna... She smiles, tries to kiss him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He YELLS in her ear. He has to repeat himself... She looks back over her shoulder... A space in the crowd...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sees Gaines. He sees her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MUSIC STOPS. Dead silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronna and Gaines trade stares for what feels like an eternity, until suddenly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MUSIC BLASTS back, harder than ever. Like a shot, Ronna and Mannie are out of there. Gaines plows through the crowd, coming after them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WAREHOUSE ALLEY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A side door BLASTS open, Ronna dragging Mannie by the wrist. They race down the alley. A burly BOUNCER shouts after them:
</DIRECTION>
<BOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HEY!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(re: sign on door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NO EXIT!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
The Bouncer is blindsided by Gaines, who charges after Ronna.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DIFFERENT ALLEY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronna pulls Mannie into a covered doorway, a niche set off from the alley. They hide back in the shadows as
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GAINES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
races past. Ronna kneels down to Mannie, who's hunched over his knees sweating and shaking.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong? Mannie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
She puts a hand on his sweating forehead. His cheeks.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus. You're burning up.

</RONNA>
<MANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't feel my hands.

	Listen to me. We're going to find Claire and get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY / DUMPSTERS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronna half-carries Mannie down the alley. He's too heavy to lift, and too out of it to go much further. He collapses to his knees. She can't get him back up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without warning, he HEAVES. We hear the SPLASH on the asphalt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She props his head back against a dumpster. Wipes his face.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweetheart. Mannie. I'm going to leave you here. I'm going to get the car and come back for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
She fishes the keys out of his pocket. Mannie grabs onto her arm, tight.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't carry you! Mannie, just hide here. Just like a little mouse, okay? You're going to be fine. Ain't nobody leaving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
She pushes his legs into the shadows. He's crying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIELD / EDGE OF PARKING LOT - NIGHT (RAIN)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, we hear the RUMBLE of the music. Keeping low, Ronna works her way down a row, coming to Mannie's car. She tries one key, then another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We LOOK UP to see Todd Gaines watching her from the hood of a nearby car.
</DIRECTION>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's it going, Ronna? How are sales?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<DIRECTION>
Her heart skips a beat. She drops the keys.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Todd, I can explain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going to ask you to.

He climbs off the car, approaching.

<GAINES>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The thing is, it's not like I'm in a highly ethical industry. But goddamn, Ronna. You fucked me over for 20 lousy hits.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls his gun from the back of his jeans. By instinct, she starts to move away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A red Miata moves down the row behind Ronna. She looks to it for help, but it's already passed.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>

At the last moment, Ronna bolts. She ducks around the corner of a van, only to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RED MIATA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
doing 20 in reverse. It brakes, but there's no time. It hits her hard.

She flies up over the roof of the car, CRASHING down on the soft top. Her limp body starts to slip down the windshield, but finally sticks.

A beat, then we hear the engine REV, pulling back again. That shakes Ronna loose, letting her drop over the headlights in front.

Rolling down the slope at the edge of the field, Ronna topples ass-first into a drainage ditch. Her body lands with a sickening THUD.

He looks to the Miata. It suddenly takes off, kicking up dirt and grass. For a moment, all is quiet.

We stay on Ronna's body as we HEAR the Miata suddenly pull away. Somewhere in the distance, the Mary Xmas Supafest is still RAGING, but here it's only a WHISPER with a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a sudden SPASM, Ronna moves. Turns herself over on her back. Each breath WHEEZES and GURGLES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls the remainder of the holly crown out of her hair and tosses it aside. She tries to push herself up. Her legs won't move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Catching her breath, she looks to the top of the ditch, waiting for somebody to look in. No one does. Adjusting herself, she slides against a weathered magazine. Spin. Jane's Addiction on the cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She collapses back, a new wave of pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a beat, she suddenly LAUGHS, until gradually it becomes a COUGHING. She pushes her hair back, streaking blood across her face.

In answer to his question, the Ram Charger SLAMS into the trunk of the Cadillac. Simon cranks the wheel, barely avoiding the car ahead of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not slowing, Simon aims for the entrance lane, where the bar is coming down behind a small Nissan. Threading the needle, Simon makes it past the car and the gate. The Ram Charger smashes through the bar.
</DIRECTION>

	Cop. Cop!

There's a police car waiting at the stoplight. Simon hits the brakes, just short of a SQUEAL. They stop in a middle lane, next to the cop. Simon and Marcus look over to the OFFICER, trying to be calm. Singh and Tiny peer out the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Ram Charger slowly approaches, no hurry. In the squad car, the Officer takes a radio call. Drunken TOURISTS walk past. The crosswalk switches to a flashing red hand.

The Ram Charger pulls in right behind the Cadillac. It's so tall, all we see are the blinding headlights through the back window. Singh and Tiny slink down. Marcus checks the gun on his lap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The red hand stops flashing. The opposing light goes from green to yellow. Simon gently REVS the engine. Suddenly, a WHOOP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lights flashing, the police car makes a right turn from the left lane, cutting in front of them. The SIREN is deafening. Simon sees his opportunity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gunning the engine, he hangs a hard left, cutting across three oncoming lanes. The Ram Charger tries to follow, but the traffic is already moving. Over the protest of many HORNS, the pickup finally forces its way through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. A SIDE STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

The Cadillac takes a corner hard, fishtailing into oncoming traffic. Tiny SCREAMS. Simon pulls it back into the lane. In the rear-view mirror, we see the Ram Charger, gaining.

EXT. VERY NARROW ALLEY - NIGHT

	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, no. They're coming in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SINGH>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them, the Ram Charger gingerly negotiates a three-point turn into the alley. Wider, it scrapes against one side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead, the street sweeper is blocking one-quarter of the alley. One-third. A moment of hesitation, then Simon floors it. The Caddy hits thirty, forty. Engine RACING --
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't make it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<DIRECTION>
The sweeper is already halfway across the alley. Singh braces for impact. Somehow, Simon still thinks he can clear it.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	STOP!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCUS>
<DIRECTION>
At the last moment, Simon SLAMS on the brakes. They're skidding towards it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marcus grabs the wheel and jerks it. The front bumper catches the wall, sending the trunk SLAMMING against the far alley wall. A ear-piercing SCREECH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ribbon of sparks shoots off as the front and rear bumpers are scraped away. Forward momentum finally stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CADILLAC - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The abrupt stop sends Tiny flying into the front seat, where his head SMACKS against the dash. Marcus's seat breaks, PINNING him. He pushes back, but Singh YELPS in protest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simon blinks, trying to figure out if he's alive. With Tiny's bleeding head on his lap, he shifts into reverse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tires SPIN in place. The car is wedged in tight sideways. Further down the alley, we find the broken-off
</DIRECTION>

SIDE MIRROR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In its cracked face we see five Ram Chargers approaching. A giant tire smashes the mirror to bits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shifting gears, Simon tries to rock the car back and forth, making no progress. Looking over his seat, Marcus sees the giant pickup heading right for them. The headlights are bright enough to cast shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Forcing back the seat, Marcus stands up through the open sunroof. Aims and FIRES. Once. Twice. Three times.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RAM CHARGER - NIGHT

On the first shot, Vic Junior ducks down. Two bullets punch through the windshield. The third ricochets off the hood.

Victor keeps the pedal to the floor. He's not stopping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All four guys duck just before impact. The Ram Charger CRUNCHES into the side of the Cadillac, pushing it down the alley. More sparks shoot off as it goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking ahead, the street sweeper has moved past the end of the alley, but the far side of the street beyond is a construction area, flashing baricades all around. The Ram Charger will push them right into it.
</DIRECTION>

Clearing the end of the alley, Simon punches the gas.

Victor hooks the wheel hard, trying to avoid it.

Hitting a parked car, the Ram Charger tips and rolls over, landing on its side. It SCRAPES along the asphalt, finally coming to rest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CADILLAC - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simon fights to regain control, the street outside a blur. Over his shoulder, an oncoming Yugo can't stop fast enough. The little car hits just in front of the tire, sending the Cadillac spinning back the opposite direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tiny's unconscious body flies out the passenger window. Marcus and Singh both grab hold. As Simon rights the spin, the Cadillac brushes past the green street sweeper, still humming along. Marcus and Singh pull Tiny back in, inches away from decapitation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simon finally settles into a lane, checking the rear-view mirror.
</DIRECTION>

INT. ROLLED RAM CHARGER - NIGHT

<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Zack. Do you know who your girlfriend's fucking?

</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
He over-articulates, as if speaking for a Learn English Now! tape. Zack does likewise. Their animosity is palpable.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Adam. I do not. I have suspicions. Mostly former boyfriends who keep calling.

Ronna sees it. Her eyes go wider. Zack nods.

In the background, Burke is trying to look around. Ronna turns, heading down the hall. Up above, the camera is watching.

For a just a second, Zack smiles.

INT. VENICE HOUSE - LATER

Burke SLAMS Zack up against the wall, twisting an arm behind him. He kicks his feet apart, then starts to cuff him. Zack is in considerable pain.
</DIRECTION>
<BURKE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Adam)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now watch what I do with his wrist. I twist it away while I put on the second cuff. That way he can't go after me. He doesn't have any leverage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<DIRECTION>
He releases his hold on Zack, his hands cuffed behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I watch all these cop shows and they never do it right. Pisses me off.

Loop emerges from the back room, carrying a big box of videotapes on his way out.
</DIRECTION>
<BURKE>

	Hey, feel the abs on this one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<DIRECTION>
He rubs Zack's stomach.

Loop pauses at the door, looking around. He's forgotten something.

A beat. Loop can't remember what it was.

	Nothing. I'm out of it. Merry Christmas, guys. Good to meet you.

Adam waves. Zack nods. Loop shuts the door behind himself. Now its just the three men. An awkward beat.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're done, now, right? That's what we talked about. Whether or not the deal went through, we just had to do our part.

He turns to the side, offering Burke his handcuffs to undo. Burke makes no motion to do so.
</DIRECTION>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that he's gone, there's something I wanted to ask you guys about. Sort of a proposition.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, my wife and I -- Irene, she's my wife -- we're both working on Christmas so we're gonna have Christmas dinner tonight. And I was thinking, maybe you guys would want to come over, eat some dinner with us. My wife is great, you'll love her, then I'll sign your form. How does that sound?

EXT. A TINY HOUSE IN CULVER CITY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zack hits the alarm for his red Miata, which BWOOPS. He and Adam walk to the door, hostility simmering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A prefab Nativity scene glows beside the front door. Adam pushes the doorbell, which CHIMES "Hark Ye Herald Angels Sing." Horrified, Zack turns to leave. Adam stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING / DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Too tall for the room, a Christmas tree leans back in a corner. The rest of the living room is dominated by a giant leather sofa pit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bored, Adam lifts a plate to check the imprint. He sets it down, straightening it. Now it's out of alignment with the other plates. He looks around casually. No one's watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Circling the table, he fixes all the plates and moves silverware to its proper position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Burke's wife IRENE is mashing potatoes with considerable zeal. Adam leans in, sees her dedication and tries to duck out. But she saw him.

She points. He sheepishly crosses to get it. While he's dialing, Irene starts in with the electric mixer. Butter. Milk. Salt. Adam doesn't know where to look while he's listening to his messages.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He suddenly smiles. Irene notices and stops mixing.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(re: phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're singing Christmas carols. My family. Minnesota, they do that.

She leans close to listen. Smiles. She continues to lean close -- uncomfortably close -- for a long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a toilet FLUSH. Zack emerges from the bathroom to find Burke stark naked, rubbing his hands over his body.

	Sorry.

</ZACK>
<BURKE>

Burke sprays more cologne on his hand.

Zack shakes his head, doesn't know.

He sprays some on Zack's hands, who didn't want it. While Burke turns to get some underwear, Zack tries to rub it off on the bedspread.
</DIRECTION>
<BURKE>

Burke climbs onto the bed beside him.

Irene pops the beaters out of the mixer, hands one to Adam. They lick the potatoes off them.

	Tell me something. When you kiss those girls, you're not really kissing them, are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<ADAM>

	It's a stage kiss. Your lips touch, but there's no tongue.

</ADAM>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no feeling. Nobody gets jealous.
	</DIALOGUE>

	It's acting. It's not real.

</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
She takes his cleaned beater from him, dumps it in the sink. Turning back, she kisses him. Caught off guard, he backs into the refrigerator. It's a good three-second lip lock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She backs off. There's an awkward beat.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, now, that. There was a tongue there.

<DIRECTION>
Irene slides a plate under the candlestick, where wax is dripping onto the tablecloth. Burke tips the bottle at Adam.
</DIRECTION>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More wine?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. He doesn't want any more. Unless he does, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This has been great, just wonderful, but we're going to need to leave. Soon. Adam's not feeling well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not. It's true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Burke and Irene share a look.
</DIRECTION>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you gotta go, then I understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(awkward beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Irene and I sort of had an ulterior motive inviting you here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<DIRECTION>
Zack looks to Adam.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He makes it sound sinister. It's not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's right. Okay, you've looked around our place. Where do you think we got most of this stuff?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<DIRECTION>
Adam and Zack shake their heads.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sears?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	J.C. Penney's?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
Irene and Burke both smile.
</DIRECTION>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's actually from Confederated Products. Almost everything in this house is from Confederated Products, from the toilet paper to the mattress to those candles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The wine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even that cologne you liked.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(practiced)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, Confederated Products is a multi- level direct wholesaling company. That means we don't just sell the products ourselves, we also recruit and manage teams who work under us. Irene and I started eight months ago and we're already bringing in fifty thousand a year in revenues.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're the number four distributor in Southern California. By March, we might be number three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<DIRECTION>
She crosses her fingers. So does Burke. We look to Zack, horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, as law enforcement officers, Irene and I can't recruit distributors from inside the force. It's against the rules and we'd get fired. So what we do is look for people in other industries...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...like the entertainment industry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</IRENE>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(realizing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want us to sell Amway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<BURKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Confederated Products. It's a different company, different quality of product.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BURKE>
<DIRECTION>
Zack and Adam share a look of disbelief and wonder.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. FRONT OF BURKE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walking to the Miata, Adam takes the keys. Zack folds a form.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to do something terrifically unwholesome. I need to bathe in sin.
	</DIALOGUE>

	With me, or one of your other boyfriends?

INT. LIQUOR STORE ON PICO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam checks a low shelf for the right brand of scotch. Zack kneels beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have cheated on you with exactly one guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ditto.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. See, if I tell you, you will freak out and it will be drama. Bad not-funny Roseanne kind of drama and I am just not up for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
He finds the right brand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BY THE REGISTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They wait in a short line.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't wait to tell me, can you? You're gloating. You think yours is better than mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Sean Connery, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Count of three.

</ZACK>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright. Sure. Wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(reconsidering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.

With fingers, they both count off "One. Two. Three."
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jimmy.

<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jimmy in makeup.

<ADAM>

	Jimmy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jimmy. Jimmy.
	</DIALOGUE>

They both stand for a moment, bewildered. It's their turn at the register. Adam sets the bottle down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A doorbell RINGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An apartment door opens to reveal a chubby girl in sweats (SANDRA) with a cordless phone and giant bowl of popcorn. She drops the former into the latter.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is Jimmy here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God. Oh. My God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
She's thrilled and disbelieving at the same time. She fishes the phone out of the bowl.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
(to phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll call you back.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to them)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jimmy's not here. He went to this thing. Let me find it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
She can't decide whether to close the door on them or not, so she only shuts it halfway. She pokes her head out the door again.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do know, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I take no responsibilty. I was only an innocent bystander. But there was once where you missed each other by three minutes. It was so exciting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
She finds what she was looking for on the back of the door. Peels off a printed card.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's some sort of rave thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>
<ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
(takes card)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mary Xmas Supafest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He left an hour ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
Adam and Zack head back down the hall. She calls out after them.
</DIRECTION>
<SANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not going to kill him, are you? The little shit owes me rent.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANDRA>

EXT. WAREHOUSE / MARY XMAS SUPAFEST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the doors, BOUNCERS stamp hands. We move down the line of people waiting to get in, stopping on Adam and Zack.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, I just have to say this. The thing is, about Jimmy, he wasn't even that good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mediocre at best. And the sounds he made, God. It was like having sex with Nell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
Adam imitates the MOAN.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somewhere off Greenland, hunchback whales were beaching themselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the ear thing. Hello, I have Q-Tips. That's really not necessary.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The only thing I will give him credit for is the oral.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean? He was terrible. At some point I just had to stop him and correct years of bad technique. I had to take him by the ears and retrain him from the throat up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	October, maybe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Early October. And he suddenly got so much better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is so disturbing. It's like you were there.

INT. SUPAFEST - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claire cuts through the crowd with two empty cups, in search of beverage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE BAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sloe-eyed blonde boy (JIMMY) makes friendly with the BARTENDER, who is too busy to flirt. Rebuffed, Jimmy scans the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zack comes up behind him, grabs him by the waist. Jimmy smiles, kisses him hello.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam comes up from the other side, blows in Jimmy's ear. Jimmy is so coked up that it takes him a beat to make the connection. Zack plus Adam equals bad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles nervously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zack takes a pair of child safety scissors from his jacket. Confused, Jimmy tries to back away. Adam holds him tight. Grabbing a fistful of hair, Zack cuts it off at the scalp. He lets the hair fall to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tucking away the scissors, he and Adam walk off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIELD - NIGHT (RAINING)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tiny Miata maneuvers through the badly organized parking lot, trying to find the way out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MIATA - NIGHT (RAINING)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zack gives directions from the passenger seat.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. This right. This right!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(passing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was the right you wanted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
Adam ignores him, convinced he can get out this way. A beat later, it dead-ends in a chain link fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zack points to his lips. He didn't say a word.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam slams it in reverse, backtracking. He's doing about 20 when suddenly we hear a loud THUMP!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
By instinct, he SLAMS on the brakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something CRASHES down on the soft roof.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
Ronna's face suddenly slams down on the windshield, bleeding already. Both men SCREAM. Her eyes are open, staring at them. After a beat, they recognize her.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's...It's that girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ronna.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
Her body continues its slide across the windshield, finally resting on the hood. In a sort of spasm, Adam REVS back, shaking the body off. It drops beyond the headlights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zack looks past Adam to see Gaines standing there, gun drawn.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go. Go. Go!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if she's...

Adam pops the clutch and they lurch backward, out of there.

Adam steadies his hands on the wheel. Zack passes him the scotch. He takes a gulp, passes it back. The energy is still revved up to 11 -- we don't let ourselves catch a breath.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's think about it logically. Either she's alive, or she's dead. If she's dead, then there's nothing we can do. If she's alive, then the guy with the gun, who seemed to want to shoot her, probably did shoot her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So even if she's alive, she's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
Adam takes another drink.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On the plus side, the only witnesses are you, me and him. And none of us are going to want to be talking about it. So if you really think about it, it didn't turn out as badly as it could have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A girl is dead.

Adam gets out of the car, walks away. Zack takes another swig.

EXT. SIDE OF THE GAS STATION - NIGHT (RAIN)

Adam stops at a payphone. A long moment before he reaches for the receiver. With a breath, he dials 911.

Zack dunks the squeegee back in the bucket. With a wad of paper towels, he cleans the hood of the car.

INT. GAS STATION BATHROOM - NIGHT (RAIN)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Washing his face, Adam looks at his reflection in the scratched mirror. He steps to the urinal, unbuttons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before he can start to piss, he notices something strange. He looks down at his crotch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GAS STATION ISLAND - NIGHT (RAIN)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zack throws away the last of the towels as Adam approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a finger to his lips, Adam holds out a mess of tape and wires, all connected to a battery pack. It's the microphone he was wearing.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy sh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
He stops himself. Adam throws the bundle as far as he can. They keep their voices low anyway.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They wouldn't have been listening all this time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, they could have been recording it. Everything we said could be on tape somewhere. They would know we did it.

</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
A beat.

<ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
(an idea)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if we were just running lines? For a scene?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
Adam won't even dignify that with an answer. A long moment, just the BUZZ of the lights overhead. With an almost eerie calm...
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a pretty good chance no one's found her yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They will.

The Supafest is still RAGING in the distance. Adam digs through the trunk of the convertible, frantically rearranging the junk inside. He keeps looking around the lid, waiting for someone to sneak up on them.
</DIRECTION>

Zack watches Adam's fruitless arranging efforts.
</DIRECTION>

<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a Miata.

<DIRECTION>
All Adam's effort, he's made enough room for a pizza. Maybe.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll put her in the passenger seat.

</ZACK>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where will I...Or you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the passenger seat. Holding her up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
Adam shudders at the thought.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a flashlight, Zack jumps down into the ditch. He nudges Ronna's body with his foot. She's dead alright.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rolls the body over, grabbing under her arms. He tries to hoist her up, but she's too heavy and the ditch is too deep.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Little help?

Frustrated, Zack tries again to lug the body out. He can't do it by himself. Meanwhile, Adam is starting to hyperventilate, tears swelling.

</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around, expecting someone to walk up and see them.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No you didn't, okay? This is all just make-believe. This is a scene. She's just acting dead. And you're just acting scared.

</ZACK>

Adam laughs to himself, still crying.
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>

	See, there's the lights, and there's the camera. Watch your blocking.

	Hi, Michelle.

</ADAM>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The craft service truck is right around the corner, and they have lots of little veggie burgers on the grill. And you can have one if you just help me finish this scene.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Then take her fucking arms!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
Obeying, Adam grabs Ronna's wrists as Zack pushes from below. Together they get the body out of the ditch. Zack climbs up to help maneuver her into the car. Just then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronna MOANS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam freaks out, dropping his side. Ronna's head hits the dirt. Louder MOANING.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's not dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No shit!

</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
They stand back, watching Ronna MOAN as she lies half-in, half- out of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If she's not dead, that means we didn't kill her. We can just leave her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's almost dead. We leave her and she dies, why did we bother coming back? I mean, you still killed her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZACK>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean, I killed her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ, I didn't mean it that way. C'mon. I would never testify against you.

Adam is not reassured.

<ZACK>

	<DIALOGUE>
	In Plan A she was dead.

<DIRECTION>
Zack reaches into the car, pulling out The Club. Trades a look with Adam, who finally acquieces. Almost says something, doesn't. They both look around, making sure no one's coming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zack grips the bar like a baseball bat. Adam turns his back, covering his ears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zack raises the bar. Adam scrunches his face tight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zack takes two quick breaths. And holds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And holds. And holds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam opens his eyes, looks back. Zack isn't swinging. He lowers the bar. They both breathe again, relieved.

	Okay. New plan.

Weaving through some parked cars, we settle on an angry BMW, its lights flashing. A small throng of RAVERS have gathered around to look, because Ronna's limp body lies on the hood.

A familiar face pushes through the crowd, just arrived.

	Look, she's fine. They're getting an ambulance. She's fine.

</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
Adam keeps watching, not convinced. He turns back, a thought...
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about that guy? The guy with the gun. He could still go after her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, listen. Girl in ditch -- that's our problem. Girl out of ditch -- that's her own problem. We're done. We did the right thing.

</ZACK>
<DIRECTION>
Thunder RUMBLES overhead. Off Adam's look...
</DIRECTION>
<ZACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, approximately the right thing. In a half-assed, thrown-together fashion.

Adam smiles despite himself. Zack points, "See? See?" That just makes Adam smile more.

INT. JAVAMAN CAFE / HOLLYWOOD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Too early for the brunch crowd, just a smattering of vampires. All around, Christmas lights are strung with mad abandon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights overhead FLICKER. Everyone looks up. That's when we come to find
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TODD GAINES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sitting alone at a booth by the window, disassembling a newspaper. He finds the comics.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laying the paper flat, he tears off the bottom corner of the page and starts reading like a kid, his whole body leaning over the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the door, Claire comes in, shaking the rain out of her hair. After a beat, she does it again, as if she doesn't remember doing it the first time. She's tired and wired, all nerves and raw edges. There's static only she can feel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks right past Gaines, out to the rain on the street. He watches her, but doesn't try to catch her eye. The Jamaican WAITER walks past her with a pot of coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anywhere you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITER>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm meeting people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't care. Claire takes a seat at the table in front of her, but it's not to her liking. Then a booth. She plays with the salt shakers. Bad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's only now that she sees Gaines watching her. At first she doesn't recognize him. Then a light goes on. She climbs over the booth and into his, facing him.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.

</CLAIRE>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>

</GAINES>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're twins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
She turns over his hand, compares it to hers. They both have the same ink stamp on the back. He's busted, no way to talk himself out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Waiter comes with coffee, refills Gaines' cup.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claire overturns the cup in front of her. The Waiter fills it. She overturns a second cup, points to it. A big weird smile. Reluctantly, the Waiter fills that too. Then leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll pay you back for breakfast.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(leaning closer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. I'm not really that hungry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
She sheds her coat, having great difficulty with one sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you seen Ronna? Or Mannie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, when we go out, we always meet here afterwards in case we get separated. It happens more than you'd think. I've been paging her, but she hasn't called back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
The lights FLICKER again, storm still raging.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Halfway into getting her coat off, Claire has second thoughts, but continues nonetheless. Gaines is taken off-balance, his private space violated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claire finally looks up at Gaines, smiles. A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unless you wanted to eat alone.

	No. It's fine.

INT. CAFE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gaines scrapes the last of his eggs off the plate. Claire sits with two pieces of toast, untouched. She takes the scrap of the newspaper he tore off, looks at it.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you have against The Family Circus?

	Besides that.

</CLAIRE>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Location mostly. Bottom right corner, just waiting there to suck. It's the last thing you read, and it spoils everything you read before it.

<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could just not read it.

	I hate it, yet I'm uncontrollably drawn to it. Are you going to...

He points to her toast. She slides it over. He slathers on a thick coat of jelly.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know what I like about you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm asking. I don't know. It's not your face, because you're only medium cute. I think what it is, is you might be the first non-fake person I've met here.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Ginseng and lotsa caffeine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
Gaines leaves money for the check.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Claire looks around at the various decorations: a red tree by the door, snowflakes on the window, lights blinking on the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I like best about Christmas? The surprises. It's like, you get this box, and you're sure you know what's in it. You shake it, you weigh it, and you're totally convinced you have it pegged. No doubt in your mind. But then you open it up, and it's something completely different. Bing! Wow! Bang! Surprise! I mean, it's like you and me here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles. She has a bewitching smile.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>

INT. STAIRWELL TO GAINES' APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claire kisses Gaines, pinning him against the wall. Rain BEATS against the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She fumbles with his belt. His hand slides under her jacket, trying to undo her bra. They take a break from undressing to kiss harder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reclining on the steps, Claire tries to push his jeans down with her toes. Her foot gets caught in the chain from his wallet. Her butt slides down a step. They laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her hand hits something hard -- his gun. It's tucked into his jacket pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they start to work up a rhythm, Huxley the cat comes down the steps, curious. He brushes against them, unnoticed. Finally, he MEWS.
</DIRECTION>
<GAINES>
<DIRECTION>
(stopping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you get out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GAINES>
<DIRECTION>
He looks to the top of the stairs, where a MAN is watching them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Victor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has the silver .45 drawn on them. Gaines looks down to the door at the bottom. Vic Jr. is blocking it. They're trapped. Claire looks around, trying to figure out what's happening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GAINES' LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gaines draws a map for Victor on the coffee table.
</DIRECTION>
<GAINES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Simon's apartment is around the back -- the gate's always open. Now, you're going to take Sunset to Hyperion.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As he's talking, we MOVE to reveal Vic Jr. by the door, holding the gun on them, and Claire, sitting on the couch beside Gaines.
</DIRECTION>
<GAINES>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At Hillhurst, you have to keep right -- you want Sunset Boulevard, not Sunset Drive.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Gaines)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you just drive him there? Maybe you could help pull the trigger.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Gaines gives her a look. Victor takes the map and folds it. He hands Gaines back his credit card.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, we hear a SOUND at the door -- a gentle KNOCK. All eyes go to look. CLOSE ON the doorknob, someone trying it. It's unlocked. We TILT UP to reveal the opener is actually... SIMON. He charges right into the room, shutting the door behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Todd, listen, I need hide out here. You won't believe the shit we got into in...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He sees Victor. He immediately reaches for his gun, but VIC JR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is right behind him. He yanks Simon's gun away, then half- pushes, half-carries him forward, slamming him down
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONTO THE COFFEE TABLE. Claire and Gaines both scoot back, freaked. Vic Sr. puts the gun to Simon's head. Panicked, Simon squirms, trying to look around. His face is mushed against the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How was your drive? We flew.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Victor hands the gun off to Vic Jr., who rests it at the back of Simon's head. Simon is moments away from execution. All at once...

	Wait! Stop! STOP! You can't do this! You won't get away with it!

Sitting in the green chair, Simon makes an `X' on his bicep with a marker. He feels for the bone.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all flesh here, it should be okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
Gaines and the Vics stand around him. In the background, Claire is dubious and horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vic Jr. puts Todd's gun to the `X.' Gaines hands Simon a shirt to mop up the blood.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right, great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
On some sick level, he's really into this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vic Jr. gets ready to shoot. Everyone subtly backs away, bracing for the gunshot. Three. Two. One.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But there's no bang. Everyone looks at Vic Jr. He pulls the gun away.
</DIRECTION>
<VIC_JR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't.

	</DIALOGUE>
</VIC_JR>
<SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
It's all right. Really.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claire rolls her eyes -- this is going to take forever. While the Vic's argue, Claire grabs her coat and purse.
</DIRECTION>
<GAINES>
<DIRECTION>
Where are you going?
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
I gotta get to work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Todd doesn't want her to leave, but really, what can he say? Everyone turns to watch Claire leave.
</DIRECTION>
<VICTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Look, now the girl's leaving.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
See you, Claire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow her out the door. As she exits...
</DIRECTION>
<GAINES>

Be good!

In the background, the Vic Jr. is psyching himself up again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - DAY (CONTINUOUS)
</DIRECTION>

Claire shuts the door behind her. As she's headed for the steps, we hear a GUNSHOT. She flinches but keeps walking.

<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) I'm okay!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronna wakes up, a bit at a time, an IV dripping overhead. We hear carolers SINGING in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her nose crinkles, her tongue finds her lips. Finally a swollen eye opens, looks around. A MEXICAN FAMILY is gathered around the other bed in the room, the father dressed as Santa Claus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronna sees the IV dangling from her arm. She sits up with difficulty, a head rush. She tries to get her bearings, but genuinely doesn't know how she got here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a beat, she rips off the tape and carefuly pulls the needle out of her arm.

<RONNA>

	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNA>
<DIRECTION>
Claire doesn't say anything, a pointed silence.

Ronna keys in, checks the drawer. Claire returns to her register. Ronna tries to make eye contact, but no luck.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, real mature.
	</DIALOGUE>

Nothing. A beat. Finally...

Claire stops, disbelieving -- if Ronna only knew. She turns on her, then back to the register, holding it in. But she just has to face her to say...

	You are constantly using us.

A stray black cat scratches through a pile of foam peanuts, looking for bugs. Another cat crawls up the body of Mannie, propped against the dumpster. A trickle of water drips off the garbage onto his face. The cat licks it clean.

A beat, then Simon finally drops his panic. He keeps the gun in hand as he pulls the chair away from the doorknob and slowly undoes the lock. He leaves the chain on.

Looking out through the crack, we see Gaines, alone.

Without a word, Gaines grabs him by the collar and SMASHES him, one punch to the face. Simon falls in a dazed lump to the floor. We stay down with him as we watch Gaines walk away.

INT. APARTMENT PARKING GARAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adam and Zack scrub the Miata's upholstery with brushes and various cleaners, trying to get the bloodstains out. Zack stops for a moment, watching Adam. Adam looks up, what? Nothing. A quiet beat, the first moment of genuine affection between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly we hear a BEEPING. We can't tell where it's coming from.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Following the sound, Adam finds a mud-encrusted beeper wedged between the seat and the center console. He looks up to Zack, then checks the number.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.

	Somethin' about it just didn't add up. So last night I went back to the pier to do some investigating of my own. Turns out there are two boats named the Princess. Only, one just got back from two weeks at sea -- Sal Dominico's boat. It got me thinkin' -- if Chase really did know Carmen was on to him, how come he didn't tell Lucas, or Gamble, or Myerson? Why would he drive up to Pinecliff by himself? And why would you still have his briefcase?
