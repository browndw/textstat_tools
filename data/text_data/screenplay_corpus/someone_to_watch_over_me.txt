INT. MIKE'S HOUSE - QUEENS - EARLY EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Winter. A celebration. Close friends, cop friends, family all here to celebrate patrolman MIKE KEEGAN'S promotion to detective, NYPD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The party spills through the house -- front room, dining room, kitchen, with a small fenced backyard visible beyond that. A community of cops on their off-hours, their wives, kids. A mix of generations, all the way from MIKE'S kid, TOMMY, and his FRIENDS, playing among the adults, to an elderly woman observing quietly from her chair at the side. The mood's warm, spirited; there's a lot of friendship here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE: MIKE, in the dining room, posing for a photo with his ten-year-old son, TOMMY, proudly displaying his new gold detective's SHIELD pinned to his jersey.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ellie! C'mon! Over here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE: ELLIE, MIKE'S wife of fifteen years, a local product, bright and lively, and clearly proud as hell of her man. She frees herself from the crush of friends, hurrying to join him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE: MIKE, ELLIE giving him a full-mouthed smack on the lips as he hooks her into his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The picture's snapped, to a chorus of hoots and hollers. Behind, a banner and poster blowup of Mike in gun and uniform read: "FINALLY THEY'VE RECOGNIZED YOU, DETECTIVE KEEGAN."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCOTTY, a patrolman with the 117th and one of MIKE'S best pals, puts his hand vigorously, in congratulations, on MIKE'S SHOULDER.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTY>
<DIRECTION>
(to Mike)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No joke? You're being transferred to the 19th as your first assignment? Who the hell loves your ass downtown?

</ROOKIE>
<DIRECTION>
BROOKLYN, a cop about Mike's age, joins in.

The ROOKIE stares, impressed.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTY>
<DIRECTION>
(to the others)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember Curran from the Sixteenth? He posted a coupla months there on a floater outside the French embassy. He met Jackie Kennedy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTY>
<BROOKLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Curran, that fuckin' noodlehead. He probably wrote her up for letting her dog dump on Rockefeller's doorstep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROOKLYN>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MIKE, trying to swallow a mouthful of potato salad as a plump and pretty middle-aged woman (HELEN GREENING) pulls him into a bear hug, planting a kiss on him.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmmmmm-glimmmeee-kisss! I'm so proud of you! What the hell took you so long?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, don't ask me. Ask the man who put in the good word.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON T.J. GREENING, Helen's husband, Mike's best friend. He's forty, stocky, looks up, horsing around with some of the kids in the next room.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If T.J. didn't push for me, I never would've made it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<BROOKLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bet your ass... I give you six weeks before you're back on the beat, Keegan, they got no room for hero cops...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROOKLYN>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Appreciate, that vote of confidence, Brook.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<BROOKLYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, am I supportive, or what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROOKLYN>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TOMMY: in the hallway, trying to show SCOTTY'S date -- a "real" BIMBO, who's spilling out of her woolly sweater and tight jeans -- how to stand on his SKATEBOARD. She shrieks a laugh, toppling off. HELEN, passing by with an empty platter, catches the action.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELLIE, another WIFE at the sink, wives all; HELEN enters.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He left Elaine for that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<WIFE_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what about little Scotty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIFE_1>
<DIRECTION>
ELLIE continues washing the dishes as HELEN and the WIFE dry. MIKE enters to get more beers.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
<DIRECTION>
(still staring)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to tie her tits together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That wouldn't be too difficult.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
(overhearing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bet you think she doesn't have a brain in her head. I bet you think the only thing he sees in her is one incredible, dynamite body...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
He GRINS at their blank stares... ELLIE'S EYES wryly following... as he moves on out with his beers.
</DIRECTION>
<HELEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love your husband, Ellie, but he's a real dork.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HELEN>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but he's my dork.

INT. MIKE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Night has descended, PEOPLE talking and laughing quietly, MELLOW music is playing -- CAMERA FINDING MIKE AND ELLIE, dancing close, moving sensually. It's impressive. HELEN convinces T.J. to DANCE. SCOTTY and BIMBO join in too. T.J., whipped, extricates himself and Helen; tousling Mike's hair in affection.
</DIRECTION>
<T_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're goin'. Get some sleep, Detective Keegan. You got a new job tomorrow.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?

</MIKE>
<ELLIE>

MIKE smiles and climbs the stairs.

INT. MIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELLIE in the bathroom, the door open, she brushes her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE in bed, thoughtful, a happy man.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own. We can afford it now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amen to that. The supermarket's full of assholes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take my advice, don't buy any...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE waits for a response. None comes.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mike?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
(aware of her change in tone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

</MIKE>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My ass if falling.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(appears in the door; stricken)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get in bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I gonna do? I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got a great ass! I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
She does -- the lights snap put. They giggle, she MOVING into his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(a declaration)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me?
	</DIALOGUE>

</MIKE>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Another muted laugh -- and they move into an EMBRACE, CAMERA PANNING WITH THEM, and then STILL FARTHER INTO THE DARKNESS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DARKNESS HOLDS.

EXT. EAST RIVER - (AERIAL) - NIGHT

... Becoming a darkness pricked with light, as WE FLOAT over the reflective river, MOVING WEST TOWARD AND OVER THE CITY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MANHATTAN - (AERIAL CONTINUED) - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fabled city, the ultimate object of man's desire and fulfillment, Oz, the city unfolding itself before and beneath us, till DAZZLING SHAFTS OF LIGHT sizzling up -- KLEIG LIGHTS -- stab our eyes and bring us down into their BLINDING BRIGHTNESS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CLUB - MIDTOWN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A nondescript piece of rundown city block that's the hottest thing in town. PERSONNEL regulate the CROWD and ARRIVALS. There is a public line, and from it the young, hip and outrageous can look on while awaiting entrance at the formally dressed, stylishly gowned GUESTS arriving at the private line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A glittering post-Metropolitan Museum of Art opening gala is in progress tonight. The club's private entrance looks like what it once was, a shuttered porno bookstore, and the joke's not lost on most of the formal GUESTS, arriving through the X-rated doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLUB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The latest achievement of money, rock and art. It's a breathtaking multi-leveled theater of light, sound and dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is also an entrance-by-invitation-only grand salon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The GUESTS arriving here for the Met gala enter almost in enchanted procession, each of them being personally greeted by the primary owner and manager of the club, WIN HOCKINGS, a charming, rakish ex-preppy. WIN stands in the middle of the floor in the throw of a spot, greeting. This is his element and his club, a son of old money, and a crossover creature to the fast life.
</DIRECTION>
<WIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi... nice to see you... thank you... my pleasure...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIN>
<A_MET_BENEFACTRESS>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you so much for agreeing to host us tonight. It's really extraordinary!

<WIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Glad I could be of help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIN>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA MOVING IN ON A NEW ANGLE, CLAIRE GREGORY and NEIL STEINHART. The way our CAMERA covers them makes it clear they are major characters in our story. NEIL steps forward to introduce himself, but WIN, looking up, spots CLAIRE first: A special beauty and clearly someone very special to him...
</DIRECTION>
<WIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claire!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIN>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Win.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
And he embraces her.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
(introducing her companion)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know Neil Steinhart?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
He grins broadly, taking NEIL'S hand; then right back to CLAIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<WIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of the filthy rich Steinharts? Why is it Claire always connects with the richest men this side of Saudi?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIN>
<NEIL>
<DIRECTION>
(to Win; meaning the club)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This gives new meaning to the word nightlife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEIL>
<DIRECTION>
WIN acknowledges the obligatory compliment with a closed smile, impatiently returning to CLAIRE:
</DIRECTION>
<WIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, let's get outa this lowbrow rag trade...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles, cutting Neil out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't mind, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIN>
<DIRECTION>
NEIL stares, polite, as WIN whisks her away; turning, as he is addressed by someone else coming his way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE CLUB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as a BLACK PORSCHE PULLS UP, its dark-tinted window rolling down TO REVEAL JOEY VENZA. The MANAGER of the club comes over to him, with a clipboard list of only the invitees.
</DIRECTION>
<MANAGER>
<DIRECTION>
(a dilemma)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Mr. Venza...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANAGER>
<DIRECTION>
VENZA jams the ACCELERATOR to the FLOOR, the CAR burning rubber like a DRAGSTER as PEOPLE SQUEAL and JUMP OUT of the way; the CAR fish-tailing away, screeching AROUND the CORNER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLUB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIN and CLAIRE. The music, noise, other conversations can still be heard as they walk through the club.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles, mid-conversation; there's a real affection here.
</DIRECTION>
<WIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Skiddy and Kit? I haven't seen them since that shitty pasta dinner on the cape.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIN>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They've got two monsters now. Both boys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<WIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so what's with Steinhart? Is it serious?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIN>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You didn't like him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<WIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks a little constipated to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIN>
<CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VENZA entering, a rush, NOISE and ACTIVITY from the alley outside; the throbbing new MUSIC overhead.

JOEY VENZA

Immaculate as always, in a conservatively-cut European pinstripe, VENZA strides tautly into the shabby corridors.

<DIRECTION>
INT. MEZZANINE - MAIN BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIN shows CLAIRE the main dance floor below, sound-filled and crowded, private and paying GUESTS mixing, indistinguishable now. He raises his voice to be heard.
</DIRECTION>
<WIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The main floor stays public. The side rooms we try to keep available for special functions like tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIN>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and takes her arm.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's terrific Win.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<WIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You still writing the occasional magazine article?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIN>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Occasionally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<WIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then c'mon. Follow me. The art's in the basement, you're going to get a privileged peek.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIN>
<DIRECTION>
He leads her to the freight elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claire!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
A sociable FOURSOME descends on them. It looks like it's going to be a long conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<WIN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Claire, quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just press the button all the way down when you're ready, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIN>
<DIRECTION>
He turns as she's engulfed, heading towards the elevator, runs into NEIL, CLAIRE'S escort. NEIL doesn't see her.
</DIRECTION>
<NEIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's she go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEIL>
<WIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably found somebody nicer... Kidding. You're great.

</WIN>

He smiles, entering the elevator and disappearing from view. NEIL looking around, with thinly-veiled impatience, at the benefit-types streaming into the room.

VENZA navigates the labyrinth that connects to the offices.

<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator reaches bottom. WIN exits into an area of tall rows of stacked boxes still awaiting unloading. Beyond, a bright, high-ceilinged linen whiteness gleams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a soon-to-be restaurant-gallery area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE RESTAURANT GALLERY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The walls have already been painted white. Tables have been positioned. Chairs are stacked, waiting. So are mounds of folded laundry and tablecloths, boxes of accessories, glass and dish and kitchenware, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Except for FRED, the elderly stock boy, the bright silence is empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRED scores open the sealed cardboard cartons with a curved case cutter. Several tablefuls of unloaded servers, kitchen utensils, etc., bear witness to the size of his job.
</DIRECTION>
<WIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're in overtime, Freddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIN>

FRED nods, putting down his case cutter, using a side exit.

WIN, left alone, turns to look up proudly at his powerhouse modern art collection lining the wall.

INT. BASEMENT TUNNELS - NIGHT

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FREIGHT ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLAIRE closes her eyes, leaning back against the metal walls, taking advantage of the refuge for the moment. Music and crowd noise still vibrate. The elevator, shuddering, continues its descent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIN turns in the silence, looking out over the bright space edged by darkness, every reason to be pleased.
</DIRECTION>

WIN doesn't even hear VENZA enter.

WIN turns.

	Your ex-partner... I'm buying you out, Joey. Read the contract. There's ample provision.

<WIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're making an eighty percent return. Which is what you wanted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WIN>

WIN turn away from VENZA. VENZA grabs his arm violently.

<DIRECTION>
hearing, emerges into the light, smiling, thinking WIN'S saying something she's supposed to respond to.
</DIRECTION>

VENZA continues to attack him, stabbing WIN to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLAIRE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
screams, unable to imagine or believe it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VENZA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looks up, hearing her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIN sprawls, a lifeless, bloodied mass at VENZA'S feet. VENZA stares, returning CLAIRE'S stare, trying to concentrate, to focus and pull himself back together. He puts down the cutter, taking a step toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLAIRE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
steps back, turning and moving back toward the elevator, running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VENZA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
quickens his step, after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE ELEVATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she REACHES IT and HURTLES inward, HITTING all the BUTTONS, the doors beginning to RUMBLE CLOSED. But VENZA is there, THRUSTING HIS HAND INSIDE to stop them. The doors CLOSE on his fingers. He cries out, pulling his fingers free. He slams his fist against the doors as they close shut, POUNDS the button again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INSIDE - CLAIRE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But CLAIRE grabs the POWER SWITCH, pulling it -- the elevator goes dead, the overhead lights go out -- and somewhere, in the shaft above, an ALARM BELL begins to RING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Relentlessly, VENZA pounds on the other side of the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON CLAIRE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
giving way in the darkened cubicle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - CLAIRE
</DIRECTION>

sagging against the elevator wall, weeping, hearing VENZA'S FRANTIC BREATHING on the other side subside, and finally move away in the darkness.

INT. MIKE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

The PHONE RINGING -- a hand fumbling on the telephone in the darkness. WE HEAR MIKE'S VOICE as he turns on the light.

<DIRECTION>
A rare tableau; swirling disco lights reflecting off strategically placed mirrors, illuminating a room filled with POLICEMEN (in uniforms and polyester suits), trying to ride herd on the BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE, in contrasting attire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man in charge and coping is LIEUTENANT GARBER; in plainclothes, fiftyish, rough-hewn.
</DIRECTION>
<GARBER>

</MIKE>
<T_J>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bad fuckin' news. Even the families dropped him when they found they had a fruitcake on their hands. But he knows where a lot of bodies are buried. It'd cap it for Garber if he could bring him in.

INT. MIKE'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE is in the kitchen; he's making eggs in agitation, throwing in everything he can find (tuna fish, chopped pickles, mustard), his kid, TOMMY, in evidence in the b.g., on a SKATEBOARD, whizzing through the kitchen, even RIDING IT down the STAIRS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE MOVES TO A CABINET -- and his FEET GO OUT FROM UNDER HIM. He's slipped on a SKATEBOARD -- barely catching himself in time.

	Tommy! Goddamnit! Get these skateboards off the goddamn kitchen floor!

</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'll live with it, I've lived with it all my life. My Dad was a cop, he said, "whatever you do, honey, never go out with a cop". So, what did I do? I got a job with the cops. Then I married a cop. I probably gave birth to a cop.

Out front, the DOORMAN opens the door for the building's children returning from music lessons.

Across the street in Central Park, handsome, elderly tenants stroll in the company of their nurse: a nanny pushes a pram, taking advantage of the last light.

<NEIL>

There's an enormous circular bathtub and a Jacuzzi, endless mirrors, a writing desk, carpeted, a place one could spend one's life in -- MIKE SEEN, in the MIRRORS, wandering through -- idly pushing a mirrored door open, to gaze, in awe, at the walk-in closet.

All silent; MIKE on "watch". Just him and a wooden desk chair, the grade-school variety. No books, no crossword puzzles; he came unprepared. He checks his watch and looks to an ornate wall clock. And he's bored. He picks up an empty coffee cup, looking for a last drop. Settles for sniffing it. Replaces it on the floor beside him. Then he looks to the closed doors of the apartment and makes a decision. Picking up the coffee cup, he quietly pushes the DOORS OPEN, and ENTERS.

INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As MIKE pads quietly across the marble floors in the quiet; pausing to gaze, in awe, at the vast, empty LIVING ROOM. It is gigantic, his eyes roaming the ceilings, as though to estimate their height.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving inward, his eyes fall on a BOOK RACK, and he crosses to it, perusing the shelves for possible reading material.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're all ART BOOKS, the big, thick kind. A Renoir, because of a NUDE FIGURE on the cover, catches his eye. But as he pulls it out and begins to leaf through -- he HEARS VOICES. CLAIRE'S and NEIL'S; her tone is agitated.
</DIRECTION>
<NEIL>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.) (barely audible)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... just saying you should think twice about it...

	<DIALOGUE>
	... I don't want to talk about it...

CLOSE ON MIKE: book under his arm, quietly moving toward the SOURCE: the DEN. It's door is slightly ajar; there is a suitcase in front of it, ready for travel.

She looks at him; a beat, emotionally. He remains steady.

ANGLE - DEN. NEIL takes her in his arms, holding her tightly, affectionately, protectively. Holding her from behind, NEIL KISSES CLAIRE gently on her neck. She calms in his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RETURN: MIKE DODGES back quickly, through the living and dining rooms until he's in the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spotting the microwave, MIKE QUICKLY TOSSES in an English muffin -- peering at the dials, as he switches it on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he hasn't escaped being a trespasser to what's going on in the far room. He can still HEAR THEM, though HE WHISTLES, trying not to.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The English muffin BURSTS INTO FLAMES, MIKE desperately pulling it out, tossing it into the sink, feverishly fanning the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE ON MIKE: becoming aware that HE'S NOT ALONE. He TURNS SUDDENLY to see MARY, the housekeeper, not ten feet from him, in the laundry room, coat on, fluffing her collar, ready to go home.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
<DIRECTION>

INT. VESTIBULE - LATER - NIGHT

NEIL, with his briefcase, finally leaving. He crosses from the hallway.

The TWO EYE EACH OTHER: MIKE attempting a cordial smile.

<NEIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're here 'til what time?

<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
NEIL noticing the Renoir.
</DIRECTION>
<NEIL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you're through with it, put it back, please, exactly where you found it, and don't use the library again. I have to leave town for a few days. Let's do everything we can to make this less of a trial for her, shall we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEIL>

MIKE NODS. But when NEIL leaves, he makes a mock "military salute"; a click of the heels.

INT. CLAIRE'S VESTIBULE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
2:45 A.M. (the clock ON THE WALL); pindrop silence; MIKE alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MIKE: thoughtful, leafing through the Renoir. Like a man making the most of solitary confinement -- becoming aware of a NOISE. Though hard to make out in this windowless capsule, it is DISTANT THUNDER. It stirs life in him and his eyes wander reflexively upward, studying the ceiling -- then the doors of the apartment, left slightly ajar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE INSIDE THE APARTMENT: CAMERA FOLLOWING MIKE as he wanders inward, becoming aware of light coming from a drawing room. HE MOVES TOWARD, STOPPING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE FROM HIS POV: CLAIRE, dimly illuminated by the light of a desk lamp that throws a gentle glow around her -- seated, still as statuary, gazing out into the rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MIKE: watching her.

<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:

INT. SUBWAY - ON THE MOVE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The uncivilized hour indicated by the TOTALLY EMPTY SUBWAY, MIKE a lone figure, somewhat numbed, his eyes set into distant space -- as the SUBWAY reaches its DESTINATION, the blurry platform signs decelerating until we can make out the word "QUEENS".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MIKE'S HOUSE - QUEENS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The neighborhood still asleep in the predawn hour; MIKE picks up the newspaper... glancing at it, he opens it, sees an article and photograph of CLAIRE on the second page. He heads inwards...

INT. MIKE'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Afternoon sunlight SPILLING IN as MIKE AWAKENS to the SOUND of a CAR MOTOR, faltering, then "chug-chugging" to another start, gasping, then revving. Someone's working on MIKE'S car. He looks at his alarm clock; it's 4:00 in the afternoon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
EXT. MIKE'S BACKYARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELLIE and TOMMY visible only as fragments as they work on MIKE'S car. ELLIE IS SEEN as a rear-end in blue jeans, the rest of her inside the hood; she calls to TOMMY to "try it again". It looks like no one's behind the wheel; but the very top of his head CAN BE SEEN as he strains to reach the accelerator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MIKE: appearing at the door, in a freshly pressed suit, a steaming cup of coffee in hand. He walks across the lawn towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! What the hell're you doin' to my car?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
ELLIE emerges from underneath the hood, flushed.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Changing the sparks. They showed it on TV. What d'you think?

</ELLIE>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think television's a dangerous thing.

</MIKE>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's twenty bucks in the bank.

Slamming the hood. TOMMY revs the engine ELLIE moving down the steps towards MIKE.

<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough, Tommy! C'mon. Get out of there!

</ELLIE>

ELLIE moving towards MIKE, she slipping her hand into his underpants: Their eyes meet, lovingly. She laughs.

<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. The neighbors.

</MIKE>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let 'em eat their hearts out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
She retrieves her cold coffee cup from the POTTING TABLE, checks out the picture of CLAIRE in the newspaper, he's left there. MIKE adjusts his tie. It's very colorful.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I read the article. You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.

</ELLIE>
<MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
(Mister Honest)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, actually, she looks better than that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
ELLIE playfully makes a move, JABBING AT HIM, MIKE stops her, ending WITH A HUG.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE kisses her. ELLIE holds MIKE'S face with her gloved hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you Tommy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON ELLIE: as TOMMY comes up and leans against his mom: both watching MIKE primp, they share on the joke. MIKE turns, his face with grease on it.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unbelievably handsome. You look fantastic in a suit.

INT. CLAIRE'S KITCHEN - LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WALL CLOCK reads 6:30. The remains of a teeny gourmet meal, before him on the kitchen table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE is playing an improvised hockey game, shooting peas through a goal made up of two water glasses, using his knife as a hockey stick. He HEARS the CLICK of HIGH HEELS approaching, crossing the vast marble floors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE FROM HIS POV: CLAIRE coming toward -- clearly dressed for the evening, her stride signaling determination.

	I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...

	Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?

</CLAIRE>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. That's true.

</MIKE>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>

She MOVES TOWARDS THE ELEVATOR: MIKE, stymied.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR - SAME - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They descend in silence, MIKE aware of being scrutinized. The ELEVATOR STOPS, MIKE about to get off, realizing they're stopped at the THIRD FLOOR, another TENANT stepping on. He's dressed in an expensive JOGGING SUIT, his key dangling from around his neck; he nods to CLAIRE and pushes "DOWN". The elevator RUMBLES downward.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have another tie? Something more conservative?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<MIKE>
<DIRECTION>

EXT. CLAIRE'S BUILDING - SAME - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The JOGGER first out the door, taking off with fierce determination, followed by MIKE, who nervously checks the street, then opens the limo door and checks inside, then, finally, MOTIONS CLAIRE OUT. She moves smoothly into the limo; MIKE checks traffic behind them, then gets in, after.

</CLAIRE>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He thinks you're being a little careless. He made the point several times.

</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE sets down the phone. They settle back; trying to feel "comfortable" in one another's presence. It's plenty awkward.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move it.

He flashes his shield at the PATROLMAN, takes a firm grip on CLAIRE'S elbow, guiding her in.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - AT THE ENTRANCE DOORS

MIKE stiff-arms the revolving door, stopping outgoing shoppers to clear the way for CLAIRE; hops over to the fixed door, opening it quickly for her, hustling her effortlessly in, zip.

CLAIRE steps onto the ESCALATOR; MIKE on alert, scrutinizing the crowd. He gets on right behind. They ascend.

At the top LANDING, A DARK-SUITED MAN VEERS RIGHT INTO HER. CLAIRE flinches. MIKE MOVES PAST HER to the front, quickly handling the guy. The MAN jumps back.

CLOSE ON MIKE: Not amused. CLAIRE heads to the ladies' room across from the bar. MIKE watches her enter. Turns back to the bar, which is very busy and confused.

CLOSE ON CLAIRE, inside a stall SHE HEARS FOOTSTEPS QUIETLY ENTER, followed by a CLICK of a DOOR. It's not the click of a stall door, because the FOOTSTEPS then proceed inward; WE HEAR A STALL DOOR CLOSE and LOCK. It gives her momentary pause, but she dismisses it, looking for her purse -- realizing she left it on the sink -- opening her stall door and heading out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She barely hears the "click" of the bolt sliding behind her -- and looks up, into the MIRROR, SEEING VENZA appear behind her. She SPINS -- but doesn't have time to CRY OUT. He's grabbed her by the THROAT.

CLOSE ON CLAIRE: her eyes wide with TERROR. He rubs his thumb across her mouth, smearing the lipstick.

CLOSE ON MIKE: RELIEVED BUT SHOCKED to see CLAIRE, disheveled, lipstick smeared across her mouth, throat and face, but otherwise uninjured.

ANGLE: He sees VENZA get into the ELEVATOR. These is only one place for it to go -- DOWN. MIKE CHANGES DIRECTION and FRANTICALLY RUNS DOWN THE SPIRALING RAMP trying to keep pace with the descent of the elevator. At the GROUND LEVEL HE SEES THE ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN and VENZA EXITS AMIDST THE PARTY.

ANGLE ON VENZA: untroubled, turning; raising his arms, and SMILING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MIKE: confused -- seeing that the man VENZA stopped to talk to is a PATROLMAN, he'd stopped to give himself up.

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PATROL CAR keeping pace as the two walk home; the COPS in the BLACK-AND-WHITE exchange a look at what they are seeing. MIKE is holding her arm, she's huddled up; she is cold and he removes his topcoat and puts it around her shoulders.

INT. CLAIRE'S ELEVATOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they ride up in silence -- on opposite sides of the elevator -- looking at each other. It comes to a stop, and neither moves; the tension is palpable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She steps out first, he follows. She moves to the doors and stops -- her shoulders visibly relaxing as he moves up behind her. But he stops, too. And she turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE: Both captive to indecision. It is he who makes it, just by staying immobile for too long. She smiles and takes off her coat, holding it out to him. And in the moment of exchange is the return to reality.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night, Mike.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sleep good.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tell me it was "no big deal," it was out of line, it makes you look like an asshole, and it makes me look like an asshole. She's coming in, in a few minutes to I.D. Venza. If Steinhart's with her, I want you to apologize.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(in motion)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get this over with...

In the room next to the corridor, KOONTZ interrupts the shift already there, entering.

<KOONTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, we're gonna have a line-up here...

<GARBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, Miss Gregory.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARBER>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE AND CLAIRE catch each other's eyes. He sees how nervous she is.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was my fault not Detective Keegan's, I'm sorry for all the fuss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
NEIL catches MIKE'S glance at her; reassures himself with a glance at CLAIRE, straightens, still steamed from last night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GARBER picks up on it, not liking the tension, especially not now; his eyes throw daggers at MIKE.
</DIRECTION>
<GARBER>

INT. VIEWING ROOM - SAME - DAY
</DIRECTION>

They crowd in; another MAN already standing there -- VENZA'S PARK AVENUE LAWYER. A one-way window looks into the brightness of the line-up (squad) room that's emptied now and undergoing preparation by KOONTZ.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GARBER to CLAIRE, a professional reassurance.

<GARBER>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good luck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARBER>
<DIRECTION>
With that, GARBER leads NEIL out. NEIL manages a final concerned stare at CLAIRE before he goes. The DOOR CLOSES. MIKE, CLAIRE, and an unruffled MR. NEUMAN, THE LAWYER, are left alone in the cramped space.

KOONTZ beckons VENZA and the OTHER FOUR LINE-UP PARTICIPANTS IN.

	Okay, take a seat... you, put a couple phone books under your rear...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KOONTZ>
<DIRECTION>
VENZA enters confidently, with the others. He's number three. He takes his place, staring unconcernedly past the bright lights toward the direction of the mirrored window, as if he could see through it, into CLAIRE'S EYES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VIEWING ROOM - SAME - DAY

CLAIRE, staring expressionless, her eyes etched with fear. MIKE aware of that fear. VENZA'S LAWYER waiting patiently, casually.

<NEIL>

He steps forward with her drink.
</DIRECTION>
<NEIL>

	The change would do you a world of good.

She straightens, suddenly attentive, in response to something on the TV.

It's a REPORT FROM OUTSIDE THE COURTHOUSE, with the TV NEWSMAN reporting:

Clenching his fists, MIKE PACES in frustration, then SLAMS his fist against the wall -- NOTICING the door has failed to FULLY SHUT.

A shuffling SOUND, something moving, outside.

<DIRECTION>
She stirs, sitting up, listening.

As MIKE rounds the corner and looks up. His breath catches. His heart starts to pound.

INT. MIKE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE hurries in. The room is bright. SCOTTY and another cop, BROOKLYN from the 117th, look up from the kitchen table, nursing cups of coffee. BROOKLYN is on duty; SCOTTY has come over on his own.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TOMMY has long since been ushered back to bed. ELLIE making coffee at the stove, turns as MIKE enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is okay, returning MIKE'S stare with embarrassment.

<SCOTTY>

She turns to her table to resume work. Scribbled pages litter the surface. Her hands betray her. It's an effort of will. MIKE enters, moving closer.

Beginning to cry, she feels his embrace, turning into it.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>

THE LIGHTS of New York beginning to sparkle against a darkening sky; MIKE and ELLIE at a table that looks out on the East River. It's an OK restaurant, not the poshest in the world. ELLIE finds herself carrying most of the conversation. They scan menus to order.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>

	Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today? He misses you...

</MIKE>
<ELLIE>

(carefully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike. To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.

MIKE is nonplused; not knowing how to respond.

He shakes his head, dismissively.

No response; MIKE having trouble with it.

CLOSE ON ELLIE: sensing deception. Her eyes begin to glisten.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MIKE: seeing her distress. Unable to hide his own.
</DIRECTION>

She looks at him -- and knowing him as well as she does, is certain. She puts a hand in front of her mouth in an attempt not to cry.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, what is it? Is it serious or what...? Quit looking at me like that! What's with this ridiculous silence?!

It's happening: A dainty teenage VIETNAMESE GIRL, distracts the DOORMAN at his post, getting enough of his attention SELLING FLOWERS, and SPOUTING VIETNAMESE, for the "JOGGER" to SLIP BY, making it inside.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MIKE: as always, AFFECTED BY HER.

She becomes aware of his presence and slowly TURNS. For a long moment, neither seems willing to move -- or speak. Finally, he does.

As the ELEVATOR slides to a stop, its DOOR GLIDING OPEN. THE KILLER, keeping himself flattened back out of sight, glances quickly out, gun and reflexes at the ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's unnecessary. The vestibule's deserted; T.J.'S post is momentarily empty.

As T.J. emerges from the bathroom. He stretches, trying to shake his fatigue. Making a decision, he HEADS for the KITCHEN to get a cup of coffee -- CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM as he ENTERS, snapping on the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING directly to the stove, he examines the Mr. Coffee; the red "ON" button glows, but the pot is virtually empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Picking it up, he MOVES TO THE SINK, turning on the tap, which is a thin, gooseneck spigot. He look up, hearing a slight SHUFFLE, seeing the KILLER'S FEET sticking out of the shadows of the floor of the LAUNDRY ROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
T.J. reacts -- TOO LATE -- there's a slight chung, and a hole opens up in T.J.'S gut; the bullet that went through him, ricocheting and nicking off the end of the thin, curving tap, sending a stream of water gushing straight up.

CLAIRE asleep in MIKE'S PROTECTIVE EMBRACE: MIKE, awake, his eyes to the bedside table, notices the almost imperceptible disturbance of VIBRATION ripple the surface of the DRINK left there by the clock.

MIKE sits up; as if by instinct, sensing something is wrong. CLAIRE continues to sleep.

INT. CLAIRE'S HALLWAY/OUTER BEDROOM - SAME - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The KILLER OPENS THE BEDROOM SUITE DOOR, steps into the ANTEROOM. Off to the right is the closed DOOR of the BEDROOM. He steps in the direction, reaching the doorknob -- thinks twice about it, though, seeing the door on the other side of the anteroom which would take him the longer, but unexpected route into the bedroom. He backs off, moving silently to the OTHER DOOR, turning it open silently and slipping through into the CLOSET and WALK- THROUGH DRESSING ROOM leading to the bedroom by the far side.

MIKE: on the other side of the door, listening.

INT. DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The KILLER passes the door he wants, thinking it's just another mirror; finds himself in the totally MIRRORED ENVIRONMENT of the MAIN DRESSING AREA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the other side of the door, MIKE HEARS HIM, tightening his grip on his gun and on the doorknob as he REACHES for it. MIKE grasps it, turning and opening the door silently. But the latch connects to the light, and the LIGHT GOES ON OVERHEAD of MIKE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The KILLER reacts quickly, gun drawn, on the turn. But he faces SEVERAL REFLECTIONS OF MIKE in front of him -- and MIKE IS BEHIND HIM.

The KILLER takes his chances, WHIRLING. MIKE FIRES FIRST, NAILING HIM right through the HEAD. The KILLER SPINS AGAIN, SLAMMING UP against the MIRRORS and falling DEAD to the floor.

She TURNS, HURRYING to the VESTIBULE and THE ELEVATOR, pulling the alarm, sagging in collapse. The ALARM goes off within the shaft, THROUGHOUT the building.

</DIRECTION>

FOOTSTEPS are HEARD coming TOWARD; MIKE looks up to see GARBER APPROACHING, his expression appropriate to the occasion. GARBER reaches him; they exchange a long look, MIKE'S eyes etched with anguish.

	I don't know... but I gotta protect the Precinct, too. You're on suspension, pending Disciplinary Hearings. Don't hold your breath. And you're not to go near that woman until she's no longer under Police protection and this case is closed.

ANGLE ON MIKE: responding with a silent nod as GARBER stands looking down at him.

	Is it "love," Mike? I hope so. I want it to be worth it, for your sake.

No response.

In the response that follows, they HEAR MOVEMENT at the end of the HALL, looking up to see the silhouetted figures of ELLIE, with HELEN GREENING in tow. They look small, and lost, framed against a floor-to-ceiling window that's beginning to illuminate with the first light of day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heavy with sadness, GARBER turns and heads toward the women. Taking a long moment. MIKE decides not to follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MIKE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA STAYS AT THIS DISTANCE as the THREESOME comes together. We do not hear their words, but sense the emotion by what WE SEE. After a brief exchange of words, GARBER takes HELEN GREENING under his arm, and they MOVE AWAY -- leaving MIKE and ELLIE alone.

INT. MILTON GREGORY - BANQUET HALL - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Overhead, chandeliers gleam. A small orchestra comprised of STUDENTS of the school plays a variety of tunes. Mirrors reflect a profusion of flowers, carved gilt and candlelight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gloved service PERSONNEL wait to be of service at the sides. The room is quite large yet intimate. The tables set perfectly. GUESTS continue to move toward their places engaged in animated chatter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE: CLAIRE moving through the crowd, PLAINCLOTHESMEN flanking her as anonymously as possible (KOONTZ among them), HER EYES anxious, scanning the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHE'S SPOTTED by the PRINCIPAL of the school (GIDDINGS), who APPROACHES, surprised to see her.
</DIRECTION>
<GIDDINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Claire. How extraordinary that you came.

INT. THE BANQUET ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPEECHES droning on -- CAMERA FINDING CLAIRE at a round dinner table, with OTHERS, who think they're engaging her in conversation; but her thoughts are elsewhere, her eyes continually glancing toward the doors -- both hoping and fearing.
</DIRECTION>

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. THE BANQUET ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SPEECHES have long since ENDED, PEOPLE DANCING, slow dances to the live orchestra -- CAMERA PANNING to CLAIRE, sitting in silent isolation at the now sparsely populated table, having lost hope, feeling utterly alone. Her chin is resting in her hand, her eyes fixed sadly on her wine glass. PLAINCLOTHESMEN, situated around her, study her dispassionately.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON HER FACE: expressionless. But it slowly gains animation, as she realizes the MUSIC has changed, made a segue to something new. It's "SOMEONE TO WATCH OVER ME."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHE LOOKS UP -- to see MIKE; his approach from the bandstand indicating that the change of music was his doing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER FACE breaks into the most enormous, and grateful, GRIN.

They TAKE to the FLOOR, she MOVING INTO HIS ARMS. She puts her head on his shoulder, then draws back to look at him, studying his face with the hunger of a woman who knows it might be for the last time.

The conversation is deeply caring; the tone opposite to the words.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd miss my life...

</MIKE>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>

She rests her head on his shoulders again; they continue to dance.

He holds her tight -- his eyes EMOTIONAL as they roam the room --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But HIS EXPRESSION CHANGES as he SPOTS SOMETHING at a far end of the room. Near the rear doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a PLAINCLOTHESMEN, headed purposefully toward KOONTZ, conferring with him -- both men looking to MIKE, a sense of bewilderment in their eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON MIKE: Stopping -- as KOONTZ heads quickly toward.
</DIRECTION>
<KOONTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brook's patching a call through to you. He thought he'd find you here. It sounds urgent.

It goes dead. MIKE PARALYZED with FEAR. CLAIRE is ENTERING, PLAINCLOTHESMAN #1 close to her heels, MIKE'S breath coming in SHUDDERS as he stares helplessly at her -- then turns to the PLAINCLOTHESMAN and KOONTZ.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TOMMY: in a near HEADSTAND, his small hands managing to TOUCH THE TAPE, his fingernails futilely attempting to DIG BENEATH IT -- as the FOOTSTEPS continue to APPROACH down the DARKENED HALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE FIGURE: almost at the kitchen door -- about to STEP INTO THE LIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch your step!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<VENZA>
<DIRECTION>
(rising)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck you doin'?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VENZA>
<DIRECTION>
TOMMY'S HANDS are on the GUN.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a skateboard in the door!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
With a sudden SOUND of TAPE "RIPPING" from under the TABLE. ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. TOMMY ROLLS, THRUSTING THE GUN INTO MIKE'S HAND as the FIGURE at the DOOR KICKS THE SKATEBOARD, sending it ZOOMING INTO THE ROOM. VENZA LEAPS ASIDE AND FIRES, the FIGURE at the DOOR OPENING FIRE in RETURN. MIKE LEAPS FOR ELLIE, knocking her off her CHAIR, rolling FAST as the ENTIRE KITCHEN ERUPTS IN GUNFIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON ELLIE: throwing herself OVER TOMMY, BULLETS "PINGING" AROUND MIKE as he ROLLS, RETURNING THE FIRE. The pitch-black kitchen shudders with BANGS and FLASHES like the Fourth of July, mixed with the "WHINE" of bullets hitting pots and pans, and the sight of BODIES hurtling through the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The "FIGURE AT THE DOOR" is firing with both hands, SCORING A HIT ON VENZA'S ACCOMPLICE, who goes down, wounded, HIS GUN CLATTERING to the FLOOR. He REACHES for it, but ELLIE GETS THERE FIRST, grabbing it with her two hands tied in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Tommy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
The ACCOMPLICE is staggering upward as ELLIE gets to her feet, SQUARING OFF in POLICE STANCE -- and FIRES, catching him square between the SHOULDER BLADES; HE SPINS, crashing BACKWARDS through the GLASS DOOR -- SWISH-PAN to VENZA, trying to get out THE KITCHEN WINDOW...
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn around, fuck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
He DOES, BLASTED by MIKE, and the "FIGURE" in the door, SIMULTANEOUSLY. He falls out the window, but still has life in him, staggering to his feet, and hit by SPOTLIGHTS from the CARS OUTSIDE. In a sudden barrage, he's hit by CROSSFIRE, SPINNING, LURCHING -- finally going down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then all is quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE THE KITCHEN -- all sound and movement has suddenly ceased; everyone is a state of shock.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(desperate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tommy...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ellie...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<ELLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
The overhead LIGHT is SNAPPED ON by the "FIGURE" in the doorway -- revealing it to be KOONTZ. In CLAIRE'S DRESS. Guns in both hands, still smoking.
</DIRECTION>
<KOONTZ>
<DIRECTION>
(emphatic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuckin' miracle, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KOONTZ>
<DIRECTION>
In the BACKGROUND distant SIRENS are HEARD heading toward. The SWAT squad. CAMERA MOVING ACROSS THE FACES OF ELLIE, TOMMY, MIKE... and KOONTZ; all holding in place. Listening to them come.
</DIRECTION>
<KOONTZ>
<DIRECTION>
(re: the sirens)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Told you they'd be here in a few minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KOONTZ>
<DIRECTION>
The grim humor of it is registered in SILENCE. MIKE picks up VENZA'S HUNTING KNIFE from the floor, cutting through the ropes that bind TOMMY'S and ELLIE'S HANDS; she PULLS TOMMY to HER, in a tearful EMBRACE, shielding his face from the ghastly sight of the man, lying dead, on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OTHER PEOPLE are MOVING INWARD, CLAIRE among them, clad in an OVERSIZED POLICE OVERCOAT -- looking frail and frightened, SHUDDERING WITH RELIEF when she sees that all are safe. But there is no mistaking the presence of something else in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON CLAIRE'S FACE: gazing at MIKE, his family wrapped in his protective embrace. He LOOKS UP, meeting her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone's all right...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. It's all over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
LONG ANGLE on the ROOM: dimly illuminated by the single light, shed from the opened refrigerator door, as people begin to move -- awakening to life, and its necessary details, in the aftermath of the crisis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE HOUSE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The LAWN virtually FILLED with POLICE VEHICLES, their revolving red lights illuminating the grim scene; a small gathering of onlookers gawking from behind police ropes, AMBULANCES pulling SLOWLY, SILENTLY, away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS to two figures ALONE, beside a squad car, in the distant shadows. It's CLAIRE, still clad in the police overcoat, and MIKE. They are together, but separate, maintaining the proper distance to say goodbye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER ANGLE ON THEM: not knowing quite what to say.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON BOTH: their eyes locked into each other's.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You still going away?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to, now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's probably still a good idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MIKE: getting her message.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Both are hurting.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
(heartfelt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll miss you, Mike.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, I'll... see you again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes are glistening; she gives him a bracing smile. But he can't quiet manage it.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
(barely able to speak)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say goodbye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
He struggles with it; unable.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like your coat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<CLAIRE>
<DIRECTION>
(half-laugh, half-cry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Silence now; their eyes adoring.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say goodbye, Mike.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAIRE>
<MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
(thick voiced)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You take care.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE TURNS -- CAMERA MOVING WITH HIM as he WALKS SLOWLY AWAY -- finding himself on a collision course with GARBER. They meet, spending a long moment in non-communicative greeting.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
(finally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any chance? There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<GARBER>
<DIRECTION>
(noncommittal)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call me next week. We'll talk about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GARBER>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE absorbs it, looking up to SEE ELLIE and TOMMY, beside a SQUAD CAR, a distance away. Girding himself, he HEADS TOWARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON ELLIE AND TOMMY -- as he APPROACHES, and stands beside them. Not much to say. Finally he reaches out and tousles TOMMY'S hair.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good police work, kiddo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
He catches ELLIE'S eye, both assessing each other.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLIE>
<DIRECTION>
(re: Tommy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He doesn't want to sleep here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a long beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neither do I. It's not my house anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLIE>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me neither.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON ALL: finding each other's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's find some place to start over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
MIKE puts an arm AROUND TOMMY -- and the CAMERA BEGINS A LONG PULLBACK, as ELLIE moves to his side, and the KEEGAN FAMILY begins to MOVE AWAY. WE SEE CLAIRE, being helped into a SQUAD CAR, turning to look back at them as it PULLS AWAY -- CARS REVVING UP and PULLING OUT, in ALL DIRECTIONS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From a distance, we HEAR MIKE'S VOICE.
</DIRECTION>
<MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (to Ellie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What this crap about singing lessons?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIKE>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
