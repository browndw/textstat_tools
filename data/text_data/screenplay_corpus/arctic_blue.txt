EXT. BOREAL FOREST - ALASKA - (AERIAL SHOT) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flying. Not at the intangible height of a jet, but at spitting distance from the treetops. We're in central Alaska, the Big Lonely, just north of the Arctic Circle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A thick forest follows the contours of mountain foothills like a deep-pile carpet. Up at treeline the forest thins to tundra, a grassy scruff turning red and yellow with the coming of autumn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the horizon, the hills rise to meet the Endicott Mountains, a great fortress wall of granite so sharp and jagged that snow cannot stick to its face. This is how all North America once looked -- raw, indomitable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, abruptly coming into the SCENE is a colossal etching across the landscape too deliberate to be of natural origin. Bisecting this country like a metallic ribbon -- or a scar, depending on your point of view -- is the 800-mile-long Trans-Alaskan Pipeline.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Even the immensity of the pipeline is rendered insignificant by the vastness of the land. It goes on, and on, and on...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lone MAN walks along the Haul Road, a one-lane gravel trail running parallel to the pipeline. The weather turns sour -- rough wind and stinging snow cut across the man's path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man is ERIC DESMOND, twenty-four, clean-shaven, determined. He's clearly out of place here, dressed in a business suit and a light, camel-hair topcoat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric is trying to follow some footprints in the snow -- a predator's tracks, those of a wolf or coyote. But the footprints ahead have faded, covered by the snow and wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The weather becomes more oppressive. Heavy snow, gale winds and sub-zero temperatures make his progress tortuous. Eric strives stubbornly forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric has gathered some branches. He tries to make a fire. Moisture from his breath has frozen in the upturned collar of his insufficient coat, and his skin is split raw from the cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His hands are too numb to hold the matches. After several attempts at striking one, he slumps down next to the pile of wood, exhausted and frustrated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The snow has covered the pile of branches. Eric still sits next to it, partially covered in snow himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ERIC
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His face is a death mask: eyes half-open and dull, lips a purplish blue, bloodless skin crystallizing as it ices over. The wind HOWLS around him. The snow sticks to his eyelashes and hair without melting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END DREAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DARK BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric bolts up in bed. Next to him, ANNE MARIE GAUVIN sits up and hugs him. All that can be seen of her in the dark is a lovely silhouette and a cascade of dark hair. After a moment, Eric kisses her. He shakes off the dream and lies back down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HAUL ROAD AND PIPELINE - CLOSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A metal sign, peppered with shotgun holes, is posted near a pipeline support piling:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PIPELINE UTILITY CORRIDOR. PRIVATE PROPERTY. NO TRESPASSING. NO HUNTING. NO TRAPPING. NO SHOOTING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric walks quietly past the sign, intent on something ahead of him. Although still somewhat boyish in appearance, he's confident and resolute in attitude. His clothes have a distinctly western feel: Lucchese boots, Levis 501's, Mahan cotton shirt. His down parka is unzipped in the sunny, windless, forty-degree afternoon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pauses, then brings to his shoulder a rifle with a four-power scope mounted atop it. He peers through the scope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV - THROUGH SCOPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He puts the crosshairs on the shoulder flank of a big, ivory-white timber wolf, fifty yards away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anne Marie stands beside Eric, a Nikon with a telephoto lens in her hand, holding her breath in anticipation. She's twenty-three, pretty, with soft features and piercing blue eyes. She wears Eddie Bauer woman's gear like she was born in it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric expertly fixes his aim and slowly squeezes the trigger. But instead of a loud retort, there is only the dull POP of a CO2-powered dart gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tranquilizer dart finds its mark in the wolf's fleshy shoulder. The wolf takes off running, but almost immediately slows, sits, then lies down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric and Anne Marie hurry over to the wolf, who is breathing deeply. Eric kneels next to him and strokes his thick fur.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a beauty.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Anne Marie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hand me the transmitter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
Anne Marie passes to Eric a tiny, weatherproof homing device attached to a steel collar band. Eric puts the collar loosely around the wolf's neck and crimps it in place, all the while TALKING soothingly to the semi-conscious animal. Anne Marie smiles at Eric's tenderness and snaps some photos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the collar in place and transmitter activated, Eric backs away while the wolf tries to rouse itself from its narcosis.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>

as she hurries back to their International Scout. On the door of the Scout is a stylized logo of an oil derrick, under which are the words:
</DIRECTION>

	NORTHLAND PETROLEUM CORP.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Anne Marie opens the hatchback and grabs a video camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON ERIC AND THE WOLF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric smiles as the wolf wobbles tentatively to his feet and trots unsteadily away. Near the treeline the wolf turns, glances back at Eric and then disappears into the forest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anne Marie is taping the wolf's retreat. Looking through the viewfinder, she crosses a gully between a pipeline piling and a rock formation. Eric turns toward her and a glint of light in the debris at her feet catches his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anne Marie! Stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
She glances down. Something metal is half-buried in the dead leaves and gravel.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
Eric runs over. He pokes at the object with a stick. With a SNAP, a steel leg trap chomps the stick in half. Anne Marie jumps back. Eric brushes the dead leaves on the ground behind her and she carefully backtracks out of the gully.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn trappers!
	</DIALOGUE>

He angrily rips the trap out of the ground, unearthing several others attached to one another by a long chain.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Takes nerve, laying traplines on restricted land.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
Eric slips the scope off the dart rifle and climbs up the pipeline on foot pegs to the top of an anchoring poINT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Using the scope as a telescope, he scans up and down the Haul Road.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE_MARIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?

<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He still might be around. I saw fresh tire tracks coming in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV - THROUGH SCOPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The road and the pipeline stretch toward either horizon, north and south. In the distance, a jeep is parked on the Haul Road. Near it, a Man climbs down into another shallow ravine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric hurries down the footpegs.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man and a jeep, about a mile and a half down.

He jumps into the Scout. Anne Marie stuffs her cameras into the hatchback. As soon as she climbs in, Eric tears out.

Startled at the APPROACH of the Scout, the Trapper uproots his traps and runs out of the ravine. He WHISTLES and another Trapper appears nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAPPERS' JEEP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pile into their dilapidated, all-terrain jeep. It's oddly well-equipped, however. Bolted to the dashboard is an expensive tape player and a beat-up radio beacon receiver with a round locating screen. They zoom off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCOUT - (MOVING SHOT)

Eric stomps on the gas. The dust from the jeep obscures his view but he's gaining on them anyway. Anne Marie hangs on and squints her eyes against the choking dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAPPERS' JEEP - (MOVING SHOT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driver is LEMALLE (35), a tall, ugly, rawboned Canadian. His entire outfit is made of animal hide. He has long red hair, and a reptilian face usually twisted into a sadistic sneer. While driving, he scans along the pipeline.
</DIRECTION>
<LEMALLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where the fuck did you drop Corbett off?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEMALLE>
<DIRECTION>
In the passenger seat, MITCHELL (38), chews tobacco and looks grim. He's a squat, flat-faced Okie, with curly matted hair and tired grey eyes. He's dressed in a brown long coat and has a Colt .45 Peacemaker in a quick-draw holster strapped to his leg. Despite his intimidating air, confrontation is not his style.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He spots a figure up ahead, where the road crosses a muddy creek.

<MITCHELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's over there.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. HAUL ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Turning sharply, the trappers' jeep splashes through the creek bed without slowing. Bouncing, it comes down hard against the axle-deep bank at the creek's high water mark. LeMalle tries to back out, but can't find traction in the mud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric stops the Scout thirty yards behind them.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Be careful -- there're two of them.

EXT. HAUL ROAD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric confidently approaches the jeep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, a third trapper climbs from the creek. He's got a line of traps slung around his neck and a world of experience on his face. He's BEN CORBETT, a life-long huntsman, somewhere past forty, weathered beyond his years.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has a feral nose, thick beard and dark, smart, hunter's eyes. He wears a hooded cotton sweat shirt, cotton coveralls and vapor-barrier mountain boots. On his belt is a holster rig cradling a .44 magnum revolver.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric slows down. He didn't expect to face anyone as formidable as Corbett.
</DIRECTION>

Emboldened by Corbett's presence, LeMalle reaches into the back seat and grabs his 6.5 by 55 Swedish military carbine.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No shooting. Let's see who's so interested in us.

Corbett has an incongruously affable voice. He throws his traps into the jeep, then strides closer toward Eric.

EXT. HAUL ROAD - CREEK CROSSING - LONG SHOT
</DIRECTION>

As Corbett comes closer, Eric realizes this might not've been a great idea. Corbett squints his eyes and sniffs the air, as if by this he can gauge his opponent's mettle.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got two counts against you -- trapping out of season and poaching on restricted land.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<CORBETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't be much of a crime, if all they got minding the area is a cocky kid.

	I got your plate number, asshole. Maybe you feel like spending a few months in jail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
Corbett just smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But LeMalle, rankled, sticks the carbine out the jeep window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing the rifle pointed at him, Eric freezes, then slowly unzips his parka.
</DIRECTION>
<LEMALLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ben? Sure you don't want me to drop the fucker?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEMALLE>
<DIRECTION>
Corbett doesn't answer. Then, his eyes narrow and he looks past Eric at the Scout.

The passenger in the Scout sticks what looks like another rifle out the window.

Eric quickly glances over his shoulder to make sure Anne Marie's backing him up.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You leave and don't come back, that's the end of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
After a long moment, Corbett smiles again, then turns away from Eric. He motions LeMalle to the front of the jeep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frustrated, LeMalle slams back the safety on the carbine and throws it in the back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TRAPPERS

Mitchell climbs into the jeep and starts the engine. LeMalle and Corbett rock the jeep back and forth in the rut. While pushing, Corbett rips the sole of his boot on a sharp piece of granite. He cusses and pushes harder.

Corbett gets out of the jeep. He regards the Sportsmen, their shotguns and their mess with ill-concealed contempt.

At the edge of town is a gravel airstrip. Mixed with the prospector-era sod-roof cabins are a few prefabricated houses. The boon brought by men building the pipeline is long gone. Now only a few itinerant loggers, natives and bush dwellers remain to fight boredom, each other and the depression of the oncoming winter.

The trappers come in. Corbett sits in a chair and pulls his boots off. One of his wool socks is wet. He nods to the man sitting in the other chair, SAM WILDER. Wilder is short and tough, with a full head of crewcut grey hair and weather- ravaged face that makes him look older than his sixty years.

A chubby Inupiat (interior Eskimo), wearing thick glasses, several heavy sweaters and battery-heated socks, fusses behind the counter. He's EARL KENAI, owner of the hot springs spa and the general store.

LeMalle chews on a handful of bear jerky. Kenai stares at LeMalle until he begrudgingly pays for the jerky. Corbett pulls on some sneakers and hands his boots to Kenai.

Corbett peers out the tiny window, frowning. LeMalle cleans his carbine while eating beans and bacon. Mitchell hunches over a table. He's making a scrimshaw -- delicately engraving, using homemade tools, on a palm-sized piece of whale bone. He rubs his eyes and looks up at Corbett.

<DIRECTION>
The winds have died down. The rain has turned to a light snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mobile arctic dwelling sits on a rise next to the Haul Road. It's a double-unit weathertight cocoon of fiberglass and aluminum, pulled by a diesel rig on oversized tires. The front module is 12 by 24, the rear 12 by 18.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An extended-cab pickup pulls up and Sam Wilder gets out. The gravel-and-dirt Haul Road, paralleling the pipeline for miles, is closed to the public. An arriving vehicle, therefore, is news. The front door of the dwelling opens. Eric and Anne Marie come outside, delighted to see Wilder.

EXT. SPORTSMEN'S CAMP - LATER THAT DAY

Everything seems peaceful enough. The SOS fire (made from burning green branches for white smoke and rubber for black smoke) has burnt down to embers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric, Anne Marie and Wilder pull up in Wilder's pickup.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two Sportsmen sit in the front seat of the Land Rover, but they don't react to the arrival of the rescuers. In the back seat, a reflective camping blanket covers a large mass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something is amiss. Eric shoots a look of trepidation at Anne Marie as they get out of the pickup. Wilder pulls the door of the Land Rover open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Sportsman slumps out onto the ground. His eyes are open and his tongue pokes out between his lips. His skin is blue-white. (He looks, in fact, much like Eric's nightmare.)
</DIRECTION>

Startled, Eric steps back. Anne Marie gasps with horror. Wilder unzips the Sportsman's light windbreaker and listens for a heartbeat. Nothing.

Anne Marie opens the back door of the Land Rover. She pulls back the camping blanket... and uncovers the third Sportsman. The torn red flesh on his head and his bugged-out eyes are a hideous sight.

Anne Marie SCREAMS and stumbles away.

EXT. DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An old primer-grey station wagon rattles into town and parks. With an unlit cheroot stuck in his mouth, "VIKING" BOB CORBETT gets out and stretches. He's 38, six-foot-six, with sandy hair, beard, ruddy skin, and his brother's dark eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around for some sign of life. He spots Neff tending one of the windmills and walks over to him.

VIKING BOB'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Illuminated by a bare bulb is Wilder's typical bush-country front yard. Piled are five cords of wood, boxes, tarps, stove parts, saw horses, 55-gallon drums, dismantled snow machines, wash tubs, tires, etc.

Bunching his collar around his neck, Kenai shivers and sorts through Corbett's traps.

Wilder handcuffs Corbett's hands to the cell door bars, then quickly wraps a piece of duct tape across Corbett's face, covering his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stuffing a .357 magnum in his belt, Wilder, coatless, slips outside.
</DIRECTION>

As soon as he's out the door, Corbett cranes his neck and painfully tries to pry the tape off his face with the corner of the door hinge.

</WILDER>
<DIRECTION>
Viking Bob responds by flinging a heavy trap at Wilder, then punching him in the gut. Wilder sprawls among the junk, dropping his revolver. Kenai freezes, not about to take sides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before Viking Bob can come at him again, Wilder grabs for his .357. Viking Bob jumps back and bolts for his car.

He dives into his station wagon and starts it up. As he drives past, Wilder POPS off a few rounds, but Viking Bob keeps going.

Viking Bob turns and takes the literal high road -- a narrow trail above the roadway that Wilder's truck is on.
</DIRECTION>

He zooms ahead and gets in front of his quarry, then drops back down onto the road and waits in ambush.
</DIRECTION>

A bottle of Eric's Scotch sits almost empty on the table beside Wilder. Wilder dozes in a chair facing Corbett.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corbett is awake. He contorts his body to bring his handcuff chain under his feet and get his hands in front of him. He eyes Wilder's .357. It's in a lefty Sam Browne holster. No way to take it without waking Wilder.

Corbett stands and inches toward the door. As he pulls it open, the insulation makes enough NOISE to stir Wilder.

Wilder's mind clears enough to realize that Corbett's hands are in front of him. He reaches for his .357. Corbett butts into Wilder's midsection with his head. Amazingly, Wilder stays on his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corbett hurries back to the door. Wilder lunges, bull-determined to hold onto him. Corbett smashes Wilder across the face with his clenched hands. Wilder goes down hard, hitting his head on the table, and stays there. Corbett instinctively kneels to see if Wilder is still breathing. But then, hearing MOVEMENT in the rear module, Corbett flees.

Viking Bob approaches in his station wagon on a narrow dirt road. The huge night sky all but smothers the weak light from the town up ahead.

Cache seems a mistake -- a jumble of unpainted buildings in the middle of a big nothing, twenty miles north of the Arctic Circle. Still, it's more animated than Devil's Cauldron. There are a hundred permanent residents, several taverns and a three-store, fly-in shopping center.

Even though it's the middle of the night, people roam the streets, drinking and socializing. With only a couple feet of snow on the ground, this is still summertime. Under storefront awnings, drunken INDIANS sleep on the concrete.

	That's why I left, moved to Washington. When I met Eric I was doing day shoots -- products and fashion, mostly. Pretty dull. Eric was teaching college, and then he got the job with Northland Oil.

The pumping station consists of three corrugated steel buildings. The largest is an airplane hangar.

Just beyond the hangar is a narrow blacktop landing strip running parallel to the Haul Road.

Eric doesn't need any convincing of that. He tears out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PUMPING STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mitchell runs out in front of them and BLASTS the front of the Scout with his .45 Peacemaker. Steam HISSES out of the radiator. Eric floors it and races past Mitchell, almost hitting him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mitchell and LeMalle SHOOT at the retreating vehicle. One of the Scout's back tires gets blown out.
</DIRECTION>

Chewing an unlit cheroot, Viking Bob pulls up next to Mitchell and LeMalle in the trappers' jeep. They pile in.

Eric backtracks as fast as possible in the crippled vehicle.

As the Scout heads for the Feldspar Creek bridge, it disappears from sight over a hill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Viking Bob zooms over Feldspar Creek. They come over the rise, but the Scout still can't be seen ahead of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Scout sits idling in a depression near the creek bed, below the Haul Road. Above, the trappers speed past without noticing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After giving the trappers time to get around the next bend, Eric drives the Scout up the embankment and crosses back over the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCOUT

Eric stops the vehicle. He grabs a five-gallon gas can and a piece of cloth from the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The prefab bridge is the transportable type used by the Army Corps of Engineers, left over from the building of the pipeline. Eric stuffs the gas can between the abutment and the honeycombed underside of the bridge. He puts the rag inside the spout of the can, lights it with a match and runs like hell back to the Scout.

The gasoline can EXPLODES, tearing the bridge couplings away from the concrete abutment.

The trappers see the explosion behind them. They turn around and head toward it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PUMPING STATION - HANGAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric parks the Scout sideways to block the way to the airstrip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the magnum at the ready, Eric cuts Corbett's handcuffs loose from the seat and hurries him toward the hangar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The leeward side of the structure is a huge metal door on rollers. Eric unlocks it and rolls it back. Inside is a Cessna 182, dusted with snow and ice blown through the cracks by crosswinds. Eric brushes the windshield with his sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trappers pull up and find the far side of the bridge burning and disconnected from the creek bank.
</DIRECTION>

Eric helps Corbett into the cockpit, then secures his handcuffs to the frame of the seat with more nylon rope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HAUL ROAD & FELDSPAR CREEK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Viking Bob assesses the damage to the bridge. Loose from the abutments, it wobbles like a diving board. Below, the water is too deep and fast-moving to be traversable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HANGAR - CESSNA

Eric tries to turn the ENGINE over. The starter is sluggish from cold and lack of use.

Viking Bob looks at the others, bursting with frustration. He climbs into the driver's seat.
</DIRECTION>
<VIKING_BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get in. We can jump it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VIKING_BOB>
<DIRECTION>
They hop in. He SCREECHES backwards to get a running start, REVS the engine, pops the clutch, and tears toward the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they reach the midpoint of the bridge it begins to buckle under them. With a sickening WRENCHING, the crossbar supports crumple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The jeep flies through the still-burning gasoline, becomes airborne, and SCRAPES to a rude stop on the edge of the pavement on the other side, the back wheels dangling in space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LeMalle and Mitchell gingerly get out and push the ass end of the jeep onto solid earth.
</DIRECTION>

Eric finally STARTS the plane and taxis out onto the landing strip.

Eric ignores the jibe. He stays at 2,000 feet, making the landscape all the more immediate.

ANOTHER ANGLE - (AERIAL SHOT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While talking in an even tone, Corbett intently studies the instrument panel and scans the landscape below.
</DIRECTION>
<CORBETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The idea was to get to the supplies before the bears did. Along the route we'd set our traps. Made our year's living in three months.

</CORBETT>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, he turns in the seat and pins Eric against the door with his left foot.

<DIRECTION>
The plane flies erratically. With his right foot, Corbett kicks the fuel jettison lever on the instrument panel, jamming it on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)

The lever, used to empty the fuel tanks in case of emergency, does so with great expediency. All the gas is instantly discharged.

INT. CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corbett releases Eric and calmly sits back up in his seat.

Eric rubs his neck, incredulous. Corbett's move was too fast and too outrageous. In a moment, the engine SPUTTERS to a stop. Eric struggles to hold the stick steady and glide the plane down to the plateau Corbett pointed out.

EXT. CESSNA - (AERIAL SHOT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's an even chance of hitting a mountain instead of the plateau. Eric pushes the Cessna's nose down. The plateau comes up fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The plane drops lower and lower, pitching and yawing in the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It CRASH LANDS, its metal underbelly SCREECHING as it hits the jagged granite under the snow. It stops suddenly, flipping tail over nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CESSNA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It rests upside down in the snow. The men are dazed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind Eric, one of the extra fuel cans, now hanging upside down, leaks gas. In front of him, the engine is ON FIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric undoes his seat belt and rights himself, but his leg gets caught in the tangled belt. He pulls out a Swiss Army knife and cuts the rope binding Corbett's handcuffs to the seat. Corbett pushes the passenger door open. Panicking, Eric tries to pull loose of his seat belt, painfully wrenching his ankle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CESSNA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corbett rolls out into the snow. With no time to grab his supplies, Eric clambers from the wreckage. He and Corbett crawl/roll down the incline of the plateau, away from the plane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later the leaking gas reaches the burning engine and the Cessna EXPLODES.
</DIRECTION>

Eric tries to stand. He cries out and falls into the powdery snow, clutching at his ankle.

Corbett realizes Eric is at a disadvantage. But before he can bolt, Eric grabs for the .357 magnum under his coat. He lies on the snow, gasping, pointing the gun at Corbett's midsection.

Grimacing with pain, he gets up. Clutching the magnum, he shoves Corbett in front of him and starts walking. Corbett frowns -- it's tough to trudge through the snow with his arms cuffed tightly behind his back.

Eric looks around and tries not to let his emotions register on his face. They wouldn't be farther from the rest of humanity on another planet. Smelling fear on Eric, Corbett enjoys the view. And waits.

The Endicott range is full of jagged peaks, icy streams and gnarled tundra valleys. Squinting in the glare of the snow, Eric and Corbett trek through the grandiose Gates of the Arctic area. The smoldering plane wreckage is a hard-won, snow-covered mile behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Intricate patterns of fragmented rock, strips of scruffy tundra and bedrock outcrops produce lonely, foreboding mosaics upon the landscape. The air is still. The silence

is itself a disconcerting presence. Ten miles ahead and two thousand feet lower, the forest begins. But here, on the rock face of the mountains, Eric and Corbett might as well be in a desert.

</CORBETT>
<DIRECTION>
Eric doesn't want to be too far from his prisoner. He keeps coming. The ice GROANS and HISSES under their weight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corbett is three feet from solid ground. He drops to his knees, then stomach, and rolls like a log the rest of the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric splays out on the ice and crabwalks across. The ice makes an ominous CRACKING and water begins to seep through air holes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing, Corbett weighs his chances of bolting from Eric.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric crawls doubletime. He makes it onto solid ground just as the ice under him breaks off in a big, thin, clear plate.

Trying to keep busy, Anne Marie develops some prints in the darkroom she's made from the front bathroom. She glances at her watch and sighs, her mind on Eric's overdue return.

Meyerling's Dodge truck pulls up. Anne Marie comes outside. Her smile wilts when she sees it's not Eric. As Meyerling climbs the embankment to the Turtle, he glances at Wilder's snowmobile parked alongside the Turtle.

EXT. ENDICOTT MOUNTAINS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric limps further down from the mountains. Corbett keeps pace in front of him and his magnum. As their altitude decreases, there is ever thicker vegetation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their tracks in the snow stretch up behind them into the distance. The magnificence and grandeur of the surroundings cannot be overstated. Picture the most rustic, overwhelming wilderness imaginable, and then make it ten times larger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men's way is once again interrupted, this time by a sheer granite drop. The steep decline would be tough to negotiate with mountaineering equipment and proper footwear. Corbett peers over the edge and shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<CORBETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have to backtrack, find another way down.
	</DIALOGUE>

<ERIC>

(assessing the drop)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Going to be a bit of a challenge with handcuffs on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORBETT>
<DIRECTION>
Eric realizes he's right. After some deliberation, Eric cautiously approaches him. With the .357 cocked and ready, he undoes one of the cuffs, leaving them hanging from Corbett's wrist. He then unthreads the nylon twine from Corbett's tarp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - GRANITE SHEER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric and Corbett are tied, belt to belt, with the nylon rope. Corbett inches down first, feet spread for maximum footing, gloveless hands grasping at anything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric mimics Corbett's moves and follows the same path. Unable to grasp the rocks effectively, he stops and takes his gloves off. Continuing, he winces -- the rock is cold and sharp. His hands are soon numb and bloody. Even in the dry, below-freezing air, Eric is sweating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down and hangs on more tightly. Sliding to level ground two hundred feet below would pummel him to hamburger. Corbett pauses and rests his cheek against the rocks. Eric is right above him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Corbett's foot slips. His right hand instinctively goes for a hold. The dangling handcuffs snare on a protuberance, knocking him off balance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fulcrum of Corbett's body leans out into the empty air. Eric moves down a little, braces himself and extends his leg, giving Corbett something to grab. Corbett takes hold of Eric's shoe and tries to teeter back against the rock wall. Adrenaline screams through Eric's system.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corbett looks up at Eric. A careless move will send them both tumbling. Eric clutches harder at the rocks and waits for the worst.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a long moment, Corbett regains his balance and lets go of Eric's foot. He continues his descent. Eric lets out his breath and tries to swallow. His mouth is as dry as the granite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TREELINE - LATER THAT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Handcuffed again, Corbett hikes in front of Eric along the top of some foothills. Now and again he glances behind, gauging Eric's weariness, waiting for a moment's carelessness. Around them there is heavy vegetation now -- snow-covered sedge tussocks, knee-deep muskeg and twisted thickets that are treacherous and slow to tramp through. Above them, ominous clouds and sharp, cold winds are coming down from the north.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But below, a mile ahead, the edge of the forest is like the hem of a great green garment stretching endlessly southward. The combination of altitude and latitude creates an amazingly sharp topographical dividing line. Within a few thousand yards, the landscape abruptly changes from scrub brush to thick coniferous forest.
</DIRECTION>
<CORBETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better get into those trees before that squall blows down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORBETT>
<DIRECTION>
Then, Corbett pauses as a walloping sound ECHOES across the foothills.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just ahead, two enormous bull moose are fighting. They ram each other with six-foot-wide antlers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corbett stares, transfixed, admiring.
</DIRECTION>
<CORBETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You talk about ecology -- there it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORBETT>

Eric turns, surprised at Corbett's unabashed awe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Catching the men's smell the moose bound away, and the spell is broken.

EXT. FOREST - CAMPSITE PREPARATION MONTAGE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STORM brings gusting winds and below-zero temperatures. Eric and Corbett move through the storm in slow motion. Both recognize the need for a truce in the face of a common enemy. The snow and wind cut through their clothing like razors. They poke around for dead wood with which to make a fire. The trees are small and healthy; little is found.
</DIRECTION>

Awestruck by the intensity of the storm, Eric tears branches from birch trees and piles them in Corbett's handcuffed arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They hurry back to the nylon tarp, strung between two tree trunks, FLAPPING violently in the storm. Hunching against the wind, Eric pulls off his gloves and reaches in his pocket for some precious matches. His fingers are so cold he can't hold them, and he drops several in the wet snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Angry, he shoots a look at Corbett. Corbett is holding his hands inside his coat. He pulls them out and quickly takes the remaining matches from Eric.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crouching down, back to the wind, Corbett grasps a match between his numb fingers and awkwardly strikes it. He holds the flame next to the kindling. It doesn't catch fire immediately. Corbett lets the match burn out against his fingers. He tries another match. This time, a flame takes hold but could succumb to the wind at any moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On his knees and elbows, Corbett nurses along the tiny fire. Eric can't control his shivering. He gets on his knees next to Corbett and holds his coat open to further baffle the wind. Corbett keeps his hands cupped around the flame, not
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
caring that it's burning his skin. Finally the fire begins to grow. Relieved, Eric and Corbett look at each other with a glimmer of a grudging mutual respect.
</DIRECTION>

The fire, now unattended, is smoky as Corbett predicted, but burns along nicely.

EXT. / INT. NYLON SHELTER - NIGHT

Corbett and Eric sit under the nylon shelter. The STORM rages outside. Eric empties his pockets of Eskimo potato, reindeer lichens, bistsort sorrel and other plants for his dinner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corbett has fashioned a snare from his boot laces and a tree branch, and placed some crushed roots as aromatic bait next to a small animal burrow outside the shelter. A squirrel sticks his nose out of the burrow to investigate.

Corbett sits catlike, ready to pounce. Eric grimaces as Corbett yanks on the snare and the squirrel's SQUEALS (OS) abruptly cease.

Suddenly, a BUMP rocks the Turtle. Someone is outside. Startled, Anne Marie turns the lights off and looks out the window.

No sign of a vehicle or a person. As she pulls on her parka, she glances at the big rifle leaning against the wall, but doesn't touch it.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. THE TURTLE

<DIRECTION>
Her visitor, whoever it is, is behind the Turtle. Anne Marie cautiously rounds the corner and stops dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A foraging GRIZZLY sniffs around, attracted by the smell of fresh carrion -- Wilder. Eight feet tall and eleven-hundred pounds, it's used to having its way. Right now, it's hungry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a casual swipe of its paw, its massive claws puncture the Turtle's aluminum skin, popping open the door of the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
utility compartment. The bear pokes its head inside, and Wilder's body slumps out into the snow. The bear pushes at the corpse with its snout. Salivating, it prepares to dig in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anne Marie looks around, wondering what the hell to do nEXT. Wilder's snowmobile is a few yards behind her, parked against the side of the Turtle. She inches toward it. Testily, the bear looks up, SNIFFING loudly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keeping her eyes on the bear, Anne Marie feels for the snowmobile ignition keys. They're not there. She feels around inside the saddlebags and finds three emergency road flares.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anne Marie IGNITES the flares. They illuminate the area with an eerie reddish glow. She YELLS at the bear, wields the flares like Excalibur and moves forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bear, reluctant to leave so hearty a pre-hibernation meal, GROWLS and cocks its head back and forth to assess the threat. As Anne Marie inches ahead, the bear stands on hind legs to its full height to meet the challenge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anne Marie tosses a flare toward the bear. It grunts when the flare hits it, and shuffles backwards. Anne Marie throws another flare. With a ROAR from hell, the bear charges. Anne Marie falls back. Still holding the last flare, she's forced into a crawl space under the Turtle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - UNDER THE TURTLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anne Marie tries to squeeze out the other side, but she's pinned in by the unevenness of the hard ground. The bear swipes at her, its huge paw inches away. Anne Marie jabs at the paw with the flare, but that only makes the bear more quarrelsome.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She twists around, looking for a defense. Above her is the cabling from the generator to the circuit box for the Turtle's electrical system. She tugs at it, but it won't budge. The bear SNIFFS at Anne Marie with its big wet snout. Anne Marie notices warning a sign on a control valve:
</DIRECTION>
<DANGER>
<BLACK_WATER>
<UNTREATED_SEWAGE>
<DIRECTION>
Grimacing, she tries to turn the valve. After much effort, it SNAPS and opens, releasing a stream of fetid sewage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER

The bear gets a muzzle full of the stuff. HOWLING unhappily, it backs away, GRUNTING and SNEEZING. Greatly offended, its appetite gone, it lopes into the forest.

Anne Marie squirms out from under the Turtle and, gagging from the horrible smell, pulls off her wet parka.

EXT. WOODS NEAR THE TURTLE - SERIES OF SHOTS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wearing one of Eric's coats, Anne Marie stands in the center of three similarly-sized trees. A FLARE supplies the light. The big Remington rifle leans against the tree closest to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tosses one end of a hundred feet of nylon rope over a sturdy tree branch twenty-five feet from the ground. Then she throws the other end over an opposing branch and stretches the rope like a clothesline.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She attaches a second length of rope perpendicular to the first and throws it over a third tree branch, midway between the other two. She kneels and ties something BELOW FRAME to the cross-length rope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulling mightily on the perpendicular rope, she hoists something heavy to the level of the branches. The flare burns out, plunging the area into darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anne Marie wraps the rope around the tree trunk and nervously tries to LIGHT another flare. As she does, the forest seems closer, sinister, filled with lurking ogres. Seized with an instinctual fear, she grabs the rifle and runs back to the Turtle.

EXT. ENDICOTT FOOTHILLS - DAY

<DIRECTION>
The storm has passed, leaving a fresh covering of powdery snow in drifts like sand dunes. Eric and Corbett trek toward Devil's Cauldron through the ever-thickening forest. Corbett has made them snow goggles by cutting slits in strips of tree bark worn like sunglasses. Eric, using a tree branch as a walking stick, still limps on his sore ankle. For the first time, he keeps the magnum stuck in his waistband.

Corbett takes advantage of Eric's poor peripheral vision from the visor by kneeing Eric in the face. Eric falls backwards into the snow. Corbett takes off like a jackrabbit. Eric spits out some blood, shakes the stars out of his eyes and yanks the .357 from under his coat.

He starts to doze off. The shivering he's been repressing now racks his body. Eric sits him up, closer to the fire, and puts his own parka over Corbett's shoulders. With his foot, Eric rolls some hot rocks bordering the fire closer to

Corbett's legs. Eric rubs his arms and hands, but it isn't enough. Eric loathes the specter of death, even Corbett's. He shakes him, trying to keep him awake.

Corbett is headed someplace far away. Sighing, Eric turns him so his back faces the fire. He unbuttons Corbett's shirt, then unbuttons his own shirt and lies across Corbett. Eric gasps -- Corbett feels like a slab of ice. Corbett's teeth chatter. He's completely unconscious.

Flashlight in hand, gloriously drunk, LeMalle stumbles outside. He crosses to the jeep to grab a box of Twinkies and, as long as he's at it, take a leak in a snowbank. Bleary-eyed, he notices the damage to the utility compartment inflicted by the bear.

Letting his breath out, LeMalle pokes around the equipment in the compartment. Ever larcenous, he pulls a few items out, examines them, and, disinterested, leaves them in the snow. Doing so, he comes close to uncovering Anne Marie, who sits motionless and terrified in the back of the compartment.

Nothing in the compartment catches LeMalle's fancy. Leaving the door hanging open, he wanders away.

To demonstrate, he rapid-fires several SHOTS from the hip, taking the radio antenna off the roof of the Turtle, shattering panes of glass in an accurate succession, and blasting the door latch off the utility compartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pleased, LeMalle slams back the bolt, ejecting a spent shell. He glances curiously at the door of the utility compartment and starts toward it.

Grinning maliciously, LeMalle hangs the Remington out the window as they retreat. Taking careful aim, he SHOOTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE TURTLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LeMalle's bullet hits the metal fuel tank of the generator. The kerosene fumes EXPLODE, splattering BURNING KEROSENE on the rear module of the Turtle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trappers don't slow down to enjoy the show. Viking Bob hurries on to more important business.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UTILITY COMPARTMENT - THE TURTLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As soon as the SOUND of the jeep fades away, Anne Marie clambers out of the utility compartment. Haggard and numb with cold, she helplessly watches as the fire ravenously devours the rear module. Shielding her face from the flames, Anne Marie reaches under the accordion cover between the modules. With great effort, she unbolts the coupling bracket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DIESEL RIG - THE TURTLE
</DIRECTION>

Anne Marie STARTS the engine, SLAMS it into gear, and lurches the front module away from the burning rear module. She shuts the motor off and, trying to hold back the tears, watches the rear module BURNING.

EXT. DEVIL'S CAULDRON - NIGHT

Bone weary, Eric and Corbett walk toward town, staying on the outskirts to avoid being seen. They look at one another -- this moment seemed impossible not very long ago. No one seems to notice as they limp into Wilder's cabin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WILDER'S CABIN

It's dark. Eric locks Corbett up in the holding cell, not noticing that Corbett seems almost pleased to be there. He blocks the windows, pumps up the pressure on the white gas lantern and heads back outside again.

The temperature dips as the winds shifts and blows down from the north. Another storm approaches. The temperate days of last week seem ages ago.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenai, Neff, and other TOWNSMEN batten Devil's Cauldron down for the STORM. Kenai is bundled up in the cold. The men tighten guy wires on the radio tower, windmills and caches; bring firewood indoors; close off unused rooms in the general store and spa. Then Neff and Kenai split off from the others.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOT SPRINGS SPA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Via a catwalk, Neff and Kenai climb up into the ceiling struts above the partitioned cubicles in the spa to caulk a roof leak with pitch. Neff is sullen from his conversation with Eric. Kenai, however, is smiling at Neff.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ERIC>
<CORBETT>

Corbett sees he's hit a nerve with Eric.

<ERIC>

	All I want want is you in jail --

A KNOCK at the door interrupts. Eric lowers the flame on the gas lantern and peers out through a corner of the cardboard in the front window. Frowning, he cracks the door open and slips outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WILDER'S CABIN

It's Neff and Kenai. Neff looks guiltily at Eric.

Eric is skeptical of Kenai's concern.
</DIRECTION>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't let him fool you. Real reason he's here is to buy Corbett's traps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Eric looks at Kenai, then at Neff. Neff nods that it's okay. As extra precaution, Eric handcuffs Corbett's right wrist to the frame of the cot inside the cell.
</DIRECTION>

It's Dixie, wearing a threadbare flannel robe.

	Guess someone should use them. Open the bottom drawer in Wilder's desk. My kit's in there. Might as well unload everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORBETT>
<DIRECTION>
Kenai tugs on the drawer. It's locked. Undaunted, he jimmies it open with a knife. Neff groans. Kenai goes to throw Corbett the duffel bag, but Neff grabs it. He checks for weapons, pulling out a hunting knife. Satisfied, he hands Corbett the bag through the bars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With his free hand, Corbett digs through his belongings: clothing, freeze-dried provisions, jerky, paperback books. He looks up and shrugs.

<DIRECTION>
INT. HOT SPRINGS SPA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric's ankle is in a resin cast. His foot rests on a stool. While waiting for the cast to set he soaks in the bathtub, a hot towel draped over his face. Above him, on a wall bracket, a closed circuit TV plays a war-surplus PORNO FILM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door CREAKS open and Dixie comes in. She impassively checks his cast -- which is interesting, as she's now wearing panties, clog shoes and nothing else. Eric takes the towel off his face and sits up, astonished.
</DIRECTION>
<DIXIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wash your back for you. You will like it.

Before Eric can protest, the door OPENS again. It's Meyerling. He snaps his fingers at Dixie to shoo her and she scurries away.

With the seats pushed back, LeMalle peels the town's lone WHORE out of her parka. He's got the motor running for warmth. Her gold tooth glints in the light from the building next to them. The locating screen on the beat-up radio beacon receiver bolted to the dash GLOWS phosphorescent green.

	This miserable wilderness is a state of the union. Policy's made here the same way as in the civilized world: at the ballot box. That's the beauty of it -- these icebox cowboys are living a century too late. Get them on your side, it's like buying Manhattan for beads.

Kenai sorts through the tangle of Corbett's traps. The door bursts open and Eric hobbles in. Gun drawn, Eric unlocks the cell door. He rips Corbett's shirt open. Looking around, he sees Corbett's duffel bag sitting by the cot. Digging through it, he finds at the bottom of the bag an ELT with a small red LED flashing on it.

He hears a door SQUEAK open and someone COUGH nearby, so he stands motionless in the snow.

Bundled in wool blankets, Kenai trundles down to his outhouse.

After Kenai passes by, Eric sneaks inside the spa. He climbs up into the catwalk.

As they exit, Corbett's sardonic look makes Anne Marie shiver.

INT. RENTAL CABIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ten-by-ten cabin is furnished with two sagging cots, a beat-up color TV set, a cookstove and a half-drum heat stove. Built into the rear wall is a rustic dumb waiter that once lowered perishables into the icy waters of a now-dry stream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric checks his watch. 6:15 AM. He bolts the door and blocks the windows, opening one enough to let sound in from outside. He extinguishes the Benman lantern and douses the fire in the heat stove so no smoke will emit from the chimney. Anne Marie slumps into the corner next to the dumb waiter.

In the spa, water DRIPS somewhere. All the stalls are empty.

In his sod house, Kenai looks out his one tiny window at the curtain of snow. Dixie comes up behind him and puts her hands on his shoulders. He looks up at her, glum.

The sound of a MOTOR grows in volume, then abruptly ceases. The trappers' jeep APPEARS in the snowfall on the road into town. It coasts quietly in and stops behind the cover of a woodpile across from Wilder's cabin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trappers get out of the jeep. LeMalle has Eric's Remington, Mitchell has his Peacemaker, and Viking Bob carries LeMalle's old carbine. Mitchell spits. It's so cold outside that the spittle freezes and CRACKS before it hits the ground.
</DIRECTION>

They fan out and approach Wilder's cabin.

The trappers march through town like an advancing army, looking for some sign of Corbett. LeMalle stops to dig through his pockets for some food. All he comes up with is the stump of a candy bar. Viking Bob looks at him impatiently.

To prove his point, LeMalle trots from dwelling to dwelling, looking through windows and letting himself in through any unlocked door. This proves fruitless, so he lets out a frustrated YELL. Pointing the Remington skyward, he lets off a couple thunderous SHOTS that ECHO back off the foothills.

LeMalle is directly above the huge central pool. He ducks to go under a long piece of twine running from the ceiling to a dark corner below.

Anne Marie lets out a startled cry and springs away from him. She falls hard on her back, knocking her wind out. Scrambling for footing in the snow, LeMalle drops his rifle. He comes at her again. Anne Marie moves away and pulls the .44 magnum out. LeMalle stops and glares at her.

</ANNE_MARIE>
<DIRECTION>
LeMalle slowly crouches down for his rifle. Anne Marie wields the handgun at him, but he doesn't stop.
</DIRECTION>
<LEMALLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want to chance it with that hog-leg? You can't even hold it up. Better drop me first shot, bitch, or I'll rip your fuckin' lungs out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEMALLE>
<DIRECTION>
Taunting, sneering, LeMalle stares her down. Anne Marie is paralyzed. Feeling that he's won, LeMalle wraps his bony fingers around the stock of the Remington.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anne Marie closes her eyes and FIRES. Pulling the rifle close, LeMalle tucks and rolls and jumps to his feet. Anne Marie FIRES again, and AGAIN. Shot, LeMalle hobbles away, leaving a trail of blood in the snow. Numb, Anne Marie lets her arm fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOARDWALK NEAR WILDER'S CABIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric looks around at the sound of the shooting, fearing the worst. He pulls Corbett off the boardwalk and they cut across open ground toward the airstrip depot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOT SPRINGS SPA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenai looks around at the messy RESULTS of LeMalle's ransacking for things to wear. Kenai turns, startled, when he hears footsteps. It's Neff and Meyerling.
</DIRECTION>
<KENAI>

	Hey, I thought you people loved Corbett and his wild men!

<DIRECTION>
EXT. YARDS BEHIND AIRSTRIP DEPOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the snow, Eric can see the faint outline of the plane on the runway. He and Corbett hurry toward the back of the airstrip depot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they wend their way through the junk-filled yards, Eric catches a glimpse of movement around a corner, REFLECTED in a pane of glass leaning against a roll of tar paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ERIC'S POV - REFLECTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Peacemaker in hand, Mitchell is behind the depot, coming right for them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric takes out the homemade flashbomb. He lights it, tosses it toward Mitchell and covers his eyes. It EXPLODES with a muffled pop and a bright flash of white light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mitchell stumbles backwards and blinks his eyes. The flash has temporarily clouded his vision.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric moves Corbett to another approach to the depot and waits for Mitchell to move on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mitchell is about to do just that when a hand on his shoulder stops him. It's LeMalle, oblivious to the profuse bleeding from his right shoulder. Mitchell blinks, still having trouble seeing. LeMalle gestures for him to be quiet and points in Eric and Corbett's direction.
</DIRECTION>
<LEMALLE>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Over there...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEMALLE>
<DIRECTION>
He hoists his Remington.
</DIRECTION>
<MITCHELL>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold it. You might hit Ben.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCHELL>
<LEMALLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bullshit. I hit what I'm aiming at.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEMALLE>
<MITCHELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let 'em come closer first...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCHELL>
<DIRECTION>
But LeMalle is too anxious. He swings the rifle up, left-handed, and SHOOTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bullet just misses Eric. He panics and wildly returns FIRE with the .357.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mitchell and LeMalle scatter under the hail of bullets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON ERIC AND CORBETT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as they HEAR LeMalle's labored footsteps run past them, nearby. Eric peers cautiously around the corner toward the depot. There is no further movement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric waits a moment, then leads Corbett cautiously toward the depot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. REAR WALL OF AIRSTRIP DEPOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reaching the rear wall, they practically stumble over something. It's Mitchell, lying on the ground near the wall, badly wounded by Eric's barrage. Eric gasps. Anguished, Corbett kneels next to Mitchell. Mitchell pulls him closer.
</DIRECTION>
<MITCHELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Glad to see you're okay. I told LeMalle not to shoot.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(tries to smile)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Had some fine seasons, didn't we...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCHELL>
<DIRECTION>
Mitchell's grasp on Corbett's coat relaxes as he dies. Horrified, Eric stares at the man he killed. Noticing the scrimshaw lying on the snow where it slipped from Mitchell's pocket, Corbett picks it up.
</DIRECTION>
<CORBETT>
<DIRECTION>
(to Eric)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifteen years on the trail with this man, I never saw him rise to anger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORBETT>
<DIRECTION>
Glaring at Eric, Corbett dips his hand in Mitchell's blood, and suddenly smears it across Eric's mouth. Repelled, Eric pulls back.
</DIRECTION>
<CORBETT>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; bitterly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your first kill. How does it taste?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORBETT>
<DIRECTION>
Wiping his face, sickened and desolate, Eric has no reply.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, from somewhere close by, LeMalle FIRES at them. Eric stuffs the .357 in his belt and uses a brick to knock the padlock off the back door of the depot. He pushes Corbett inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CARGO PLANE - COCKPIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pony-tailed, ex-hippie PILOT shuts his engines off and removes his Walkman headphones. Hearing LeMalle's continuing GUNSHOTS, the Pilot pulls his door closed and turns on his two-way radio.
</DIRECTION>
<PILOT>
<DIRECTION>
(into radio mic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Circle, this is BMY-955. I just touched down in Devil's Cauldron. Nobody's here to greet me like usual, and there's gunfire. I'm getting scarce.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PILOT>
<DIRECTION>
With that, he STARTS his engines up again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO ERIC IN DEPOT

who turns, startled, when he hears the ENGINES coughing to life OS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CARGO PLANE - COCKPIT

<DIRECTION>
The Pilot fiddles with his controls and prepares to take off. He looks up, surprised, as the passenger door suddenly opens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Anne Marie slides onto the seat.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE_MARIE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ANNE_MARIE>
<PILOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my responsibility to get this aircraft out of here safely.

</PILOT>

Anne Marie points the .44 at him.
</DIRECTION>
<PILOT>

(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got to be kidding.

</PILOT>
<ANNE_MARIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave the engines idling. Go back and open the side door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE_MARIE>
<DIRECTION>
Shaking his head and muttering, the Pilot unfastens his seat belt, climbs between the two seats to the cargo compartment, and obliges the little lady with the big gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AIRSTRIP DEPOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The depot, as temporary-looking as the rest of Devil's Cauldron, is a boxcar-shaped loading dock and warehouse with a corrugated steel roof. Boxes, wood palettes and hand dollies are piled haphazardly about.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eric and Corbett navigate through the piles of boxes, inching toward the front door -- the door leading to the plane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a string of overhead lights come on. Eric goes for the .357, then stops when he sees Meyerling, Kenai and Neff have come in the front door. Kenai stomps his feet and shivers. Grandstanding for the others, Meyerling steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<MEYERLING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody wants any more killings; we all agree to that, correct?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(no one argues)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good. Now, Eric, you're gonna hand your prisoner over to us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEYERLING>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<MEYERLING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't your concern. It's over, here and now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEYERLING>
<CORBETT>
<DIRECTION>
(to Meyerling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, when you put a bullet in my back on the way out. Easier for all involved.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORBETT>
<MEYERLING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not a bad idea. Face it, Ben. There's no room in Alaska for you any more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEYERLING>
<DIRECTION>
Meyerling pokes with his foot at a tipped-over rack of Eskimo paraphernalia -- masks, furs, big skin drums, fish- and bear-spears.
</DIRECTION>
<MEYERLING>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're as antiquated as this shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MEYERLING>
<DIRECTION>
Meyerling moves toward Corbett, but Eric stands in his way.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<CORBETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're quite a piece of work, Meyerling. The tide changes, you ride right along with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORBETT>
<DIRECTION>
Eric looks at Neff.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neff, you know better than this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<NEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're an outsider, Mr. Desmond. Step aside; stay out of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Kenai and Neff move in with Meyerling. Eric stands his ground and reaches for the .357 in his belt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, LeMalle stumbles into the depot, the blankets and furs dragging at his feet. His right side is bathed in blood. Half-frozen, bled dry, he looks ready to drop down dead. In his left hand, impossibly, he still clutches the massive Remington.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hoists it to his hip and grits his teeth as he BOLTS a round into the chamber with his injured right arm. Bracing himself, he levels the rifle at Eric.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hearing the ACTION of the rifle, Eric turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Corbett reaches down, grabs a rusty Eskimo spear in both his handcuffed hands, and hurls it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a deafening ROAR as LeMalle's rifle discharges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LeMalle flies back from the recoil -- and from the spear stuck clear through his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some packing material above Eric's head smolders, ignited by the muzzle blast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a moment of silence. Corbett looks at the other weapons near him, and then at Meyerling. Threatened, Meyerling pulls out a .380 automatic. Before Eric can do anything, Meyerling FIRES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The IMPACT of the bullet throws Corbett against some boxes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a YELL, Eric jumps Meyerling and rips the gun from his grasp. Enraged, he pummels Meyerling with it until Kenai and Neff pull them apart. Eric wrenches away from them and scrambles to his feet with Meyerling's gun in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anybody moves and I'll shoot!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
Holding the .380 on them, Eric crosses to Corbett. Bleeding from the abdomen, he's trying to stand up.
</DIRECTION>
<ERIC>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you walk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<CORBETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wound's a through-and-through. Missed my liver, I think.

</CORBETT>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get out of here.

Cautiously backing away from the others, Eric helps Corbett get up and shuffle toward the OS SOUND of the cargo plane.

	We'll get you to a hospital, soon as we get to Fairbanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERIC>
<CORBETT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So they can patch me up and put me in a cage? Forget it. Meyerling's right -- I'm a dinosaur. Greedy bastards like him, it's their turn with this land. Put me in the woods, let me live or die on my own.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORBETT>

He painfully pulls himself into a sitting position.
</DIRECTION>
<CORBETT>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; peers out window)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look down there, tell me what any of this matters. Struggles of men get swallowed by the bigness. Soon there won't be a trace of our troubles... or us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CORBETT>
<ERIC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're wrong. Everything we do leaves its mark. You said it yourself -- there are hundred- year-old footprints in the tundra.

Too tired to argue, Corbett leans back against the window. He takes Mitchell's scrimshaw out of his pocket and looks at it.

Eric sighs as he looks at the blood -- Mitchell's blood -- on the back of his hand. He stares at Corbett for a long moment. Then, resolved, he climbs up front and says something to the Pilot. Grumbling, the Pilot adjusts his controls.

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

The snow clouds are dissipating. The cargo plane comes down through them and lands on the airstrip behind the pumping station.

Eric and Anne Marie watch from the door of the plane as Corbett limps across the runway toward the treeline. As he goes, his footprints are dusted over by the snow and wind.

Corbett stops, turns and looks back at Eric, then continues onward, disappearing into the forest.
