INT. JEFFERIES' APARTMENT - DAY - LONG SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Although we do not see the foreground window frame, we see the whole background of a Greenwich Village street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We can see the rear of a number of assorted houses and small apartment buildings whose fronts face on the next cross-town street, sharply etched by the morning sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some are two stories high; others three; some have peaked roofs, others are flat. There is a mixture of brick and wood and wrought iron in the construction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The apartment buildings have fire escapes, the others do not.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The neighborhood is not a prosperous one, but neither is it poor. It is a practical, conventional dwelling place for people living on marginal incomes, luck -- or hope and careful planning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The summer air is motionless and heavy with humid heat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It has opened windows wide, pushed back curtains, lifted blinds and generally brought the neighborhood life into a sweltering intimacy. Yet, people born and bred to life within earshot and eye glance of a score of neighbors have learned to preserve their own private worlds by uniformly ignoring each other, except on direct invitation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA PULLS BACK until a large sleeping profile of a man fills the screen. It is so large that we do not see any features, but merely the temple and side of the cheek down which a stream of sweat is running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA PANS OFF this to the right hand side of the window, and MOVES TO a thermometer which is hanging on the wall just outside the window. It registers 84.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA MOVES ON into the open, and brings nearer to us a room with a large studio window. We are able to see inside this room. A short, balding man is standing near the window, shaving, using a small bowl of water and a portable mirror which he has set up on a shelf.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To the right of him is a battered upright piano. On top of the piano is a radio. The music selection coming from the radio stops, and the announcer is heard.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The time -- 7:15 A.M., WOR, New York. The temperature, outside, 84 -- Friends -- is your life worth one dollar?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
The man shaving quickly puts down his razor, hurries to the radio, and changes the station, moving past a number of commercial voices until he again finds some music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Contented, he returns to his shaving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA MOVES ON AND OVER to a far building. It passes over the face of this building until it comes to fire escapes. It goes up and near enough to one which has become the outdoor bedroom of a couple. We are near enough to see an alarm clock hanging from the rail which is now ringing vigorously. A man rises lazily to a sitting position. He gropes to switch the alarm off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see that his pajamas are stained with sweat. In his sitting position he leans forward and shakes somebody beside him. To our surprise, the head of this other person -- a woman -- rises where his feet are. They have been sleeping in opposite directions. They sit limply looking at each other with bedraggled and weary expressions which show they enjoyed very little sleep in the heat of the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA NOW MOVES DOWN toward the left onto another low building. It MOVES IN A LITTLE to a living room window. Just inside the windowsill, a small fan is oscillating. The fan sits on the right side of the table, and to the left of it is an automatic toaster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the toaster stands a full-bodied young woman, apparently wearing only a pair of black panties. Her stomach, navel, and the lower part of her chest are naked. Just below her breasts, the curtain, partly drawn, has thrown a deep shadow which extends upward, hiding her breasts, shoulders and head. Two pieces of toast pop up in the toaster. She takes them out, butters them. Then she turns around and bends over another table on which stands an automatic coffee-maker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She picks up the coffee-maker, and swings back to the table to sit down. She does this so deftly that her breasts are never exposed, but hidden by the fan as she sits down. The fan moves back and forth as she pours coffee, far enough to reveal that she wears no bra, but not far enough to fulfill the exciting promise of her lack of clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA MOVES ON to a distant street corner seen between two buildings. The traffic is very light at this hour, but a Sanitation Department truck moves through the intersection spraying water out behind it to cool the pavement and keep the dust down. Three little kids in bathing suits run behind the truck, playing in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA MOVES OFF and around to some buildings at the side. As it skims this building, we see a hand emerge from one of the windows, and remove the cover from a birdcage which is hanging from a hook on the wall outside. In the cage are two lovebirds -- arguing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA NOW PULLS BACK SWIFTLY and retreats through the open window back into Jefferies' apartment. We now see more of the sleeping man. THE CAMERA GOES IN far enough to show a head and shoulders of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is L. B. JEFFERIES. A tall, lean, energetic thirty five, his face long and serious-looking at rest, is in other circumstances capable of humor, passion, naive wonder and the kind of intensity that bespeaks inner convictions of moral strength and basic honesty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is sitting in an Everest and Jennings wheelchair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA PANS along his right leg. It is encased in a plaster of Paris spica from his waistline to the base of his toes. Along the white cast someone has written "Here lie the broken bones of L. B. Jefferies."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA PANS to a nearby table on which rests a shattered and twisted Speed Graphic Camera, the kind used by fast-action news photographers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the same table, the CAMERA PANS to an eight by ten glossy photo print. It shows a dirt track auto racing speedway, taken from a point dangerously near the center of the track. A racing car is skidding toward the camera, out of control, spewing a cloud of dust behind it. A rear wheel has come off the car, and the wheel is bounding at top speed directly into the camera lens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA MOVES UP to a framed photograph on the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a fourteen by ten print, an essay in violence, having caught on film the exploding semi-second when a heavy artillery shell arches into a front-line Korean battle outpost. Men and equipment erupt into the air suspended in a solution of blasted rock, dust and screeching shrapnel. That the photographer was not a casualty is evident, but surprising when the short distance between the camera and the explosion is estimated. A signature in the lower right hand corner of the picture reads -- "L. B. Jefferies."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA PANS to a second photograph of a picket line at an aircraft plant strike. Strikers, non-strikers and police are embroiled in a bitter and confused riot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clubs, fists and truncheons swing, blood flows, faces twist with emotion and fallen victims struggle to regain their feet. The picture represents no distant, cautions photographic observation, but rather an intimate report, so immediate and real that the viewer has the nervous feeling the fight surrounds him and he had best defend himself. The same signature, "L. B. Jefferies," is in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA PANS TO another framed picture, this one a beautiful and awesome shot of an atomic explosion at Frenchman's Flat, Nevada. It is the cul-de-sac of violence. The picture taken at a distant observation point, shows some spectators in the foreground watching the explosion through binoculars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA MOVES ON to a shelf containing a number of cameras, photographic film, etc. It then PAN ACROSS a large viewer on which is resting a negative of a woman's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From this, THE CAMERA MOVES ON to a magazine cover, and although we do not see the name of the magazine, we can see the head on the cover is the positive of the negative we have just passed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA FINALLY COMES TO REST ON a pile of magazines -- perhaps a hundred or so. They are all of the same publication.
</DIRECTION>

INT. GUNNISON'S OFFICE - DAY - CLOSE UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The screen is filled with the top of a desk. In addition to the usual telephones, blotting pad, etc., the most prominent feature is the number of glossy photo prints, and even larger- sized mat prints. Some of them have slips pasted over with descriptions. The center of the desk is occupied by a large layout of photographs on one magazine page. Behind this we hear the murmur of two voices of men who can be vaguely seen beyond the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA PANS UP and we are now face to face with IVAR GUNNISON and JACK BRYCE. Gunnison is sitting on a window- ledge, and beyond him we realize we are high above the New York streets. Bryce leans against a wall at right angles to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gunnison is holding a cablegram in his hand. Bryce has a cigarette in his mouth. He scratches a match, and is about to light it, when he notices that Gunnison, still reading the cable, has reached into an inside shirt pocket, and produced a cigarette. Quickly, Bryce moves over to light Gunnison's cigarette. Then he settles back to light his own. Gunnison doesn't even bother to thank him.

<DIRECTION>
While Jeff is continuing his phone conversation, we see the object of his look. Two pretty girls have appeared on the distant roof. They are smiling and talking, although we cannot hear their dialogue. Each wears a terrycloth robe. With their backs to the CAMERA, they take off the robes, slipping them down over their shoulders slowly. Then, seductively, they turn -- revealing the full beauty of their tanned and bathing- suited bodies. It is almost as if they want to be noticed, the center of neighborhood attention. They at least have all of Jeff's attention. Then they spread the robes in front of them, and lie down on the roof, and out of sight. Jeff seems a little disappointed.

Jeff's eyes become set upon something else in the neighborhood he sees.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff's attention is now drawn to another feature of his backyard entertainment. THE CAMERA IS NOW FOCUSED on the window of the small building where we earlier saw the girl behind the oscillating fan. Loud ballet music is pouring from her open window. The girl, now dressed in dark and revealing leotard, and ballet slippers, has just turned away from a portable record player. She begins the first graceful movement of a modern ballet interpretation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gracefully moves across the room to the rhythm of the music and dance, toward the ice box. With her feet still moving, she throws open the door, and then rhythmically moving back to the center of the room, gnaws the chicken bone, occasionally waving it in the air as part of the choreography. She now twirls over toward a table at the other side of the room on which is an open package of bread slices, some butter nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With swaying body, she puts down the chicken leg, and gracefully and rhythmically butters a slice of bread.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She picks up both bread and chicken leg and continues her interpretive dance, alternately munching the bread and butter and chicken leg.

THE CAMERA PANS from the window of the dancing girl, to the window below. Someone is reading the New York Herald Tribune. The paper lowers, and we see an elderly lady, in her late sixties. She is a faded, refined type. She looks up in the direction of the music and in a calm routine fashion adjusts the volume of her hearing aid. She resumes her reading.

	You've got to get me out of here! Six weeks -- sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
At this moment we hear the sounds of a piano playing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a simple, but broken, melody as if someone was just learning to play the piano, or carefully composing a song. It clashes abruptly with the music from the ballet dancer's apartment. It irritates Jeff as he looks in the direction of the new music.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's worse than the Chinese water torture.

We now see the source of the piano music. It comes from the apartment with the studio window which we saw earlier where the man was shaving and listening to the radio. The short, balding man sits at the piano playing a few notes, then transferring them by pencil to notepaper on the piano rack. He continues this process, fighting the interference of the ballet music. The opening bars of his melody are beautiful and ear-catching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is slow, hard work, and the ballet music finally becomes such an interference that he gives up and walks to the window to look down toward the dancer's apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands by a table at the window which is littered with records, the morning coffee cup, unwashed, the remains of breakfast, old newspapers, song sheets, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a cigarette out of his mouth, looks for an ash tray, and ends up putting it out in the coffee cup. He then returns to the piano and begins picking out the melody the dancer is playing on her record player.

We see a three-storied, flat-roofed apartment house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The brick is weather-worn and faded. Each apartment has three windows facing the back, one showing a hallway, one a living room, and the window on the right opening into a bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the second floor, a man has entered the living room from a hallway door. He carries a large aluminum sample case common to salesmen. He sets down the case heavily, removes his hat, and slowly wipes his brow with the back of his right hand. He takes off his coat and tie. His shirt is stained with sweat underneath. He rolls up his sleeves, and his well- muscled arms heavy with hair confirm his dark, husky build.

The man enters the bedroom. We can see a woman lying on the far bed. Near her, a small table is covered with medicine bottles, spoons, boxes of pills, a water pitcher and the other impedimenta of the chronically ill. The woman sits up as the man enters. She takes a wet cloth off her forehead. Before the man even reaches her, she begins talking, somewhat vigorously. Pointing to a wristwatch, she seems to be saying something such as "You should have been home two hours ago! I could be lying here dying for all you'd know -- or care!" The man stops short of the bed, makes gestures of trying to placate her, but she goes on scolding. His attitude changes to weary patience, then irritation, then anger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shouts back at her, turns and goes out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back in the living room, he picks up his hat, throws it against the wall in anger, and leaves the apartment, slamming the door behind him.

Jeff's attention is suddenly diverted to himself. His leg, under the cast, begins itching. He squirms, tries to move the leg a little. It gives no relief. He scratches the outside of the cast, but the itch gets worse. He reaches for a long, Chinese back scratcher lying on the windowsill. Carefully, and with considerable ingenuity, he works it under the cast. He scratches, and a look of sublime relief comes over his face. Satisfied, he takes the scratcher out. As he replaces it on the windowsill, his attention is drawn back to the scene outside the window.

We see the man who left his apartment in anger come out of the doorway into the backyard. He is easy to identify through the color of his garish necktie. In one hand the man carries a small garden hoe and rake, and in the other a pair of trimming shears. He goes to a small patch of flowers, perhaps three feet square.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are beautiful, multi-colored three foot high zinnias. He kneels down, inspects them, touches them affectionately and with some pride. His anger seems to have left him, replaced by the kind of peace that flowers bring many people. He stands up, carefully hoes the ground, them rakes it. Then he snips a few leaves off the lower parts of the plant. Finally, he waters them.

Into the next door yard we see emerging from the apartment below the ballet dancer, the elderly lady.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She wear a broad sun hat, dark glasses, and a sunsuit consisting of pink shorts and halter. She carries a copy of the Herald Tribune, and still wears her hearing aid. She settles into a folding, canvas deck chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her skin is dead white, and her body is thin to the point of emaciation. No sooner has she settled into her chair, than she is attracted by the sound of the salesman working in his garden. She gets up, walks to the fence, and looks over. He notices her, but doesn't speak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She begins gesturing to him how to take care of his flowers. He listens for a moment, then looks directly at her. The strong movements of his mouth show us that he objects vigorously to the annoyance of her comments. She moves away from the fence, started and a little shocked.

<STELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And there aren't any windows in the workhouse.

She puts her bag down on a table. It is worn, and looks as if it belongs more to a fighter than a nurse. She takes off her hat coat, and hangs them on a chair.

	Years ago, they used to put out your eyes with a hot poker. Is one of those bikini bombshells you always watch worth a hot poker?

He doesn't answer. She opens the bag, takes out some medical supplies: a thermometer, a stop watch, a bottle of rubbing oil, a can of powder, a towel. She talks as she works.

As she leaves him holding the thermometer THE CAMERA PULLS BACK as she crosses to a divan. She takes a sheet from underneath, and covers the divan with it. Talking, all the time.

	Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.

He is now looking at the windows of the apartments nearest to him. A shade has gone up, and a man, obviously a caretaker is raising a window with some effort. Having accomplished this, he turns back into the room, and we now see him approach a young man and woman who are standing just inside the doorway. He hands a key to the young man, and then obligingly brings in two suitcases which he places on the floor beside them. He gives them a studied, but agreeable nod, then departs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We now see that the girl has a small hat with a veil, and an ornate corsage pinned to her light blue tailored suit. The boy, who like the girl is perhaps twenty years old, wears a dark blue serge suit and a grey felt hat. He takes off the hat, and scales it over to a nearby chair. Quickly they are in each other's arms, kissing passionately, crushing the girl's corsage and pushing her hat back a little. They part, the boy laughs nervously, and takes a furtive glance out toward the corridor. He looks back into the room, and beckons her to come out. She follows him wonderingly. For a moment, both are lost from sight. When they reappear, he is carrying her in his arms, over the threshold. He sets her down, closes the door, and they kiss again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They part, still holding hands and looking into each other's eyes. Then slowly, and significantly, she looks toward the open window. He releases her hands, goes to the window and pull down the shade, as she is reaching upward with both hands to unpin her hat.

She does. He takes out his own professional corkscrew, quickly inserts it and levers the cork out. He deftly wraps the napkin around the bottle and pours the wine, replacing the bottle in the wine bucket. Lisa has opened her purse to produce some money, in bills. She hands it to the waiter.

Carl goes up the stairs and out the door, while THE CAMERA REMAINS on Lisa and Jeff. She picks up both glasses of wine and walks toward Jeff. She seats herself on the windowsill as she hands him his glass. We notice that the outside is considerably darker by now, and the lights are beginning to come on in the various apartments outside. They raise their glasses in a silent toast, and sip the wine. THE CAMERA CLOSES IN until they are both in a tight TOW SHOT.

<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the "21" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show.

	She looked very cool. She had on a mint green --

</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
She breaks off with a little laugh, and a slight reproachful look at Jeff. She sips her drink then says:
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And to think, I planted three nice items about you in the columns today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff's opinion of that is a short chuckle.

Jeff gives a sigh of relief, exhaling his breath, then looks down toward his legs in thought. He holds this attitude for just a moment, then seems to shake off his concern to lift his head and turn his attention to what might be happening in his neighborhood beyond his window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him we see the vague form of Lisa bringing in a card table, which she proceeds to unfold.

Jeff's attention is concentrated on an apartment we have not seen before. This belongs to a single woman, about forty years of age. She lives alone. Her apartment is below that of the salesman with the invalid wife.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A nearer view show us a more intimate picture of the woman Jeff is concentrating on. She is thin and unattractive. At the moment, she is putting on her make-up in front of the bedroom mirror. She gives a half turn and picks up a pair of horn-rimmed glasses, which she puts on, and leans nearer to her mirror. She picks up a lipstick and proceeds to paint her lips carefully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Having completed her make-up, she takes off her glasses and surveys her face in the mirror. She stands up, swings the skirt of her dress around, admires herself in the mirror. She is quite flat-chested, and the dress hangs unattractively. She lifts her chin, gives one last look, and turns toward her living room. As if she's preparing to meet someone.
</DIRECTION>

THE CAMERA HAS PANNED slightly to the woman's living room window. A small, candle-lit table is set up, with dinner for two. The spinster sweeps into the room, smiling. She goes to the door, opens it, and in pantomime admits an imaginary caller. She pretends to kiss him lightly, take his hat, and place the hat on a chair. Then she shows him to a seat at the table, disappears into an unseen kitchen and returns with a bottle and two glasses. She sits down, pours two drinks. She lifts her drink in a toast to the imaginary man opposite her.
</DIRECTION>

Having finished her drink, the lonesome woman pours herself another one. Then she starts to take a sip, smiling across the table at her imaginary guest. She lowers the glass onto the table. The smile fades from her face as her head drops. Suddenly she buries her head in her arms over the table and starts to sob.

	Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?

	Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours.

Both of them swing their eyes a little to the left.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kitchen-lining room combination of the ballet dancer's apartment has now been made more presentable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ice box is now skillfully concealed by a large Chinese screen. All kitchen utensils have been put away, replaced by more attractive effects, and lamp light softens the surroundings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miss Torso is now wearing a cocktail dress, which shows off her figure to great advantage, especially when she leans toward three assorted men to offer them a plate of hors d' oeuvres. She is the perfect hostess, animated, charming, and with an added personal touch for each guest. She is behaving with a sophistication which was not apparent when we first saw her in the morning. Her every movement is followed admiringly by the eyes of the three men -- one wearing black tie, with a touch of grey in his hair, a Long Island socialite -- a young rather handsome, actor in grey flannel suit -- and last, a bright, pleasant, young man who might possibly be from Wall street, wearing a blue-pin-striped suit. The latter two are engaged in an animated conversation. The young man in the grey suit is showing the other young man some newspaper cuttings he's taken from his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miss Torso sees that the cocktail glass of the third man is empty. She takes it over to the window, and starts to fill it. The man in the tuxedo follows her over, with a casual glance toward the other two. He stands beside her as she makes the drink. He looks at his watch with some impatience, and makes a side comment to her as to the lateness of the time. She turns, gives him a light kiss on his cheek, as if she's telling him to be patient. Instead of pacifying him, it makes him more amorous, and he puts an arm around her shoulder an plants a heavy kiss on her cheek. She turns to face him, they look into each other's eyes a moment, and she allows herself to be kissed on the lips -- but only long enough so as to attract the attention of the other two men. With a little admonishing look, she moves away from him, and makes him rejoin the other two.

There is a slight, but warm, smile on Jeff's face as he looks at the drawn shade. His eyes move away from the newlyweds' apartment, and slowly explore the neighborhood to his right. He finds something of interest, and stops to stare at it. His face sobers at what he sees.

The salesman's apartment. We see both the living room and the bedroom. The salesman has prepared a dinner tray, and is carrying it from the kitchen, through the lining room, into the bedroom. He places it on the lap of his wife, sitting up in bed. He puts a couple of pillows behind her back to make her more comfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't bother to thank him, but is busy examining the content of the tray. Her attitude shows her dissatisfaction. Nothing is right. It's not what she wanted, and it's badly prepared. She begins criticizing him. He starts to answer her back, but decides better of it, and instead, leaves the room. He goes to the kitchen reaches up to a wall cabinet, takes down a bottle and pours himself a drink. Then he returns to the lining room, listens a moment. The wife is grudging beginning to eat the dinner. The husband quietly lifts a phone from the cradle, and dials a number.

We get a better view of the salesman waiting while his connection is being made. Whoever he has called answers. And instantly there is a marked change in his attitude. He relaxes, smiles, is warm. He talks softly, perhaps guardedly, with an occasional glance at the bedroom door. In the bedroom, his wife has become aware of the call.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quietly she moves the tray, gets out of bed, and goes to the bedroom door to listen. The wall hides her from our view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then suddenly, she apparently opens the door, because the living room, we see her arm suddenly appear, pointing at the man and the telephone. He speaks quickly into the phone, and hangs up. His face is flushed and angry as he goes toward the bedroom. In the bedroom his wife appears walking back to the bed, followed by the husband. She is laughing, and he is answering her in angry tones. She climbs in bed laughing. The more she laughs, the more angry he gets, and the harder she laughs. Finally, he leaves the room, goes into the living room, back into the kitchen and has another drink. He stands there, controlling an outburst of emotion, and seems almost to be crushing the shot glass in his clenched fist.

The CAMERA slowly sweeps over the various apartments with an odd window lit here and there. In the distant street there is still some traffic passing, with one or two pedestrians going by.

Jeff smiles a little, but as the howl continues, his expressions sobers. His eyes begin to scan the neighborhood, as if looking for the source. He fails to find it, and sits there, puzzled and disturbed. The scene, and the sound of the dog:

His head nods sleepily as he dozes. He opens his eyes and looks out, as a slight sound of rain starts.

From his viewpoint we see the first few drops of rain starting to fall. It is sort, gentle rain, not a downpour. There are still some windows lit in the neighborhood. The apartment house corridors all have small night lights burning.

The couple who sleep on the fire escape. The increasing rain cause them to hastily gather their things to retreat inside. The man, hurriedly untying the alarm clock from the railing of the fire escape, lets it slip through his fingers. As if falls to the garden below, the CAMERA FANS SWIFTLY down with it. When the clock hits the ground, the alarm goes off sending a shrill sound through the neighborhood.

Coming out of his apartment into the corridor on the floor below is the salesman with the nagging wife. The shades are drawn in his apartment, but a light burns dimly behind them. The salesman carries a large aluminum suitcase -- the same one we saw him with earlier in the day. The sound of the alarm startles him. He turns toward the window a moment listening. Then reassured that is is nothing important, he turns and moves down the corridor.

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light comes from the song-writer's apartment. His door is open, and he is hanging onto the door frame, his hand still on the light switch. He surveys his apartment. He appears rather drunk. He comes into the apartment, closes the door behind him, and sways a little. He wears a hat, pushed back on his forehead, and no raincoat. His clothes are quite wet. He might have even fallen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks disgustedly at the piano, then lurches toward it. There is no doubt now as the state of his drunkenness. At the piano he viciously sweeps all the note paper off the music stand. This seems to give him some satisfaction, but he loses his balance, twists sideways, and fall into a nearby chair. He remains there, bleary-eyed and a little sick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP
</DIRECTION>

What he has observed seems to give Jeff an idea. He moves his wheelchair backward and to the left alongside the side board. Awkwardly, with his left hand, he reaches up for a bottle of whiskey. He cradles the bottle in his lap, and reaches for a tumbler. He then wheels back to the window, and pours himself a good, long drink. He lifts up the glass, starts to drink, but something happening beyond his window startles him and he stops in the middle of his drink, his eyes a little wider then usual.

The street is deserted. At the right hand side of the screen a light goes on. THE CAMERA PANS OVER and we see that Miss Torso has returned from her date. She is wearing a three- quarter length coat over her evening dress. She is inside, with the door two-thirds closed, but she leans out to kiss someone goodnight. Then it takes some coaxing to get the door completely closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns the key in the lock. She listens a moment then comes to the center of the room. She takes her coat off and drapes it over chair. She removes the screen in front of the ice box, then opens the ice box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She searches it for something to eat; finds a big piece of pumpkin pie. She closes the ice box. She starts to eat the pie as she moves in the direction of the bathroom. Stopping a moment, she puts the piece of pie on a table, and proceeds to take off her dress. Undoing the zippers, she slides it over her head as she passes into the bathroom. The dress is thrown on a nearby chair, and the bare arm picks up a piece of pie. She is now in the bathroom. We see her slip down the brassiere straps, but the window does not permit us to see any lower. As she munches on the pie, she pulls out a few pins holding up her hair, which she proceeds to brush rhythmically. She turns and moves down her bare back.

We can hear the song-writer at work, but the thing that attracts our attention mostly, is some action that emanates from the fire escape where the couple sleep at night. On a long rope, the woman is lowering an open wicker basket in which sits a small dog. When is reaches the yard below, the CAMERA PANNING DOWN, the dog steps out and runs off to explore the yard.

The salesman leans forward and grips the window sill as he watches the dog. The CAMERA PANS DOWN and we now see that the old lady with the hearing aid is leaning over the fence admonishing the dog. We can faintly hear her voice saying something to the effect that he'll get into trouble. The dog turns to glance at her and apparently taking heed, moves away. The old lady is wearing a faded house-robe.

Jeff is amused at the dog incident. Behind him, Stella moves to the center of the room, saying:

She begins putting her equipment back into her black bag. Jeff's eyes lift to the salesman's apartment, and the amusement drains from his face. He leans forward a little, tensely.

She turns around. Jeff points to a coat-stand near the door.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you take those binoculars out of the case and bring them to me.

</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
She puts down her bag, reaches for the binoculars, takes them out the case. She comes down the stairs, brings them to him. He immediately swings to the window, and lifts them to his eyes. Stella sniffs, then goes to the door, as she says:
</DIRECTION>
<STELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trouble. I cam smell it. I'll be glad when they crack that cast, and I get out of here.

As Stella goes out the door, the CAMERA MOVES IN until Jeff's head, and the binoculars, are filling the screen.

The man is now moving out of the living room, and the binoculars PAN him though to the small kitchen which is seen through a side window.

The man starts to busy himself in this kitchen with his back to us, but the image is very unsatisfactory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff lowers the binoculars and there is an expression of exasperation on his face. He throws the binoculars down, and then looks about him. He backs his chair up quickly toward the main cabinet on his left. He leans down, opens a cupboard door and takes out a long-focus lens. Then from a shelf above he takes a small Exacta camera. He quickly takes off the existing lens and puts on the telephoto lens in its place. He wheels himself back to the window and raises the camera to his eye.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the view-finder of the camera, we are now brought into close proximity with the salesman in his little kitchen. His back is still to us. He half-turns and takes a used newspaper. He spreads it open, along the drainboard. From the sink he takes out a large butcher's knife, and a long, narrow saw. They disappear from sight as he lays them on the newspaper and proceeds to wrap them up. Having completed his job, he emerges from the kitchen carrying the newspaper- wrapped parcel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment he is lost behind the wall that separates the kitchen recess from the living room. He does not reappear for a moment.

Half of a man's body is now seen in the living room.

Then the salesman turns and moves to the center of the room. He is not carrying anything. He sits down on a couch, with a display of fatigue. He yawns and stretches out of sight at full length on the couch.

The thermometer outside of Jeff's window, registering 83 degrees. The CAMERA PANS OFF to the left until it comes to rest on the song-writer's studio. He is dressed only in bathing trunks, and is vigorously cleaning his rug with a carpet sweeper. In the middle of his sweeping, he stops, hurries a step or two to the piano. He plays a couple of notes with one hand, while he stands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Listens, plays them again. Decides they are no good, and returns to his carpet sweeping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA PANS FARTHER LEFT to the salesman's apartment. There are no lights burning behind the drawn shade of the bedroom, but the living room and the kitchen are lighted. There is no sign of the salesman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA CONTINUES ITS PAN to the left, to include the couple who sleep on the fire escape in the hot weather.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We now get an opportunity to examine these people more closely. The man is balding, and middle-aged. He is wearing striped pajamas. He is in the act of laying out the mattress. His wife is slightly younger, peroxided, faded show girl type. Also wearing pajamas, with a fluffy handkerchief in the left pocket, the wife is leaning over the railing holding onto the rope which leads to the dog's basket now on the floor of the courtyard. Having been a one-time siffleuse, her call to the dog is clarion and melodic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The little dog emerges reluctantly from the shadows, and steps into the basket. It begins to move upward, and THE CAMERA FOLLOWS it. When the basket reaches the fire escape, THE CAMERA PANS ON to the apartment of Miss Torso. She is in the bathroom brushing her long hair, while her thoughts seem to be far away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA DROPS DOWN to the apartment below, occupied by the elderly lady with the hearing aid. For the first time we see something of her activities inside the apartment. She wears a short smock, although her legs are still bare. She is hard at work on a piece of abstract sculpture. It takes the form of a piece of mahogany through which a simple hole has been carved.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA MOVES ON much farther to the left, and eventually comes to rest on the newly-weds' apartment with the shade still drawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It MOVES ON and at last passes though Jeff's window, and comes to rest on the two bid heads of Jeff and Lisa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her lips are brushing lightly against his cheek as she speaks:

Although it is not complete, it is farther along then before, and he plays his theme a number of different ways, trying to move it note by note to its completion.

Jeff is seated by the window in his wheelchair. He is talking on the telephone while his eyes are still on the neighborhood. There is a touch of urgency in his voice.

<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Doyle -- it's just one of those things I can't tell you on the phone. You have to be here, and see the whole set-up.

The CAMERA PULLS BACK slightly as Stella emerges from the kitchen. She is carrying a tray with breakfast on it. Eggs, bacon, toast and coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's probably nothing important -- just a little neighborhood murder, that's all. As a matter of fact, I did say "murder".
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Stella squeezes past the right side of Jeff, and places the food tray on a windowseat in front of him. She peers out cautiously toward Thorwald's apartment for a moment. Then she squeezes back, moving to the sideboard against which leans a small table on an adjustable stand.

<JEFF>

	My only thought was to throw a little business your way. A good detective, I reasoned, would jump at the chance to detect.

Stella returns with the table, and sets it up so that it is across Jeff's lap. She gets the tray of food pausing to look toward Thorwald's apartment. Then she places the breakfast on the tray table in front of Jeff. He has moved back a little to avoid getting the phone cable tangled in the food and dishes.

The young husband leans his hands on the windowsill, and looks out. He is wearing only his pajama bottoms, because of the heat, and we see that he is a well-muscled, attractive young man. He looks around with some satisfaction. He turns at the sound of a woman's voice behind him.

The binoculars are held for a moment until we see a puffing and blowing Stella arrive at the opening of the alleyway. She looks toward the front of Thorwald's apartment house.

SHOOTING TOWARDS the big window, with the neighborhood beyond, Jeff is as usual seated in his wheelchair on the left of the window, but now turned toward a newcomer.

The second man is standing near the divan looking out the window with the binoculars. This newcomer is POLICE DETECTIVE LIEUTENANT THOMAS J. DOYLE, the man Jeff phoned earlier in the day. He is an intelligent-appearing, well-dressed modern detective. He has a sense of humor. He lowers the glasses, and turns to Jeff.

	You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?

He tosses off the rest of the drink, and his movement is almost a comment. Jeff's face grows serious.

<JEFF>

	Who said they left then?

</JEFF>
<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who left -- where?

</DOYLE>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Thorwalds -- at six in the morning?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Doyle quickly collects his thoughts, and gets back to the case at hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
(Sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?

<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jeff -- huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
(Sharply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If possible -- both.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't do it even if he's gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
(With sarcasm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give him evidence.

	<DIALOGUE>
	How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?

<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ever get an answer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah -- frequently -- it ran something like this: "Your request for transfer turned down --"

He can't help smiling, and neither can Doyle.

<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry I had to turn it down.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going over to the railroad station and check Thorwald's story.

He moves to the sideboard, picks up a felt hat.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it!

</JEFF>
<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh -- I almost forgot!

He pulls a slip of paper out of his pocket. Jeff watches him intently.

(Looking at Jeff)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was a postcard in Thorwald's mailbox.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Mailed yesterday afternoon, three- thirty P.M. from Merritsville --

	<DIALOGUE>
	-- That's eighty miles north of here.

(Back to paper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The message read "Arrived O.K. Already feeling better. Love, Anna."

He looks at Jeff with some smugness.

<DIRECTION>
The sun has just set. THE CAMERA is concentrating on the long-focus lens camera which fills the screen. Just beyond, there is a plate on which a solitary sandwich.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff's hand comes in, picks it up. We PAN US with the sandwich until Jeff's head fills the screen. (Except for a small light in the kitchen, Jeff's apartment is in darkness.) As he munches, he keeps his attention on the neighborhood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - SEMI-LONG SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thorwald's apartment is darkness. THE CAMERA PANS slightly to the left, as we see the dog being lowered in its basket. We follow the basket down to the yard which brings Miss Lonely Heart's apartment into view. She is wearing a Kelly Green suit, and is seated at her dressing table. She seems to be putting on the final touches of her make-up, prior to going out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - CLOSEUP

Jeff looks down, he smiles to himself. He turns, and we see him raise the long-focus camera to his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - CAMERA SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The long-focus lens brings Miss Lonely Hearts into an enlarged picture which reveals details we have not previously noticed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pair of ill-fitting, horn-rimmed reading glasses rest half way down her nose, and she has to tilt her head back slightly as she applies lip-stick, with their aid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Satisfied, she takes off the glasses, and examines her face as a whole, through squinting eyes. She has faded good looks, has fairly nice clothes, but is badly in need of advice on hair dressing. Her hair-do makes her seem middle-aged. She reaches for a tall glass of liquor next to her, and takes a long drink. Putting the glass down, she squints to see if she has disturbed the lipstick. Unable to see clearly, she puts on the glasses again, looks, and touches up her lips slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She puts her glasses in a handbag, then stands to put out the lights. She walks into the living room, finishing the drink. The long-focus lens moves with her. She goes straight for a bottle of liquor, and pours out a final neat slug, and tosses it off. Then she leaves the apartment, with a show of determination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns out the lights behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Jeff lowers the long-focus lens, and turns his head to the right as he hears the first notes of the songwriter's melody which we have heard him trying to complete.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The songwriter is at the piano, poking out his melody, slowly, note by note. He is in black tie, and from the looks of the apartment he is preparing for guests. An attractive girl is setting out trays of canapés, glasses, ice and liquor. She pauses as she crosses the room carrying a tray of food. She listens a moment to the songwriter's melody. Her expression shows that it pleases her, and moves her romantically. She comments on it to the songwriter, who starts from the beginning again, playing it more fully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - SEMI-CLOSEUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A new source of music comes in to interfere with the piano playing. It is orchestral ballet music, in a modern style. Jeff's head turns in this new direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - SEMI-LONG SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miss Torso, and a male partner whom we have not seen before, are practicing a pas a deux. He is a tall flowing-haired young man, lithe and graceful beyond normal masculine capacity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stop, at one point, to listen to a word of comment from a woman who is watching. By her gestures, she is obviously a professional choreographer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CAMERA PANS from this to the street beyond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing there, on the sidewalk, looking up and down the street is a Kelly Green clad figure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - CLOSEUP

<DIRECTION>
He quickly raises his long-focus camera to his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - CAMERA SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are now given a waist-high shot as the focus is adjustment by Jeff. The figure is that of Miss Lonely Hearts. She seems to be trying to figure out what to do, or where to go. She nervously looks at a couple of men passers by. Getting no reaction, she crosses the street, and seats herself at an empty table in front of the cafe. She orders a drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is suddenly blotted out by a figure of a man who enters the picture from the left side. He is much nearer the lens, because he is on this side of the street. He is, therefore, slightly out of focus. The lens suddenly sharpens. It is Thorwald, carrying a light-weight cardboard box under his arm. THE CAMERA PANS him over to the right until he is lost behind the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - DUSK - SEMI-CLOSEUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lowers the lens, and we see Jeff's eyes travel across the screen, as he imagines Thorwald's progression. Then sharpening his look, he picks up the long-focus lens, and easing himself back cautiously, begins watching Thorwald.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - DUSK - CAMERA SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thorwald comes up the corridor, and stands unlocking his door. As he hesitates, we are able to see the cardboard box he is carrying has the name of a laundry on it. He enters the apartment turns on the living room lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He proceeds to the bedroom, and the lights go on there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A number of suits and top coats are lying on an orderly pile on the bed. He takes the laundry out of the box and puts in on the bed next to the suits. Then he goes to the dresser, and instead of putting the laundry away,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
he proceeds to take out the contents of the drawers -- pajamas, shirts, sox, etc. He piles these on the beds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Jeff lowers the camera quickly. He picks up the phone and dials a number, still keeping his eyes on Thorwald.
</DIRECTION>

The phone buzzes on filter, then is picked up and answered by a woman:

He hangs up. Then, his brows knit a little, as if he's puzzled about something he sees across the neighborhood.

<DIRECTION>
He lifts up the long-focus lens.

Early night. In the dresser Thorwald finds an alligator handbag. He holds it up thoughtfully. We have previously seen this handbag hanging from the bedpost when Mrs. Thorwald was in bed. Thorwald takes the bag into the living room, where he picks up the phone and dials.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Long distance again.

Thorwald reaches his party. As he talks, thoughtfully, he takes some jewelry from the handbag -- a couple of rings, diamond wristwatch, brooch, pearls, etc. He discusses each piece, apparently trying to make some decision. Then, seemingly satisfied, he replaces them in the bag and hangs up.

The lights are out in Thorwald's bedroom, and Thorwald is in the act of pouring himself out a drink in the living room. He comes to the window, glass in hand, and looks down into the garden, nonchalantly. Over this, we HEAR Lisa's voice, questioningly:

	Still -- those witnesses.

She comes over to Jeff. He reaches up, takes her hand.

He pulls her into his lap. She puts her arms around him. She is very happy, and kisses Jeff's cheek.

Lisa smothers him with another kiss. She lets up.

(Starting to open it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway. Compact, but ample enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LISA>
<DIRECTION>
She has opened it, and surprisingly enough, it is a compact outfit of pajamas, slippers, toothbrush, toothpaste, and all the general necessities for a comfortable overnight stay. She comes to Jeff, sits in his lap again, displaying the inside of the case
</DIRECTION>
<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.

The party at the song-writer's has grow considerably larger. An assortment of well-dressed people have now crowded into the studio. They are drinking, eating, etc. At the moment, a number of them are crowded around the piano, listening to the composer's newest song -- which isn't quite completed. However, the melody has become more beautiful than ever. During the following scene, we HEAR the melody being played a number of different ways on the piano.

The shade is going up in the newlyweds apartment. The young husband throws up the window an lights a cigarette. He takes a deep and satisfying drag on the cigarette, glancing toward the song-writer's party.

Just as he starts to exhale the smoke, we HEAR his young wife's voice off:

Doyle's look is completely noncommittal. His eyes turn at the sound of the song-writer's party. He moves forward to get a better view, as the CAMERA RETREATS in front of him. He stops to glance out of the window.

	What else do you have on this man Thorwald?

</DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff's tension eases off a little, by he is eager to talk.

	Everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom, ready for packing.

</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Doyle looks back toward Thorwald's bedroom. We see the dark apartment beyond him. Doyle nods thoughtfully. He turns his head suddenly at the sound of Lisa coming out of the kitchen. She holds two large brandy snifters containing some brandy. They are cupped in her hand, the stem between her fingers. She is rotating them gently toward the body to warm the brandy. She is quite beautiful.

She comes forward hands one snifter to Jeff. She offers the second to Doyle. (NOTE: In the following set of scenes, whenever anyone holds a brandy snifter, it is being rotated- regardless of their attitudes.)

<LISA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Doyle? -- I presume.

Doyle sort of smiles, and takes the snifter awkwardly.

	Tom, this is Miss Lisa Fremont.

Doyle bows his head slightly, but his eyes remain on her in a fixed stare.

Lisa smiles in return.

He listens, and then looks up to Doyle.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a minute, please.

Doyle crosses and stands behind Jeff, as Jeff hands him the Phone. He juggles the cigarette, the brandy snifter and the phone all at once. This is all done deadpan.

Before Doyle can comment, Jeff asks impatiently:

	Come on, Tom -- you don't really need any of this information, do you?

Doyle smiles at Jeff, and then strolls over to the table where he puts out his cigarette and puts down the brandy snifter.

	As a matter of fact, I don't.

He waits. No response comes across. His face sobers a little, he reaches for his unfinished drink of brandy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to toss it off like a straight shot of liquor.

<DIRECTION>
A light has gone on in Miss Lonely Hearts' apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look. Surprise of surprises, she has returned with a lover hooked. He is much younger then she, and a little more keyed up to the promise of an adventure still fresh to him. Her actions are coy, and over-feminine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She slips away from his hasty embraces and exploratory kisses with the proper flush of confusion and nervous giggle that seems to say, "It's quite a surprise you find me so desirable, but me mustn't do anything improper, you know. After all, we're practically strangers -- and what would you think of me?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pours a drink for each of them with gestures over-genteel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she sips her drink and look at him over the rim of the glass, he tosses his off with nervous dispatch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves toward her, this time more cautiously. An embrace, a long kiss. She puts her drink down on the edge of the chair. It spills over onto the rug. He begins kissing her cheek, her ear, her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly and fiercely she pushes him away. Slaps him across the face. He moves back with shock as she loudly and emphatically orders him out, out, out. He flushes with anger and embarrassment, and his mouth twists into unpleasant shapes as he slaps degrading words back at her, telling her what she is. She screams at him to get out. He leaves, slamming the door behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She goes back dumbly to the spilled liquor, makes a futile effort to clean it up, and the collapses onto the rug sobbing hard enough to shake her whole body.

	Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?

Lying near the sidewalk in the backyard below the couple's fire escape, is the silent body of the little dog they own. Miss Lonely Hearts comes running out of the basement door. She goes directly to the dog, picks it up in her arms. Then she slowly turns and looks up at the sobbing woman above her.

He turns back to the window, holding out his right hand to the side, waiting for the box and viewer. The CAMERA PULLS BACK a little as Lisa comes up, and places the box and viewer in his hand.

Jeff is staring out, gripping his chair tightly. There is a touch of desperation on his face. He looks down at the flowers, briefly, then swings around abruptly. He wheels away from the camera to the wall cabinet. We see him take a piece of notepaper, a pencil and an envelope.

He puts a name on the envelope, and then proceeds to write something on the sheet of paper. Stella and Lisa edge up behind him, and look down at what he is writing.

The alleyway and street. Just regular traffic.

<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Lisa comes into the picture from the left. She is carrying a white envelope. She stops, waves her hands at Jeff, smiles, and then hurries on. The lens slowly pans to the right and stops on Miss Torso's apartment. She is standing on a small stepladder, nailing curtains above her window. Her legs are bare, though she wears high-heel shoes. We do not see more than half-way up her thighs. The lens takes this in for the briefest split-second of hesitancy then moves on to await the arrival of Lisa along Thorwald's corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She does not appear yet. The lens moves back to get another glimpse of Miss Torso, who is now descending the ladder. She is wearing a leotard. Over this, we hear Stella's voice:

Lisa approaches the door of Thorwald's apartment. The salesman comes into the living room. He finds a package of cigarettes, extracts one, and lights it. Lisa kneels down, and carefully slides the letter under the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At this moment, Thorwald extinguishes the match, tosses it into an ashtray, and turns toward the door. He freezes as he sees the letter on the floor. This momentary hesitation allows Lisa to straighten up, turn, and walk carefully but swiftly, away. Thorwald moves rapidly toward the door. He bends down, scoops up the letter, and examines it briefly. Lisa is just turning out of sight at the end of the corridor, as Thorwald throws open the door. He looks and sees no one. He takes a few questioning steps down the corridor, then stops to examine the letter again. Slowly he turns and makes his way back to the apartment, tearing open the envelope.

Thorwald stops in front of his door to read the note.

There is some curiosity on his face. As he reads, all movement and emotion drain from his body. He stands there, frozen. Jeff's voice is heard over:

There is a candle burning in a holder, and other lamps also light the apartment. She is dressed in sedate street clothes. She sits at the table, and by the light of the candle proceeds to open a black-covered book, and read it. The print is fine. She bends over it a moment, looks up at the capsules, and returns to the book. She seems quite at peace. Stella and Jeff are heard over:

Jeff hangs up. Stella is now beginning to dig, carefully lifting the flowers off the center of the bed where they had dipped down. She places the flower plants on the sidewalk. Lisa stands facing Jeff's window and occasionally glances over her shoulder uneasily at Stella's work.

In the songwriter's apartment, several of his musician friends have gathered. One plays a guitar, another a clarinet, and so on. One by one they try out the theme of the songwriter's new melody, running through it in turn to become familiar with the notes. We, therefore, hear the melody played informally in different ways with different instruments.

She throws out a helpless hand and shakes her head. "Nothing."

We hear the sound of the receiver picked up, and Jeff starting to dial New York Police. At this moment, from the song- writer's apartment which has been quiet for a while, comes a new burst of melody. It is the melody which the song-writer has been composing during the past few days. Now it is rich, and full, and completed, as the musical group plays it. Miss Lonely Hearts lifts her head to listen, and slowly lowers the pills and glass of water into her lap, her whole purpose arrested by the beauty of what she hears.

Then looking across to Jeff, she holds up her hands triumphantly to show him the jewelry she has discovered. At this point, Thorwald appears coming along the corridor of his apartment house! Lisa is completely unaware of his approach.

Thorwald crosses the living room, and goes into the bedroom. Suddenly he looks onto the bed. He picks up the open alligator handbag. He turns, facing the window, looking down at the bag. He looks up in the direction of the living room. Then suddenly his whole frame stiffens, his head turns a little further around to his right. He is looking directly at Lisa who is out of our sight in the corner of the bedroom. He holds out the bag, and without moving, starts to question the unseen Lisa. He takes a little step forward, and his head begins to turn slightly to the left as Lisa begins to emerge into the living room, backing away slowly. By her gestures, and nervous laughter, she appears to be offering a lame excuse for being found in his apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes towards her, and enters the living room as well. Lisa edging toward the door, points to it as she apparently argues with him as to the way she came in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He points to the window. She makes one more step toward the door, but Thorwald reaches out quickly and grabs her by the wrist. He twists it brutally, and flings her sideways into the sofa beneath the window. Her head snaps back against the head rest. With his right hand he throws the handbag across the room in anger, and with his left open-palmed he demands something from Lisa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly her right hand comes up and opens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the jewelry from her, looks at it for a surprised moment, puts it into his coat pocket. He reaches down with both hands, and by the wrists jerks her to her feet. He is talking viciously to her. We can hear Lisa calling out faintly: "Jeff! Jeff!"
</DIRECTION>

Thorwald suddenly looks out at the neighborhood. He realizes that somebody might be watching him. He drags her across the room, reaches up with one arm, and the lights go off. The faint light from the bedroom illuminates their struggle, but not clearly.

We see Lisa start to excuse her presence in the same manner she used with Thorwald previously, as if to say she came into the apartment by mistake. Thorwald, listening, comes quickly forward to contradict her, vigorously. He holds out the jewelry in his hand, and then picks up and shows the empty handbag. The policeman, impressed, looks back to Lisa for an explanation. She has none. Over this we hear Stella frantically asking:

	In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - LONG SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Thorwald leave his apartment and proceed down the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DOYLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOYLE>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up, and just as he does, Jeff looks toward Thorwald's apartment. He rolls forward to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He seems a little puzzled by what he sees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thorwald's apartment. Completely dark. No movement, or glow of a cigar. The corridor outside lighted, but empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff scratches the side of his chin, studies Thorwald's apartment as if he might see some small clue as to where the salesman is. He looks toward the intersection to his left. Apparently he sees nothing. He turns to look down into the garden.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - SEMI-LONG SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miss Lonely Hearts is standing in the yard outside her apartment, looking up to the porch of Miss Torso. The ballet dancer is in high heels and a fresh summer dress.
</DIRECTION>
<MISS_TORSO>
<DIRECTION>
(Faintly heard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you heard that song he's been writing?

She indicates the song-writer's apartment. Miss Lonely Hearts turns, looks up at the studio apartment a moment, then looks up at Miss Torso.

INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSE SHOT

<DIRECTION>
He sits quietly a moment, thinking. Suddenly he jumps a little as the phone rings. He reaches for it, picks up the receiver.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
(Still looks out window)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello.

<DIRECTION>
(No answer)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Doyle? Tom? Tom, I think Thorwald's left. I don't see anything of --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(He looks at receiver, then:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly he looks up toward Thorwald's apartment. Then, back to the receiver. On filter, a receiver can be heard carefully being replaced. Jeff slowly lowers the phone into the cradle. He looks once more toward Thorwald's apartment. Then he turns his chair around quickly and looks toward the door to his apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door. Quiet in the apartment, and in the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Light showing beneath the door from the hall light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff watching, waiting, nervous at first. He reaches for the phone, changes his mind. He looks around for some kind of a weapon, finds none to suit him. He hears the slightest squeak of a floorboard, and looks quickly toward the door again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door. Another squeak of a floorboard, so light and quickly passing that at any other time it would have no significance, even if it could be heard. Then the light beneath the door disappears. Black.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff squints at the door, blinks, squints again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door. No doubt about it, black.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks again for a weapon, and almost by instinct he snatches up his flash holder and the small packet of bulbs he had taken out to signal Lisa earlier. He tries to move his wheelchair farther into the shadows. His eyes are glued to the door of his apartment, and his senses are sharp as a hunting dog's. He scarcely breathes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only the slightest sound is heard as the doorknob turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door slowly and carefully swings open, but the corridor is too dark to tell at first who is entering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door closes just as quietly. From the shadowed recess comes a heavy voice. A threatening voice.
</DIRECTION>
<THORWALD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want from me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THORWALD>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff doesn't answer. Thorwald steps to the top of the stairs, and is now somewhat visible. He looks tall and huge and explosive.
</DIRECTION>
<THORWALD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your friend -- the girl -- could have turned me in. Why didn't she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</THORWALD>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Jeff doesn't answer. His eyes watch Thorwald. He licks his lip with nervous tension and grips the flash holder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thorwald comes down the two steps, pauses at the bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<THORWALD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it you want? A lot of money? I don't have any money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THORWALD>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff doesn't answer.
</DIRECTION>
<THORWALD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say something!

</THORWALD>
<DIRECTION>
He moves forward a couple of steps.
</DIRECTION>
<THORWALD>

	Say something! Tell me what you want!

</THORWALD>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff still doesn't speak. He grips the flash holder a little more tightly, lifts it just the fraction of an inch as if he is prepared to use it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thorwald has advanced to the middle of the room, his eyes on Jeff and his hands clenching with the effort to control his anger.
</DIRECTION>
<THORWALD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you get me that ring back?
	</DIALOGUE>

	No.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell her to bring it back!

He advances a step.
</DIRECTION>
<JEFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't. The police have it by now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JEFF>
<THORWALD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then if the police get me -- you won't be around to laugh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</THORWALD>
<DIRECTION>
Thorwald starts to move threateningly for Jeff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From a three-quarter angle toward Thorwald. Jeff lifts the flash holder to face level and closes his eyes. He explodes the flash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thorwald's face fills the screen registering shock, confusion. He throws up his hands for protection and recoils, making an involuntary sound of surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A vision of Jeff and the apartment as seen by Thorwald.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is distorted and out of focus, filled with large twisting balls of bright yellow color.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Thorwald blinking, trying to regain his sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSEUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff ejects the used bulb and quickly inserts another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He works furiously, sweating. He gets the bulb in the flash holder just in time to meet Thorwald coming at him. Jeff closes his eyes and another bulb explodes in Thorwald's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - CLOSEUP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thorwald's face, full screen again, as he recoils from the flash.

The apartment as seen by Thorwald again. Big, twisting balls of blinding yellow.

Thorwald stumbles back against the side table, knocking objects off onto the floor, struggling for balance and sight. Jeff works rapidly to put a fresh bulb in the holder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thorwald regains his equilibrium and some of his sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Orienting himself, he starts for Jeff again. This time, when the flash holder goes off, we see it from Jeff's angle. Thorwald is lighted almost white, shockingly outlining every detail of his face, clothes, hands. His rage and frustration are fixed for a brief but terrifying moment. He stumbles backward again, trying to brush the light away from his face almost as if it were a solid enveloping substance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - SEMI-CLOSE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff ejects a bulb, puts his last bulb into the flash holder. He tries to move the wheelchair a little further away from Thorwald. Then he raises the flash holder again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In b.g. we see: Doyle, Lisa, Stella and the detectives come to Thorwald's door, try it. Locked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the men steps forward with a flat steel jimmy and snaps the lock open. They move quickly into the darkened apartment. Doyle hits the lights inside the kitchen. The group goes into the living room. The lights go on. No sign of Thorwald. Doyle, Lisa and Stella instinctively turn and look toward Jeff's apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From Thorwald's apartment shooting at Jeff's window. A sudden bright flash is seen as the last flash bulb goes off. And it lights the scene of Jeff in the wheelchair and Thorwald diving through the air at him. Darkness rushes in, blacker than before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JEFF'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thorwald has finally reached Jeff, knocking the flash equipment out of his hands and coming to grips with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is apparent that he is trying to pull Jeff out of the wheelchair. Jeff fights him off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wheelchair crashes over, spilling Jeff to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thorwald is on top of him, lifting, dragging him to the window. Jeff grabs everything he can to keep himself away from the window, but Thorwald is far too powerful for him. He strains to raise Jeff to the windowsill.
</DIRECTION>
<THORWALD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll give you a good look out the window.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THORWALD>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, inexorably, he raises Jeff to the windowsill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff frantically grabs for the upright window frame, wrapping his arms around it. Thorwald shoves the rest of his body over the windowsill.

Looking down at the two detectives from Doyle's point of view. Creel grabs for his gun expertly. The holster breaks away. It is in his hand and with a deft movement he tosses it upward.

Doyle catches it, turns up to Jeff's apartment.

Thorwald still trying to loosen Jeff's grip. The salesman, in a complete, wild, sweating rage, is beyond all reason. His glasses hang from one ear, his coat is torn, his tie pulled to one side.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT - MEDIUM LONG SHOT

Shooting over Doyle's shoulder as he steadies himself against the wall, lifting the service revolver up for a shot at Thorwald. His aim is careful, slow, painfully deliberate. Jeff seems about to fall.

<DIRECTION>
People rush to their windows, looking out at the excitement. Some people on the ground floor come out into the yard. Doyle and the two detectives come into the patio beneath Jeff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doyle directs them to improvise something to break Jeff's fall -- leaves, greenery, their coats, cushions from the patio furniture -- anything they can find. The four uniformed policemen rush into the backyard. Lisa and Stella come over the wall into the patio beneath Jeff. They look up at Jeff, encouraging him to hold on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A detective goes into Jeff's cellar door, trying to reach his apartment before Jeff loses his grip.

The siffleuse and her husband are standing on the fire escape in plain, almost somber clothes. They watch expressionlessly. Beneath them the empty basket which once held their dog swings silently in the night air.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jeff, hanging from his windowsill. He loses his grip and plunges down into the patio below. Two detectives throw themselves beneath him. They are knocked to the ground as Jeff's fall tumbles both of them. After Jeff hits, he lies still, twisted over to one side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doyle and Lisa rush over to Jeff. There is an audible

SOUND of shock in the neighborhood as Jeff has fallen -- various oh's, ah's, and possibly a stifled scream or two.

In the songwriter's apartment we see the songwriter with a guest -- Miss Lonely Hearts. Both in dress and manner she seems quite happy and adjusted to life. The songwriter is placing the first recording of his new song on a record player for her to hear. It is a full symphonic arrangement which is heard over.

Thorwald's apartment is empty, stripped of its furnishings. Two painters are repainting the walls.

The siffleuse and her husband are on their fire escape, training a new white dog to ride in their basket.

<DIRECTION>
Miss Torso is practicing her ballet again. She wears a white leotard. The sound of someone at the door interrupts her. She goes to the door, opens it an inch or two cautiously. When she sees who is outside, she throws open the door. An innocuous, unhandsome and somewhat shy army private enters with a barracks bag slung over one shoulder. She kisses him fondly after closing the door. He puts down the barracks bag, tosses his hat into a chair and, with the attitude of a man who belongs there, goes to the icebox to see what's to eat.

The newlyweds are arguing.

The CAMERA PANS past Jeff who is asleep in his wheelchair facing away from the window. CAMERA MOVES DOWN to the lower part of his body and we see that both his legs are now in casts. The CAMERA LIFTS SLIGHTLY to show Lisa sitting on the sofa nearby. She wears Levis and a plaid cotton shirt. She is reading a book on travel. She looks up briefly at Jeff. When she realizes he is asleep, she puts down the travel book and reaches for the latest copy of Harper's Bazaar. She settles down to study it as we
