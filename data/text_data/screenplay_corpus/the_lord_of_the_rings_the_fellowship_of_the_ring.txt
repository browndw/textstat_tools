Frodo slowly steps up to the pedestal...he peers into the glossy surface. The night sky is reflected into the water... suddenly a figure takes form...the bowed figure of an old man, clad in white robes. He walks down a long road. Frodo leans closer to the mirror's surface...

Gandalf looks at Frodo with a fierce intensity. Frodo reaches out his hand toward the surface of the mirror. Suddenly the image flares, burning out to white. The vision shifts...Frodo gasps in horror! The Shire is in ruins! The image suddenly widens to fill the screen...buildings burning...bodies strewn about...Dark Shapes of ORCS looting and destroying...Bag End, billowing in flames! The Party tree is hacked down. Frodo reels back as the mirror seems to grow...the nightmarish image sweeps past his head, engulfing him entirely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IMAGE: Hobbiton...now an Industrial wasteland! The fields and trees destroyed...replaced with Brick factories belching smoke! IMAGE: ORCS brutally herd manacled Hobbits into the Factories! We see Sam...Merry... and Rosie Cotton. Soot- stained and sobbing, they disappear into the factory hell- hole! Suddenly, the mirror goes dark...and out of the black abyss a single eye grows. CLOSE ON: FRODO IS FROZEN. Unable to move or cry out. The ring dangles from his neck, inches above the water...not shimmering with curls of steam. Fire erupts around the eye... With a Yell, Frodo pushes himself away from the pedestal and collapses on the ground. Light instantly fades from the mirror. Frodo comes to his senses...he is shocked. Galadriel stands still as a statue, unmoved, untouched by the horror.
