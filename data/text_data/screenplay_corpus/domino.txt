INT. DMV -- AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES. SOUTH CENTRAL LOS ANGELES. People are jam-packed into the internal maze of cubicles. It doesn't get more crowded and disgusting than this. THE SOUND OF SCREAMING BABIES IS INTERRUPTED BY A-

</DIRECTION>
<DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They wait for their number to be called. They wait for this license to drive to yet another miserable job... dive pub... drive by shooting.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is if they're lucky enough to own an automobile. Most of them aren't. They need a license to prove their citizenship or else they'll be deported.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA ARRIVES at the last chair on the row. There is a FRATERNITY GUY named FRANCES (20) sitting in it.

<DOMINO>

	There are three kinds of people in this world. The rich... the poor... and everyone in between.

A bead of SWEAT rolls down Frances' temple. He glances over at a BLACK TEENAGER filling out a form. Brief eye contact. Frances looks away.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Frances glances down at his number. G086. He takes a deep breath and walks over to WINDOW SIX.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting behind the counter is LATEESHA RODRIGUEZ (28). She is filing her FINGERNAILS. They are VERY LONG... VERY SHARP... and VERY COLORFUL.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kee Kee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Lateesha raises her eyes to meet Frances. He drops an ENVELOPE on the desk in front of her. Lateesha's demeanor changes. She slowly opens the envelope and removes a piece of PAPER from inside.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four.

<LATEESHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four to six weeks.

Lateesha has gone back to filing her turbo nails.

<LATEESHA>

	Four to six weeks... Frances.

</LATEESHA>
<DIRECTION>
Frances' blood has begun to boil.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(fierce whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, bitch. I'm paying you double this time. Kee Kee said tonight. I paid half in advance like she said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Rage is building in Lateesha's eyes. No one talks to her this way and gets away with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the next CUBICLE... RAOUL SANCHEZ (30), an OBESE HISPANIC MAN with BLONDS HIGHLIGHTS, leans his head over.
</DIRECTION>
<RAOUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lateesha... I need that web link.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAOUL>
<DIRECTION>
Lateesha does not answer. Her eyes are locked on Frances.
</DIRECTION>
<LATEESHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kee Kee don't make the rules. I said... four to six weeks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LATEESHA>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know if you realize who the fuck you're dealing with here. I can have your job eliminated like that.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Say good-bye to your little side business...

<FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)

Raoul is persistent.
</DIRECTION>
<RAOUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Teesha... I need that web link! The J-Lo concert is probably sold out already!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAOUL>
<DIRECTION>
Lateesha raises one GIGANTIC FINGERNAIL in Raoul's direction as if to say... IN A MINUTE. Raoul sighs impatiently and ducks back into his cubicle... cursing her in Spanish.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANCES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's it gonna be, Lateesha? Get ready to start counting those food stamps.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<DIRECTION>
Lateesha opens the DRAWER and removes the envelope. Gears are turning. Decisions are being made.
</DIRECTION>
<LATEESHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tonight. 8PM.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LATEESHA>
<DIRECTION>
She taps her nails on the plastic surface of the table.
</DIRECTION>
<LATEESHA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything else?

	Nope.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANCES>
<LATEESHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good-bye... Frances.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LATEESHA>
<DIRECTION>
As Frances turns to leave, Lateesha slams a PLASTIC SIGN down onto the ledge of WINDOW SIX. It reads: THIS WINDOW CLOSED. Lateesha then unfolds the piece of PAPER inside the envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The following SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS are printed in BLACK INK:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
774-32-5543 : 342-77-0098 : 323-34-5452 : 854-80-6745
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lateesha stares at the numbers... gears turning.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love is a desperate measure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
Lateesha takes the LOCKET that hangs around her neck and opens it. Inside... there are two photographs. A TEENAGE GIRL and a LITTLE BABY.
</DIRECTION>
<LATEESHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck 'em. Fuck 'em all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LATEESHA>
<DIRECTION>
Lateesha takes a deep breath... kisses the locket and closes it. She drops the paper down on the table and begins to type the SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS into her COMPUTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Raoul leans over once again.
</DIRECTION>
<RAOUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lateesha... I needed that web link an hour ago!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAOUL>
<DIRECTION>
Lateesha continues typing... disregarding his annoying plea.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Desperate measures often have disastrous consequences...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
Raoul stands up. He is losing his temper.
</DIRECTION>
<RAOUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lateesha... girl... are you listening?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAOUL>
<DIRECTION>
Nope. Fingernails keep typing. FOUR DRIVER'S LICENSES pop up on her computer screen. We get a glance at FOUR DMV PHOTOS. FOUR MEN. FRANCES is one of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The story of my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
Raoul's voice has become an unbearable high-pitched shrill.
</DIRECTION>
<RAOUL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	LATEESHA... THE WEB LINK. I NEED IT RIGHT NOW! THE CONCERT IS GONNA SELL OUT! WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAOUL>
<DIRECTION>
Lateesha whips her head around with the SASSY OUTRAGE cultivated by so many years at this shitty job.
</DIRECTION>
<LATEESHA>
<DIRECTION>
(screaming out)WWW.SHUT-THE-FUCK-UP.COM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The entire DMV is silenced. Raoul lowers back into his chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lateesha turns back to her computer screen. She aligns the MOUSE POINTER on the word SEND. She then lowers her GIGANTIC FINGERNAIL onto the MOUSE with the sound of DISTANT THUNDER.
</DIRECTION>

BEGIN CREDIT SEQUENCE: U2 & JOHNNY CASH - THE WANDERER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STREETS are filled with MILLIONS upon MILLIONS of DOMINOES. They are assembled in many colorful patterns seen in such 80's television programs as "THAT'S INCREDIBLE!" and "RIPLEY'S... BELIEVE IT OR NOT!".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the intersection of Wilshire and Santa Monica, THOUSANDS of falling dominoes assembled to spell out:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW LINE CINEMA PRESENTS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In Beverly Hills... there are thousands of falling dominoes assembled to spell out:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DAVIS FILMS/SCOTT FREE PRODUCTION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the abandoned 10 FREEWAY the dominoes read:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TONY SCOTT FILM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the abandoned 405 FREEWAY the dominoes read:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Domino.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow the IMMENSE TRAIL of falling dominoes throughout the city... through DOWNTOWN... CENTURY CITY... SANTA MONICA... COMPTON... revealing the rest of the OPENING CREDITS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we near the end of the sequence the trail takes us out into the DESERT where the falling dominoes read:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WRITTEN BY RICHARD KELLY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dominoes approach the lights of LAS VEGAS... approaching the western end of the STRIP. It is completely desolate. The lights twinkle... but there is no one there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dominoes finish on a PEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC BRIDGE that crosses the strip. They read:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DIRECTED BY TONY SCOTT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TRAIL of dominoes tapers off into a CEMENT HALLWAY... leading into the shadows. A METAL DOOR looms in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA lingers on the FINAL DOMINO... moving through the METAL DOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOMINO HARVEY (25) sits alone at a METAL TABLE. Despite her disheveled appearance, she looks like she could be on the cover of VOGUE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her hands are cuffed together. She holds a MARLBORO RED between the fingers on her right hand... raising it to her mouth. There is BLOOD SPLATTERED on her hand. A small cut on her lip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SINGLE TEAR traces down her cheek. There is a CHILD LINGERING just beneath the tough surface veneer.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Domino Harvey.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am... a bounty hunter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
Domino flips a book of MATCHES between her fingers. She raises her eyes to the GLASS WALL on the south end of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're watching me from behind that two way mirror. What I say over the next several hours will determine whether or not I spend the rest of my life in prison.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
Domino takes a pull from her Marlboro, wiping the tear away from her face. The METAL DOOR opens... and an attractive woman in a black business suit steps into the room. Her name is TARYN MILES (38).
</DIRECTION>
<TARYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ms. Harvey... my name is Taryn Miles. I'm a criminal psychologist working for the FBI. I'm here to ask you a few questions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TARYN>
<DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's the part where I'm supposed to get all defensive and say... 'not until I speak with my attorney.'
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
Domino takes another pull from her Marlboro... then stubs it in the ash tray.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure... I'll tell you everything I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
Taryn removes a file from her attache case and places it on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<TARYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thirty-six hours ago... ten million dollars was stolen from an armored car that was subsequently found abandoned at the Hoover Dam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TARYN>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT -- DAWN -- THIRTY-SIX HOURS BEFORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA SOARS over the desert... approaching the lights at the Hoover Dam. An ARMORED CAR is parked on the edge of the cement abyss.
</DIRECTION>
<TARYN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The driver's name was Locus Fender. We know that he was in on the heist.

INT. ARMORED CAR -- NEXT

LOCUS FENDER (30s) is behind the wheel of the armored car. His unshaven, disheveled appearance looks totally out of place in his security uniform.

<DIRECTION>
INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taryn is now scrawling notes on a pad.
</DIRECTION>
<TARYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is the money?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TARYN>
<DOMINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINO>
<TARYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think that you're lying. I think you know exactly where the money is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TARYN>
<DOMINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're trying to scare me into falsely incriminating myself... and it's not working. I said I'd tell you everything I know. You and your friends behind the mirror.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
Domino waves to the mirror. Taryn calmly opens her file... refusing to lose control.
</DIRECTION>
<TARYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it true that you were hired to track down and capture the thieves... and then deliver them to Drake Bishop... owner of the Stratosphere Hotel & Casino?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TARYN>
<DOMINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINO>
<TARYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You then learned where the thieves had hidden the money... and at the instructions of your employer went to retrieve it yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TARYN>
<DOMINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.

INT. FENDER HOUSE -- THE PREVIOUS NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FRONT DOOR to this house is KICKED FORWARD... snapping off its hinges onto the cheap tile floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HISPANIC MAN named CHOCO (38) is standing there with a SHOTGUN. He steps forward into the DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER HOME attached to an ADOBE SHACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him is a CAUCASIAN MAN named ED MARTIN (50s) wielding his own shotgun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the two men part ways... DOMINO... wearing jeans and a T- shirt... follows them through the doorway into the house. She carries a SEMI-AUTOMATIC PISTOL... moving into the FAMILY ROOM ahead of the men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tiny family room is pure SOUTH-WESTERN DESERT TRAILER PARK kitsch. None of the furniture matches. Shag carpeting. Georgia O'Keefe knockoffs on the walls. Stained wagon-wheel coffee tables.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Domino notices the LA-Z-BOY in the corner of the room. It is gently rocking back and forth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A low growling noise can be heard from the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	EDNA! WE KNOW YOU'RE IN HERE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
Domino turns back to the men with a raised finger... issuing a silent warning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the KITCHEN... EDNA FENDER (60s) is sitting on the floor against the cabinets. There is a SHOTGUN in her left hand. A PIT-BULL is restrained by its COLLAR in her right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks down at the dog, CHI-CHI (3), with a clenched jaw.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sick boy... Sick-em!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
SHE LETS GOT OF THE COLLAR AND CHI-CHI SPRINTS AROUND THE CORNER...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Choco fires a SHOTGUN BLAST into the floor of the trailer... detonating a HOLE in the carpet that is two feet wide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHI-CHI falls YELPING into the hole... cartwheeling down into the DARK ABYSS beneath the trailer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Domino turns back to Choco and sees that he still has his SHOTGUN aimed at the floor. Smoke drifts from the barrels into the gloom of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<CHOCO>
<DIRECTION>
(SPANISH WITH SUBTITLES)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	FUCK... I MISSED!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHOCO>
<DIRECTION>
Domino throws him a nod of gratitude anyway. He returns.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's my best friend. His name is Choco. He's always fancied me... but too shy to ever do anything about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINO>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chi-Chi!

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	CHI-CHI!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DOMINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chi-Chi has gone to doggie heaven, bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
Choco cocks his shotgun for emphasis. SHELLS drop down into the abyss. He likes it when Domino talks rough.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The next one is going to doggie hell!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
Ed snaps his fingers... and Choco removes his BACKPACK and begins to retrieve something from it.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All we want is the money, Edna!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DIRECTION>
Domino looks back at him... waiting for a signal.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Ed Martin. The most legendary bounty hunter in all of Los Angeles. He's my boss. My mentor. The father I never had.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
Edna is now SOBBING loudly.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chi-Chi... my poor Chi-Chi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
Ed throws Domino a nod. She moves further into the family room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edna may have shitty taste... but she isn't poor. Domino notices the MITSUBISHI widescreen. Surround Sound. DVD Player. The Manchurian Candidate is playing.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Manchurian Candidate, huh Edna?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
In the KITCHEN... Edna leans over and grabs a BUDWEISER longneck from a STYRO-FOAM COOLER. With the shotgun still in her left hand, she cracks the bottle open with her right and takes a long swig.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that you, Domino?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DOMINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice to see you again, Edna.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
Edna lets out a sly cackle... wiping the bitter tears from her face. She is wicked tough... not to mention wicked drunk. Age has not been kind to this desert harlot.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your father must be so proud.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look what has become of his little angel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
Ouch. That hit Domino below the belt.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen bitch! We've got your son! If you don't deliver the money... we're gonna wax his fucking ass!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
Edna takes another swig of Budweiser. The RAGE returns.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YOU DON'T HAVE SHIT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
Domino turns back to Choco. He has unwrapped a LARGE OBJECT from the backpack. It remains hidden in the shadows. Domino stares at it with trepidation. She's in over her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Choco steps forward into the light and we see that the object is a SEVERED HUMAN ARM. The BLOODY STUMP ends at the UPPER BICEP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Choco lobs the arm over the KITCHEN COUNTER and it lands on the linoleum floor next to Edna with a loud thump.
</DIRECTION>
<ED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't fuck with us, Edna! There are at least three more limbs where that one came from!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ED>
<DOMINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can certainly think of one more!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINO>
<DIRECTION>
Edna stares at the severed arm with her mouth twisted into a grimace of horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edna closes her eyes... takes a swig of Budweiser and then LEAPS up onto her FEET. She COCKS the shotgun and aims it blindly over the counter into the FAMILY ROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<EDNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	AAAAAHHHHHHH!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDNA>
<DIRECTION>
SHE UNLOADS TWO ROUNDS. TWO SHOTGUN BLASTS RIP HOLES IN THE WALL BETWEEN ED AND CHOCO. EVERYONE HITS THE GROUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Edna drops back down to the kitchen floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Domino's face is buried into the shag carpet. Her heart is pounding.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HE'S STILL ALIVE, EDNA!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINO>
<EDNA>

The FENDER COMPOUND sits out in the desert near JOSHUA TREE. There are JUNKED CARS, BARBED WIRE and SIGNS saying Keep out, Private Property, and Beware of Dog. Several FIRES are burning in metal barrels... sending smoke signals out across the horizon.

Choco looks at his watch anxiously. He seems to be under a lot of pressure. His clothes are splattered with blood. The entire Winnebago is splattered with blood. Some nasty shit has transpired.

Alf emerges from the back of the winnebago with Locus Fender. His LEFT ARM is missing. The wound has been sealed with DUCT TAPE. He is pale and delirious from the loss of blood.
