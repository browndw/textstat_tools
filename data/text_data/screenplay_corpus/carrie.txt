From an absolutely glistening WHITE ­ an image which first appears to be a brilliantly shining glass globe, and then gradually becomes more of a piece of solid matter, less of a mystery. It's the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WHITE BUNGALOW (OR HOUSE) ­ DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FILLING THE FRAME like a picture postcard. Modest, old-fashioned, spotless ­ a vision of small town normalcy and virtue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is the home of MARGARET WHITE and her daughter CARRIE. It seems to have been scrubbed from roof to porch; it is white. Even the lawn seems to have been washed and bleached. Antiseptic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a woman's voice:
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
(o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carrie! Carrie
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
The voice is distant but insistent. It is heard, in perspective, through the following prologue, which initially involves:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STELLA HORAN ­ DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An all-American sunbathing beauty of eighteen, getting the tan of her life with only a skimpy white bikini running interference between her skin and the sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA SLOWLY PANS OVER the expanse of her body ­ luxuriant, taking it in inch for inch as she dreamily rubs in suntan lotion and licks her lips. The MUSIC is coming from a transistor radio by her side; she's on a beach blanket in the Horan back yard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWNWARDS ANGLE ­ STELLA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she senses someone standing over her, someone staring at her body through the half- grown hedge which separates the Horan back yard from the White house next door.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are those?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
STELLA'S POV ­ CARRIE WHITE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A terribly appealing little girl, a child of indeterminable age. Pink cheeks, a halo of blonde- white hair which will darken in time. What sets her apart from other children, however, are a pair of bright button brown eyes; and it's these eyes that we notice as she peers at Stella through the hedge.
</DIRECTION>
<STELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hiya, Carrie. Gee you gave me a fright.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning down the radio)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long have you been there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STELLA>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(not smiling; pointing with her finger)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are those?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Stella looks where Carrie is pointing; the top of her bikini has slipped, just barely revealing her breasts ­ white against the golden tan. Stella adjusts her suit ­ not out of any particular modesty of her own but as a reflex at being stared at so strangely.
</DIRECTION>
<STELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those are my breasts, honey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STELLA>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat; then solemnly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish I had some.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<STELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will. `Course you'll have to wait a couple of years, but ­
	</DIALOGUE>
</STELLA>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(a fact)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No I won't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<STELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, sure you will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STELLA>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(emphatic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I won't.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(glancing behind her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Momma says no... Momma says good girls don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<STELLA>
<DIRECTION>
(at something of a loss)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm a good girl. And besides, doesn't your mother have breasts?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STELLA>
<DIRECTION>
CARRIE Glances anxiously at the mention of her mother at the White house next door. She swallows her words so that all Stella and we hear is:
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...dirtypillows.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<STELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STELLA>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Momma calls them dirtypillows. Says she's got them `cuz she was bad when she made me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
STELLA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Incredulous. But she senses that Carrie is both perfectly serious and quite worried, and she too glances warily over at the White house just beyond the half-grown hedge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She kneels next to Carrie and tries to laugh it off.
</DIRECTION>
<STELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, honey, that's just silly. Listen ­ you must be real hot in that long dress. What do you say we go inside and get us some lemonade, would you like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STELLA>
<DIRECTION>
CARRIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clearly torn ­ tempted but in the clutch of some weird terror ­ as if she expected the earth to open and swallow her up. She shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<STELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(offering her hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll be our secret.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STELLA>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie ­ now really scared ­ shakes her head and disappears farther into the hedge.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<STELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure you can. I make it nice and sweet, and ­
	</DIALOGUE>
</STELLA>
<DIRECTION>
And just at that moment, a figure appears in the second-story window in the White house. Although Stella and we really can't distinctly see through the sun's glare, it's unmistakably MARGARET WHITE. The moment this big woman sees her daughter with Stella, she lets out a bloodcurdling scream:
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	CAARRIEETTAAA!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
CARRIE, STELLA Both frozen by this terrible sound
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STELLA'S POV ­ CLOSER ON CARRIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she sucks in her breath, quivering with fright, looking as if she might faints. She looks quickly to Stella, then back at the White house, then back to Stella. For the merest flash, she seems to smile ­ or is she about to cry?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then, she's gone ­ running around the hedge and then up the porch stairs and into the White house as fast her legs can carry her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STELLA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stands there, riveted. Not knowing what's happened, what to do. It's utterly silent for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then, an incredible CACOPHONY of strange sounds starts coming from the White house ­ an unearthly babble as Margaret White screams, rants, and screeches; as Carrie sobs that she's sorry, that she forgot.
</DIRECTION>
<STELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mother!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(louder)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mother!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STELLA>
<DIRECTION>
THE HORAN HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As MRS. HORAN ­ in an old housedress with the hem falling down in the back ­ rushes out to answer to her daughter's call.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_HORAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What in the name of God? What's the matter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_HORAN>
<STELLA>
<DIRECTION>
(frantic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know... Carrie was just talking to me, and Mrs. White started screaming and...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STELLA>
<DIRECTION>
THE WHITE HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun glistening brilliantly on it as in the opening shot. Again, it should appear like a huge glass globe over which we counterpoint one mother/daughter dialogue with the less distinct babble of another:
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
(v.o.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you to stay away from there, I told you....
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>

	I'm sorry, Momma.

<MARGARET>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
Which continues over:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT ­ STELLA AND MRS. HORAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes riveted on the house ­ trying, squinting to see through the sun's terrible glare.
</DIRECTION>
<STELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you yell at her like that! Stop that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STELLA>
<MRS_HORAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That poor sweet child...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_HORAN>
<STELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mother, we've got to do something!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STELLA>
<MRS_HORAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_HORAN>
<STELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call the police? Mother, call the police!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STELLA>
<MRS_HORAN>
<DIRECTION>
(not about to interfere; hopeless)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The child...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_HORAN>
<DIRECTION>
At this point, the hysteric babble reaches its crescendo; we should be able to pick out phrases in this cacophony as Margaret rants at Carrie to go into her closet and pray for forgiveness; as Carrie's frightened little voice proclaims that she forgot, that she's sorry. And then suddenly the screaming stops and it's quiet ­ dead quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WHITE HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it becomes more distinct, visible. There's a low WHISTLING sound, and then what appears to be a stone the size of a small pebble lands on the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another, slightly larger one appears a second or two later. And then another, and another, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHTER TWO SHOT ­ STELLA AND MRS. HORAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
squinting, blinking at the pebbles which are coming down like marbles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WHITE HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it's pelted with what are now even larger stones ­ WHISTLING, SCREAMING in the air like miniature bombs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stones from a perfectly blue summer day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stones ranging in size from marbles to handballs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of them hits a downspout, knocking it onto the lawn. CRASHING, CRACKING SOUNDS as these pieces of granite tear into the stucco roofing, leaving holes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The effect is that of a drum being bombarded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT ­ MRS. HORAN AND STELLA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frozen to the spot: Mrs. Horan with her hands over her ears, her screams blending with the SOUND of larger and larger stones as they pelt the house and we hear Margaret throughout screaming:
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop that! Stop that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Stella is clutching Mrs. Horan like a child terrified by the freakiest of summer storms ­ a healthy young woman as her figure in the bikini testifies, but a child nonetheless, this nightmarish moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As still larger stones hail from the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then just as suddenly and inexplicably as they started, they stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT ­ THE WOMEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Horan with her hands still over her ears, her daughter standing next to her, transfixed on the lawn. Once again, it's quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WHITE HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As one final stone ­ this one the size of a mere pebble ­ falls from the roof and plops onto the lawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The image grows lighter and lighter. All the color seems to bleach out, turning the screen once again into an incredible, silently blazing white.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAIN TITLES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE ­ MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now some years later ­ and no longer glistening so whitely or mysteriously. We see the front of the house as the door flies open. Carrie, now sixteen or seventeen, appears in the doorway, carrying school books. As she comes out on the porch, the screen door bangs behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is wearing a shapeless, drab dress ­ much too long, not so much out of style as utterly without style. What remains in this adolescent girl that links her with the pretty child we glimpsed in the prologue are those remarkable eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she comes down the porch stairs, we hear:
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carrie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie stops, turns to reply into the house.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Momma.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<MARGARET_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You come straight home from school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGARET_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
A moment of hesitation on Carrie's part, a very slight hint of rebellion, but:
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(sweetly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I always do, Momma.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Then she turns, walks to the street, gathering pace, quickening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT WHITE HOUSE ­ ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Carrie walks down the path from the porch and turns at the sidewalk, in the course of which she passes by where the Horans used to live. Only the Horans no longer live here. No one does. It's a vacant lot with a FOR SALE sign out front, with overgrown weeds. From the looks of them, the house vanished a long time ago.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOWN STREETS ­ DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie is walking to school, the sun shining brightly above her. The farther she gets from her house, the livelier she seems. We sense that underneath this drab dress is a girl pushing out, an altogether different creature than her appearance would suggest. And to help persuade us about this possibility, there is MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOBBY ERBETER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
About five, BOBBY bikes on the other side of one of the streets, keeping pace with Carrie on a twenty-inch Schwinn with training wheels.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, fart-face! Hey, old praying Carrie! Praying, Carrie, praying Carrie, praying Carrie!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie favors him with a sweet tolerant smile and goes on toward the high school, in the background:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby, frustrated, stops astride is bike and screams after her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby's face ­
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FACE OF AN ADOLESCENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Or as he is known in school, THE BEAK. He is pathetically thin, myopic, weak-chinned, beak-nosed, almost a caricature of an adolescent reject. Over his face, we HEAR:
</DIRECTION>
<FROMM_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you going to leave for us, You people in your big cars Spewing pollution into the air?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FROMM_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
We PAN the faces of adolescents, listening with various degrees of attention, indifference, or reluctance, to:
</DIRECTION>
<FROMM_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You people with heavy feet Trampling down the wilderness? You people who peer into the back seats of our cars Hours after you come out of the back doors of your motels. Soon all we will have is each other, and that could be enough...

INT. CLASSROOM ­ FROMM ­ DAY

<DIRECTION>
Or, as he is known to his pupils, BIG BELLY FROMM, at his desk in front of the class, reading from an assignment paper.
</DIRECTION>
<FROMM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...If you will let us have room enough And air enough And peace enough To love each other As you never could

</FROMM>

He sets down the paper, and looks at the class.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROMM'S POV ­ THE CLASS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We will see, among others, Carrie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We also see TOMMY ROSS ­ a mid-seventies version of the boy next door. Good-looking, clean-cut, intelligent, athletic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROMM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is nodding his head slowly, affecting a kind of puzzlement.

	...a talent extraordinary for you, Tommy Ross.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FROMM>
<DIRECTION>
THE CLASS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All eyes are on Tommy, who doesn't seem very abashed. In fact, he turns, clasps his hands over his head, to the delight of his classmates. But you don't get the feeling he is a goof-off; he is a kid aware of his own popularity and comfortable with it.
</DIRECTION>

The usual hesitation. Then Carrie's hand shoots up.

Her volunteering has surprised her as well. But she's stuck with it. The eyes of the class are on her. And she has to say something. So she does.

<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's... beautiful.

He leaves his desk, moving into the class area, seeming to pounce on Carrie.

	`Beautiful.' `Bee-t-ti-ful!' `Oh beautiful for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain.' Is that the beautiful you mean?

The class is snickering. Carrie throws a despairing glance toward Tommy. Tommy looks at her, and away, embarrassed. Carrie looks down at her desk, almost burying herself.

(no one else)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, at least we've finally gotten Carrie White to say something!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FROMM>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy looks toward Carrie, with something suggesting compassion. Then he looks toward Fromm, and he is muttering something. Or to be specific:

EXT. VOLLEYBALL COURT ­ DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two teams of girls, among them NORMA WATSON, HELEN SHYRES, CORA and RHONDA WILSON (sisters although not identical twins), CHRIS HARGENSEN and SUE SNELL. Supervising the game is MISS COLLINS wearing a warm-up suit and holding a whistle awaiting the next point. Among the girls is CARRIE anxiously watching for the ball to come her way. It has apparently been a close game, the competition building steadily. When the shot begins, Miss Collins has just blown her whistle to announce:
</DIRECTION>
<COLLINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, now. This is game point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLLINS>
<DIRECTION>
This is the final point of the game and Rhonda Wilson is serving (she is on the opposite team as Carrie).

<RHONDA>
<DIRECTION>
(giving the score)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty ­ Twenty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RHONDA>
<DIRECTION>
The ball is successfully served and remains in play for some time as the girls skillfully volley it back and forth over the net. And then, just when the tension is its greatest, the ball comes over the net toward Carrie. It's evident that the outcome of the game depends upon her success. The little boy who decided to put his finger in the dyke had it easier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other girls are (AD LIB) shouting cautions and admonitions to Carrie. Carrie almost trembles with tension, about to bat the ball over the net, afraid to hit it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie whacks the ball. She shacks it hard. And on a line ­ straight into the net.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another chorus of groans, with remarks like "Wouldn't you know!" and "Dumbo!" reinforcing them. Chris storms back toward Carrie.

INT SHOWER ROOM ­ DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steam partially obscures the girls as they whoop and holler and cavort under individual showers. They banter little barbed pleasantries, bits of sexual information, family plaints, talk of college ­ all of which we hear from separate stalls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One by one the showers are turned off, the girls stepping out, removing pastel bathing caps, toweling, spraying deodorant, bras hooked, underpants stepped into. Steam hangs in the air. So do words, running into one another, tumbling, drifting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
`...Tommy says he hated it on me... My sister's husband picks his nose... So does your sister... too cheap to spend a penny... we'll go after school... I'm going with Billy, we'll meet you... Friday night...'

We PICK UP Miss Collins as she steps among the girls, spies Carrie still standing under the shower. She claps her hands together once, smartly.

As Collins departs, and the other girls start to move toward their lockers, Carrie is left alone in her shower stall. She is soaping herself. In a virtual reverie, she begins at her shoulders, moving her hands over her breasts in small, regular, virtually erotic circles. Her hand goes out of frame, below her stomach. Slowly, it emerges back into frame ­ full of blood. And just as she and we see this, so do the girls.

Behind her, another girl pretends to throw up.

<DIRECTION>
Who is sitting in an old Boston rocker by the window in her room which overlooks the street. She is wearing just a slip or perhaps an old terrycloth robe ­ her plain dress and school books on the narrow bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is leafing through a teenage magazine on the order of "Seventeen" ­ absorbed in the mundane fantasies of models in their pantyhose and underwear; long gowns and mystery men. An escape of sorts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we reveal Carrie's bedroom in the low attic of the White house: tiny, plain, severe. It's decorated with just the fewest embellishments (i.e. high school pennant) that Margaret would allow in exchange for her own prices ­ a crucifix above Carrie's bed, a small bureau with an equally small mirror, a Bible and plastic glow-in-the-dark Madonna and child, and various religious prints and plaster quotations on the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ­ FEATURING CARRIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Caught up in the magazine, in the most normal of female fantasies courtesy of the slick Madison Avenue mind. And then, with that extra sense of perception apparatus that fears it's about to be caught doing something it shouldn't, Carrie glances out the window and down to see:
</DIRECTION>

As this formidable vision of black strides down the walk. Another woman like this would be coming home from a funeral; Margaret actually seems to like black.

CLOSEUP ­ CARRIE

<DIRECTION>
Her heart pounding as we glimpse that look of terror we witnessed earlier ­ a scared little girl now encased in the body of an adolescent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she hears Margaret close the front door and call out her name as she hangs up her coat, Carrie hastily stashes the magazine under the mattress. Then she begins to dress as we hear the SOUNDS of Margaret in the kitchen, starting her daily afternoon ritual of making tea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then the telephone RINGS ­ only to stop as Margaret picks up the receiver. It's just as Carrie dreaded ­ it's the school ­ and she stands by the door, trying desperately to overhear Margaret's muffled voice. And then Margaret hangs up, and in a deadly tone of voice ­ not yelling but enunciation with a terrible clarity ­ she calls up the stairs:
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you're listening. Come downstairs.

And defeated, Carrie braces herself and goes down the:

As she hurries down toward her mother and into:

<CARRIE>

<DIRECTION>
No response. The teakettle is just beginning to boil over the gas burner, and in this altogether strange little kitchen ­ a veritable arsenal of lace-tatted religious art ­ Margaret is a rock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie sits down at the kitchen table, bursting with shame and the need to talk. Yet she recognizes her mother's wall of silence, knowing she won't speak until she's ready. They've been through this dance a thousand times. Finally, Carrie breaks.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who was it that called?

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did they say?

</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Point one and some grim satisfaction. Yet she doesn't respond immediately. Then she turns from the stove.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a woman now.

	Oh Momma, why didn't you tell me something? I was so scared...

Margaret walks over to the table and sits next to Carrie. She puts on rimless glasses, then opens the Bible and starts to read with one of those strange Kathryn Kuhlman looks on her face:

Sue and Tommy have finished making love in the back seat. They are both putting their clothes in order, silently, slowly.

Margaret is at the sewing machine. She is either listening to a reasonable facsimile of Kathryn Kuhlman preaching on the radio, or instead, to an old Victrola which plays Tennessee Ernie Ford's "Let the Lower Lights Be Burning." A Black Forest cuckoo clock, providing a sense of lapsed time.
</DIRECTION>

Suddenly the treadle on the sewing machine depresses itself. The needle begins to dip up and down; the bobbin whirs and jerks.
</DIRECTION>

Margaret turns around to see:

She is standing in the entrance of the living room. Her demeanor seems more peaceful, calm, almost too calm.

INT. CARRIE'S ROOM ­ NIGHT

Carrie turns on a light. She undresses slowly, wearily. And then she stops and looks at herself in the mirror. A close, tired inspection. Her eyes seem hollow, haunted. Carrie doesn't like what she sees; she doesn't like herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flex. Slowly cracks appear in the mirror, spiderwebs.

Flex. The mirror cracks wider.

Margaret peers around the room; she did hear a mirror break, no mistake about it. But there it is ­ whole again as her reflection in it testifies. Margaret walks over to it, rearranges the plastic glow-in-the-dark Madonna and child on the dresser.

Billy takes a huge toke from a joint and hands it to her; she ignores that too, and proceeds to busy herself applying makeup in the visor window.

A couple of other students watch this ­ is this their Tommy Ross actually trying to speak with Carrie? But he's oblivious of any looks now, any snickering ­ all he wants is to catch up with Carrie.

Which he does; he manages to touch her arm, and it's a weird moment, this contact. She turns around, her head painfully ducked down.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you people think you can just go on tricking me forever?
	</DIALOGUE>

A beat. Tommy stands there helpless, sensing just how much of a big deal it is. Seeing that she's on the verge of tears, he's feeling even worse, and all he can say is:

	Sorry.

Leading to Henty's farm. A slight drizzle; or, the ground is still wet. A little more than a crescent moon silhouettes a group of five: Billy and Chris in front, and Billy's twitchy zoo ­ a completely wrecked KENNY GARSON, a very nervous FREDDY DE LOIS, and an occasionally giggling, goggled HENRY TRENNANT ­ trailing behind. De Lois is swinging a nine-pound sledge-hammer in the air; the other two goons are struggling with an ice-chest and steel pails. Henty's farmhouse and barn are in the distance.

Courtesy of Carrie, the treadle on the machine depresses itself.

Carrie sits in front of that same mirror, but this time, there's a different attitude. And a different girl, which pleases her. She looks different, very different, from before. She's dressed in her lush red crushed velvet prom dress, but the SHOT is ANGLED in such a way that we don't see it. In any case, it is not prim. She is wearing some makeup. She looks... well, there has been a transformation.

Carrie's voice is calm; nothing, not even Margaret, will spoil tonight, and ever so slightly, this scene ­ and all that follow for a considerable period of time ­ has an edge of unreality to it.

Bur she's rattled, and nervously starts moving around a series of objects in the room. Cosmetics on the bureau, the florist box, the glow-in-the-dark statue. But it's sheer will at this point. It's after eight, and there's no sign of Tommy.

<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not too late. You can stay here with me.

	No.

Margaret is pushed back on the bed. Horrified, she rises again.

	I'll say that you changed your mind, I'll say ­

Margaret is thrust back on the bed.

	`Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.'

</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
The words stop. But Margaret's eyes are fixed on Carrie, as Carrie leans toward her. Carrie's voice is soft and compassionate.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll say nothing, Momma. You are going to have to learn that I'm not like you, not anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
The BUZZER downstairs sounds. Carrie goes to her window and sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARRIE'S POV ­ TOMMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
at the front door, the overhead light shining on his hair, making it glisten. He looks very handsome.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARRIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She goes back to the bed and picks up her wrap; then, to Margaret:
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be home early, Momma.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
The BUZZER downstairs sounds again.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's going to be a judgement!

</MARGARET>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Momma, you will be quiet until I'm gone.

<DIRECTION>
(beat; then, at the door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you, Momma.

</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
And she's gone, down the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
STAIRS, LIVING ROOM, TO THE FRONT DOOR ­ TRACKING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie who opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON TOMMY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Well, we know he's beautiful. And he's looking at Carrie. He didn't know:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARRIE ­ TOMMY'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He didn't know she could be beautiful. And she is.

<DIRECTION>
TOMMY AND CARRIE

<DIRECTION>
He reaches out his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.

Carrie takes his hand.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. WHITE HOUSE ­ NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hand in hand, Carrie and Tommy walk down the path toward his car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are observed by:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
at the window of Carrie's room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CARRIE'S ROOM ­ NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margaret leaves the window as we HEAR Tommy's car drive off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She goes out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING MARGARET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Down the stairs, through the dining room, into the kitchen. Almost the same path that Carrie trod, but trod so differently. While Carrie's pace had been light, nervously expectant, Margaret's is slow and heavy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHITE KITCHEN ­ NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margaret crosses to one of the drawers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches in and takes out a long carving knife; it gleams in the light.

CUT TO:

EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT ­ NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The school gymnasium is lit up brightly for the Prom; cars are pulling in, among them, Tommy's Ford.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOMMY'S CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Tommy turns off the ignition. Carrie's staring at the other couples getting out of their cars. Tommy watches her taking it all in.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's like a dream.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can still change your mind, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to him and realizes he's teasing her.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easier said than done.

<TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(grinning)

	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon.

<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Please ­ not yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scared?

<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we sit here another minute?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy laughs and nods. A moment of silence. Carrie is miserable ­ she's happy to be with Tommy, she's trying to have a good time, but it's hard. It's like getting up to dance the first time. Perhaps it would be better to sit this one out.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tommy...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(and then out it comes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe... maybe this was a mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, it won't be so bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to smile at him. It's not very persuasive.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really, I mean it. They're okay, you'll see.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat; she's trying to believe him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be nervous. Besides...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a little self-mocking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd look awfully silly dancing by myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
And that's just enough ­ he's taken her mind off her own fear just enough to make her laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GYM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where the prom is already under way, the band PLAYING an energetic version of "Harlem Nocturne." From Carrie's POV it's all magic ­ explosions of pastel color, everyone looking like they stepped out of an advertisement for happiness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie just stands at the double-doors which are the main entrance to the gym, taking it all in as Tommy hands their tickets to ushers at the door. As Carrie stares at the giant mural on the stage wall ­ full of celestial moon, stars and rockets ­ a VOICE bellows out behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Ross. Gawd, you look queer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
GEORGE DAWSON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The source of the salutation and Tommy's best friend. He bounds INTO FRAME, wearing a T-shirt with a painted black tie under his dinner jacket. His girlfriend, Frieda Jason, tags behind.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When did you come out of the treetops, Bomba?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ross, if I'd known you were going to look this good, I'd have asked you instead of Frieda.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
The two boys immediately go into a mock fight. Frieda comes up to Carrie.
</DIRECTION>
<FRIEDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't let it bother you. If they destroy each other, I'll dance with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRIEDA>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie smiles back at her nervously; there's an awkward silence.
</DIRECTION>
<FRIEDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, where'd you buy your dress? I love it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRIEDA>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I made it.

(unaffected surprise)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Made it? No shit.

</FRIEDA>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie hesitates; realizes Frieda is quite sincere.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Frieda laughs; so does Carrie, and the tension eases up. Behind them, Tommy keeps one eye on Carrie. He shrugs ­ it's working, goddammit ­ and he stuffs his hands into his dinner jacket.

ANOTHER ANGLE ­ THE GYM

Carrie and Frieda, Tommy and George right behind them, head for their tables.

	S'okay. We're sitting together.

Norma Watson rushes over to them ­ all breathy taffeta and green chiffon.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I made it.

	Well, of course you did. I can't get over it, you look so different. You're positively glowing. What's your secret?

MONTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the prom gets underway:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A) JOSIE AND THE MOONGLOWS ­ THE BAND ­ make like Lawrence Welk and launch into an oldie-but-goodie. On drums ­ The Beak himself. B) THE TWINS ­ CORA AND RHONDA ­ dressed identically, dancing with C) ERNEST PETERSON, the black class president, is wonderfully officious as he gets the evening's first entertainment organized. It (or she) is ­ D) SANDRA STENCHFIELD and her fabulous twirling baton act, a phenomenon to the lilting STRAINS of "Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head." E) NORMA is off in a corner, bending another girl's ear; STAN is standing idly by, pretending to be invisible. F) MORTON, FROMM and the other chaperones including MISS FISH look for something to do, for someone who's stepping out of line. And find it. In the person of FREDDY DE LOIS, who's guzzling the punch. G) TOMMY and CARRIE sit at their table next to GEORGE and FRIEDA. Tommy lights a candle.

<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ­ TOMMY AND CARRIE'S TABLE

As Josie and the Moonglows launch into a new NUMBER. George suddenly comes to life.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Viiibes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs Frieda, and they make their way out onto the dance floor, Frieda shrugging helplessly at Carrie.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're nice. George is funny.

<TOMMY>

<DIRECTION>
Tommy nods ­ it's okay with him.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carrie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie turns around and finds herself facing Collins ­ dressed up, looking more like one of the students than a teacher.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look very pretty, Miss Collins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<COLLINS>
	<DIALOGUE>

<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's awfully nice of you to say so. I know I'm not... not really... but thank you anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy ­ feeling like a fifth wheel ­ clears his throat and stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	`scuse me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Carrie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be right back, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
He goes off into the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<COLLINS>
<DIRECTION>
(gesturing to his seat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLLINS>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie nods, and she sits down, pulling the chair next to her. They're virtually alone at this moment; everyone else is dancing or occupied.
</DIRECTION>
<COLLINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Carrie, anything that happened before... well, it's all forgotten. I want you to know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLLINS>
<CARRIE>

	I can't forget it.

	<DIALOGUE>
	But it's over with. It's over.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Collins smiles; she looks at the dance floor and Carrie's eyes follow hers. At this particular moment, the band is PLAYING a quiet number ­ slow, romantic.
</DIRECTION>
<COLLINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember my own prom. I was two inches taller than the boy I went with when I was in my heels. He gave me a corsage that clashed with my gown. But it was magic. I don't know why. But I've never had a date like it, ever since. Is it like that for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLLINS>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's very... nice.

	No. There's more. I don't know...

(hesitating; then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...it's like being on Mars.

</CARRIE>
<COLLINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll never forget it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLLINS>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you're right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
And then, on sheer impulse, Carrie reaches out and hugs her, hugs her tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.

</COLLINS>
<DIRECTION>
A smile at Carrie, and she goes off.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't let me catch you hugging any guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You won't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better not. Hey, listen, do you really have to be back so early?

<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's okay.

</CARRIE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is?

</TOMMY>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to go with your friends. I don't want to spoil anything...

</CARRIE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, let me finish. What I was going to say, I mean if it'd be alright with you, what do you say we go to the Cavalier?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised; she'd love to)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've never been there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, great. We'll have the place all to ourselves. Great!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he means it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then it's settled.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
He takes her arm, turns her toward the dance floor.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(holding back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tommy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon...

<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't... I can't... I...

</CARRIE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
He has his arms around her and half-spins, half tugs her out onto the floor. He is a young man of considerable confidence ­ the best part of his popularity ­ and it's a contagious trait. Gradually, Carrie gets caught up in the slow dancing, begins to follow him less and less awkwardly, begins to get less and less self-conscious, and, in short, starts to glide into her freedom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CORNER OF THE GYM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy and Carrie dance into this corner; Carrie is a bit breathless and very happy. For some moments, Tommy keeps his arms around Carrie, looking at her. And then he leans forward, about to kiss her, impulsively. And impulsively and instinctively, she draws back. And is immediately embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.

</CARRIE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>

<CARRIE>

</CARRIE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No harm, no foul.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
They stand there for a couple of seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And suddenly and swiftly, Carrie kisses Tommy. It's a quick, awkward, frightened kiss. A bird peck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And again they stand there, until:
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know... anything. I can't dance...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You danced.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't even know how to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
And he kisses her. She breaks, looking up at him.
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tommy... why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why what?

</TOMMY>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why am I here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the prom.

</TOMMY>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I asked you. And...

</TOMMY>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? Why did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I wanted to.

</TOMMY>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

</CARRIE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because...

</TOMMY>
<DIRECTION>
He pauses; he's on the edge. And steps back.
</DIRECTION>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...you liked my poem. Only I didn't write it. Someone else did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.

</CARRIE>

She's puzzled. And she's about to ask something else.
</DIRECTION>

	Look, Carrie, we're here, we're together... and I like it, you know... I mean, I...

Tommy turns.

CARRIE

A small smile at being recognized by the Beak as the one responsible, the one with the power now. It's not what she wanted, but it no longer matters. They're going to know her now and never forget her.

as her eyes narrow and focus on the hose, zeroing on it.

THE HOSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it starts to unwind, to unspiral into the air, starting to spray a burst of water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HOSE ­ ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it becomes snake-like, water springing from the nozzle.

<DIRECTION>
THE STUDENTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cries of surprise as it begins to spray water on them, ruining their clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HOSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the velocity of the water increases, stronger and stronger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARRIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eyes gleaming, a glimmer of triumph as she concentrates and surveys ­
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE STUDENTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like rats in a maze ­ a slapstick chaos as they try to get away from the animated hose. The water forces the students back from the doors, backwards toward the stage.

280A CHRIS AND BILLY ­ UNDER THE STAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they see students propelled toward them by the hose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARRIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A smile of satisfaction. For the first time, she's showing them ­ they're the ones being made to look foolish. She's standing on one side of the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ERNEST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Level-headed to the end, making his way through the pandemonium toward the stage area and the bandstand as fast as he can...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARRIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still controlling the hose, she spots Ernest, seeing him move toward the stage area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING ­ ERNEST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
knowing somehow ­ with some sixth sense ­ that Carrie's watching him. He feverishly hurries toward the area where the band equipment is plugged in... where the high voltage cables are hooked up to the electrical current.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him, Fromm has reached the microphone and is trying to be heard, telling everyone to remain calm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARRIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Realizing just what Ernest plans to do:
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
(gently; determined)

	No.

</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
And she mentally fixes on him, jerking her head just so... so ­
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ERNEST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is flung invisibly and forcibly away from the area by Carrie's will.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROMM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Big belly and all, trying to steady the mike. He puts his hand on it. The water, however, has reached him, and just as he touches the mic, he's electrocuted ­ his arm bursting into flame, unable to let go as his body goes into an electric dance, his mouth gaping open like a fish on land.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARRIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watching this; another flex, and:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FROMM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is propelled backwards from the microphone; he falls backward into the cyc, his flaming arm igniting it. A celestial fantasy immediately bursts into flames. It prevents any of the students from using the back exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE STUDENTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watching, riveted with horror, some of them screaming, others frozen to the spot as the cyc CRACKLES. Utter pandemonium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARRIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her face flushed, a vein in her forehead throbs, her heart pounding. She spots:

<DIRECTION>
THE LIGHTING T-BAR

<DIRECTION>
hanging over the bandstand.

<DIRECTION>

as the prom-goers press against the opaque glass, straining to get out. Fish in an aquarium.

<DIRECTION>
CARRIE

<DIRECTION>
She flexes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CEILING POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Collins and Ernest directly below the path of the lighting bar. We see the flaming cyc on the stage collapse forward. The light bar begins to shake. Plaster drops, and the light bar DROPS ­ just short of Collins' head ­ as far as its wires carry it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARRIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watching all this ­ a giggle (or is it a sob?) emerging from deep within her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another flex.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE LIGHT BAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
starts to swing recklessly around the gym. Back and forth, back and forth ­ it hits the ceiling, igniting it and the decorations. Flaming stars and planets begin dropping from the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BENEATH THE STAGE ­ CHRIS AND BILLY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
seeing their chance to escape while Carrie is busy with the light bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The back door (which Sue couldn't enter from the outside, and which the cyc flames prevented any of the students on the gym floor to get to) is now free, and Billy and Chris see their chance to escape. They burst out from under the stage as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARRIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spots them. In the instant it takes her to wonder what they're doing there, it's too late. They're out the door, and there's absolutely nothing she can do.

THE GYM ­ FEATURING THE LIGHT BAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it swings, catching Norma Watson in its path, casually whipping this screaming girl in her green chiffon dress back into a wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Helen Shyres is backed into a corner, giggling with horror, in shock, utterly hysterical.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Students have climbed onto the back of the bleachers, trying in vain to pry off the screens on the windows so they can escape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Morton has grabbed a chair and is trying to smash it through another of the windows. All this to no avail. End SPLIT SCREEN.
</DIRECTION>

CARRIE

As Carrie exits, the doors swinging shut. Behind her, through the windows, we see a wall of fire collapse behind her.

Carrie's on her way home. At this point, she looks less like a girl that the survivor of a grisly car accident; wet, caked with blood, eyes glistening madly, almost shapeless. She goes down a hill, and then, from:

<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE ­ THE HILL ­ NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as a fire truck rushes toward the school, past Carrie. And then shortly afterward, out of nowhere, Billy's Chevy ­ it's headlights gleaming, lurches forward; it's headed right for her.

Turns around and sees it coming toward her.

Chris screaming "Get her! Get her!" at the top of her lungs, Billy grinning madly behind the wheel.

As the Chevy heads right for her, standing in the headlights in its path, bloated, swaying back and forth, her arms thrown out.

<DIRECTION>
Almost right on top of her...

Flexing, averting the car just as it almost smacks into her. It just misses her.

Her head pounding, flexing.

They're heading right for the embankment. Billy's eyes are bugging out, Chris is screaming as:

<DIRECTION>
Plows smack into the embankment and rolls over several times. It then bursts into a sheet of flames.
</DIRECTION>

Watching this explosion turn into a conflagration. We see the fire reflected in her puffy, exhausted face ­ brighter and brighter as we HEAR the sound of the WHISTLE merging with SOUND OF SIRENS, and:

EXT WHITE HOUSE ­ NIGHT

The house is totally dark. Not even a porch light. In the distance, perhaps, the glow from the burning gymnasium.

<DIRECTION>
A figure is moving toward the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is Carrie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Carrie tries the front door. It is unlocked. She opens it partially.

Carrie closes the front door.

With the closing of the door, Carrie turns on a light. She looks around. The house is ominously empty, ominously still.

	MOMMA!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Silence floods back in.

Carrie moves to the foot of the stairs, turning on lights as she goes. She mounts the stairs, goes along the narrow hallway to her room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CARRIE'S ROOM ­ NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie turns on the lights, closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at the Madonna-child figurine on the bureau.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, slowly, she removes her blood-stained clothing, letting it lie in a heap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clutching a robe, she goes into the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM ­ NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie turns on the shower, waits for it to get hot. It is almost steaming as she steps in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Very carefully, Carrie scrubs herself clean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she steps out of the shower, dries herself off briefly, puts on her robe, and turns off the bathroom light. What's important here is this gives us time to breathe, to focus on Carrie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CARRIE'S ROOM ­ NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie returns to her room. She is clean now; her wet hair hangs. A feeling of despair about her or perhaps she is emptied out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie almost mouths:
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Momma...

</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
It is a little child's voice and there is no answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She goes out into the hallway.

<DIRECTION>
Carrie goes to the head of the stairs. Once again, she mouths the words:

<CARRIE>

</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
Something ­ a movement? An instinct? -- makes her turn. She sees:

<DIRECTION>
MARGARET

<DIRECTION>
Coming toward her.

She flings out her arms and cries out:
</DIRECTION>
<CARRIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Momma!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARRIE>
<DIRECTION>
And throws herself against her mother, holds her. A movement from Margaret, a quick movement, hard to define. And Carrie recoils, her hands clutching her stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Briefly we see the knife in Margaret's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Carrie tumbles down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE DOWN STAIRS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On Carrie, lying like a broken doll, huddled at the foot of the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET

Carrying the knife, she stares down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARGARET It says in the Lord's Book: `Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.'
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CARRIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dazed, she sees her mother coming, dimly, everything distorted. She begins to crawl backwards, her eyes always on her mother, who is slowly but inexorably coming down the stairs.

<DIRECTION>
Carrie starts crawling to the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN ­ NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie crawls farther and farther from the door, until she reaches the far end of the kitchen, just as Margaret, the knife gleaming in her hand, pointed toward Carrie, reaches the bottom of the stairs and turns toward the kitchen, mumbling all the while.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie flexes: the kitchen door swings shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margaret is coming toward the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie flexes again ­ to hold the door shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But it's no use ­ Margaret is relentless now, and the door opens. She raises the knife and starts toward Carrie, the door swinging behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGARET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should have killed you when you were born.

<MARGARET>

	Sin never dies.

</MARGARET>
<DIRECTION>
There's nothing else to be done. Carrie flexes, and a serving fork ­ dangling from a hook on the way ­ suddenly hurtles through the air, piercing Margaret. It is followed by another and another as a rain of instruments strikes Margaret.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margaret collapses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carrie, horrified by what she's done, starts toward her mother.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then she and we see Sue standing in the doorway, clasping her hand to her mouth, stifling her screams.

Then a third.

The stones are beginning to rain on the roof, like hail.

Sue is rooted to the spot, terrified.

A stone of fairly small size crashes through into the kitchen.

Carrie flexes.

And Sue stumbles backwards toward the door.

Sue is whipped around, as though by a great wind.

Eleanor Snell, looking incredibly tired, is attending to the last-minute details of moving. She sorts through magazines and books, discarding some, putting others into cartons. And she comes across the religious tracts left behind by Margaret White, forgotten until now. They have a momentary hypnotic effect on her.

looking utterly haggard and perhaps a bit on the loony side from a lack of sleep stands staring at the lot. She's standing there in her white nightgown, barefoot.

And when we get close enough, we see that some graffiti has been hastily scrawled in chalk on the sign:

She stares at her hand, fixating on it, remembering Carrie in the shower. Suddenly, a second hand thrusts into frame, onto her nightgown.

A bloody hand.

A hand from the Earth itself.
