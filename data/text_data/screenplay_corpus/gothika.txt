OPENING CREDITS OVER QUICK CUTS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S BEDROOM - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUSH in on a sleeping couple in the dark. The ALARM CLOCK reads 5:59 AM. The woman's eyes open a second before the alarm beeps and turns it off. She grabs a glass of water on her bedside table and drinks it. Climbs out of bed past typical bedside photographs (wedding, vacation, etc.). This is MIRANDA GREY: 30, sharp and prettier than she knows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. GYM SWIMMING POOL - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda slides through the water. Swimming cap on, goggles. Her STEADY BREATHING takes us in and out of the water. Something unsettling about this sound. Something slightly unsettling too about her detached manner. A person on autopilot, recognizing only the water and the perfectly aligned lap stripes leading her path. Like graphic metaphors for her own conscience: flat. She emerges from the pool and self-consciously wraps herself in a towel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. COFFEEHOUSE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda pays for a pair of coffees and a newspaper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. KITCHEN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda's husband DOUGLAS GREY (older, a superficial analysis would suggest a father figure) serves breakfast. Miranda smiles thank you and goes back to studying a case file. He sips from his takeout coffee and reads the newspaper. A pleasant domestic scene. It's 8:00 AM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ST. ANNE'S HIGH SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda's Volvo pulls in as students amble up the steps. Doug kisses his wife and hops out. Exemplary carpoolers. Students are already chatting him up as Miranda drives off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - ON A SURVEILLANCE MONITOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda's car at some sort of guard gate. A BUZZER lets her in. As the car drives past we read the plate on the wall:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"WOODWARD FORENSIC INSTITUTE"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gate shuts behind her with a certain finality as we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - MIRANDA'S OFFICE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stark walls. Simple decor. Bookshelves packed with the according psychiatric tomes and diplomas. Miranda faces a troubled young mess of a woman, CHLOE: charismatic, deranged and forever trying to provoke. Mid-session:
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is your stepfather who came to visit you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My stepfather? No. He's dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I killed him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda tries not to act surprised at this breakthrough. Responds with the even keel of a trained psychiatrist.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the first time you admit it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So? There's a first time for everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(jotting this down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It means you're finally past the denial stage. This is good, Chloe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never killed anyone who didn't deserve it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You only killed your stepfather as far as I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should've taken care of my mother. She knew all along. You remind me of her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remind you of your mother?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Always so put together. Like you iron your underwear. Like your pussy is the apricot of the Promised Land and the bread of the --
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(getting her back on track)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get back to your visitor last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Devil.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, the Devil. Why would the Devil visit you? It's already hell in here, what would he have to gain?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He came to fuck an angel.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(giggles at that)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm his dirty angel.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Before Miranda can analyze that one, the room LIGHTS FLICKER AND DIE. Darkness. Miranda's breathing speeds up.
</DIRECTION>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He grabbed me by the hair while I sucked him and usually I love that, I just do -- maybe you can tell me why I love it so much -- but not this time, he was just too rough --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As suddenly as it went out, now the POWER RETURNS. A visibly uncomfortable Miranda checks the clock.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it until Monday. Try and get some sleep tonight, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, Doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(leans in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Crazy people hear messages from God. Not the Devil. You know that, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't say you were crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to say it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She almost doesn't seem crazy when she says this. Almost. TWO ORDERLIES appear at the door. Miranda nods for them to escort Chloe. Chloe shakes their hands away from her, strides off dramatically. The princess of the asylum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda locks her office, armed with paperwork. The end of another workweek. DR. PETE GRAHAM, a good ten years older and Miranda's best friend on the job, approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Grey.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Graham.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They walk along with the easy confidence of colleagues who not only respect each other, but enjoy each other. A lot.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Power went out again in our wing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(knows what's coming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Same here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not shrink-appropriate to be afraid of the dark, you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not shrink appropriate and you're about to get promoted. Everybody's afraid of something.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I afraid of?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yourself. At least you should be. What are you up to this weekend?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Write a little country music, decline invites to grand social events, drink myself to sleep -- the usual. You?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doug wants to look at some Real Estate up at Willow's Creek.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Again?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He thinks it's fun.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So is golfing, I'm told. Who was your six o'clock?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chloe McGrath -- talk about trying to empty the ocean with a tea cup. She's a mess.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hear Manhattan's full of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't start with that. I already turned down the job. We're staying.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They have reached an office marked "DR. PHILLIP PARSONS DIRECTOR" and peer in to see Parsons (50's, distinguished, commands respect from everyone) on the phone. He gestures for Pete to sit. Miranda is about to exit when he covers the mouthpiece --
</DIRECTION>
<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miranda, my wife keeps wanting to set that dinner with you and Doug. Are you free tonight?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's stuck at a school board meeting.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Parsons looks through his appointment book.
</DIRECTION>
<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been here a year already, Dorothy's starting to take this personal. How's next Wednesday?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next Wednesday it is, Phil.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He nods at her with a smile and returns to his phone call.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda drives off, leaving the majestic grounds behind. A GUARD waves her off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END OPENING CREDITS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda slows down at the sight of colored lights up ahead. A knocked-down telephone post blocks the road. EMERGENCY VEHICLES at the scene. A patrolman waves her down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MIRANDA'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHERIFF RYAN, 40'S, recognizes her and ambles over.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anybody hurt, Sheriff?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah, telephone post just decided to fall. It'll take us a while to clear this up so I'm afraid you're gonna have to take the long way home, Miranda.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you say so.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And tell your husband he owes me a phone call.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will do. Wouldn't want him in trouble with the authorities.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That a girl. The law never sleeps and all that. You take care now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He taps on her hood and heads back to the site. She shifts into reverse and makes a U-turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. OLD MAIN ROAD - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda drives down the curvy road toward an old bridge. Something definitely creepy about this deserted place --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MIRANDA'S CAR - MOVING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda dials a number on her cell phone, gets the machine.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, it's me. Are you there? Pick up, pick up. I'm on my way but I just got detoured so I'm...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A bump on the road makes her drop the phone on the passenger seat. She reaches for it and when she looks up we see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A TEENAGE GIRL stands smack in front of us. Naked. About to get pummelled by us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda swerves to avoid her and slams into the railing. METAL SCREECHES as she struggles to regain control of the car and finally BRAKES TO A HALT -- She looks in her rearview mirror: the girl is standing back there. Drunk or high or in any case completely out of it.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay on the line. Don't go anywhere. The weirdest thing just --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(the phone cuts out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at the dead phone. Punches the buttons on it. No go.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wonderful.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She tosses the phone on the seat and hops out of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ASHLEY BRIDGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda cautiously approaches the girl, who is now not moving. Just standing there. Her back to us.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Are you hurt? Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing. As we get closer we see she is covered in bruises. Clearly something horrible has happened to her.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were you in an accident? Were you attacked? It's okay, I'm a doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Miranda Grey...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And now she turns. Young, seventeen tops. Busted lip, black eye. Miranda pulls off her coat, wraps it around the girl --
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're in shock right now, that's perfectly natural. I'm going to get you to the hospital. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The girl suddenly grips Miranda's arm. Hard.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be scared. It's going to be fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Now the girl is touching Miranda's face. Her movements desperate, smothering. Like the movements of a drowning person. Miranda tries to push the girl's hands back down.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hands off me, okay? Tell me your name, do you remember your name?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The girl tries to speak but no words come out. Instead she produces a strained, wettish sound. Creepy as hell. And now she is prying Miranda's mouth open and she's much stronger than expected and Miranda is panicking --
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing? I'm trying to help you --?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The girl opens her own mouth wide like a snake. And as Miranda muffles a scream, blood starts leaking out of the girl's eye sockets and from wounds all over her body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLAM CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BEDROOM - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda wakes up in a cold sweat. Just a bad dream. A beat. FAINT at first but GROWING LOUDER, we hear a REPETITIVE SOUND outside. Like an ECHO of some sort, but vaguely familiar: THWIP, THWIP, THWIP. Miranda takes a deep breath, reaches for the glass of water on her bedside table. Except... it's not there. She turns to her husband but he's not in the bed. And now she glances around the room and realizes this is not her bedroom. She climbs off the bed and walks in the dark. Trips over something. A TRAY that CLANGS LOUDLY. Her heartbeat goes haywire. She feels her way along the wall to a small opening in the door. A glass pane. She peers through the glass at the empty corridor outside, realizing what this must mean, realizing she's inside a cell. She jiggles the handle and pounds on the door, frantic --
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Somebody help me!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - ESTABLISHING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA SOARS through the tall iron gates, past the guard. Now we spot the source of our continuing THWIP THWIP sound: sprinklers watering the impressively-kept gardens. The expansive complex is more Victorian campus than drab prison, with separate wings (male and female), research units, libraries, gym and volunteer outpatient center.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - VARIOUS SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bored group of female patients listen to a social worker lecturing them. A janitor mops a long corridor. Patients study at the library under the watchful eye of orderlies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A doctor and two orderlies hold down a patient having an epileptic fit (we'll soon know her as SHELLEY). They force a biting block in her mouth to avoid her swallowing her tongue, prepare a syringe. Institute director Phil Parsons at a meeting with other doctors, discussing a patient's progress on a chart. Now we are MOVING up the main building's wall and THROUGH large windows into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FEMALE WING STAIRS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pete rushes up two steps at a time, passing by a NURSE WITH A CART OF MEDS, who nods respectfully as he goes --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE MIRANDA'S CELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ORDERLY unlocks the door for Pete. Through the glass pane he can see a visibly upset Miranda arguing with the head nurse: a tough as nails woman in her 50's: IRENE.
</DIRECTION>
<ORDERLY_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sleeping beauty is awake.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter forces a smile, enters --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MIRANDA'S CELL
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peter, what the hell is going on?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pete nods at Irene: it's okay, he'll take it from here.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you feel?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How do you think I feel? Is this a joke?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Peter is half-listening to her, half-signaling to the nurse with the meds to come in. Miranda catches all of this, growing more agitated. She wears the uniform all patients wear: a white T-shirt and sweats. Her wedding ring is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Giving you something to calm down.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't need to calm down. What I need is an explanation
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pete grabs the meds from the nurse. Irene and the attendant step closer to help. Miranda feels them closing in on her. Peter's tone is infuriatingly gentle:
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just take this and we can sit down and chat.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why here, why not in my office?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at the silent faces around her. No sympathy. Or maybe too much sympathy. Either way it's unnerving.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want an anticonvulsant, at least give me Valium.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
<DIRECTION>
(nods at nurse)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifty milligrams.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ, you're gonna knock me out? Ten milligrams.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
<DIRECTION>
(final offer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The nurse complies. Miranda stares at the meds, trying desperately to put this into some kind of perspective.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How would you feel if you woke up in a goddamn cell, dressed like this?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can discuss it at length after you take your meds.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Awkward nods from Irene, the nurse and the attendant. Pete holds Miranda's gaze. Miranda takes her meds.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. This better be good.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pete motions for the others to leave them alone. One by one they file out and lock the door behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda paces. Alone with Pete, she is even more upset.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miranda, this is very awkward. Technically I shouldn't even be treating you but the court has granted us a waiver until you're transferred. So whatever is said here won't leave this room. I won't tell Parsons, I won't tell anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to talk to my husband.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't to that. Sit down, please. Try to relax.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would I pretend to be in any way relaxed?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand you're upset. But we need to put some things in order.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two massive understatements.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He hesitates, unsure where to begin.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long have you been here?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this? Why are you doing this to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just answer the question. Humor me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, my name is Miranda Grey. I'm a psychiatrist. I transferred here to the Woodward Forensic Institute a little over a year ago. My job entails dealing with a ward of schizophrenic women between the ages of eighteen and fifty-fife --
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't mean how long you've worked here, I mean how long you've been staying here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
This stops her. Wanting desperately to whip out a comeback but realizing she doesn't know the answer.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a doctor, yes? Or was medical school just an elaborate dream?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course you're a doctor. A great doctor in fact.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The hint of sadness in his voice alarms her.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pete, how long have I been here?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Five days.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(barely audible)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were admitted to the neurosurgical unit seizing violently. That lasted three days. Scans revealed left-sided weakness, numbness and severe fontal lobe deficits.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda shakes her head in disbelief, but we --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK - INT. NEUROSURGICAL UNIT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda seizing violently FROM HER POV: Doctors struggling to contain her. Arms thrashing, legs. FLASHES of the wall, the floor. Head crashing against a cart, out of control.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You came out of it and tested negative for PCP, underwent extensive hypnosis and received amytal injections.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH: Miranda being tied down. A nurse with a syringe --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks down at her wrists with the reddish marks.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were tied down for a day and a half so you wouldn't hurt yourself and then you went into a state of, well --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(how to put this?)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been pretty much catatonic.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the first time you speak.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda, speechless. Reality sinking in.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doug must be worried sick. I need to call him --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pete shakes his head emphatically.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the most logical person I know, bar none. Plus you have a photographic memory -- unconfirmed, but you do remember events and phrases more accurately than anyone around. Why am I telling you this?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're establishing my personality as fairly intellectual, you don't consider me impulsive or emotional.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's a fair assessment, no?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, that's fair. And following this pattern of analysis, we're about to discuss a traumatic event that rendered this psychological profile useless, correct?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two hundred percent.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A pause here. He's waiting for her to continue. She's not used to being on the other side of the therapist's table.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think I'm in denial. That I'm putting on a brave show -- that this is a 'cover' for some unbearable emotion I'm hiding. Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't analyze yourself, just focus on remembering.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember Friday night after work, if you say that was five days ago --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pushing on)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, I asked you what you were doing for the weekend and you said the usual and you made a joke about writing country songs and drinking yourself to sleep and I told you I was going to look at some real estate in Willows Creek with Doug.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then what?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I drove home.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then what?

	I got home, I guess, and had dinner by myself because --

(pauses, struggling)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Because Doug had an alumni meeting at his school and he was going to get a ride back. He's the principal now, as you well know.

She stops here. Pete waits. The silence is deafening. She pushes on, but her hands shake a little.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But wait -- there was an accident before that, wasn't there? A girl -- she had been beaten. I took her to the hospital, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was indeed an accident, you were detoured by the cops. But there's no report of any girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, the cops weren't there. They were back on Main Road. A knocked-down telephone post, correct?
	</DIALOGUE>

Pete nods. Miranda is all foggy on the details:

<MIRANDA>

	I saw the girl after that. She was bleeding.

	Tell me nothing happened to Doug.

<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's backtrack a second. You left your office, you were driving home, you got detoured by the police -- Did you call someone on the phone that night?

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I might have.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who would you call?

	I might have called Doug to tell him something. Or checked my answering service.

	<DIALOGUE>
	There is no trouble in my marriage. You just used the past tense; why?

His face says he doesn't know how to tell her.

<MIRANDA>

	Did something happen to Doug?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't remember anything else. Anything at all?

Frustrated, she snatches his cell phone and starts to dial:

	This is preposterous. What's wrong with Doug?

<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's dead.

This stops her cold. Time stands eerily still. She stares at Pete as if by looking at him long enough, he will contradict his statement.

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, he's not. Don't tell me that. Don't tell me that.

Graduation night. School principal Douglas Grey shakes hands with proud parents and clumsily formal students. Miranda grabs a drink from a nearby tray, bored.

	<DIALOGUE>

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Mr. Principal. Special occasion -- I'm celebrating how proud I am of my husband tonight.

He smiles weakly at the compliment. Moves his hand towards her, in an affectionate gesture (or so Miranda thinks) but instead fixes her bra strap. Ever methodical.

A flustered Miranda fumbles with her purse and keys, heads for the door. She tries to fix her smeared lipstick and messed-up hair. TURNS TO CAMERA:
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. The fact is I'm married and I -- this is not me, this is a mistake.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
First we hear our mystery man's voice, then we see him: Pete. (Yes, the same person she kissed and went to the movies with.) He places his hand on the door, blocking her.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your marriage is the mistake and you know it.

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't.

<MIRANDA>

He smiles. Touches her face tenderly. Torn. A person used to doing the right thing but not liking that at the moment.

A breathless Miranda wipes her face, leaving a thick streak of blood on it. She looks down at her hand, noticing the blood -- and now we are back in --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT (PRESENT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda wakes up with a start. The darkness renders the room almost void of any color. Monochromatic. It takes her a moment to orient herself. Her eyes wander across the unfamiliar room, feeling like she's being watched. We become aware of a RAGGED BREATHING sound. Like somebody is standing over her bed. But we don't see anything. Miranda gingerly crosses to the door and peeks through the glass partition into the empty corridor. She glances back at the room, stills seeing nothing -- and bangs on the door.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I get some assistance here? Hello?!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She waits. Bangs on the door again.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Irene?! Anybody!?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. And now finally we hear FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING. A light is switched on down the corridor. The FOOTSTEPS get CLOSER... and CLOSER... Miranda tries to appear composed. Wipes sweat off her forehead. Fixes her hair. The FOOTSTEPS now STOP right out side the door. A KEY goes into the lock and JIGGLES it. Miranda waits for the door to open but nothing happens. Confused, she steps up to the glass partition and peeks -- The second her face touches the glass, she is met by a pair of piercing eyes. The eerie teenage girl. Miranda jumps back, screams. And when she looks up again, the image is gone. A beat. Rational thought kicking in --
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>

	Wake up, wake up...

	You're dreaming. It's not real. An anxiety dream, that's all. That's all. This is dream logic. If it was real, they would have heard you scream. There are twenty employees on the night shift. Fact. At least twenty.

She props herself with her back against the wall. With a view of the whole cell. Just in case. Staring at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just dreaming.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And now, FAINTLY at first, but GROWING LOUDER -- FOOTSTEPS can be heard APPROACHING outside. Just like before.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Like her life depends on that mantra. The FOOTSTEPS get CLOSER. And her voice begins to falter --
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(voice rising)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming --
	</DIALOGUE>

And now the FOOTSTEPS pause outside her door like before and she holds her breath, horrified, when suddenly we are hit with the sudden glare of returning light. EVERYTHING FLASHES WHITE and then COLOR RETURNS --

No reaction.

She shakes her harder. And now Miranda's EYES SHOOT OPEN and she grips Irene's arm. Hard. Like the teenage girl did.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy now, it's okay.

Miranda stares at her, coming back to. Starts to speak but has no voice. Clears her throat --

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doctor Grey, if you don't mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually I do mind. I start calling you 'doctor' and everybody else wants to be called 'doctor' --
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. It's a bit different, wouldn't you say -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Irene reaches out her hand and the nurse places a cup with meds on it.

	What do you think you're doing? I want to speak to my lawyer -- wait, what are you doing?

Irene shoves the meds into Miranda's mouth --

	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, Irene, don't do this. I'm calm now, look -- I'm calm -- !

She struggles as they hold her down and Irene sedates her.

DRIFTING PAST the female patients at their usual activities. Some watch TV, play dominoes, some pretend to read, some stare out blankly. Here's Chloe at a table, engaged in some sort of trivia game with a tattooed Southern redhead named JENNA:

Chloe shrugs, if you say so. Jenna resumes:

	Moditen, Molindone, Moltipress, Motival. That's it for the 'M's.

	Trick question. There's only Jatroneural.

Chloe checks a reference book. Nods, impressed.

CAMERA FOLLOWS HER INTENT GAZE to another patient, SHELLEY (the same patient we saw earlier mid-fit) moseying across the room. Nervously takes a seat beside Miranda.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi there, Doc.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
It takes a moment for the heavily-drugged Miranda to react. She looks up slowly: eyes glazed, painfully out of it.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never got shrinked by you but all I hear is nothing gets past you, I mean, that's just hearsay and I don't pay much attention to hearsay because now they say you hacked your husband with an axe but I say maybe it just slipped, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda notices Shelley is toying with a wrinkled NEWSPAPER CLIPPING. Shelley catches this look and slides it over to her. Without malice, like a child.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They put your picture in the paper.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
It reads "SCHOOL PRINCIPAL SLAUGHTERED. WIFE UNDER ARREST." Photos of Miranda, Douglas, their house. Miranda stares at it in disbelief. Growing sick.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you get this?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHELLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chloe did. Who knows how? Not me. Around here I'm on a need to know basis about stuff and most stuff I don't need to know. My point is about people talking behind other people's backs. Like before I was here, everything I did I thought, 'this'll get them,' wanting their approval, wanting them to say good things behind my back. But now I'm more anonymous, more myself. I'm Shelley.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda slides the clipping back to Shelley, clueless as to how to get out of this conversation, but Shelley has no problem holding a conversation all by herself --
</DIRECTION>
<SHELLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not like, undercover here, are you? They pulled that at Spring Grove, had a bunch of doctors pretend they were patients, see if they could handle it. Most quit after day one. You're not, are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Shelley. I'm not undercover.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHELLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because if you were, I'm like the Fort Knox of secrets. Ask anybody.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good to know. But I'm not.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHELLEY>

	Say no more.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand perfectly.

She hands Miranda paper and some crayons, whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<SHELLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drawing is a great cover. Good luck to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
With a wink, she's gone. Miranda looks at the room around her: Chloe spying on her in the corner, Irene and the nurse sharing a laugh, other patients ambling about, arguing -- Life among the insane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. LOCKER ROOM - DRESSING AREA - DAY

Patients undress in the bare-bones locker area. An uneasy Miranda is handed a bar of soap and towel by Irene.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Now come on. If you go downtown, you gotta dance.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda studies the patients already under the spray of the shower. Something vaguely concentration camp-like about institutional bathing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shower, like everything else in this place, is regulated by shifts, so that various groupings of patients each get their turn. Miranda feels Chloe's gaze on her across the room. She is stripping off her clothes for Miranda's benefit, gleefully mangling the last refrain from the Stones' "START ME UP."
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's five minutes, group one.

<DIRECTION>
(to Chloe's group)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, ladies, nice and easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The first group of bathers file out, dripping wet past Miranda, in all shapes and sizes. She registers their many scars and tattoos, like maps of troubled souls: names of men, places, religious quotes. Burn scars, cuts, needle marks. They begin to towel off as Miranda, slowly and painfully self-conscious, begins to undress in the corner. A moment later Irene nods for her to go in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. COMMUNAL SHOWERS - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda hangs her head under the spray and closes her eyes, trying to shut it all out. The SOUNDS slowly FADE OUT until all we have is Miranda and her RAGGED BREATHING. Chloe and Shelley, the last two out from the previous group, grab towels. Chloe winks at Miranda when she catches her staring, but Miranda is not staring at her. She is staring past her at the tile wall. More specifically at a hole in the tile where a busted water pipe pokes out. Clearly at some point there was a handle there, but now it is just a hole with a busted pipe. PUSH INTO the hole to see a perfectly-formed globule of blood emerge, following by a GURGLING sound which seems to come from deep in the bowels of the plumbing system. The blood lingers tentatively, as if unfamiliar with the laws of gravity, before tracing an upward line along the tile. The GURGLING GROWS LOUDER, CLOSER, and now more blood flows from the hole and spreads up the wall. Miranda looks away, disturbed, and now realizes she is the only one left in the showers. Panic. Shuts her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(to self)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It isn't real. It isn't real.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Opens her eyes. Five letters are written in blood. N-O-T-A-L. Shaking, nauseous, she looks down at her feet and the drain, too scared to look back up.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(to self)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It isn't real. You're hallucinating.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Perhaps. But now blood drips by her ankle, DRIP, DRIP, DRIP. And the shooting pain she feels is coming from her arm. What the hell -- ? WE SEE SHARP SLASHES appearing on her skin, like some invisible knife is slicing her. Hallucination or not, she bolts out of the showers --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. LOCKER ROOM - DRESSING AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda wraps a towel around her bloody arm, too freaked out to process anything. Fumbles for her clothes and heads straight to Shelley, tying her shoelaces, muttering.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shelley?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHELLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And pick up those damn cigarette butts. Jesus, TV is dumb --
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shelley, can you do me a favor??

Shelley fixes her with an intense conspiratorial look.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The housewives will find something better to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you go in the shower and tell me if you see anything on the wall?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Shelley doesn't respond. Simply crosses over and heads for the showers. Miranda gets dressed when a hand on her shoulder makes her jump --
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough privacy for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Thank you, Irene.

But now Irene notices the blood seeping through the towel.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. It's nothing --

And now the other patients are curiously watching as orderlies RUSH IN to haul her away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH a glass pane we see a NURSE bandaging Miranda's arm. Parsons and Irene confer just outside the room.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I looked away for a second. It's unacceptable, won't happen again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not your fault. Patients always find a way to hurt themselves if that's what they want.
	</DIALOGUE>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just didn't peg her for a cutter, that's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Parsons watches Miranda through the glass. She can't look him in the eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. REC ROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda (with her fresh new bandage) ignores the looks from the other patients as she rejoins them. Spots Shelley by the window furthest from the wardens. Scared.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God. Oh my God.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You saw it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHELLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Doctor. Some people, they have a gift. And in here, because they categorize us as a bunch of schizos, they refuse to acknowledge that. It's like that Hubble telescope that sees things a trillion miles away but what it's seeing is just reflected light of a star that died a thousand years ago? It's like that. Doesn't mean you're crazy. It only means your eyes open in a different way.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda tries to follow the convoluted explanation, but has a sinking feeling.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did it say?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHELLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On the telescope?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you see anything, Shelley?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Shelley glances around to make sure no one can hear.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not tile that wall is made out of . It's a holographic screen. All part of your mission, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda shakes her head, feeling foolish. Walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHELLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(taps her forehead)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is all we have. The rest is dust.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pete and Miranda stare at each other. A tense beat.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was you I called that night.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you mention that to the cops?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't think it would help you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does that mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It means they wouldn't have let me treat you if they thought I had any kind of involvement in what happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I what?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I make it to your place? Did I see you that night?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. We got disconnected and I couldn't get through to you. I sat there waiting all night. Figured you'd changed your mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't you tell me this before?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because the only way you'll be able to accept these events is if you remember them on your own. My job is to assist you in processing that information because you're not in a frame of mind to do it by yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at him. Queasy.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're changing the subject.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The subject is you don't trust me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right now I don't trust anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to read his face. Reminds herself of who Pete is and what he means to her. He points at her bandaged arm.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to talk about today?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a resigned breath, slowly shakes her head. Wishing she could wake up from this nightmare:
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to talk to my lawyer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think that's premature.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't help what you think.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE GARDEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPRINKLER SYSTEMS doing their thing: THWIP, THWIP, THWIP... The female patients are out in the gardens for their freshly dose of air. BOOM DOWN TO Miranda alone at a bench. A cigarette appears before her, being offered to her:
</DIRECTION>
<JENNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You a Marlboro girl?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda sees Jenna looming above her, shielding the sun.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't smoke, thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JENNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All we have is our health, cupcake.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sits beside her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I do is quit constantly, start again. Drives them all crazy. One day I quit three times.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jenna lights her smoke, blows out the match slowly. Miranda turns and checks the building entrance as Jenna rambles on.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They allow me one match at a time and pretend they're not watching. Check it out: salivating goon number one at three o'clock, oh- so-inconspicuous goon number two at five o'clock.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda follows Jenna's gaze. Sure enough, she's being closely watched by two orderlies.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you set on fire to wind up here?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JENNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very perceptive, Doc. I burnt down the building where I worked. I found a baby at the doorstep, called the cops -- of course the bottom feeding pricks never showed. It's beside the point, really.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda shrugs. God knows what Jenna is talking about but who is she to say? Once again, Miranda checks the building entrance and now sees Parsons emerge. She rises --
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Phil.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He keeps walking. Headed to the parking lot beyond.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Phil!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns. His first instinct is to smile. But he checks himself, reminding himself of her new status. Slips into his best professional face:
</DIRECTION>
<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Miranda.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wonder if I could talk to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(checks his watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, actually, I'm about to...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your staff meeting's done and Thursdays you don't schedule sessions until the afternoon. This will just take one minute. Promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Impressive. She remembers his schedule perfectly.
</DIRECTION>
<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	True.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(points)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the Sheriff wants to ask me some questions.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She follows his look to the parking lot where Sheriff Ryan emerges from his patrol car. Miranda nods.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's about Pete.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about him?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps he's not the most qualified person to be treating me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
His tone is fatherly yet direct.
</DIRECTION>
<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you complaining about his methods or are you referring to the nature of your past relationship with him?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
This surprises her.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did he tell you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He explained there might be a conflict of interest because he has feelings for you. You two engaged in a kiss at one point. Am I right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told him we're all grownups here and the fact is he's the best doctor on my staff. As such, and given the severity of the charges you face, I consider him the most qualified person to assist your recovery. Now, if you'll excuse me, Sheriff Ryan is not a patient man.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Stonewalled in the simplest of ways, she's left feeling like an idiot. Watches Parsons join the Sheriff by his car. The two men shake hands when suddenly Irene runs past her, yelling --
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Chloe!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Now two ORDERLIES race past. Miranda looks over to see what the fuss is all about. Chloe is on top of an institute staff member we haven't seen before, a round black woman named CONSUELO. Punching her -- Other patients have crowded around the scuffle.
</DIRECTION>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fucking cow giving me the evil eye, huh? Fuck you, you fuckin' voodoo witch -- !
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Irene and the orderlies yank Chloe off Consuelo. Chloe kicks and screams like an animal. Consuelo meekly stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<CONSUELO>
<DIRECTION>
(heavy Cuban accent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is okay, she's okay -- she don't mean nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bet your goddamn fat ass I mean it, you're a witch -- !!
	</DIALOGUE>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	McGrath, that's enough!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The orderlies start pulling Chloe away. Chloe spits at Consuelo, full of venom.
</DIRECTION>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take your voodoo shit back to Cuba --
	</DIALOGUE>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said that's enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CONSUELO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Irene, she's okay. Pobrecita, la infeliz. It's a misunderstanding. Pobrecita. I was only trying to help her --
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanna help me? You pity me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(grabbing her crotch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suck me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The orderlies haul Chloe off. Irene disperses the crowd. Consuelo sighs, embarrassed, wipes a bloody lip. Her manner says she just wants to get back to her duties. Excitement over, the patients resume whatever it is they were doing. Miranda stares at her bleak surroundings when something catches her eye: Pete watching her from his office window. He quickly slides the curtain shut. Odd.

A sunny sky grows dark as night envelops us with a SWOOSH --

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOW PUSH DOWN empty corridors. The air thick with dread --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda cries softly, unable to sleep. VOICES trickle in from the corridor outside, wardens on their rounds, a SOFT MOAN from another cell, a random SCREAM. She shuts her eyes, repositions herself on her stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As before, somebody seems to be watching her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. WOODWARD LIBRARY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irene escorts Miranda into the library. A warden follows.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are we feeling today?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'We'?
	</DIALOGUE>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry I asked.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't seem like the best choice of words when treating schizophrenics.
	</DIALOGUE>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fitting right in, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The library is pretty much empty at this hour except for the LIBRARIAN and the odd janitor tidying up. An efficient-looking man rises from a desk, briefcase in place, glass of water -- this is attorney THEODORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"TEDDY" HOWARD.
</DIRECTION>
<TEDDY_HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miranda.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Irene checks her watch. The warden hangs back, keeping watch.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's due back in the rec room in twenty, Counselor.
	</DIALOGUE>
<TEDDY_HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you kindly.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda sits. Waits until Irene is out of hearing range.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Teddy, I know you knew Doug well and this is an extremely --
	</DIALOGUE>
<TEDDY_HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm here as your lawyer. So whatever my relationship was with Doug is no longer of consequence. First things first, how are they treating you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like I'm crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<TEDDY_HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know this place better than anyone. Anything out of the ordinary?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Other than me being crazy? No.
	</DIALOGUE>
<TEDDY_HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The DA is pushing for a hearing as soon as next week. They're eager to resolve this situation because -- well, crimes like this don't happen that often around here. Doug was a hometown boy who'd done good, beloved high school principal, a role model. Our best shot -- scratch that, our only shot -- is to claim temporary insanity.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As he speaks, she starts fidgeting with her itchy bandage.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, wait, wait -- Teddy, you know me. I wouldn't raise a hand at my husband for the life of me. Not even in self-defense. Isn't it remotely possible a burglar broke in or some crazed high school student attacked Doug and I went into shock?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Teddy shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're telling me there's no other suspects in anyone's mind?
	</DIALOGUE>
<TEDDY_HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frankly, no. Neighbors heard screams. They have you at the scene, they have the murder weapon and they have your prints everywhere. The only thing they don't have is motive.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She keeps absently playing with the bandage. The adhesive is giving. The bandage starting to peel off.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because there is no motive.
	</DIALOGUE>
<TEDDY_HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that's what's confusing them. The fact that you're a brilliant psychiatrist doesn't help either. It fills their heads with ideas. They figure if you were to plan a murder you might know how to fake insanity to get out of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls off half the bandage, back and forth. Not looking. BUT WE SEE the beginning of a pattern in her scarred skin --
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not faking anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
<TEDDY_HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. I pass no judgment either way. The point is --
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The point is I'm the only person who doesn't believe I killed my husband. I never thought I'd say this, but I feel like I'm in the middle of a conspiracy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you believe I'm crazy?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
An uncomfortable Teddy takes too long before answering. Miranda looks down, humiliated -- and now she sees it. Perfectly carved into her arm, her scar reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"NOT ALONE."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Petrified, Miranda jumps back, knocks down Teddy's glass of water all over his papers, her chair topples over. The warden and janitor look up -- Teddy tries for delicate:
</DIRECTION>
<TEDDY_HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't matter what I believe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it. Forget I asked.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
PUSH INTO her face as involuntary tears roll down and we --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PETE'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda. Numb. Pete trying hard to get through. A beat. We get a good look at the writing on her arm. (The right arm.)
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't help you if you don't talk to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Silence from Miranda. He is firm but not unkind:
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can stand here all day. All week. You're the one running out of time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing. He goes to touch her arm. She jerks it away.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does it mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head, at a loss. Torn between her suspicion and the need to confide in someone. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't write this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then who?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They stare each other down. There's definitely chemistry between these two. But the moment is far from romantic.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to have to trust me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because no matter what's going through your mind right now, I haven't done anything wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you know exactly how I feel.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to speak, stops himself. Switches tactics. Their banter escalates in speed as their terms get more clinical:
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You admit you're having a hard time differentiating what's reality from what's hallucination, right? So isn't it at least possible that --
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As a doctor I agree with you. Maybe -- and this is a big maybe -- all of this is just a deep epilepsy that extends to the limbic structures, but I'm telling you --
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about this moment right now?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this a hallucination?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You tell me. But I do know what I sound like. Paranoia is the ultimate awareness, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which is why I suggest we simply increase your dose until --
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(venom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Goddamnit! No!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He steps back at her blowout. She catches the look on his face and forces herself to sit down.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. Is there any way we can pretend that didn't just happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat; struggling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to believe you. I do. So I'll take your word for it -- you're not involved in this -- but you take mine: I didn't write this and I didn't kill my husband.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He studies her. Finally nods. New tactic:
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright. Let's say you didn't write this --
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Number one: I'm right-handed. Number two: I would have had to bring an X-Acto knife into the shower to do this, wouldn't I?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pete tries to reserve judgment. Her argument has a certain loopy logic to it. He hesitates, then pulls a SERIES OF PHOTOGRAPHS from a manila envelope.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's time you look at these.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda looks at the crime scene photos. Lurid. Terrible. Here's part of Doug's body. Here's the axe. And now she sees a closeup picture of the wall with words on it. In blood, a la Manson family. And it says:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"NOT ALONE."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda immediately tosses it away from her. Repulsed --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK - INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda furiously writes on the wall with blood. Wipes her face breathlessly, leaving a thick red streak on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PETE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION (PRESENT)
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wrote that. Any idea why?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(panic rising)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I didn't. No, I didn't!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pete retrieves the photograph off the floor and holds it up for her to study again.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the only person who can figure out what this means. Try to remember. Stop holding back.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She nods meekly. Staring at the picture. Begins to shake as all of it finally comes flooding in --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK - INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A breathless Miranda wipes her face, leaving a thick streak of blood on it. She looks down at Doug, crawling on hands and knees. He moans horribly, in shock. She grabs the heavy axe from the floor and follows him. He reaches for the coffee table with the telephone on it and makes a move to grab it. He has all the speed of a dying turtle, and that's pretty much what he resembles. Miranda bites her lip, lifts the heavy axe with both hands. Doug's hand grabs the phone. Miranda SWINGS THE AXE over her head and it comes down straight AT CAMERA. Miranda wipes her face again, catches her reflection in the mirror over the mantel and stares -- WE HEAR THAT SOUND. The WETTISH GURGLING sound. Miranda stares at the MIRROR looking for the source of it. For an instant we see the teenage girl's reflection there, beckoning. But now she's gone and Miranda is left studying her own demented expression and now FLAMES RISE around her. She looks down at her feet: No fire. Blood on her clothes, axe still in her hands. Looks back up at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MIRROR VERSION OF MIRANDA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
shows a serene expression on her face. Fire enveloping her. She slowly lifts her hands over her head. In place of the axe there are CHAINS attached to SHACKLES on her wrists. She is completely naked, as if purified -- like an extreme version of Anima Sola. (A Biblical icon in which a woman in fiery purgatory awaits her fate.) Time stands still for a mesmerizing moment -- When the MIRROR SHATTERS TO PIECES and we're back to reality. Miranda stares at the axe she's flung at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MIRANDA'S BATHROOM - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda tries to wash off the blood in the sink. This is a daunting task, seeing as how she's covered in it. She stares at her bloody footprints all over the floor, at the marks on the door handle, towels and wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gasping for breath, almost crying, she turns on the shower at full blast and climbs into the tub. She watches the blood wash off her. As if finally coming back to her body and realizing what she's done, she slowly slides down the shower wall and curls up in the tub. Crying. Shaking. She shuts her eyes as hard as she can to make it all go away, and we --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACKNESS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. And now, faintly at first, but GROWING PROGRESSIVELY LOUDER, we hear the SOUND OF BUZZING FLIES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:

:SC: INT. MIRANDA'S BATHROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda wakes up, still in the tub. How long has she been there, hours? Days? Impossible to know. But at some point she must have turned off the water. She sits up, every muscle of her body aching, hair caked with blood. The first thing that hits her is the stench. And it's foul, the putrid smell of decaying flesh. She steps gingerly out of the tub onto the flooded floor and follows the trail of blood, mortified at what she will find.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soon enough the press will make the Manson Family reference, but for now, only Miranda is here to witness the fruit of her labor. She gasps for air. Instead she is hit by a wave of nausea. She doubles over to throw up when there is a FRANTIC RAPPING at the front door. She freezes. VOICES and YELLS trickle in. The HINGES on the door RATTLE under REPEATED POUNDING and she still stands there as the first FIREMAN breaks in. Sheriff Ryan and his deputies right behind. A concerned Pete Graham behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cops take one look at the place and raise their guns at her, but we can't hear what they're saying because Miranda's ragged BREATHING has taken over the soundtrack. Suffice to say that, at the sight of the guns, something clicks inside her and she turns on her heel and flees --

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She slips on blood, nearly falls as she scrambles to the bedroom --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She locks the door behind her, hyperventilating in terror. Instantly there are men POUNDING on it. SQUAWKING RADIOS. ORDERS BARKED at her. She spots two officers through the window in her backyard. About to smash the window. A caged animal, completely surrounded, she covers her face with her hands. Trembling. The doorknob jiggles violently, about to give. And when she brings her hands down she is staring straight into the teenage girl's face. And she OPENS HER MOUTH WIDE and now we are back in --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT (PRESENT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda gasps for air, drowning in sensory overload.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God, oh God, oh God...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She rocks back and forth. Finally aware of what she's done. She is the killer. No more doubts. And now that she knows, everything is much worse. A long, harrowing beat. WE PUSH IN ON her devastated face. NIGHT TURNS TO DAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The locks are unlocked. Pete appears at the door. Miranda glances up at him. She looks like a different person. Completely destroyed. He crouches beside her.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head slowly. He sets his hand on her shoulder. She turns to him and hugs him tight, holding on for dear life. Breaks down in sobs.

<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It all came flooding back last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guilt?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	More like an uncontrollable reminiscence. Intense, over- cathected. She's not feeling guilty of her actions, not exactly. Sounds to me like last night she actually re-lived them in great detail.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hypermnesis following amnesia. Could a specific epileptic element be involved?

	That's exactly what she suggested. Even in her present state, her instincts remain impeccable.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not taking it lightly, no. We will talk about it at home.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda and Pete sit across from him. Miranda trying hard to appear composed -- acutely aware of her every gesture, and of how different her last visit to this office was. Nothing casual about it now. She stares at the picture frames on Phil's desk (all facing AWAY FROM us), the diplomas on the wall, the books by noted fathers of neurology (works by Hughlings Jackson, Kurt Goldstein, Henry Head, A.R. Luria). A framed quote reads: "'If You Do Know That Here Is One Hand, We'll Grant You All The Rest.' -- Wittgenstein"

<PARSONS>

(into phone)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, dear. Me too.

He hangs up. Takes a moment to look at Miranda. Tries a smile but to her it comes off condescending. Fact is -- there's nothing to smile about.
</DIRECTION>
<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so sorry about this, Miranda.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She nods, dazed. Angles her head to look at a framed picture on his desk. Parsons looks to Pete.
</DIRECTION>
<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Has Pete told you about the hearing?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Teddy already filled her in.

<PARSONS>

	Teddy Howard is top notch. He's going to do everything in his power -- and he's quite resourceful -- to prove you're not fit to stand trial. Miranda, I know you have no family left, so we're your family now and we're all going down to the wire to protect you and help you in any way we --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
PUSH IN ON Miranda who stares intently at something on the desk. Not listening to a word he's saying --
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is that?

Parsons pauses here. Exchanges glances with Pete.

<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The girl in the picture.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
WE SEE what she is talking about: a framed photograph on the desk is now FACING us. Eerie. It shows Parsons, his wife Dorothy and a young girl. Our teenage girl.
</DIRECTION>
<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>

Miranda looks up at this, perplexed.

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's the girl I saw.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're obviously mistaken.

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm positive. She was hurt, bleeding. Is she all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pete and Parsons trade uneasy looks.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miranda, you've seen that photograph at least a dozen times, every time you've been in this office. You're just confused --
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not about this. Is she all right?

	No, she's not... all right.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And she finally succeeded. Jumped off Ashley Bridge. She was only seventeen years old.
	</DIALOGUE>

Ashley Bridge. Mute. Ghost? Miranda hesitates here. She is not the type to believe in ghosts, and knows full well what even her suggestion of it will sound like.

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm -- I'm terribly sorry, Phil.

Parsons doesn't want to talk about it anymore. Rises.

<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peter, can I speak to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The men step outside. PUSH IN ON Miranda's face as she stares at the picture of Rachel. We catch snippets of the doctors' discussion outside, increasing her paranoia --

A DARK SHADOW envelops Miranda's confused face, as we --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda's pale skin is visible in the dim monochromatic light. We are MOVING TOWARDS her, seeing her as if from the POV of someone approaching her. We become aware of the RAGGED BREATHING sound. Miranda opens her eyes, looks this way and that, then closes them again. She is nearly asleep when she hears a sound we've heard before. The strained WET SOUND. Miranda's eyes SNAP OPEN. She slowly sits up, back against the wall. Squinting to cover every inch of the room. And now she sees it: a SHADOW crouched in the corner. Roughly the size of a person. Miranda climbs off the bed and slowly walks towards it. Scared, but determined. She wrinkles her nose at the putrid smell coming from it. She gets closer... closer... The RAGGED BREATHING GROWING LOUDER as she reaches the shadow -- She stretches out her hand and finally touches... NOTHING. She swipes her hand through the air, feeling stupid.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is not going to work. I'm sick of being watched, and I know this place well and it doesn't smell this bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She paces around the room, feels the wall, taps her head.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm awake, I'm not dreaming. I'm alive -- this is not some afterlife mumbo jumbo. So-called paranormal activity can be debunked a million different ways. So whatever you are, whatever it is I'm making up here -- I'm letting you go, I'm setting you free. I'm the wrong person. And I need to sleep. I'm not afraid and I don't believe and I'm fully aware that this is all in my mind -- fiction -- a concocted alternate reality -- and I acknowledge it. And now I'm done with it. I'm going to sleep now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The moment is as brave as it is ridiculous. She has psyched herself into verbally defeating the ghost. And now she climbs back in bed.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(sleepy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Besides, if you really were the ghost of Rachel Parsons, you would let me out of this cell.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. And now we hear the SOUND OF THE DEADBOLT SLIDE OPEN. The door opens quietly. PUSH INTO Miranda's face. Properly scared now.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
If proof is what she wanted, proof is what she got. From now on we'll refer to the teenage girl as RACHEL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FEMALE WARD - CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda takes a tentative step outside her cell, feeling the door with her fingers, feeling along the wall -- still making sure she isn't dreaming this. She looks down the long, empty corridor, the glare of neon lights making her readjust her eyes momentarily. Nobody there. But when she looks down the other way she sees a pair of bare feet disappear behind the wall. So quick we're not sure we saw it for sure. Miranda deliberately walks in the opposite direction. At night the clinical corridor takes on an unsettling quality. She silently strolls down the hall, tilting her head at the various sounds from PATIENTS in their cells. She turns to make sure Rachel isn't behind her and when Miranda faces forward again, she realizes she is standing right across from:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE NURSES' STATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where two nurses are watching TELEVISION. Miranda tiptoes past them, ducking at the window to remain unseen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This one is wider. Miranda is startled by the sudden sound of LAUGHTER behind her. The nurses laughing at their late night show. Momentarily distracted, she almost knocks over a mop and bucket resting by the wall. She holds the mop in place and now opens the door to a
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SANITATION CLOSET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks for something, a tool. Discards a pair of brushes and finds a small screwdriver. Pockets it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE STAIRS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda hurries up the stairs, hugging the wall to stay clear from the SURVEILLANCE CAMERA sweeping the area. She waits at the landing, times it just right -- and scurries to the next floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. WOODWARD CORRIDOR (OFFICE FLOOR) - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Knowing her way around here, Miranda keeps a steady pace as she heads towards her old office. She turns a corner and stops in her tracks: another JANITOR making his rounds. She waits until he's out of sight and rushes to her office. She pulls out the stolen screwdriver and brings it to the lock. Starts unscrewing the screws. She does this as fast as she can, but she's no professional -- so it takes a few tries. She loosens one screw, then another -- and clumsily drops the screwdriver. The METAL ECHOES against the floor. Miranda sucks her breath in, waits. No footsteps. She bends down, retrieves it, and holds onto the knob for balance. It easily turns in her hand. It was open all along. She simply forgot to check.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MIRANDA'S OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda shuts the door behind her and slips behind her computer. Shrouded in darkness. Hits a switch and a SURVEILLANCE MONITOR comes to life. Now she has a view of the corridors: two guards here, a nurse going for a smoke, a janitor at the coffee machine and so on. She switches on her computer and taps her fingers as she waits for it to boot up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SURVEILLANCE MONITOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The JANITOR with his coffee cup now heading back towards Miranda's office corridor --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda glances at the door, can see the glare of the computer screen reflecting against the glass pane. She tries opening drawers but they're all locked. She remembers something and digs a sweatshirt from beneath the couch, uses it to block the light. Computer powered up, she runs an online search for "RACHEL PARSONS." Waits as the info appears --
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(to self)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright. What happened to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ON COMPUTER SCREEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Various listings: The archive news of her funeral, something about her search and a LOCAL NEWS ARTICLE about teen suicide. That's the one she chooses. Hits "PRINT." She checks the surveillance monitor again: the janitor now mops right outside her door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON PRINTOUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The heading says "WHAT DRIVES OUR TEENAGERS TO SUICIDE?" A quick glimpse gives us ages (16, 18, 17) and names of three local girls who have died. Rachel's name and PHOTOGRAPH appears with two others: Jenny Dixon and Andrea White. Miranda pockets it, looks back at the surveillance monitor: the janitor is walking away. She watches him disappear down the hall. Slowly but surely. And now the screen is empty. But just for a second. Because suddenly Rachel is there. Staring straight at her. Makes us jump.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CORRIDOR/STAIRS - MOMENTS LATER

Retracing her steps, Miranda shuts her door and hits the stairs. Playing off the sweep of the surveillance camera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FEMALE WARD CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she reaches the landing, she hears VOICES coming her way. She detours down another corridor and hides from view. Waits for Consuelo and a nurse to exit down the staircase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now she turns at ANOTHER SOUND. Coming from inside the room immediately behind her. Room 237. She steps to the small glass pane on the door and peers inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ROOM 237
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It takes a moment to adjust our eyes to the darkness but now we make out TWO FIGURES in the room involved in some sort of struggle. Miranda presses her face against the glass and now sees a flash of metal. Something sharp. Not a knife, but a needle. And now a blur of hair yanked up by a strong arm. In the dim light we can make out Chloe, eyes glazed, drooling. Just for a beat, because now she is slapped down on the bed like a rag doll and the man with the needle ENTERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Miranda flinches, confused. Glances down the corridor to ensure she remains undiscovered. Then peers back in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ROOM 237
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chloe on her stomach on the bed. Her pale naked skin marked with scratches and bruises. The needle is stuck in her arm, which hangs off the side. Her mouth is open but it is impossible to tell whether she is laughing or sobbing. Abruptly the man climbs on her, pulling off his T-shirt. As he discards it we see that it is yellow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Disturbed, Miranda turns away. Except now the corridor isn't empty. There is a JANITOR at the end. Coffee cup in hand. Staring at her, disconcerted.

Miranda turns and runs.

Miranda bolts down the stairs. THUNDERING FOOTSTEPS and YELLS can be heard right behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FEMALE WARD THIRD FLOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda races down the empty floor towards an emergency exit door all the way at the end. TWO ORDERLIES emerge from the staircase and give chase, shouting for her to stop. PATIENTS holler from their cells, awakened by the COMMOTION. Miranda's heart is nearly bursting through her chest as she gets closer and closer to the emergency door. Twenty feet, fifteen, ten -- When a side door opens and a MAN IN A YELLOW SHIRT appears, blocking her path. Miranda tries to avoid crashing into him but carries too much momentum. Veers left against the wall but the man easily tackles her and pins her down. The orderlies and an nurse arrive at the scene to find her screaming, hysterical. They hold her down --
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's him! It's him! Jesus Christ, it's him!
	</DIALOGUE>

The man in the yellow shirt acts as if he has no idea what she's talking about. Ho-hum, just another psychotic woman trying to escape. A nurse prepares a needle and we --

FADE OUT.

	Could there be any truth to her claim?

<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peter, we have one hundred and forty employees. Thirty-five work maintenance. They all wear yellow shirts, it's their uniform. I'm holding a very discreet inquiry, sure -- but I don't want a news van parked outside day and night. It makes much more sense that she tried to escape and got caught, doesn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pete ponders this. It certainly seems that way.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I perused Miranda's files on Chloe McGrath -- they're damn comprehensive. Maybe she was a bit obsessed with her.

Irene and Parsons share a look. He wraps it up:

<PARSONS>

	Did you live here when Rachel killed herself?

	You can imagine. Actually, Phil was in Houston undergoing triple bypass surgery when it happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
What was that? Miranda reacts to this.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And this is confirmed. There are hospital records and so forth?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure there are. Can we get back on track now?

Miranda pulls out the folded printout from her pocket.

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about these other dates, was Phil here when the other girls went missing and found dead?

<DIRECTION>
A disconcerted Pete looks at the article with the pictures of Rachel and the others: Andrea White and Jenny Dixon.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you going with this? First I'm a suspect in Doug's death, now what, Phil Parsons murdered his own daughter?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rachel Parsons disappeared six years ago. A week later she's a suicide. Andrew White, four years ago, same M.O., and Jenny Dixon, two years ago. Don't you find that unusual?

He regards her. Maybe Parsons is right: she's desperately grasping at straws now. Skims the article:
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What same M.O.? One jumped off a bridge, one hung herself and one crashed her car. Who gave you this?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not one left a suicide note. In fact, how is anybody sure these were suicides?

	You heard Phil, his daughter had tried several times before --

	That's his story. I need to talk to the reporter who wrote that. Frank something.

	Don't be smug, Pete. That's one thing you've never been. Rachel is somehow connected to what I'm going through. I don't know how -- like you said, I'm not in a frame of mind to process the information without assistance. So I'm asking you for assistance.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me. You are not well. I had hoped once you remembered the murder we could deal with your feelings about it but these fixations: Rachel Parsons, Chloe McGrath -- are self-created distractions to avoid looking into yourself. And the longer you --

Claire squeaks until she sees her attacker: a stoner type named SIMON. Deftly unbuttoning her uniform, hands all over her. She means to resist but he's got such boyish charm.

	You can't be in here and you know it. Nap in your car.

She finally twists herself out of his grasp. Points an accusing finger, but she's grinning. Blushing, even.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now get out before we get busted.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Properly reprimanded, Simon picks up his folded uniform and prepares to leave, head hung low.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You slay me, Claire. Honest.

<CLAIRE>

He exits. She shakes her head, slips her uniform back on.

:SC: INT. ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simon presses the button, waits. He checks inside his folded uniform where we see several stolen vials of sedatives. The doors begin to close when --
</DIRECTION>
<CLAIRE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold it, Simon!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He hides the loot behind his back, busted. She holds the door open and tosses him his yellow shirt.

	What do you think I am, laundry service?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SIMON>
<DIRECTION>

She turns and exits. The doors slide shut. Meet our rapist.

:SC: INT. WOODWARD CAFETERIA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bustling with activity. The room is divided into two: a large main area where the patients eat, plus a second, smaller upstairs area for the staff. BOOM DOWN to find Miranda eating at a long table. Shelley beside her, playing with her plastic fork. Jenna taps an unlit cigarette. As usual, Irene keeps watch nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... She'd get high on glue and make me help her try on my bras. Is that the strangest shit you've heard?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JENNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heard stranger. But she's a case.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHELLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And she always put on a happy face. Man, what an optometrist.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Optometrist? Miranda starts to correct her, but lets it go.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You narced her out, didn't you? Boo-hoo. Bet you were a little buzzed yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda's gaze strays from this, um, most compelling of conversations and comes to rest on Chloe. Alone at another table. Heavily sedated. A wreck. Miranda rises and walks over. Shelley waits until she's out of hearing range, leans in to Jenna --
</DIRECTION>
<SHELLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All work, that woman. Work, work, work.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JENNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHELLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's like an alcoholic. But with work.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JENNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What work?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHELLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not safe to tell you. Wish I could.

Jenna rolls her eyes, returns to her food.

<DIRECTION>
Parsons watches intrigued as Miranda sits beside Chloe and starts talking. From Parson's POV up above we can see pretty much the entire dining area.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO MIRANDA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trying to get Chloe's attention. But Chloe just stares at her untouched food, glassy-eyed.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw what happened. I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
No reaction.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you told anyone? Chloe?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Chloe -- the person who did this to you is not the devil. And if you can identify him, I'll make sure the motherfucker is arrested.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Now Chloe looks at her, like something finally registers.
</DIRECTION>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doctor, did you just say 'motherfucker'?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know his name? Maybe you saw a nametag on his uniform? Think.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Chloe simply stares. Finally shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, you must really hate me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? I don't hate you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You hate me because now you're just the same as me. You must feel so embarrassed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't hate you. And I don't feel embarrassed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's just a pat answer you have because you're new at this. Trust me, I know what I'm talking about.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(rising)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it, alright? Forget we had this conversation.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Chloe abruptly grabs her arm. Tightly.
</DIRECTION>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what happens next?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I get the distinct feeling you're going to tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The shock wears off and the guilt kicks in. And that guilt is the real motherfucker. You'll be watched 24/seven, because they're afraid you'll kill yourself. Dr. Graham will question every harmless gesture, every innocent comment, ever twitch you make and eventually -- and it's a fucking tedious 'eventually' -- you'll stop hating yourself for what you did. But what replaces that hatred is this unbearable sadness. And you don't lose that as long as you live.

PUSH IN ON Miranda. Deeply affected by Chloe's words, as we --

A) Miranda and the other patients line up for meds in the rec room. B) Irene keeps watch in the garden as the women get their daily fresh air. C) Wardens watch as each patient enters their cell at night and the lights go off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Echoing an earlier scene, we are MOVING TOWARDS her -- her pale skin visible in the dim monochromatic light. Miranda flicks a look this way and that, alert. Sensing something.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave me alone. Go away.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Just like a crazy person. She listens for any further noise, hears none and shuts her eyes. Exhausted.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've lost my fucking mind. Happy now?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. But now the BEDSPRINGS CREAK behind her and she whips around and starts to scream as a big hand covers her mouth. Her eyes open wide at the sight of Simon, in his yellow shirt. He shoves her against the mattress and presses his full weight against her. She lets out a muffled scream as he uncaps a syringe with his teeth and brings the plunger to her throat. Straight into her jugular.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
(sotto)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is gonna hurt you more than it hurts me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She flails and kicks desperately but he pins her down. The BEDSPRINGS STRAIN violently and now he's straddling her, squeezing the plunger into her throat. Her eyes welling up:
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
(sotto)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've always wanted to do a doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She manages to free one hand and yanks the syringe from her throat. It flies to the floor. He grins, enjoying this:
</DIRECTION>
<SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
(sotto)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The more you fight me, the harder I get, pussycat -- so pretty please, with sugar on top -- keep still.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Simon paws at her clothes as she struggles to defend herself. He finally slaps her free arm down. Presses his knee against it, immobilizing her once more. Now he produces another syringe from his pocket. Checks it. Miranda shakes her head, pleading. A scream stuck in her throat. But nobody can hear her. Simon brings the syringe towards her when suddenly we hear a LOUD CLANGING at the door. Shaking it off its hinges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Simon looks up, confused. Nobody is there. The split- second distraction is all Miranda needs to shove him off the bed. She fumbles for the discarded syringe and STABS HIS CHEST WITH IT -- squeezes the plunger --
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(sotto)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take that, son of a bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Simon moans as the full dose hits his system and his body goes limp. Miranda exhales, coming back to herself. A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rachel?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
No response. Miranda grabs his keys, begins to undress him.

shows a uniformed janitor calmly walking down the corridor. PULL BACK to see we are in --

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SURVEILLANCE BOOTH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bank of monitors keep watch on the premises after dark. TWO GUARDS play cards (Uno), bored to tears. A cursory glance at the monitors produces no reaction. Certainly a janitor walking down the corridor is no cause for alarm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dead quiet. CRICKETS CHIRP or whatever it is crickets do. Miranda steadies her breathing, perusing rows of unfamiliar cars. She clicks Simon's key-ring button repeatedly until a set of headlights blink on and off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SIMON'S CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda slips behind the wheel, STARTS the CAR. The RADIO KICKS IN at EAR-DEAFENING VOLUME. She nearly drops dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. WOODWARD GATE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gate GUARD reads a magazine as Miranda's stolen car approaches. The guard barely registers the driver in the booth mirror, immersed in his article. Hits a button to open the gate for him. It opens SLOWLY. S-l-o-w-l-y.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SIMON'S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda, sweating, watches the receding image of the institute behind her. Turns on the main road. Free.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, thank you, thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She glances back, makes sure no one is following her. Catches her own reflection in the rearview mirror: the scared eyes, the haunted face. The new version of herself. She flips the RADIO dial: BAD NEW AGE MUZAK. BAD COUNTRY. BAD DISCO. More BAD NEW AGE MUZAK. She finds IGGY POP'S entirely appropriate "THE PASSENGER) and lets it play.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we are seeing her as if from the POV of someone traveling alongside the car. Peering THROUGH the passenger window. Miranda becomes aware of this, slowly glances over. Sees nothing but her own reflection. Turns back forward. We NOTICE the blue cigarette lighter key chain dangling off the dashboard. Nothing but a long stretch of road ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The neighborhood perfectly quiet late at night. Miranda parks in the driveway and stares at the empty house. Steels herself, climbs out of the car and heads around back. She finds her SPARE KEY behind a potted plant, takes a deep breath and lets herself in through the back door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POLICE CRIME-SCENE TAPE everywhere. She turns on the kitchen light only and scurries to her bedroom without even looking in the direction of the living room, avoiding the scene of the gruesome crime altogether. Eerie as hell --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BEDROOM - QUICK CUTS

Miranda stuffs clothes into a suitcase, finds her passport, digs out some cash from a box. Quick change of clothes to get rid of the rapist's uniform. Fast, fast, fast --

Miranda watches her house fade from view in the rearview mirror as she drives down the block. Shudders. Flips the RADIO dial with shaky hands.

<DIRECTION>
She looks in the rearview mirror once more. Only this time she is met by a piercing pair of eyes. Rachel's. Inside the car. Rachel's mouth opens unnaturally wide, revealing a gaping abyss of rotted teeth and flesh -- and lets out the wet sound. A threatening howl this time, pure venom. Miranda covers her face, jerks the car. It does a 180 and slides to a halt in the middle of the street -- Facing the direction of her house again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. STREET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda jumps out, panicked. Glances around. Looks inside the car: no Rachel. A beat to catch her breath, making up her mind. Slides behind the wheel and makes a U-turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SIMON'S CAR - MOVING - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda flips the rearview mirror so it faces the ceiling and turns UP the RADIO. GUNS the pedal. Freaked. She's driven maybe 20 feet when suddenly her ENGINE DIES --
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The CAR SPUTTERS to a stop. Miranda goes to turn the key but suddenly freezes. Looks at the ignition oddly and notices the key is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you doing this to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A dead-still beat. Glancing around, she is even more startled to see the blue lighter key chain lying in the middle of the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda opens her car door and walks down the empty street to retrieve her suddenly magical keys. We watch her reach the keys, all alone out here. The moment she bends down to pick it up she is blinded by the glare of HEADLIGHT and the ROAR OF AN ENGINE. Miranda jumps out of the way, narrowly avoiding being flattened by a ROAD SWEEPER, spraying water as it goes. She watches the truck disappear down the block. Heart in her throat. Calms her nerves and now walks over to the pesky keys again. Smack in the middle of a puddle now. BOOM UP the posts harnessing power lines which surround the area until we STOP ON a pair of INDUSTRIAL BOLTS fastened around the insulators of a thick power line. From here we see Miranda bend down and pick up her keys. And now the bolts suddenly shake off their hinges, coming loose right in front of our eyes -- moved by some invisible force -- Miranda tilts her head at the sound of a METALLIC SNAP and turns. The bolts pop out of their sockets. The LIVE WIRE uncoils like some gigantic serpent and swings straight towards the paralyzed Miranda -- She looks down at her feet, ankle-deep in the puddle, back up at the 11,000 VOLTS OF POWER about to fry her to a crisp and jumps out of the way at the last second. The wire hits the water and the monumental charge sends SPARKS flying in every direction. It looks like lightning. A silent, sudden beat. That was as close as close gets.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(fighting tears)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want from me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
No sign of Rachel. Miranda yells at the air, glancing over her shoulder, seemingly demented:
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it you want me to do?!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A moment. Miranda stranded. The stolen car in the middle of the road. And now the SQUEAK of a GATE OPENING abruptly. Miranda whips her head in the direction of the sound. It's the front gate to her house. And now the front door SWINGS OPEN. And now the living room LIGHTS switch on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clearly Rachel wants her back in the house.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, please don't make me go back in there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
But even as she's saying this her feet are moving towards it. She pauses, looks at the car in the middle of the road. Looks at the fizzling puddle where she was almost electrocuted. No neighbors have come out to investigate yet, but how long can that last? She walks to the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SIMON'S CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda climbs in, not sure whether to laugh or cry here. She's never asked a ghost for permission before:
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bear with me, I'm just parking it out of the way so it won't look suspicious in the middle of the road -- okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She STARTS the ENGINE and pulls over to the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MIRANDA AND DOUG'S HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda stands in her living room, staring at her handiwork. Frozen with dread. The blood has been cleaned up some, but the mess remains. The upturned furniture covered in plastic, the chalk outline of the body, the yellow crime-scene tape, the shattered mirror above the fireplace, the muddied footprints of dozens of cops, coroners, etc. The faded writing on the wall: "NOT ALONE." Miranda takes it all in, not entirely sure what she's supposed to be looking for.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(piecing it together)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not alone. What happened to you happened to other girls.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand. And I'm sorry. But there is nothing I can do about it now. It has nothing to do with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Not knowing what else to do, she turns to exit when the TELEVISION SET suddenly COMES TO LIFE, making her jump. The unmistakable MUSIC from some old WB cartoon at FULL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLAST.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at the TV screen. Is there some sign here she should be able to follow? She crosses to turn it off and immediately doubles over in pain --
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at her foot. A big SHARD OF GLASS is stuck right through the flimsy hospital slipper into her skin. Blood already seeping from the nasty cut --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda seated on the edge of the tub, slowly pulls out the piece of glass, drops it in the wastebasket. She grabs a cotton ball and alcohol and starts cleaning the cut. And now, FAINT at first, but GROWING LOUDER -- she hears the hollow WET SOUND we've come to associate with Rachel. Inside the room with her -- Miranda stares at the medicine cabinet. Did the mirror move? We watch her from the MIRROR POV as she holds perfectly still, listening. The SOUND now seems to have STOPPED. A silent beat. She turns her attention back to cleaning her cut, grimacing as the alcohol burns her skin. It looks painful. And now the slow SQUEAK of the MEDICINE CABINET DOOR makes her look up again. And she sees herself in the mirror like the night of the slaughter: flames all around her. Naked arms raised. Wrists shackled. Anima Sola. She stares. Mesmerized. The sound of FLAMES GROWING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOUDER.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No. No...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda walks slowly to the mirror. Incredibly, the image reflecting back at her also grows bigger. As if the two versions of her are literally walking towards each other. FROM A SIDE ANGLE WE SEE both their faces mere inches apart. Miranda brings her fingertips to the mirror and touches it. Immediately pulls her hand back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda stares at her fingertips. The tips are burnt. The skin sizzles softly. 200 percent scientifically impossible. And when she looks up at the mirror again -- the image is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is now deathly quiet. And what she finds herself staring at in the mirror is the reflection of something just behind her. A folded newspaper discarded in the far corner of the room. She turns to look at it now. It's opened to the REALTY LISTINGS page. Doug must have left it there. She picks it up and looks closer: Focusing on a picture of a bank- repossessed property. The address is in Willows Creek. Her brain wires start clicking. This must be what Rachel wanted her to see. She stares at it. PUSH IN ON the picture as we --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MATCH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. WILLOWS CREEK PROPERTY - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A "FOR SALE" sign still flapping in the wind. The first few rays of light break through the dawn sky. Miranda's (Simon's) car approaches up the road until it FILLS the FRAME and parks. Miranda steps out. She studies the house before walking up the drive. We watch her peek through windows and walk around back, looking for something. What exactly, we don't know. (Neither does she.) She makes her way back to the starting point and fixes her stare now on the barn. The one place he hasn't looked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BARN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dark, empty. The WIND outside causes the ALUMINUM SIDING to FLAP NOISILY. It's slightly unnerving, but hey, it's just the wind. Miranda covers the distance of the large room, perplexed. There is something about this place. Something she can't quite put her finger on. Beckoning her. With a last fruitless look, she heads towards the front door when a glint of mental in the opposite corner stops her. She moves to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And here, where the walls should meet, there is a narrow gap, leading to a passage, maybe five inches wide. A padlocked chain has been threaded through a hole in both walls, holding them together. Miranda inspects the heavy padlock, the source of the glint. She tugs on the wall and opens it to the limits of the chain, but that's only a few inches more. Miranda peers into the darkness beyond, but can't see a thing. Hesitating only a moment, she turns sideways and slides herself into the claustrophobic slot. She moves forward cautiously a few feet until her face brushes against something hanging in the air. She stops, startled. It's a pull-string hanging from a naked light bulb. She tugs on it. And now she has 60 watts of reddish glow to see the hatch on the floor immediately in front of her. She pulls on the LATCH and it opens with a RUSTY CREAK. She peers into the pitch-black basement below. Feels around for the beginning of a stepladder and climbs down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SECRET BASEMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda emerges from the ladder into total darkness. Whatever dim reddish light was provided by the bulb upstairs does not reach here. She feels around the wall for a switch. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(to self)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not shrink-appropriate to be afraid of the dark, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Abruptly there's a sharp CLICK as she lights Simon's key- chain lighter, and the wavery light illuminates the vast space. Rats scurry for cover. It takes a second to orient ourselves. Something metallic catches the lighter's reflection way in back. Miranda walks towards it.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a few more steps until her foot hits a bulk on the floor. She stops. Kneels down and in the dim half- light we make out a backpack. She unzips it and rifles through it (T-shirts, underwear, Walkman) until she finds a wallet. Opens the billfold and brings the lighter next to the ID: the picture belongs to a teenager named
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"TRACY MARIE SEAVER."
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there anybody here? Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The lighter in her hand is getting hot, so she lets it click off. When it comes back on we see she has wrapped a ragged T-shirt around it for insulation. Miranda steps deeper into the room. Up ahead, she can make out the metallic thing that reflected light before. It is a hook in the ceiling. And suspended from it are several heavy chains. Like a meat rack. And now she catches a whiff of the terrible smell and sees the body of the teenage girl: hanging upside down, tied around the hands and ankles. Medical training kicking in, Miranda quickly lowers the girl to the ground, causing the angry rats to skitter away.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go away! Fuck off!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(We see the following in between flicks of the lighter so that we go from midnight black to wavery light in an almost strobe-light effect:) She checks for vital signs, pulse, heartbeat -- Miranda's adrenaline at full tilt --
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	C'mon, c'mon, c'mon --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She strikes the flint and brings the lighter to the girl's pupils. Inspects them. Slaps her repeatedly, clinically. The strobe effect also allows us glimpses of the immediate surroundings: household tools strewn about; wire cutters, pliers -- a pool of dried blood.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wake up, Tracy, wake up --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing. She unties the wires around the girl's ankles. The skin swollen grotesquely around them. She shakes the girl. Slowly coming to the realization that it's too late.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. BARN - LATER

Miranda comes crashing out of the barn, doubles over and throws up. The bright light outside blinding her momentarily. Her bloodshot eyes taking a moment to register --

<DIRECTION>
parked in front of the house. A POLICE OFFICER cautiously peering inside her stolen car. He looks up and notices her. Miranda hesitates. Nowhere to run. The officer waves. His name is TURLINGTON.

	Howdy there.

He says this while already strolling over. Miranda's mind races a mile a minute --

She stares at the young, friendly cop. His left hand resting on his belt. Right next to his gun. But it seems as if he has no idea who she is. At least not yet.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- I -- I just pulled over. I was -- looking for a bathroom. Morning sickness, you know...
	</DIALOGUE>
<OFFICER_TURLINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Congratulations. But I'm afraid this is private property -- you can't just waltz on in. You understand that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She nods, nerves shot to hell. Starts walking.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be on my merry way now. My husband will never forgive me if I get a ticket for trespassing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The cop nods at that, seeming to have a fair grasp of marital dynamics. He flashes a smile but suddenly stops, whips out his gun and trains it on her --
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER_TURLINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(clicks the safety off)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lady, stay right where you are.

Miranda shuts her eyes, busted. Freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER_TURLINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hands up where I can see them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda awkwardly raises her shaky hands.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER_TURLINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice and slow, start talking to me. And make it good. Tell me just exactly who that is.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A confused Miranda slowly turns in the direction he's looking to see Tracy Seaver at the barn door. Dragging herself in agony, clearly in a severe state of shock. Battered, yet somehow -- incredibly -- still alive. But just barely.

Sheriff Ryan is busy at the urinal. But even here he can't find any peace because Teddy Howard is on his case --
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Howard -- let me simply list the events your client was involved in last night. First she drugs a janitor, steals his car and escapes a mental institution --
	</DIALOGUE>
<TEDDY_HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold on, there isn't even any substantial evidence --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sheriff Ryan zips up his pants, flushes and runs the sink to wash his hands --
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Howard -- there isn't evidence because the overdosed janitor hasn't woken up, that's why -- and when your client was questioned on the matter she admitted to injecting a full syringe of --
	</DIALOGUE>
<TEDDY_HOWARD>
<DIRECTION>
(handing him a paper towel)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You had no right to question my client without my presence --
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Howard, this is not a courtroom. Your client was read her rights and she still insisted --
	</DIALOGUE>
<TEDDY_HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Let me ask you this, Sheriff: what exactly was a janitor doing with several vials of sedatives inside my client's cell? And is it not possible he had taken some drugs himself before my client --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sheriff Ryan discards the paper towel and walks out to the waiting room, Teddy following closely --

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ER WAITING ROOM

<DIRECTION>
Paramedics and nurses doing their thing. The young officer who arrested Miranda hands the Sheriff a cup of coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not a drug expert. I'm simply stating the frigging facts.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sheriff Ryan burns his tongue on the coffee, notices Parsons and Pete approaching. Relief crosses his face.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Phil, thank God -- this guy's driving me nuts!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An 'incident' -- for lack of a better frigging word -- involving Miss Grey and a teenage girl who's been tortured and is in critical condition and chances are slim she'll even utter another word.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's the girl?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A runaway from Portland, Tracy Marie Seaver. Reported missing a couple weeks ago. We found Miss Grey in some barn off Willows Creek with the girl all messed up. I'm just now waiting for the surgeon to give me an update.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Teddy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Notice, Counselor, how I'm not even mentioning her trespassing or lying to a police officer.
	</DIALOGUE>

Teddy waves him off in frustration. Goes to talk to Turlington.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ, the woman's got the entire hospital busy --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sheriff Ryan notices Teddy talking to Turlington --
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you harassing my deputies?
	</DIALOGUE>
<TEDDY_HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm only asking him where he got the coffee -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not at liberty to answer that. You've had enough goddamn coffee already.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff leaves Pete and Parsons. They walk over to the water cooler where they can talk more privately.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need to get Miranda back to the institute. She needs psychiatric care, not a prison cell.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Parsons nods, lost in thought. Sheriff Ryan returns.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Phil, how well does your wife know the suspect?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do you ask?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because she's at the station right now, demanding to speak with her.

Parsons frowns at this, concerned. Pete studies him.

:SC: INT. COUNTY STATION HOLDING CELL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bare room. A desk and two chairs. Glass window panes to insure no privacy. DOROTHY PARSONS (50s) waits, seated. The door opens and a DEPUTY escorts Miranda in. She sits across from Dorothy, looking as lost as can be. A long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda doesn't answer. Her mind elsewhere. Namely back at the barn and how it connects to Rachel.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I needed to see you, but I'm not sure where to begin. I don't know you well, I certainly have nothing but fond feelings for you. Phil always keeps me posted on his colleagues and his work and -- in any case, I have always thought of you as a very bright, very perceptive doctor. Even though I don't know you well.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She pauses here. Miranda looks up now. Her face hollow and exhausted. Bags under her eyes. A person who has seen too much. Wondering where the hell this is going.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My point is, my point being -- when Rachel died I had, um, I suffered through these spells, these recurring dreams. And eventually, once I came to terms with her death, they went away. Losing a child is the hardest, most inconceivable event a mother can --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She drifts off. Takes a beat to collect herself and resume:
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The past few days I have been having the same dream. A nightmare.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda can't help but smile to herself at that.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That word. Nightmare. Welcome to my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This nightmare involves Rachel but it also involves you. In the nightmare Rachel holds a box in her left hand. A small box. And she repeats a series of numbers. Now, Rachel never spoke, from the time she was born -- she had a condition -- I often asked God why he punished this child in such a way -- she couldn't speak, but she was extremely bright. She wasn't autistic as the doctors claimed --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Dorothy Parsons starts to cry. A moment passes like this. It seems she won't recover enough to continue her tale.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mrs. Parsons, you need a therapist. Normally I would encourage you to schedule a session with me but as you can see --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Dorothy shakes her head, determined to finish. She pulls out a folded piece of paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Every night the same box in her hand and the same numbers. I wrote them down.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She slides the paper over. Miranda watches her carefully, then looks at the piece of paper. The numbers are:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1-0-2-2-0-1.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a message. It's a code for something. I don't know what. But she wants you to have it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda studies it. Studies this woman, who quite frankly seems to have completely lost her mind. Then she looks back at the numbers and is slowly hit with a realization.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	October 22nd, 2001. It's my wedding date.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She stares at Dorothy, stunned. Brain click-click- clicking. Her wildest fears confirmed: Doug is behind this somehow.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That code belongs to a safety deposit box my husband kept in a bank up in Newcastle, that's where his parents live.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dorothy, I need you to drive up there and open it.

Dorothy stares at her, scared. And finally nods.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pete hurries down the front steps of the main building as TWO POLICE CRUISERS pull up. Miranda is brought out of one of the cruisers by two OFFICERS.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can take those off now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sheriff Ryan leans out of the other cruiser.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't push it, Doctor. She's cuffed until your people secure her in a cell.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pete sighs, gestures for the officers to bring her in. Irene and two heavy-duty orderlies will also be part of the escort. Miranda locks eyes with Pete as she approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you alright?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was wrong. It wasn't Phil Parsons. It was Doug.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we talk about this later?

<DIRECTION>
(to Sheriff)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Sheriff.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tomorrow morning first thing my deputies are here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, I know. We'll see you then.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And my offer still stands if you need added security.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. She won't go anywhere. I guarantee it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff waves, whatever. Knocks twice on the hood and the officer behind the wheel shifts into drive.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why Rachel picked me. It was Doug. I'm so stupid.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pete regards her now, has no idea what she's going on about this time. Tries to remain professional.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Inside, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lunch time for the female wing. An excited Shelley rushes over to a table where Chloe and Jenna are, whispers something to them. They glance at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later, Miranda walks in with her police escort. Taking her across the cafeteria towards the back door. An uneasy Pete leads. Irene and the wardens at the rear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda glances at the women staring at her like a specimen. Like somehow she's even more dangerous than them. Top dog, as it were, of the crazies. And then, halfway across the room, one of the women stands up. Chloe. She claps her hands together. Slowly. Miranda watches her, confused. And slowly Shelly, Jenna and others rise as well. All of them joining Chloe in clapping.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's a hero. Little Red Riding Hood put the big bad wolf in a coma.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pete nods. Just what he needed. The OFFICERS trade looks.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're not gonna start something, are they?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Irene shakes her head, amused.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ain't scared of a bunch of women now, are you, Officer?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The entire cafeteria is on their feet showing their solidarity for Miranda. Chloe locks eyes with her, mouths the words "thank you." And Miranda is hauled out the side door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
White. Surveillance cameras in every corner. Two separate doors with elaborate locks. High security all around. The officers undo Miranda's cuffs and excuse themselves. Pete gestures for Irene and the Orderlies to leave as well.
</DIRECTION>
<ORDERLY_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll be right outside, Doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Once the doors are locked and they're alone, the conversation jumps straight into frustrated high gear:
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pulled a lot of strings to get you transferred back. The best case scenario you're looking at right now is five years here. Five. Under my --
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peter, I didn't believe in ghosts before this. And neither do you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pete is at the end of his rope. Can't hide his sadness when he looks at her. Still, he tries to get her back on track:
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you know that the brain is fully capable of tricking you into seeing all sorts of things. The simplest chemical deficiencies can --
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chemical deficiencies can't get inside of you and make you do terrible things you don't remember doing!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a very open-minded person, but as a doctor --
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you're not. You're a close- minded academic, just like me. You told me once that I was the most logical person you knew, remember? Well, everything that's happened has an explanation but it has nothing to do with psychiatry or science. Rachel Parsons was abducted and she was murdered six years ago -- tossed off the Ashley Bridge by my husband. My harmless, righteous 'community leader' husband -- that's how pathetically blind I've been. Andrea White and Jenny Dixon were also abducted and murdered -- now this was before I met Doug but I bet you anything that they both went to his school. Then he obviously stopped for a while: fear, guilt, distractions -- namely me -- delayed him from reverting to his sickness. That's why I didn't notice anything. I believe he really tried to lead a normal life, for me. Then along comes Tracy Seaver and he can't resist. Locks her up and tortures her in some abandoned property --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She shows him the crumpled newspaper listing.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's Doug's interest in real estate, Pete.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pete stares at the realty listing for Willows Creek.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rachel Parsons is a pissed-off ghost with an agenda, furious at her parents for giving up on her -- she's been trying to communicate with them for years but they're too goddamn logical to pay attention -- and she picked me, she sought me out that night and sent me home to fix her problem. Made sure I killed Doug because he was going to do the same thing to Tracy Seaver as he did to her. And she will get rid of anyone who stands in her way.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pete takes all of this in. Dumbfounded.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that a threat?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To whom?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To you? I'm telling you she nearly electrocuted me when I tried to leave town and she led me to that barn and if I don't do what she wants -- she's going to kill me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pete can see that she's petrified. He starts to speak, but she hushes him by gently placing her finger on his lips. The gesture is tender, almost romantic. A reminder of their very real connection.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need you to at least consider the possibility that I'm not insane.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat; pleading)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not as a doctor. As the only person I trust in this world.

	I'm not doing it for Miranda, I'm doing this for Rachel.

<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're making a complete fool of yourself. Do you realize what you sound like?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She sighs, climbs out of the car, leaving him there. Takes three steps. Stops. Turns back around and lets him have it:
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do I sound like, Phil? Like one of your patients? Well, it's probably because that's exactly how you treat me. And I've had enough of this deafening silence between us, this exemplary mourning in front of the community, tiptoeing around our lives with you pretending Rachel never existed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
BANK CUSTOMERS walk around the argument, pretending not to hear. Phil is mortified. But Dorothy doesn't care:
</DIRECTION>
<DOROTHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm losing my mind. Our daughter is gone and I miss her and I'm angry.
	</DIALOGUE>

She turns and storms off. Phil takes it all in for the first time. A moment later he climbs out of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. BANK VAULT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A solemn GUARD places the safety deposit box on the table in the middle of the room. Steps back through the gate and waits. Dorothy and Phil stare at the box for a moment. Finally, Phil punches in the code written out by his wife and opens it. He sorts through some paperwork that means nothing to him until his hands feel a thick envelope. He opens it and spills the contents on the table. It is a stack of POLAROIDS. Dorothy leans in and immediately her face darkens. She grabs onto the table, shakily -- and is forced to sit down. A horrified sob rises from deep inside her, comes out like the howl of a dying animal. Her husband pales, all blood draining from his face.

</DIRECTION>
<CONSUELO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are we doing today?

That term again, "we." Doctor-speak. Miranda doesn't have the energy for it:

	She's very, very angry. And she's not finished with you yet.

	She wants to show you something.

	That may be so, but I want her to go away.

	Consuelo, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but I honestly don't think this ghost will go away if I pour some egg powder on myself --

<DIRECTION>
Consuelo holds up a finger, hushing Miranda. She's receiving something here. Shudders.
</DIRECTION>
<CONSUELO>

	She made you do things. Bad things, didn't she?
	</DIALOGUE>

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know how to do that -- I'm not qualified for it. You do it.

Consuelo crosses herself. A sign of respect for the situation. But it has a chilling effect on Miranda.

	Come on, Phil, you of all people --
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I of all people hold logic, reason and facts above everything else. And seek the truth through proof and proof only.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(re: pictures)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what do you call that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Has it occurred to you that maybe she knew what her husband was doing to those girls?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Frankly, it hasn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe she couldn't stand the guilt and cooked up this far-fetched tale to tug at everybody's heartstrings. The fact remains she hacked her husband to pieces.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fact remains my daughter was murdered and Miranda stopped the killer. A killer who was loose under your incompetent nose for over six years. We don't know how many future victims were spared, but we do know she saved that girl in the barn's life. And that's more than you or I can say -- !
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Calm down. For the record, that girl is on a ventilator. The doctors don't think she'll make it through tonight. Now, you want to stand up in a courtroom and tell a judge that a ghost is behind all this, that's your prerogative -- but I have to abide by the law. And the law says Miranda Grey faces criminal chargers. So here's what we're going to do. I'm going to leave a cruiser outside to make sure you don't go anywhere tonight and two of my deputies will go guard Ms. Grey until tomorrow morning. Phil?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Parsons doesn't respond. His eyes far away.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There will be no breakouts, no aiding and abetting, no taking the law into your own hands. It'll take an Act of God for Miranda Grey not to show up in that courtroom tomorrow. Are we clear?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And now the Sheriff can see that Parsons is crying. Quietly, miserably. And it's a disparaging sight. Sheriff Ryan exits. Two deputies follow, RADIOS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SQUAWKING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parsons remains still for a moment, then digs a photograph out of a drawer. A picture of Rachel in happier times.
</DIRECTION>
<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I will never forgive myself for what happened to you. Not as long as I live.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(breaking down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

He sits there, staring at his dead daughter. Grieving. WE PULL BACK to see he is not alone. Rachel is watching him.

The WIND has really PICKED UP now. A massive LIGHTNING BOLT streaks the sky, officially announcing the storm's onset. A POLICE CRUISER pulls up to the guard gate.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. WOODWARD SURVEILLANCE BOOTH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAN OFF the bank of monitors TO the same two guards we've seen before. Playing yet another bored card game. The LIGHT RAPPING on their glass door makes them look up.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
TWO OFFICERS stand there. We recognize one of them:
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER_TURLINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're here on Miranda Grey detail.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Guards shake their heads, chuckle.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sixth floor. You can get a couple chairs from the nurses up there. A pretty decent cup of joe too.

<OFFICER_TURLINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Guard points at the bank of monitors.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Although why the Sheriff is making you fellas waste your time is beside me. We got her right here. She ain't going no place.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ON MONITOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda inside her pristine white cell. Restlessly pacing.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER_TURLINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks perfectly harmless, doesn't she?
	</DIALOGUE>
<GUARD_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't they all, Officer, don't they all?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The men share a chuckle over that one when suddenly THUNDER CRACKLES and the power goes out. No monitors, no radio, no nothing. Pitch black.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit. There goes the card game.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Abruptly there's a SERIES OF sharp CLICKS as FOUR FLASHLIGHTS come alive.
</DIRECTION>

Miranda holds her breath, listens. And sure enough, somebody else is in the room. She looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No. What do you want -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And now LIGHTNING streaks the room and we see Rachel in the corner. Staring with her dead eyes. Moving towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've done everything you've asked me to. My life is ruined. I can't take this anymore. I can't...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(faintly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to step into the light, Rachel. You don't belong here -- you don't belong...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
But it doesn't work. Rachel keeps walking towards her. Miranda backs up against the wall. Trapped. Fighting tears --
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Into the light --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(loudly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can somebody come in here? I need help. Somebody, please!

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - DIFFERENT FLOOR - STAIRS -

<DIRECTION>
The cops reach the landing where we see other flashlights down the corridor. They walk towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<OFFICER_TURLINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Officer Turlington, ma'am. We're supposed to sit outside Miranda Grey's cell all night.
	</DIALOGUE>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Knock yourself out. Next floor up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(loudly)
</DIRECTION>

	It's only a power outage, ladies -- let's call it an early night.

<DIRECTION>
The cops head down the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel stretches out her arm to Miranda's face --
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't. Why are you doing this? It's over. Over and done!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel slowly shakes her head, places her hands on Miranda's eyes and shuts them --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIRANDA'S VISION - ANDREA WHITE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in her school uniform. Staring straight ahead. Now the image is bathed in a red and blue light and we see her half-naked, bruised. Dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JENNY DIXON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
staring AT us in her school uniform. Now abruptly she is a hellish vision: opening her mouth in agony, also bathed in the strange red and blue light --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END OF MIRANDA'S VISION.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MIRANDA'S NEW CELL - CONTINUOUS ACTION

Miranda screams at the visions. Rachel holds her steady.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it! I don't want to see this! I can't help you anymore! Stop it!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Now a heavy RATTLING makes her turn to the door. One of the HINGES has SHATTERED and the latch itself is half- pulled from the doorframe. Relentless POUNDING on the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me out of here! Let me out!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
There's a deafening SOUND like a thousand bells ringing at once and Miranda covers her ears -- Outside WE HEAR MURMURS, YELLS, INSTRUCTIONS --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cops arrive to find every door in the corridor flung open. Confused patients spill out as guards and nurses try to restore order. RADIOS SQUAWK, flashlights beam and FOOTSTEPS fill the dark corridor as patients try to escape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. WOODWARD INSTITUTE - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
FIRE ENGINES and PATROL CARS arrive at the scene, SIRENS blazing. Sheriff Ryan and additional deputies rush from their cars to contain the breakout. A large SPOTLIGHT comes to life. We spot Jenna making a run for the garden wall when the spotlight hits her. Two officers rush after her.

A car pulls up at the scene. Pete and Parsons step out.

<DIRECTION>
Pete rushes up the steps --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SIXTH FLOOR CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Officer Turlington looks inside Miranda's cell. Empty. And as he is about to speak into his walkie he spots her: Seated by the elevator. Holding a biting block in Shelley's mouth as her seizing subsides.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
(into radio)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheriff? I have Miss Grey right here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He flashes his light at her. Miranda looks back blankly.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER_TURLINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, we thought you might have made a run for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Page Irene ASAP. This patient needs her meds.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Turlington nods. Miranda looks down at a grateful Shelley, whose head is cradled in her lap. Brushes the matted hair off her face. Carefully removes the biting block, making sure Shelley is alright.
</DIRECTION>
<SHELLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(after a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're gonna get that Pulitzer after all.

	Shh, shh, just rest.

:SC: INT. REC ROOM - LATER

<DIRECTION>
The patients are all assembled here. Flashlights galore. Irene and Consuelo do head counts. Guards, officers, janitors -- everybody. Irene points a finger at Jenna.
</DIRECTION>
<IRENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have really disappointed me tonight, Jenna --
	</DIALOGUE>
<JENNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me a break. You wouldn't respect me if I hadn't tried --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Parsons breaks away from Turlington, heads over to Pete and Miranda --
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everybody accounted for?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're doing the final count. Now they can't find the Sheriff.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda scans the near-dark room, looking for someone. Watches Turlington step aside to take a call on his radio. Parsons regards her with newfound respect:
</DIRECTION>
<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you alright, Miranda?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine, Phil. Thanks for asking.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly all the policemen in the room begin to exit --
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's going on, Officer?
	</DIALOGUE>
<OFFICER_TURLINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One of your patients is holding the Sheriff at gunpoint. She's in the cafeteria.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pete glances at Miranda. She knows exactly who it is:
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chloe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Turlington is about to exit when Parsons stops him:
</DIRECTION>
<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think Doctor Grey should be the one to talk to her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CAFETERIA - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DOOR CRASHES open and Chloe shoves the Sheriff inside. She has a gun pressed hard against his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Young lady, I don't know how you think you can get out of here, but --
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're very polite for a piggy. Now take off your uniform.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sheriff Ryan hesitates. Chloe presses the gun against him.
</DIRECTION>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do it quick. I won't make fun of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of the UPSTAIRS DOOR BEING THROWN OPEN makes her glance up. She trains her flashlight at the second level, stepping behind the Sheriff to use him as cover.
</DIRECTION>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody better fucking move up there or I'll blow this piggy's head off!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Her FLASHLIGHT BEAM searches the section. Catches the reflection of a police shield hiding behind a table.
</DIRECTION>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That means you, fucko. Up on your feet or I'll start by shooting his ear off.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Officer Turlington rises. Slow and deliberate.
</DIRECTION>
<CHLOE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Sheriff, sotto)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell junior the grownups are talking now and he's not allowed in here. Do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turlington, it's alright. I can -- I'm just going to --
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The grownups are talking. Don't paraphrase me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The grownups are -- are talking now. Just leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A voice startles Chloe from behind, at floor level.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chloe? Can I talk to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Chloe flicks the flashlight to see Miranda by the door.
</DIRECTION>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dreadful timing, I'm real busy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to let him go. I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Chloe flinches at that. Like all this multitasking is affecting her. She digs the gun deeper into the Sheriff's neck, making him cower to his knees, execution style --
</DIRECTION>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look -- let's not confuse things. I like you. But this is my only chance.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Sheriff)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now take off that goddamn uniform before I get really pissed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff glances at Miranda. Miranda nods. The Sheriff begins unbuttoning his shirt --
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you going to do? Put on his uniform and walk out of here? Think about it, Chloe. They know you have him. The place is crawling with cops.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are my options? To grow old in this place? It's clear they will never let me go. Never. Ever.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not true. You have less than a year left here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a lie! I'll never stop being sick, they'll just find something new that's wrong with me. No wonder you doctors can't help anyone -- all you have are deficit columns and stupid tests designed to point out what part of the puzzle you think we're missing!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She starts sobbing. Letting everything go --
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right, doctors never concentrate on the things patients are actually capable of. But I know you, Chloe, you've been through things that most people don't survive. And you have a wonderful future in front of you if you choose it. It's up to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
This gets through to Chloe. Her grip loosens on the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No more guilt, no more hatred, no more unbearable sadness. You have no use for any of that anymore. Your life begins this very second.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm so tired. So goddamn tired --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda walks over and embraces her. Chloe hands her the gun. And that's when the power returns. Miranda and Chloe frozen in their embrace. Sheriff Ryan on his knees. In the sudden, shocking glare of returning light, color abruptly re-enters the world and every RADIO, PHONE, FAN and MACHINE that were left on HUM TO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIFE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda finds herself staring at Sheriff Ryan, bathed in the glow of the flashing red and blue lights from the cruisers outside. The image a replica of the Andrea White and Jenny Dixon visions. Peeking from his half-unbuttoned shirt is the beginning of a chest TATTOO. Miranda slowly trains the gun on the Sheriff, finally struck with the realization:
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was you, wasn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She opens his shirt to reveal the tattoo: a 1950s pinup- style WOMAN SURROUNDED BY FLAMES, ARMS RAISED, SHACKLED. Anima Sola. Miranda's recurring vision from the night of the slaughter.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Not alone.' That's what Rachel has been trying to tell me all along. Doug was not alone. You were with him. This whole time it's been you. You covered up their deaths to look like suicides.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Sheriff throws his jacket on, starts walking --
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've lost your mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Miranda, don't do it!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She glances at Pete's pleading face and the room around her: cops everywhere. All guns trained on her. Sheriff Ryan speaks low so only she can hear the following:
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And just exactly who would believe you? No proof, no living witness. Everybody knows you're crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda's finger itches on the trigger as they face off. Her hand starts to shake. Sheriff Ryan turns and strides off. Getting away. Further. Further... But as much as she wants to, she can't bring herself to do it. Finally brings the gun down. The armed policemen rush over and disarm her, shove her to the floor and cuff her.
</DIRECTION>

Turlington hits the gas. Miranda presses her face against the window so only Pete can see her say the following:

Miranda's eyes snap open at the SOUND OF DEADBOLTS SLIDING UNLOCKED. Hopeful. Could this be Rachel?
</DIRECTION>

A looming figure appears at the door. Doesn't bother to shut it. Stares at her silently for a long while. And so begins a claustrophobic cat and mouse game:
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>

	How did you know?

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You tell me.

	This isn't one of your word association games, Doctor. Did Douglas tell you that night?

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why wait this long if he had?

<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it's your amnesia. Maybe you blocked it out.

<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe. But it seems to me that it's vital you know for sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He studies her. Takes a step towards her. Miranda responds by stepping back. A slow motion semicircle, if you will. She eyes the open door. Tempted.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think me and Doug are monsters. That this was all a carefully laid out plan with those girls. But it wasn't that at all. You do things sometimes and you're not sure why you did them. Then you realize you can live with them and so can everyone else. Life goes on.

She's stalling, trying to keep him talking and he knows it.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One thing about fear is it makes people say the dumbest things.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be that as it may, you're afraid too -- because you know killing me won't solve your problems.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My only problem is you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Parsons? And Peter? They know. And that girl in the hospital will never forget your face. You miscalculated, now you pay.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Patience tested, he suddenly WHACKS her across the face.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate a bad bluffer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She makes a big effort to hide how much that stung.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sure hope that felt good because you can't afford too many more signs of struggle. Can you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead, hit me back. It's what you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that's what you want me to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back to profiling, huh? Your thought process is completely transparent.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And now Miranda briefly takes the reins of the conversation. Analyst and patient in session. Echoing her opening scene with Chloe.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So we're even. You left that door open so I'd try and run, it's what you get off on, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess we'll find out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And yet you have to make me look like a suicide. With what, your belt?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off his shrug)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How would I get access to a belt?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trust me, prisoners hang themselves with just about anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think that's going to satisfy you. You won't be able to do this clean. You have too much guilt inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
SMACK! Another slap across the face. Miranda's knees buckle. But she remains standing. Her lip trembles.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're losing grasp of the situation. It was different with those girls. I bet all they did was cry and scream.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, you'll scream.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(after a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take off your shirt.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
This throws her off. She shoots a quick glance at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't I a little old for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it off.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She hesitates. He draws his gun, tired. Removes the safety.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's for show. You know you can't shoot me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I can smash your teeth out and make it look like you bashed your head against the wall. Now shut up, take off your goddamn shirt and pull off your bra.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda is petrified now. Running out of ways to hide it.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Today, Doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
In a sudden move, Miranda shoves the chair at him and bolts out the door. The Sheriff doesn't move to stop her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HALLWAY TO CELL AREA - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda dashes down the hallway, trying to escape. Takes quick inventory of the space: two more holding cells like her own, a row of filing cabinets, and a storage area with barred windows. She makes a turn up ahead and reaches another gate down the corridor. A sliding gate that closes off the cell area from the main station. She tries the gate. Locked, naturally. She shakes and bangs on it, desperate.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	TURLINGTON!! SOMEBODY HELP ME!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
No response. And no way to disguise the sheer panic in her voice. She fell for his trap. They're all alone here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MIRANDA'S CELL - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ryan smiles at that. Re-holsters his weapon and walks towards her, taking his time. Relishing the hunt.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doug mentioned you were painfully 'modest.' But enough about you, let's discuss Rachel.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HALLWAY TO CELL AREA - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Miranda searches for a place to hide. His FOOTSTEPS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GETTING CLOSER --
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was no crippled saint. Wasn't the first time she turned up at Doug's house all messed up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheriff Ryan peeks down the corridor where we last saw Miranda. The gate still locked. She's not there. He traces her steps, clearly enjoying this:
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure she was a minor, but she wasn't going to let that get in her way.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. STORAGE AREA - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda is cramped underneath an upturned desk. The SHOT is FRAMED so we can see the doorway. She prays silently:
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
<DIRECTION>
(sotto)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rachel, where are you when I need you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Clearly not here. Sheriff Ryan's voice getting closer:
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those other girls -- make no mistake -- they knew what they were getting into.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He appears at the doorway now, peeks inside the room. Sensing her in there. Miranda holds her breath.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not saying they knew they were going to die, but truth is, Doug and I didn't know it was going to end that way. It was just the natural extension of that moment. So yeah, we fucked them and we killed them. And we knew it was wrong. Sure we did.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches the upturned desk and flips it over with a CLANGING SOUND. Miranda wasn't underneath that one. She scrambles to the door behind him as he turns --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HALLWAY TO CELL AREA - CONTINUOUS ACTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She slams the door shut on his fingers and fumbles to slide the deadbolt behind her when the door suddenly SMASHES OPEN against her, knocking her backwards onto the floor -- He looms over her. She reaches around for anything to defend herself. Nothing there. Game over --
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't some satanic pact, society didn't make us do it. But I believe given the proper circumstances a person is capable of anything -- certainly in my line of work you see it day in, day out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell you what, keep the shirt. The bra will do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miranda stares, helpless. The Sheriff gestures for her to begin. Like he has all the time in the world. Miranda slides up the wall and starts to unclasp her bra under her shirt. Petrified --
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chin up, Doctor. You wanted to get to the bottom of this and you did. You followed it all the way through. This is how it ends.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
His demeanor and voice are eerily calm, as if in a trance. He takes the bra from her hand and hangs it around her neck, as if helping somebody with their tie. She takes a step back and finds herself pinned against the wall --
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doug settled down once you two got married. New start and all that. Wanted nothing to do with this runaway I'd found, Tracy Seaver --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He squeezes the bra tightly around her throat, choking her. She stares straight into his eyes -- her whole body simultaneously frozen in place and shaking uncontrollably --
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or so he claimed. Because the truth, Doc -- is people never change. The son of a bitch couldn't resist. I asked him to dump the body and instead he went found some barn to work her out of his system some more. Go fucking figure.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And now we PAN DOWN TO see Miranda's left hand ever so slowly reach for his holster...
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't count on anyone, even friends you've had your whole life.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They're so close together their noses nearly touch. He gazes into her eyes, watching life drain out of her. He applies one final burst of pressure, stretching her skin to the point of no return --
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The only soul you can ever count on is yourself --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
BLAM! A GUNSHOT rings out and half his ear explodes in a gush of blood. He stumbles back, still on his feet, dazed. He looks up at Miranda with the gun trained on him. Struggling to catch her breath. A faint smile forms on his lips, somehow appreciative of this turn of events.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, Doctor. That was unexpected.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He steps forward, almost playfully. She slowly shakes her head. Wraps her fingers tightly around the trigger --
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure about this?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at her. Blood flowing from the side of his head. He's now standing directly in front of Miranda's open cell, weighing his options at triple speed --
</DIRECTION>
<SHERIFF_RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You need me alive for your story to stick. Be logical now. You know you can't kill me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He takes exactly half a step forward when Miranda drills a BULLET through his forehead. Sheriff Ryan splays backwards and lands with a crash.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Logic is overrated.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door to Tracy's room is closed. WE FIND Pete where we left him, by the soda machine, fighting to stay awake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING TOWARD him, we COME TO REST ON the back of his neck. So TIGHT we can actually see the hairs on the back of his neck. And as he feels the SWOOSH of a cold whisper, they stand up on their ends.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pete turns to Tracy's room to notice that the door is now open. Strange. He stands up and walks to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. RECOVERY ROOM #1
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pete looks oddly around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<PETE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anybody in here -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As he turns, we REVEAL Rachel slipping out of the room. Unseen by him, of course. Pete starts to exit when Tracy opens her eyes. Groggily waking as if from a dream.

Turlington raps on the Sheriff's door and opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER_TURLINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheriff Ryan?
	</DIALOGUE>

No sight of the man. That's odd. Maybe he's in the bathroom. Turlington heads in that direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MEN'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

<DIRECTION>
Turlington peeks in. checks the stalls.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER_TURLINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sheriff?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Nobody. He notices the back window is open because raindrops are blown in by the wind. He looks out to the parking lot for a moment before shutting it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

The FRONT DESK OFFICER is trying to hold back a grim Pete, Parsons and Teddy Howard from heading to the back area.

	</DIALOGUE>
<OFFICER_TURLINGTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know full well you're not allowed to see --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Teddy Howard slaps an official-looking document on him.
</DIRECTION>
<TEDDY_HOWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's straight from Judge Wilkinson. Take us to her cell.
	</DIALOGUE>
<FRONT_DESK_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better get the Sheriff out here.

Turlington looks over the paperwork, confused.

	Sheriff Ryan isn't here. His car is gone too.

<PARSONS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Officer, unlock the goddamn door to Miranda's cell or I'll break it down myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Turlington is not used to being spoken to this way, certainly not by upstanding directors of psychiatric institutes. He leads the men down the corridor and unlocks the cell. The men wait as all three locks are dutifully undone and then the heavy door is slid open. The men look inside and instantly stop in their tracks.

A healthier, much happier-looking Chloe shakes Pete's hand at the front steps. Small suitcase by her side.

	Thank you for everything, Dr. Graham. I'll never forget all you've done for me.

	It's been my pleasure, Miss McGrath. Good luck out there.

Chloe smiles. Awkward. Her first day out in the real world.
</DIRECTION>
<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I guess this is it. I hope not to see you again unless it's for coffee or something.

<PETE>

	Hey, you never know. It's a small world, unless you have to clean it.

Chloe picks up her bag, climbs down the steps to her cab. Stops midway, turns:

<CHLOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to tell me if you don't want to, but -- have you ever heard anything from -- ?

Pete shakes his head. Chloe nods, climbs inside the cab. Pete waves as it drives off. Then he pulls out a postcard from his pocket. It has a New York City postmark.

	Dear Pete. Hope this finds you on both feet, preferably having been promoted to director after Phil's retirement. Not that you had much competition, but a big hug to you anyway...

I wish I could personally thank certain people for their convincing testimonies in the case.
