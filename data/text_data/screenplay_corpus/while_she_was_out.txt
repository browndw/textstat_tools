:SC: MAP GRIDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the pages of a Thomas guide converge, overlap and re- configure across the screen. The endlessly ironic names of American suburbs parade before us, their violet territories marching forward like a bruise into dark green patches of forest and wilderness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Closer in on one last map grid which fades into a transparency of itself overlaid across the actual location of the suburb. The name of this housing development is "Pleasant Valley". The transparency fades out to reveal:

<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. PLEASANT VALLEY BOULEVARD - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From a sign reading "Pleasant Valley Dream Homes", a picture postcard boulevard of mini mansions curves into infinity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Each home is brand new. Each has the same size lawn, the same shrubs, the same satellite dish. Each has an indistinguishable car parked in the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the homes have Christmas decorations, Christmas trees with baubles, lights and Christmas stars sitting proudly at the top. The doors have Christmas wreaths.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sheen of a recent rainfall makes all the surfaces glimmer in the lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We halt outside one house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DELLAS'S HOUSE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This home too seems perfect until we notice the Christmas star has fallen from the top of the tree and lies reflecting itself in a puddle on the wet lawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly we hear the sound of wings fluttering and see an owl among the branches of the Christmas tree. It rises from the tree then swoops down to the lawn where it sweeps a mouse from the grass. The owl then soars off, casting a magnified shadow of her wings across the house, and disappears with it's prey into the woods behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Curtains part at a downstairs window. The silhouette of a man appears bathed in the blue glow of a computer screen. He draws the curtains once again and disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. DELLA'S HOUSE/ KENNETH'S MEDIA ROOM - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We sneak between curtain and window ledge into a home office fitted out with a flat screen TV and a computer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KENNETH, a forty something ex-jock with a once handsome face, pours a beer into a crystal brandy glass. Kenneth's eyes are glued to the computer screen where stock numbers scroll endlessly down. He highlights a set of numbers and stands up abruptly from his chair elated.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
Steps back onto a A CHILD'S DOLL, crushing it underfoot. His ebullient mood changes quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn! DELLA!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of footsteps are followed by the door opening. DELLA peers into the room. She's a diminutive blonde in her thirties with fine features and a fading Southern accent. She's pulling a coat on over a white shirt and jeans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sees the broken doll.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SHOOT, KENNETH! That's Tammi's favorite doll.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
She walks in, picks up the doll and tries to fix its squashed face. He turns back to the computer guiltily, takes a sip of beer.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should just swear properly and get it over with. Do you think the kids don't know what you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
Close up, his face is ruddy - the face of someone who drinks too much. He turns back towards her. She ignores him, continues to try fix the doll. His eyes linger on her coat.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNETH>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Going out again? What is it tonight? Auto Mechanics for Dummies? The bored housewives' reading group?

Kenneth clearly thinks he's funny. Della glares a warning at him and bites her lip to stop a vitriolic response escaping from her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to the mall for wrapping paper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
A trail of kids mess in the hallway behind Della catches Kenneth's eye.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you do all day, Della honey? Cause it sure isn't keeping house. This place is an eyesore. I'm mortgaged up to the eyeballs for this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
His sad eyes meet hers in confrontation. Della, determined not to engage, averts hers. Kenneth, unable to contain himself, faces her.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean it's not like you're at some salon fancying up your hair or nails like the other men's wives.

He lifts a strand of her limp fair hair and lets it drop, looks right in her tired face.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The last time I saw you wearing something sexy was our engagement party. God, Della, you used to be hot!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
She bites her lip again, but this time to try stop the tears. He turns away, in an attempt to conceal his own sadness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks away clutching the doll.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put the twins to bed by eight. Give them a chocolate cookie with their milk.

</DELLA>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, Della. Della honey, I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
But she's already left the room. He watches her pick up a set of car keys from a dresser in the dimly lit hallway. Her knuckles are white as she clenches her fingers around them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenneth turns back to his computer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. STAIRS - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della climbs the stairs. Framed photographs on the wall tell the public story of her life. The engagement to Kenneth, their wedding, the birth of the twins, Kenneth's graduation, Kenneth as a sixth grade football star, Della on the farm in Ohio with her horse, a really young Della playing baseball with her father. We linger on a photo of a very pretty twenty something Della in a little black dress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. THE TWINS BEDROOM - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TERRI and TAMMI are seven year old twins with the delicate blue eyed blonde looks of their Mother.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della stands in the doorway and watches them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tammi is lying on her girlish bed drawing with crayons. Terri's toy dinosaurs are destroying Tammi's heirloom dolls house, starting with the furniture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She steps into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<TAMMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mommy can I get an American Girl for Christmas?

</TAMMI>
<TERRI>

</TERRI>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You better leave Santa a note. It's only three days until Christmas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
She gives them each a kiss, breathing in their scent she loves so much.
</DIRECTION>
<TAMMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you going, Mommy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAMMI>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Mall. One chocolate cookie each and then Daddy will read you a bedtime story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<TAMMI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy's stories are lame. I want you to read us a story.

<TERRI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah Mommy, the one about the pirates.

	No, the cowgirls. Diamond Lil and Slingshot Kitty.

</TAMMI>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tomorrow night I'll read you the best bedtime story in the whole world. I promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>

Della gives them a little wave and turns to leave.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To make sure you're sleeping.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles. Terri's already turned back to his dinosaurs. Tammi runs toward her and gives her the drawing she's been working on. It's a drawing of a stick figure family holding hands. The words "Mommy, we love you" are written across a cloudy night sky like big stars.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Tammi, it's wonderful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
Della doesn't have time to look at it properly so she folds the drawing up and puts it in her pocket. She kisses Tammi again and turns to leave. Tammi's eyes follow her mother as she walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. STAIRWAY - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della checks her watch and hurries down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HALLWAY - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sits on the bottom stair to pull on a pair of boots. The boots are well worn but polished to a gleam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind her, an antique grandfather clock strikes seven p.m. The sound of gun shots fades in from the TV in Kenneth's office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. KITCHEN - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della collects a packet of cookies from a cabinet. She looks at the pile of dirty dinner dishes in the sink then looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. STAIRWAY - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della leaves the cookies at the bottom of the stairs and opens the front door. The TV blares out some action flick from Kenneth's ajar door.

TITLE --- "WHILE SHE WAS OUT"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DELLA'S HOUSE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della is met by a blast of cold evening air and the eerie silence of the suburbs. She closes the door softly behind her and rushes along the path to the driveway where the family's black Ford Explorer is parked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She CHIRPS the remote and quickly climbs in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della inserts the key and turns it in the lock. The car sputters in defiance against the cold night.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frick!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
The car sputters again.

	C'MON...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
With a massive exertion, the car engine turns over and the vehicle starts. She sighs with relief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns the heat up high and warms her hands at the vent, pauses to look at her home through the car window. For a second, in an upstairs window, she sees a reflection of Tammi.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles, then looks at the house and lawn and the Christmas tree. She notices the fallen star, is about to get out of the car to retrieve it, but decides it's too cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shadow creeps across her face as she pulls the stick into reverse and backs up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. PLEASANT VALLEY BOULEVARD - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow her as she backs up, pushes into drive and heads slowly down the boulevard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The road is empty. All the cars are neatly tucked away in their driveways and it looks like no one's out tonight. She makes a right turn onto.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. PLEASANT VALLEY CRESCENT - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She follows the road as it curves around a long row of endlessly monotonous houses. In the distance, we can see the gates of Pleasant valley gated community.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She slows down, rolls down her window and swipes a chub card against the security panel. The gates slowly open. She drives through. The gates close behind her. She rolls the window up and makes a left turn onto.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. PLEASANT VALLEY DRIVE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The road is wider and framed on either side by the high walls of gated communities. A Ford Explorer just like hers passes in the opposite direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della smiles mysteriously, reaches into the glove compartment with her free hand. She pushes aside a bunch of car papers, a flare, pulls out a check wallet hidden underneath - her secret hiding place for:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A nice pack of Marlboros. She smiles again - the smile of the secret smoker. She presses the cigarette lighter into the dashboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lighter pops out. She tips out a cigarette, sees a sticky note attached to the interior foil. Scrawled in messy handwriting are the words - YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE QUITTING DELLA HONEY. XOXO KENNETH.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get right on that Kenneth honey. AFTER you stop drinking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
She rips the note off, stuffs it in her purse, lights the cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She inhales deeply. We see the pleasure written across her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. PLEASANT VALLEY DRIVE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few cars pass Della in the night. Their lights are like torches in the suburban wilderness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FORD EXPLORER/ EXT. PLEASANT VALLEY DRIVE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is the familiar ring of a cellular phone. Della has programmed one of those "oh so cute" recognizable tunes into it, like the "William Tell overture".

Della holds the wheel with one hand and fumbles through her purse with the other. She eventually locates the phone.

	Well, with the way you flaunt your double D boob job at the free fun PTA events that's hardly a surprise.

Della stops at the red light. She clicks off the phone and lets it lay on her lap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She rakes about among a bunch of kids stuff in the back seat, casts aside, an anorak, mittens, a sock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She finds what she's looking for, a bottle of water, caught on the bar under the passenger seat. It's only a third full but she takes a sip, recoils from its coldness.

Waiting for the light at the opposite side of the road from Della is a car with an animal cadaver strapped to the roof.

She turns on the radio again, finds a station playing "The Sound of Silence".

Della lets it drop onto her lap. She opens the window and flicks out the remains of her cigarette. She waves her hands to fan away the smoke. She closes the window again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's about to hide her cigarettes again when she changes her mind and stuffs them directly into her purse.

As the car approaches the cusp of the hill she slows down to stare ahead.

:SC: EXT. MALL PARKING LOT/INT. FORD - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The road spits her out in front of the Mall entrance where revellers and shoppers are entering and exiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della follows several cars down the first long row of parked cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The asphalt is wet from the recent rainfall. Puddles gather in its dents and hollows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She passes car after densely parked car. There isn't a space in sight. She reaches the end of the row and indicates left, turns down the next row, ploughs through a rain puddle which splashes up onto a MOTHER who's walking her little GIRL and BOY back to their car. The woman shouts at Della.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>

Della rolls down her window.

The Mother's weighed down with shopping bags. She glares at Della and drags her kids across the aisle in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della sighs, drives down the second aisle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An Escape midway down the row blocks traffic. It's waiting for a Subaru to pull out so it can take the spot.

Della continues her journey down to the end of the row. There are no spaces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

It dawns on her that parking up close to the entrance just isn't going to happen. She takes the last puff from the cigarette burning out in the ashtray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Using the side aisle she scoots past row three and four as they all flow one way.

At the end of this row a confrontation is brewing. Several cars block each other. Horns blast. An angry DRIVER screams at another.

<DIRECTION>
Della looks on for a moment at the confrontation. She grinds out the stub of her cigarette into the ashtray, slams it closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della shakes her head and turns left into row five. Jesus! Are there really this many cars in Pleasant Valley? It's a brand new Mall and the only one around for miles but this is ridiculous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della reaches the end of row five quickly. She guessed there wouldn't be a spot so she's driving faster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She notices a portly middle aged RENT-A-COP directing traffic ahead. She lowers her window.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?

At the end of this row, Della decides to take the Rent-A- Cop's advice. She makes another left at the aisle and skips several more rows. She heads down to the third from last row.

	Yes!

She guns the engine, gets ready to pull in and is DENIED.

She brakes in the nick of time and sighs deeply. She's starting to lose her patience now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With no options left, Della heads down to the very last row. More cars fill the spaces. And then - two spots. The last two spots in the car park. They overlook undeveloped land just beyond the mall. Small concrete bumps signify the end of each space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della whips the car into the first one. She sighs with relief as she straightens the car up into the spot. She sits for a second trying to calm herself down but it isn't working. She reaches for another cigarette, then, talks herself out of it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She fastens her coat, grabs her purse and opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Steps down from the Ford right into a puddle. The dirty water splashes up onto her pants.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GREAT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes the boot off and looks over at the mall. It's at least a half mile away, glimmering in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sets off marching across the lot, taking what seems to be the most direct route. Maybe she can shake off this mood by the time she gets inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She passes the Plymouth, turns, stares back at it. The car is dirty gold and riddled with rust holes with a vinyl roof that's almost peeled away. She walks up close, tries to decipher the plate, but it's caked with mud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Annoyance rises like bile in her throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She finds herself reaching into her purse, rummaging for a small notebook, then a sharpie. She leans on the car as she writes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEAR JERK, IT'S GREAT YOU COULD USE UP TWO PARKING SPACES ON A NIGHT LIKE THIS. EVER HEAR OF THE JOY OF SHARING? SIGNED, A CONCERNED FRIEND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She scans her words. Pretty good!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della rips the piece of paper from the notebook, folds the note several times and slides it under the Plymouth's windshield wipers. The driver can't miss it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles. That felt good!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Head held high she marches on towards the Mall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA pulls up so we can see the mall, see Della marching across the lot, see the crowds of shoppers entering and exiting the mall, and get the feeling that maybe somebody just saw her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MALL ENTRANCE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shoppers are buying freshly felled Christmas trees from a vendor. Della squeezes past and pushes through the mall doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MALL - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wave of heat and Christmas lights hits Della. A wave of nausea follows as she is swallowed by the crowd of last minute shoppers. Distorted muzak versions of Christmas songs seep from invisible speakers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della gets caught up in a line of children waiting to see Santa in his grotto. She squeezes through and makes her way towards the fountain outside of Victoria's Secret.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
En route she is stopped by a perfume sales lady who sprays her wrist with perfume before she has time to protest.
</DIRECTION>
<PERFUME_SALES_LADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a classic revival of Chanel No.5. We have a wonderful Christmas Special on offer at Macy's.

She hands Della a sample and flyer.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
Della arrives at the fountain. A piddling jet of dirty water gurgles from the mouth of a bored mermaid and streams down into the shallow pool full of nickels and dimes. She scans the crowd but there's no sign of Cassie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della sits at the edge of the fountain. She checks her watch then checks out the people milling around in front of Victoria's Secret, where mannequins in skimpy festive underwear are propped seductively in the window displays.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still no sign of Cassie. She's about to make a wish and throw a quarter into the fountain when a Red Cross worker shakes her "Save the Children" tin at her. Della sticks the quarter into the tin instead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. VICTORIA'S SECRET - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della wanders the aisles of festive colored undies watching men pick out slinky lingerie for their partners and women examine slim fit underpants and padded bras.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She notices a pure silk black teddy, very classic, no frills. She lifts it from the rail and holds it against herself in front of the mirror, tries to imagine herself in it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A young SALES ASSISTANT approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<SALES_ASSISTANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's pure silk, the last one in our classic black label collection. Would you like me to fix you a changing room?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SALES_ASSISTANT>
<DIRECTION>
Della checks the size tag. It reads 36C, two sizes too big. And the price tag next to it. Ouch! It's expensive for Victoria's Secret.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thanks. Not my size.

She gestures to her small boobs, smiles and hands the teddy to the sales assistant. She quickly leaves the shop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Della checks one last time at the fountain for Cassie. She tries to dodge the crowd as she makes her way toward a generic coffee shop. Maybe Cassie will be there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. COFFEE SHOP - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Harried women and a few men, clutching bags full of gifts and impatient children, stand on line for their favorite drug.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della squeezes past them to look for Cassie. Every seat at every booth is full but there's no sign of her friend.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della joins the line. She finds herself biting at her nails, a bad habit since childhood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A woman in front of her places an order then moves on to the pick up area. Della moves up to the counter to where an OVERWEIGHT SALES ASSISTANT waits on her.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>

She passes a hair salon and presses her face to the steamy windows. Inside, women are getting their hair styled and their nails manicured at the same time.

:SC: INT. PHARMACY - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della enters a pharmacy. She locates the wrapping paper aisle. She sweeps up a bunch of rolls at three for ninety nine cents. She feels the texture of the paper, it's thin and looks gaudy so she puts them all back. Instead she selects some expensive gold paper with silver embossed stars and matching silver ribbon. She then finds some jolly children's wrapping with Christmas tree designs and a great big red bow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She browses through the aisles of cards. She sees some cute cards for the twins and then arrives at the "To my Darling Husband at Christmas" section. She opens some of the cards and recoils from the sentiments contained inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She catches a groomed BLONDE HOUSEWIFE staring at her and corrects her facial expression from one of revulsion to a complicit Stepford smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a pity they don't have any "To a bastard at Christmas" cards.

The woman looks at Della like she's a lunatic. Della chuckles to herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She finds the feminine hygiene aisle and picks up a pack of regular tampax.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gathers her stuff and carries it to the checkout where a TIRED MAN and his TWO KIDS wait before her on the line.

The man tries to remove a snow globe, with a tiny house and Christmas tree inside, from the clutches of his young son. The child starts bawling. The man ends up buying the snow globe to placate the child.

Della's hands start to pinch with the cold.

She gathers her bags of wrapping paper and sets off across the emptying lot. The last of the shoppers rush across the car park to find their cars. It's pretty dark between the dim pole lamps and the car lights.
</DIRECTION>

She slows down at the second aisle for a car to pass, then another. Marches on.

She stops for a split second. Then approaches. Glances at the windshield. The note is gone.

<DIRECTION>
Maybe it fell off. She checks the ground around the car. No sign of it. She shrugs, who cares anyway?

She rests the cigarette in the ashtray while she releases the hand brake and slips the gear into reverse. The interior of her car is suddenly flooded with light from another car's headlights. She glances in the rear view mirror. A car is blocking her.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good Lord! What now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
She steps on the brake and waits for the car to move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But it doesn't. Its headlights flick to full beam blinding her view in her car mirrors. She honks her horn. The car still doesn't move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della's really angry now. She slips the gearshift into park and steps out of her car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della squints in the blinding headlights. The front of the car looks familiar. It's the gold Plymouth!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two unseen car doors click open and clunk shut again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights abruptly go out. Della blinks, her eyes try to adjust to the dim mercury illumination from a pole lamp a few car lengths away.

<DIRECTION>
She uneasily turns back to her car.

The words are emphasized by another boy's shrill giggling. Della freezes. This can't be happening!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes are adjusting. The glare phantoms drift out to the limit of her peripheral vision and vanish.

She sees three boys in front of her, then a fourth, but she doesn't see any gun.

HUEY is a sweet-faced African-American decked out in a hip hop style. He's small and skinny and can't be more than eighteen. He's playing to CHUCKIE who's twenty-one and looks like a marine gone AWOL. Bracketing them is VINH, a nineteen year old Asian punk and TOMAS, twenty, a Latino runaway in an American Idol T-shirt.

</RENT_A_COP>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone turns to see a Rent-a-Cop, puffed up like a pigeon in his fur trimmed jacket and Russian style cap. It's the same guy Della approached earlier when she was looking for spaces except this time his hand is laying casually across the unsnapped holster flap at his hip.

Chuckie smiles and nudges Tomas who starts dancing in a real mocking manner imitating the Rent-a-Cop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chuckie pulls a gun from deep in his army jacket pocket and points it straight at the Rent-a-Cop's face.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah. We not in the mood.

Chuckie looks at his friends for approval. Huey laughs again, shrill. Tomas grins. Vinh hunches and looks around.

Chuckie grins at Della while keeping the gun pointed straight at the Rent-a-Cop.

<CHUCKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These Rent-a-Pig companies are too lame to give their foot soldiers any ammo. Liability laws and all that. Tough shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCKIE>
<DIRECTION>
The Rent-a-Cop goes for his pistol anyway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chuckie shoots him in the face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THIS MOMENT CHANGES EVERYTHING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We thought Della was in trouble but now we know she is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bullet hits the Rent-A-Cop in the forehead. Blood spurts from the exit wound. He slumps to the asphalt like a marionette whose strings have just been cut. Bullet smoke hangs in the air where he once stood. Smoke too blackens the bullets entry wound. Blood puddles out from the back of his head.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCKIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

It's clear that Chuckie's been acting harder than he is. The hand that holds the gun is trembling. The color drains from his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All stand riveted in shock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A deathly silence follows. The carol singers can be heard in the distance faintly finishing up Silent Night.

<DIRECTION>
Chuckie looks to his friends for support but none is forthcoming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Rent-A-Cop's body twitches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chuckie hesitates then raises the gun. He aims and fires. The shot shatters the top of the Rent-A-Cop's head. Chuckie flinches, closes his own eyes in reflex.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della swallows. If she started screaming now, she may never stop. She spins instead and makes for her car door. She's dead if she doesn't get out of here and she knows it.
</DIRECTION>
<VINH>

	She's busting a move!

Chuckie looks over and sees Della disappear through the door of her Explorer. Agitation overwhelms him.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She ain't going nowhere. We got her Ford blocked in, right?

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della flinches but no bullet tears through the back of her skull. She slams into the driver's seat and punches the door lock switch. She hits the four wheel drive button and presses the accelerator pedal to the metal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Explorer barely protests as its front tires claw and bounce over the six inch concrete row barrier. The barrier screeches along the underside of the frame. There is a loud SCRAAAAAPE noise as the car heaves over the barrier. Then, the rear wheels bounce and claw over. The car fishtails momentarily.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please God. Don't overcorrect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
She releases the pressure on the accelerator. The Explorer straightens.

Vinh tugs at Chuckie's sleeve.

But Chuckie's staring at the bloody mess he made, with a faraway look in his eyes, like he's disassociating.

Vinh throws down the stub of his cigarette, follows Tomas into the Plymouth. Tomas guns the engine.

Tomas shuffles over to the passenger seat. Chuckie climbs into driver side. Doors slam. The Plymouth screeches across the parking lot and exits onto the service road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. SERVICE ROAD - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della speeds down the long dark empty service road which skims the deserted warehouses at the back of the Mall. Between the warehouses are dark patches of undeveloped land - No Mans land.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not a car nor a person in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It starts to rain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes the cell phone trying to revive its dead battery. Types 911 in anyway. No connection. No response. She shakes it some more. Gives up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She relentlessly checks the rearview and side mirrors as she races into the rainy night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The driving conditions are not good, poor visibility ahead. Too bad. She speeds anyway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The road has to connect to a main road soon!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another glance in the rearview. Nothing. Side mirror. Still clear. Once more in the rearview. Headlights!
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
Side mirror. It's the Plymouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She presses the accelerator down harder. The engine revs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the rearview there's a sudden flash above her rear left headlight. And another.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
They're shooting at her!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della steps the accelerator to the floor praying the Explorer won't skid out. The engine struggles, catches up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sudden speed causes a small silver love heart, hanging on a silver chain necklace from the rearview mirror, to crash against the window. The catch bursts open to reveal two tiny photos of the twins inside. The necklace flies back and forth against the window as the Explorer races onwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. SERVICE ROAD - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Plymouth accelerates behind blasting rap. Its thick tires plow along the wet asphalt, gripping to the road below in steady pursuit. Its windows are all steamed up. The front passenger window is open, a hand and a gun muzzle stick through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another flash and Della's left side mirror shatters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She swerves in panic. Her car almost hits the ditch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This can't be happening. Not to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reclaims the steering wheel. Straightens up. Hits the accelerator again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. SERVICE ROAD - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Plymouth swerves behind on the skid that Della created, corrects itself just before the ditch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della gains speed. The Plymouth lags.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A stop sign appears ahead. The road's ending.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Right or left, Della? Make a choice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. SERVICE ROAD - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is no choice. A barrier blocks the left hand turn. A big sign reads "LOT FULL".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. EMPTY HOUSING ESTATE ROAD - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della swings right instead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The streetlights recede behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. EMPTY HOUSING ESTATE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing but the darkness of a housing complex under construction ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But she seems to have shaken off her pursuers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She speeds down the road, looking intently for any sign of life. But there's nothing but half-built houses, empty houses, houses just like hers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. SEVEN ELEVEN MINI MALL - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Seven Eleven sign appears. She slows down. But it may as well be a mirage, it's an unfinished building with only the sign, in an unfinished mini-mall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close to screaming now she speeds up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. EMPTY HOUSING ESTATE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More empty houses in varying stages of construction. No sign of life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. FILLING STATION - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, what looks like a filling station, one light on in the kiosk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hope. She pulls in and dims her lights, drives right up to the kiosk door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hope dashed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. FILLING STATION - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's in its final stages of installation but definitely not functioning. And there's no one there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. EMPTY HOUSING ESTATE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back onto the road and she sees far behind her, car headlights that can only belong to the Plymouth, following her through the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She dims her lights to just the side lights. Hurtles along the dark road which is getting rougher and rougher. Potholes filled with mud and rain water splash against the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her wipers struggle to cope. She can hardly see through the front window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ROUGH ROAD - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The potholes yawn deeper. The asphalt ends. Gravel deteriorates to dirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She steers the Ford blindly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ROUGH ROAD - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wooden barrier with reflective stripes looms suddenly ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She guns the engine and ducks sideways as her car PLOWS into the barrier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a sickening crack as shattered windshield sprays around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Explorer SLAMS through and VEERS towards a clump of trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della tries to sit upright but the auto's spinning too fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car swings, then CRASHES right into a Pine tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Car stalls out. SILENCE. A prolonged moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Della crawls out from under the dashboard, sweeping pine needles and glass from her hair. She reaches up and hits the light switch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pine branches protrude through the broken windshield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Using the sleeve of her coat she sweeps broken glass from the driver's seat and sits down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She slides the gear into park, turns the key. The engine groans like a dying animal, then gives up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a deep breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tries again. The engine groans again, another death rattle. It just won't catch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She switches off the interior light and pushes the driver door open. She steps out of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She closes the door behind her so's not to trigger the light switch. Finds her legs are giddy. Holds onto the door frame for a moment to steady herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It looks like she's crashed at the very end of the housing development - where it cuts like a knife edge into an old forest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dirt road stretches ahead beyond the barrier, into the midst of the forest. Behind her, shrouded in darkness, houses in different stages of development dot the deforested landscape. Land moving trucks sit on recently flattened land, waiting to tear into the next layer of forest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Patches of leftover snow and puddles of rain catch the light from the moon which hides in an overcast sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jesus! She's driven all the way from the Mall only to find herself in the middle of nowhere with a bunch of psychopaths on her tail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This must be some sick joke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Speaking of which, where are these little bastards? Her eyes scan the darkness for a sign. Nothing. That doesn't mean they're not close by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She checks out the damage to the car by feel. The driver's side is scratched and dented. The front is wedged into the tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The only way out is for her to back up the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She climbs back in for another try.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della turns the key. It barely even groans this time. Just a faint gurgle. Then gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She rifles in the glove compartment and pulls out the flare, sticks it in her pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She leans under the dash and manually pops the trunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della runs outside to the back of the car and feels about in the trunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She throws carrier bags full of wrapping paper to the side as she searches. Pulls out a lug wrench from underneath and then a small tool box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hears the screech of a car's wheels spinning in mud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ROUGH ROAD - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della turns to see headlights in the distance on the road behind, pointing upwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>

</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
The Plymouth must have skidded and got stuck in the mud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. EDGE OF WOODS - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She closes the trunk softly then runs to the front of the car, clutching the toolbox and the wrench. She reaches back into the car and unlatches the hood from underneath the dash. Pop. She softly closes the door again. Punches her way through the branches. Slides her fingers under the hood, pries up the lever. It pops up only a few inches.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn!

She tries to manually lift it. But it's heavy with the weight of pine branches.

Della frantically sweeps pine branches and cones from the hood. But some larger branches are jammed, wedged by the broken tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she looks back over for the boys she sees the car headlights are off and there's no sign of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stands stock still, listening, scanning the landscape for a sign of them.

The sound of glass shattering breaks the silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della jumps out of her skin, spins around. Her eyes settle on a light in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ROUGH ROAD - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light illuminates the small cabin of an earth moving truck. The cabin glows like a box in the darkness. There's a figure inside: it's Chuckie. He's inspecting a powerful construction flashlight. He switches settings from broad light to concentrated beam. He points the beam through the broken glass window onto Tomas, who's standing on a truck tyre knocking out the rest of the glass with his elbow. Chuckie leaps down through the broken window, pleased with his find.

He switches it to broad beam, whistles.

When there's enough distance between them and her, she darts from the forest's edge into the development and hides behind a half finished house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. UNFINISHED HOUSE 1 - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She leans against a recently bricked wall, finally takes a breath. The smell of fresh cement and putty fills her nostrils.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rain gathers and drips from a nearby ledge
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She peers around the side of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. EDGE OF WOODS/CONSTRUCTION SITE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beyond the rows of plots of land with their sold signs, she sees the boys still pacing and debating beside her Ford, illuminated by the sweeping light rays of their flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes drift across the landscape of house foundations and structures to the distant neon lights of the shopping mall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she looks back over for the boys, she sees that the flashlight and the boys are gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She strains her eyes. Guesses that must mean they're off looking for her in another direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She clutches the tool box and silently creeps between the houses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
If she could just track along the edge of the development she could maybe make it back to the Shopping Mall, to the twins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An owl hoots from the trees behind. She freezes, eyes sweeping the immediate area for danger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She waits a moment, silence, then makes her way once more between the edge of the development and the edge of the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's trying desperately not to make a sound, praying to be invisible, eyes darting around, evaluating every shape and form.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On one side the dense wood of trees, predominantly pine, with thick ancient trunks and tangled branches. On the other, plots and structures of homes to be.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She keeps trudging on, skirting the edge of the trees, following the lights in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hears a loud thudding noise. Stops. Stops breathing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. PLANKS IN TARP - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead, piles of planks wrapped in black tarp block her view.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She braces herself, peers cautiously around, sees nothing. She clutches the lug wrench and toolbox and steps forwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rain water from the branches of a nearby tree is dripping down and collecting in a puddle in the middle of the tarp causing the sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She breathes a sigh of relief.

She ducks down the side of a half finished house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sees that it is the shadow of an earth moving truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She keeps going, between the houses, looking for a sign of the mall lights.

She stops.

Just ahead, a flurry of footprints.

<DIRECTION>
They're her footprints!

And then she sees the flashlight sweeping towards her.

Della shrinks backwards between the houses. She ducks into an unfinished doorway and watches the boys pass ahead.

She runs into the house and out through the far side. Skirts a row of plots of land. Then, she hears Chuckie's mocking voice, echoing through the building site.

She makes for another window at the opposite end of the house. She sees the mall lights and decides to head once more towards them.

The wire drives through her coat and into her right shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She jerks away but the length of loose barbed wire follows. She bites her lip to prevent a pained response.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's caught in its spiral like a trapped animal. She spins around and physically pulls the wire from her back, tearing her coat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She casts the wire away from her. Winces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. UNFINISHED HOUSE 4 (FOUNDATION) -EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She crawls into the foundations of a nearby house, underneath the floorboards which are lain roughly across to form a first floor. She huddles in a dark corner. It's very quiet and cramped. She tries not to move, not to breathe. The smell of the wet earth underneath makes her feel nauseous. A moment passes. It feels like an infinity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to creep along towards a gap in the planks to see if she can see anything above. Just as she approaches the gap she hears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of footsteps above her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The footsteps make erratic rhythms across the planks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She silently undoes the catch of the toolbox. Her hands are shaking. She lifts the lid. She rakes around inside for tools, comes across several kids toys instead! In shock, she rakes around some more, trying to find something else, something more dangerous, anything. To her surprise the only tools inside are a pathetic little screwdriver and a small crescent wrench. The kids must have borrowed the other tools replacing them with the toys. She gives up, closes over the lid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then suddenly:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. UNFINISHED HOUSE 4 -EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The whole house is illuminated. She looks up to see four faces looking down at her. Chuckie points the gaze of a powerful flashlight directly into her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beam almost blinds her. She tries to look away but Chuckie focuses it right in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Peek a boo!

</CHUCKIE>
<DIRECTION>
She shrinks back towards the wall. Her mouth feels dry, so dry. Tomas lifts several planks up and casts them away so they can see her. She's cornered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chuckie then lowers the flashlights direction and sweeps it voyeuristically down across her body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light lingers on her breasts. Huey whistles appreciatively, picks the game back up from the parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<HUEY>

Tomas leans down towards Della. Chuckie moves the flashlight to illuminate them both. Tomas drains the last dregs from a bottle of Bud, tosses the empty bottle down into the foundations. It rolls into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della shudders. She clutches the lug wrench against her coat behind the tool box and tries to disappear into the wall.

Tomas reaches down and pulls Della up to standing by the coat collar. He then yanks the coat down over her shoulder. The white shirt she wears underneath is damp with sweat making the form of her breasts very clear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chuckie keeps the light focused right on her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tomas slides his index finger down across Della's neck towards her breasts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della claws at Tomas' face with the nails of her free hand. He staggers to the side holding his cheek and cursing. Her chewed nails haven't left any dents, but she stunned him.

Her hands move slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She rests the lug wrench in her left palm under the base of the tool box and with her right hand unsnaps the catch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She holds the far end of the lid up to shield her right hand from the beam as she slips it inside the box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A prayer plays silently across her lips as her fingers feel the cool steel and shape of the small crescent wrench.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She curls them around its handle and grips tight. A surge of nervous energy courses through her veins.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wrench flies up and across the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a CRUNCH, it catches Chuckie right in the collar bone, right side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He screams. Drops the flashlight. Drops to his knees holding his throat.

Della snaps the tool box shut and makes a run for it. She throws herself up onto the first floor and darts between Tomas and Huey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Huey lunges for her but trips over a loose plank, lands with his face down, biting on the plank's edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della catches a peripheral glimpse of Tomas leaping towards her, but his leading foot slams down instead onto the back of Huey's neck. Grinds Huey's face into the plank with a hideous THUD. Huey's neck SNAPS back smiley style. Huey's scream gurgles into the night. Huey's body falls through the space in the floorboards landing with a thud in the foundations below.

:SC: EXT. WOODS - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della runs for her life. She makes straight for the cover of the trees. She hesitates for just a moment after the first layer of Pines. It's pitch black beyond. Then she steps in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She follows her breath into the icy blackness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Branches and foliage scratch against her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She grapples about, looking for hiding places between the dark shapes and forms. Steps between tree roots and shrubs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes begin to adjust. She can now make out the difference between the clumps of darkness and tell, looking back, where the edge of the woods begins. A construction light shines behind like a distant moon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pushes between the branches of indistinguishable trees, some thick and knotted, others slight and brittle. Only the evergreens still have their foliage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking back constantly to the edge of the trees for a sign of the boys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fear drives her further into the woods towards where the trees grow even more densely together. Where there just may be the right place to hide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stops for a second to catch her breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The handle of the toolbox has chaffed her right palm. She changes hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
God, that boy Huey! He really died back there. She heard the sound of it. The horrific sound of him dying a stupid pointless death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It could have been her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There has to be some way out of this nightmare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead, a dead tree with spectral branches blocks her path. She steps around its huge trunk and tangle of roots.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DELLA!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCKIE>
<DIRECTION>
Chuckie's voice drifts towards her. She ducks down among the roots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes scan the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No moving shapes nor forms. No sound. No flashlight. Just shadowy clumps of trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Should she stay put or should she run?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she sees it. The flashlight weaving through the pines ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pushes further in among the roots, tries to make herself invisible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flashlight beam sweeps across the forest floor towards her. One set of footsteps crunches through the foilage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She holds still, terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flashlight pauses on the dead tree, the roots.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della stops breathing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, the light sweeps past and on into the woods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She waits until it disappears before stepping out of her hiding place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She creeps back in the opposite direction, figuring if they're in the woods now she should get out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes search for the construction light, which indicates the edge of the wood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She heads in the direction of the light, painfully aware that one noisy footfall could alert her pursuers. She steps between leaves and roots as delicately as a ballet dancer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The construction light grows closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light abruptly goes out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stops, eyes desperately searching the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She resumes in the direction she was headed. Tries to keep calm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the woods are impenetrable. Layers of trees and shrubs, and then more trees. Deep in the cold dark places there are patches of left over snow. She's losing her bearings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. X'D TREES - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead, the chilling sight of four luminous Xs glowing in the dark forest almost makes her heart stop. She realizes the crosses are painted on the trunks of several trees, marking them for death. She shivers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. WOODS -EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She backs up, starts off in the opposite direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And there it is again. The flashlight sweeping through the trees in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stops, close to screaming, then when the flashlight disappears, runs off in yet another direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She slows to take a breath, notices the butts of several cigarettes still smoking in the dirt close to her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
(muttering to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit! Oh Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
She trudges on, pushing between the branches, no clue where she is headed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The further she treads, the quieter it becomes. So quiet she can hear her own footfalls and the sound of the trees breathing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, she spots the light again, in the distance, shining out over the forest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thank God!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She trudges up a slope ahead, clinging onto branches and shrubs to help pull herself up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. LEDGE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light grows closer. She climbs up onto a ledge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A loud noise startles her. It's music. Rap music. Blasting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della pushes her way through to the edge of the trees. Sees....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. CLEARING - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woodland ahead slopes down into a clearing, where a huge ghetto blaster sits on a pile of felled trees. Young pines about to become Christmas trees. It's blasting out a hip hop anthem for a dead homie. A construction light illuminates the clearing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ghostly Vinh, head hung low, moves to the music, bottle of beer in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Propped up against a tree stump sits the body of Huey, arms crossed over his torso, hood pulled up to cover his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scene is so surreal that Della is drawn closer. She creeps along the edge of the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she moves, she kicks back on some dirt. It tumbles downhill into the gulch. She freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But nobody notices.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She slips invisibly between the trees and watches as Tomas enters the clearing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tomas stops and watches Vinh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vinh continues to get into the music in his solemn Japanese punk style. The juxtaposition between the hard core rap music and the serious vibe that Vinh is sending out shows us that this is really important music to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a theatrical tableau -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della overhead, looking down on the clearing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vinh transfixed by the music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tomas stone silent, watching Vinh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It plays out for a poignant moment. Like they're all part of some spiritual rite about to be consummated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vinh pours some beer onto the ground at Huey's feet. A small tear runs down his stoic face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then CLICK. The blaster is abruptly turned off by Chuckie who appears out of the shadows behind it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares a beat at Vinh like he can't believe what he's been seeing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vinh keeps on moving like he's in a trance.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCKIE>
<DIRECTION>
Vinh doesn't reply. Stares down at the ground, keeps on with his weird dance. Chuckie moves towards him. Tomas grabs Chuckie, tries to stop him from going for Vinh, but Chuckie shrugs him off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chuckie reaches out and shakes Vinh. No response. He shakes him again.

:SC: EXT. LEDGE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della's been watching the scene unfold, a captive audience, attentive and terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly she tears her eyes away from the boys. She backs away from the edge and right into the sharp branch of a big old tree. The branch digs into that point in her shoulder she hurt earlier on the barbed wire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches up to feel it and pulls her hand away bloody. She reaches into her coat pockets for a tissue. Nothing. Feels something in her pants pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls out not a tissue but a sheet of folded paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She unfolds it. It's Tammi's drawing. The one from the beginning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stick figure family holding hands and "Mommy - We love you" written in stars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della's lost in the drawing. Her eyes drink in every mark and color and word. She sees that the male figure is slightly separate. That the children stick figures have frightened eyes and cling to the female. That the sky is turbulent. The stars clear and bright. The words...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tear escapes from underneath her eyelid. Then another. A sob.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She might never see her kids again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another sob. She heaves with the release of emotion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More tears escape. Another sob. She tries to bite it back. Wills herself to stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finds that rage takes sorrow's place. Rage and self recrimination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Goddamit! She's gonna be raped and killed because of some stupid note! And God knows what will become of the kids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenneth always told her she had a temper. That she reacts without thinking of the consequences. This time the bastard was right.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks again at the picture.

Chuckie's voice booms out into the night.

Della edges further into the trees and disappears into the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's rustling in the darkness. Tomas pushes through the edge of the trees, making animal calls with his right hand curled around his mouth. The flashlight illuminates him from behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chuckie follows him operating the light in a mockery of classic noir style. Vinh slouches behind them.
</DIRECTION>

Tomas heads along the ledge, straight past the spot where Della stood only moments before. Tomas doubles back.

Thomas stops, sniffs.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chuckie sweeps the flashlight across the gulch looking for a sign of Della.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chuckie shifts his focus to climb down the steep slope. As the light sweeps back across the gulch we catch a glimpse of Della between some rocks at the far side. But the boys' eyes are elsewhere, focused on the steep incline ahead of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della quickly ducks, draws her toolbox in tight and crouches low between the rocks. She watches the boys carefully as they climb down the gulch.

There's the sound of a stumble followed by a splash.

Della needs to get out of there and fast.

They begin to ascend the rocks. Chuckie keeps the flashlight slightly ahead of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della crawls stealthily between and behind the rocks, keeping as low as she can. Dodging the approaching light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys crawl across and up and between the rocks with the dexterity of animals. Della's so low she's scraping her knees and hands to shreds.

She can see ahead where the rocks end and the trees begin. What was she thinking hiding here? It was too exposed.

Her hand grasps the last rock at the top of the gulch. She pushes the toolbox up on the ledge. Her strength is ebbing but she tries to hoist herself up. The flashlight sweeps by. She lets go of the ledge and ducks. The flashlight sweeps by again.

Tomas catches up with Della, chases her into the trees. Behind him Vinh hoists himself up over the ledge, then Chuckie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della runs. Faster than she's ever run before. Practically flies through the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her breath comes hard. His too, just behind her. Their footfalls crash into the foliage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's dark, so dark. She's running blindly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And they're right behind her. Tomas swipes at her. He just misses. He swipes again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A twisted shape looms ahead, almost blocks her path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She runs right up to it then darts left at the last moment, setting up Thomas who's right behind her.

Tomas runs into the stump of a big old tree trunk, hits himself at groin level. He doubles over in pain.

Thomas gathers himself together, picks up the chase.

Her adrenaline pumps hard. Eyes darting for a hiding place among the dark shapes and planes of the woods.

:SC: EXT. DEADWOOD PILE - EVENING

There it is, a deadwood pile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She throws herself down into its midst. The dried branches jag and tear at her hands and face. She burrows down low, so low she's right in the dirt. She peers between the branches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tomas's feet run by and disappear. She hears him circle the area then turn back towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment passes. She picks the next. Rises slowly and softly from between the jagged branches clutching the lug wrench.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then there he is. Diving out of the trees towards her.

<DIRECTION>
Della raises the lug wrench.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the clouded moonlight it's an almost biblical image: a woman rising from the brush wielding an iron black cross.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tomas crashes towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della swings the lug wrench, hard, intensely, directly at Tomas's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a THUD as the sharp arm of the lug wrench catches him up under the chin. It sends him reeling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He goes down face first.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della gasps in horror, watches as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tomas pulls himself up onto his feet, comes towards her once more.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della swings the lug wrench back and strikes him across the head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He spins, clutches at his head, then reaches towards her AGAIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She loses it. She swings the lug wrench towards him. All the years of pent up rage finally find their release.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wrench catches up under his nose with a sickening CRUNCH. It drives the cartilage up and into his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blood spurts from the wound. He staggers backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shocked scream escapes from Della's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Awwwrgh!

<DIRECTION>
Tomas crashes back into a tree. He loses consciousness. His body slumps slowly down the tree trunk to the dirt. Blood gushes from where the wrench meets his face. He looks like he's dressed for Halloween.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della just stares. Stares at Tomas, at what she did, what she had to do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tomas' eyes are wide open, staring too, at nothing, dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The horror of having killed someone overwhelms Della. She starts shaking with shock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vinh cries out for Tomas

Della tears herself away from Tomas's body and staggers into the deadwood to collect the toolbox. It glints, even in the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs it and runs for cover behind a tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind her in the near distance the chaotic sweeps of the flashlight illuminates Vinh and Chuckie as they march through the woods searching for Tomas.

<CHUCKIE>

	Tomas is one hard son of a bitch. He got her strung up from a tree by now and you know it.

Della flashes briefly into shot, running between the trees. The flashlight sweeps by.

<VINH>
	<DIALOGUE>

Chuckie walks towards Vinh. Vinh takes the flashlight from Chuckie and shines it towards a thick shape between three trees.

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It looks like a body.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINH>
<DIRECTION>
They close in on a muddle of shapes, bush and spidery tree trunks. The flashlight illuminates a tree trunk long and thick as a body.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a big old tree trunk, you paranoid gook.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCKIE>
<DIRECTION>
Chuckie tries to take the flashlight back from Vinh but Vinh won't give it. Chuckie doesn't persist. Vinh keeps going, shivering and blustering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vinh senses something. He shines the flashlight behind the tree trunk. Still nothing. Sweeps back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della darts between the evergreens behind them. She conceals herself in between the trunks and branches. Braces herself, waits for the right moments, the ones when they're not looking, to run between the trees. Cognizant enough to know they just want to find Tomas right now. She seems to be on autopilot, becoming numb as the minutes stretch on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She watches Vinh plod forward and through the brush. He hits every inch of it with the flashlight. Sighs. Doubles back to follow Chuckie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, the flashlight catches a glimpse of something. Sweeps back, illuminates Tomas's dead body, splayed out on the mud at the foot of the tree, eyes staring wide, bloody, ghastly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tomas's Catholic cross pendant glimmers in the flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence until Vinh falls to his knees in front of Tomas, tries to speak but only a whisper comes out.
</DIRECTION>
<VINH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tomas.....IYAH!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINH>
<DIRECTION>
Chuckie realizes from Vinh's demeanor that something really is wrong. He hesitates a moment, then rushes over to Vinh, stares too at Tomas's body, gulps back the desire to scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He punches his fist hard into the tree behind Tomas' body instead. A shower of pine needles rains down on them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chuckie grabs the flashlight and sweeps it away from the body, grabs Vinh's arm, grounding him.

<DIRECTION>
Vinh sobs and shakes.

Chuckie chokes up despite himself.

He stands up, brushes the pine needles off his tee shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He paces back and forth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls the gun out from deep in his jeans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della creeps between the trees behind them. She appears for a second or two, like a ghost, behind the next tree.

Chuckie defiantly fights back tears.

</CHUCKIE>
<DIRECTION>
She hears a faint gurgle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She slows, listens. It's the burble of a stream..
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She listens hard. Traces the sound. Treads towards it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There it is. Glistening, even in the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. STREAM THROUGH WOODS - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She steps between rocks, walks straight into the stream below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stands ankle deep in the icy water with her eyes closed clutching the toolbox.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water gurgles faintly below her, so cold it almost sounds like glass breaking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ghastly images of what just happened play out behind her eyes like an inerasable movie of the psyche to be remembered for all time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's talking to herself in a whisper.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.

	<DIALOGUE>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you, God?
	</DIALOGUE>

She falls to her knees in the stream. Holding herself and rocking. The freezing water seeps up into her clothes, her hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, I just want to see my babies again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
Her rocking slows until it stops. There's a loud crunch close by. She rises reflexively from the stream. Raises the toolbox. She looks around. A branch has broken from a tree and drags down into the stream behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This seems to bring her back to herself. She realizes it's only a matter of time before they come looking for her. She needs to get moving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sets off downstream. She trudges through the shallow water. Her wet coat drags heavily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stream must end somewhere, likely at the other edge of the woods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She trudges onwards, sweeping aside the branches of stooping trees, stepping around rocky obstacles in the stream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Forging ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She now needs to pee. GREAT. Her temper surges up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks for the right place to do it, realizes it's probably best to pee in the stream, so all trace of it will be dispersed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A leafless willow trails its dried up branches into the stream. She makes her way toward it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lays the toolbox down and disappears between the branches. We see glimpses of her lifting her coat, pulling down her pants, pushing the crotch of her underpants to the side. We hear her shiver and the faint tinkle of water meeting the stream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More glimpses of her pulling up her underpants and pants, smoothing down her coat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hoists her coat up again around her waist and picks up the toolbox.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She plows down stream once more. Longing to see the light that will tell her she's at the edge of the woods, closer to the mall lights, closer to home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She swallows another wave of grief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stream loops around ahead then splits into two. She follows it, picks the left fork.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then she hears it, the terrible sound of feet thundering down into the stream behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't even turn to see them. Just runs. Runs for her life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The glare of the flashlight blasts against her back. Freezing water splashes up her legs, soaking through her pants. Her feet slip and slide over wet rocks. But she keeps running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vinh's behind her. She can feel his breath, the swipe of his hands as he grabs for her and misses. She runs even faster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She leaps over tree trunks that cross the stream. They leap behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pushes through the hanging branches of several trees. Pushes them forward hard then lets them go as she passes, right into Vinh's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to duck but they hit him right in the eyes. He cries out, covers his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<VINH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aaaarrhh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINH>
<DIRECTION>
This buys her a moment or two to get ahead. The stream bends right ahead. She opts to stay in it. Chuckie leaps out, runs along the banks, hoping to outrun and trap her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the stream then bends left, giving her an advantage. He leaps back across the stream to the other side. But she's outrunning him. He charges back into the stream behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della keeps on running through the stream, somehow trusting its direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vinh catches up with Chuckie. The boys are maybe twenty-five feet behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHOT rings out. Then a bullet races past her ear. Lodges in a tree just ahead of her. She almost loses her footing. She'd forgotten for just a moment, that they had a gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another shot blasts off into the night, skims her shoulder, hits the muddy bank of the stream. She flinches, braces herself, keeps going, adrenalin pumping harder than ever.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stream winds around a bunch of rocks ahead. For just a moment she's invisible to them. She uses it. When she reaches the rocks, she dives out, ducking below the glare of Chuckie's flashlight, down behind the rocks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. EMBANKMENT - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She creeps up the muddy embankment hiding deep in the shadows of some wiry shrubs, as close to the mud as her back will allow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys stop by the rocks. Chuckie sweeps the flashlight up the muddy embankment, looking for a footprint, a sign of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to creep through the midst of the brush to avoid leaving prints. Tries to stay quiet as a mouse. Stops when she sees the flashlight sweep by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
If she can get to the top, she can make another run for it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All of a sudden, it grows dark. The boys must have switched the flashlight off or maybe the battery's dead. She listens hard for their footfalls. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. PINE TREE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sees that she is in the shadows of a big old Pine tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She creeps behind its massive gnarled trunk and silently slides open the toolbox, fumbles around for the screwdriver. She removes it from the box and grasps it tight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della rises slowly, remaining concealed behind the tree. She reaches up and softly places the toolbox deep in the junction of the first sturdy branch and the tree trunk. She pulls herself up onto the branch and edges in close to the trunk. She peeks between the branches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No sign of the boys. She pulls herself further up into the tree, branch by branch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The thin stiff outer branches, fringed with sharp little needles, fall like a jagged veil around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She waits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's high enough up to have a clear view of the landscape below despite the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She makes out the faint echo of voices, strains to hear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. STREAM THROUGH WOODS - EVENING

<DIRECTION>
Vinh and Chuckie are arguing in whispers. Vinh's pale and shivering hard.

Chuckie clicks the flashlight back on. Sweeps it up, across and back down the embankment to the stream, illuminating the banks.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She got to be hiding up on the slope? You head up first and I'll follow with the flashlight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCKIE>

The light sweeps past her. Della shrinks further into the branches of the tree. She crunches her foot against a branch. SHIT!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys freeze, then resume talking in whispers.

Vinh paces, braces himself to head up after Della.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. EMBANKMENT - EVENING

<DIRECTION>
Vinh starts to ascend the embankment.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the spirit gangsta. Holler if you see her and I'll shoot.

Vinh glares back at Chuckie.
</DIRECTION>
<VINH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Faito!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VINH>
<DIRECTION>
Della watches Vinh plough through the brush.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flashlight sweeps and darts with his movements, up ahead of him, up the embankment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vinh pushes through several trees, slips, regains his footing. He plods past the tree. She slips the screwdriver up her sleeve. Prays he won't stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls herself further up the tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sudden commotion of swaying branches startles her, followed by a shower of pine needles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her heart stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment later the sound of fluttering wings is followed by the squawking of angry birds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's disturbed a bird's nest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sees the silhouette of four large crows as they burst through the branches above and up into the patch of sky between.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crows circle the patch of sky above, like a Greek chorus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks back down for a sign of Vingh. Sees nothing. Inches along a branch to see better.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light sweeps back and up through the trees into her eye line, disorienting her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hears footfalls so close by they must be under the tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes have barely readjusted when she sees him: Vinh standing under the tree scanning the area for a sign of her. She stares down at him, frozen, holding her breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flashlight illuminates the whole tree, then sweeps away up the embankment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Vinh's seen something. He makes out her footprints under the tree. He leans down to check, then rises, looks up through the branches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes meet. He opens his mouth to shout for Chuckie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She LEAPS down through the branches. Lands THUD on his back.

Vinh topples to the mud, dragging Della with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They roll as he desperately tries to disengage her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flashlight frantically searches the area for them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della frees the screwdriver she'd stuffed up her sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She DRIVES the screw driver up into the base of Vinh's skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vinh screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She thrusts and twists the tool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the while she's tightly wound around him, intertwined, intimate as a lover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She drives the screw driver deeper in until she feels her knuckles dig into his stiff hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vinh's scream becomes a high keening wail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The screwdriver pierces the base of Vinh's skull. It protrudes through his mouth, knocking several teeth out in a stream of blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His scream cracks into a death rattle as hers begins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They roll downstream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His arms are wrapped in a death grip around her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They roll until they crash full into a tree about two thirds of the way down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She feels his grip loosen and his body slump over hers. He becomes so heavy he almost crushes her underneath as he dies right there on top of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's trapped, suffocating underneath him, until she finds the strength to push him off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She crawls out from under his body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pushing him away, sets him off rolling again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to stand up but her legs are unsteady. Her head hurts so bad it's about to burst.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The world around her shifts into a migraine zone. Trails follow trees, rocks, brush. The desire to close her eyes, to close it all out almost overwhelms her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her shoulder aches too and there's a new pain in her arm where Vinh bit her. She sees blood has matted her sleeve, and rolls it up to find a nasty bite mark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a loud crash. Della freezes and moves only her eyes, looks around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's Vinh's body hitting the stream below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where was the light at the edge of the woods? Nowhere to be seen now that's for sure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She staggers along the slope, clutching onto tree trunks and roots as she goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della grabs for a shrub to help her cross a patch of muddy slope. Pulls it clean out by the roots. Loses her footing, reaches for the roots of an old tree. She pulls herself up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plods once more along the slope, heading upwards in a diagonal through the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She arrives at the top of the slope only to be met by more darkness. But there's a strange calm about her now. Like she's reached the eye of a terrible storm.

Della wants to run at him so bad she almost hyperventilates. But she also knows that's what he wants and she refuses to give him the satisfaction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move in closer on Chuckie. He's looking right at where she's hiding, pure malevolence hardening his face to a mask.

He coughs some more.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm betting you didn't really know who you were until tonight. I reckon I know what you've been dreaming about though, what you've been aching for, through all these lonely, wasted years. Blasting out of Podunk without never looking back. Feeling the wind in your hair and the dirt of life between your fingers. Doing all the things they told you you ain't supposed to do. Taking what YOU want from life. And wasting anyone who stands in your way. Right, Della?

</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
But she doesn't finish the sentence. She rises slowly from between the plastic wrapped trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A momentary grimace of pain crosses her face. Then, their eyes meet, like for the first time. It catches them both by surprise. He smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave the tools.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCKIE>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I already did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
He shines the flashlight on her path so that she can see where she is walking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della steps around the plastic wrapped trees and between the stumps. She heads towards him, slowly, deliberately.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chuckie's hands are by his sides. She stops a few feet away from him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She can see him up close. The clearest view of him yet. They both look like they've been to hell.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell of a night, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCKIE>
<DIRECTION>
He lays the flashlight on the ground and turns the lens to point up through the trees and into the sky between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was only going to the mall for some Christmas wrapping paper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
Chuckie smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit happens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCKIE>
<DIRECTION>
They stare at one another, all alone in the night. A knowing moment stretches between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She notices the gash of matted blood and bruising on his collarbone.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
Chuckie smiles, brings his teeth back into a scary, feral grin.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted to look you in the eye before I kill you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCKIE>
<DIRECTION>
Della doesn't react. He brings up his hand, gun clutched, pointed and ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della surprises him and us.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I figured.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
She nods her head, points her chin over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huey there, going to help?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
Chuckie is puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCKIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huey? Huey's ....
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCKIE>
<DIRECTION>
He glances to the side for a split second, turns the gun as he turns his head. It's enough. Della slips the flare out of her pocket and opens it in his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before he even has time to react she LEAPS at him with all the spring left in her legs. Her fingers close around the wrist with the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flare falls aside casting its fiery glow across them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She crashes her good shoulder into the spongy place where his collar bone is broken. It makes the ugly noise of sinew tearing.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCKIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	CHRIST!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCKIE>
<DIRECTION>
She tumbles him down to the December ground and wraps her legs tight around him. Tight like a lover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She grinds her chin deep and forcefully into the area of his broken collarbone, exacerbating the wound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He cries out, thrashes about. She keeps her body melded to his, grinding her chin even deeper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wraps his arms tightly around her and pulls her even closer, wrenches her chin up and away from his collarbone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They roll across the dirt. He whispers, low and close to her.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUCKIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're even better than I thought.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHUCKIE>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes his mouth hard up against hers to stop her chin returning to the wound. She tries to pull away but he only presses harder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Neither can break away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's unclear who's got the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They roll until she suddenly pulls away, sits up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he has her and she has him in a fatal leg lock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And she has the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look at each other. He smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He makes for the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She fires into his chest, just once, it's enough.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His legs release. He slumps back. Blood darkens his shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gun smoke coils from the dark bullet wound. Blood seeps below him from the exit wound, spreading out in a dark puddle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His body surrenders to death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stares down at him. A queasy silent moment passes. She stares at the gun in her hands. It feels so heavy, so unreal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His dead eyes stare. She reaches over and closes them gently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And she's light-headed, so light-headed she could just float away. Somehow she stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks back down at the body, not quite believing he could be dead. She sees her silver locket lying beside him in the pool of blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She retrieves it. Uses her sleeve to wipe the blood away from its exterior. Inside the photos of her kids are still there; tiny photos of Tammis little thoughtful face and Terri's mischievous one look back at her. She snaps the locket closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She searches the area for the rest of her belongings, finds her wallet, her purse, her diary, her lighter, her tampax box, a lipstick in the dirt. She sticks everything in her purse. She almost misses her pack of cigarettes. We see them half buried under the dirt. She scans the area once more finds them. The pack is empty but she takes it anyway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's time to go home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. WOODS - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without really thinking about it, Della slips the gun into her pocket and starts running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tree after tree disappears behind her until she sees the light ahead. That place where the rest of the world meets the woods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She peers through the last layer of trees like she would a curtain to her other reality, the one she almost left behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The housing development is still there and not more than a hundred feet away is her car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hears the sound of distant sirens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. PERIPHERAL WOODS - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hurries across the clearing towards her car. Sees the trunk is open. Sees sheets of wrapping paper blowing about. Sees the big red bow tangled around a pine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She quickly gathers them, stuffs them in her purse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment of trepidation as she reaches her car. What if it's locked? What if the keys are gone?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She presses the Ford's driver door handle and much to her relief, it opens. She sees the keys still dangling from the ignition.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. EXPLORER- EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She climbs into the driver's seat and turns the key. No connection. No surprises there!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. PERIPHERAL WOODS - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She steps back out of the car and looks nervously around like nothing good could ever possibly happen to her again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hood is still ajar by a few inches, the weight of pine branches still pressing upon it. She uses the last of her strength to try push them away. A few smaller branches give way but the bigger one won't budge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches under the hood for the bar and pulls hard. It scrapes along the inner surface of the hood as she forces it to prop the hood open to its maximum, about fifteen inches. The hood buckles but there's enough room for her to reach in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She fumbles about and finds the positive wire has come loose from its attachment to the battery. She re-attaches the wire and, Presto, the car lights up and the keys start to ping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She almost smiles as she forces the bar back down. The hood slams down after it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FORD - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She quickly climbs back into the car and turns the keys. The engine sputters but doesn't fully catch. She turns the keys again - another wimpy sputter. Again, this time the sputter gathers momentum, catches for a second, gives up. She tries again, the sputter gathers momentum and catches for real.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della looks over her shoulder and backs up, pulls out of the tree, up and past the broken barrier and onto the road. She makes a tight U-Turn, sticks the car into four wheel drive and plows down the rough gravely road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ROUGH ROAD - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She passes the Plymouth on her way. Sees its wheels lodged deep in the mud. Keeps going.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. EMPTY HOUSING ESTATE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She drives right on through the ghostly housing estate, slowing only to change back into drive as the road improves. Empty houses flash past like a movie in rewind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights of the mall grow closer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FORD EXPLORER- EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She passes that stop sign, sighs. The barrier is open and the road up to the mall stretches freely ahead. She slowly inches out on to the road and commits to her return to "civilization".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MALL ROAD - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The road's empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She punches the accelerator, drives just over the speed limit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MALL ROAD - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The concrete blocks of the mall rise from the wastelands ahead on her left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She slows, ahead there's a small traffic jam at the entrance to the Mall road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hears the siren before she sees the police car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
God, she hopes they don't notice her smashed up windscreen, the fucked up side of the Ford.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. MALL ROAD - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She edges slowly up to meet the line of cars. Watches as the police car circumvents the traffic and pulls into the Mall road, to join a police car that already has the Mall entrance road blocked off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Of course. How long has it been? That poor security guard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She checks the car clock. It's only 85 minutes since she left the house! Hard to believe. Feels like another lifetime.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another cop car whizzes past the line. How long before they come for her? She's got to get back to the kids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Della adjusts the rearview mirror. Her gaunt bloody face looks back.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at her hands, they're ingrained with mud and blood. And her clothes!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While waiting for the traffic to start moving again she fumbles on the passenger seat, finds some kleenex.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She wipes her hands, her face, using the rearview mirror, some Kleenex and the rest of the water. She looks only slightly better.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The line starts moving. Della follows. She passes the police cars, steals a cursory glance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She keeps checking her face in the mirror. The cars soon start to disperse in different directions. The Mall disappears behind her. She turns left onto an almost empty road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She can't wait to see her babies, make sure they're okay. How could anyone expect her to go the speed limit at a time like this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hits forty, forty-five, fifty. Takes it all the way up to sixty. Runs a light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. RAILWAY ROAD - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As long as the roads empty she's gonna own it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At sixty-five she races across the railway track. She slows down to just above speed limit when she sees a car ahead on the adjoining road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With one hand guiding the wheel she grabs the lipstick from her purse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She carefully applies it in the rearview but her mouth is so parched it just cakes into her chapped lips. She wipes it away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. CROSSROADS - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She drives through the crossroads.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FORD EXPLORER - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She applies some lipstick to her cheeks to give her some color. But she just looks odd. She ends up wiping it away with the back of her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gosh, this car in front is really taking its sweet time. She decides to overtake. She accelerates to sixty. As she passes the driver stares at her car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She slows down so as not to arouse any more suspicion. She passes the familiar sign for "Pleasant Valley Drive". The road's empty ahead so she guns it to sixty-five.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The closer she gets to home, the faster she wants to go. She tries to resist but can't. The speedometer hits seventy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car hurtles into the night. Oh No, a red light ahead. And a car waiting to go in the opposite direction. She decides to slow for this one. Barely makes it - screeches to a halt. The driver in the forward facing car checks her out. She attempts to smile and look like a normal housewife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. PLEASANT DRIVE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She waits for the car to pass, then hits the accelerator again. She signals right, turns abruptly into meet the gates of Pleasant valley Dream Homes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She rakes about in her purse for her chub card, can't find it. She presses the intercom. No one answers. She presses again. Still no answer. She backs out hard onto Pleasant Valley Drive. Luckily for her, the car she overtook a few minutes earlier pulls in. She tails the car tightly through the gates which scrape shut against her back bumpers. But she's in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She guns it along Pleasant Valley Crescent and slows as she approaches the sign for Pleasant Valley Boulevard. Checks herself in the mirror. Pulls into the boulevard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she sees her house ahead a huge sob engulfs her. She snorts it back. Not yet. Her face hurts so bad with repressed emotion that it feels like it's made of stone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls into the driveway. Smooths her coat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She glances at the gun, which lies on the passenger seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns off the ignition.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks back at the gun. She removes the car keys from the ignition.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She glances at the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at the house; it all looks normal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a deep breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She moves to get out of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She leans over, grabs the gun and sticks it in her purse. She finds her chub card inside. She sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. DELLA'S HOUSE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She remembers her shoulder hurts when she climbs out of the car. That her arm hurts when she pushes the car door closed behind her. That her heart hurts when she sees the star of the tree still lying there in the snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The whole side of the car is scratched to hell and the windshield is shattered. She makes her way down the path to the front door. She kicks off her wrecked muddy boots on the front step. Turns the adjoining key, on the car key chain, in the front door lock. Pushes open the door.

:SC: INT. DELLAS'S HOUSE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where the hell have you been?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
Kenneth's voice meets her as she steps into the house. Nice welcome.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't respond. Closes the door behind her. Walks into the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There he is ahead, leaning against the office door. Beer in one hand, remote in the other. The TV blaring behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said....
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
He's about to begin shouting again when he notices something's not right about her.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Della?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
He switches the TV volume down using the remote.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Della honey are you all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
She stares back at him coldly.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't call me that. Don't ever call me that again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
She steps slowly towards him. Sees a violent adventure flick wrapping up behind him on TV. The end credits scroll down the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just wanted to get home to my babies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
Kenneth cannot understand her garbled words. He sees the dried blood on her chin, matted mud on her coat.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
She just stares.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was there an accident?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
She keeps staring, looks at him with a cold odd expression. She needs to be held like a child but he doesn't even move towards her. Just stands there like a jerk, unsure of what to do, so he takes a swig of beer.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you hurt?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
That swig of beer turns what was left of her love for him to stone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are they okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
Without waiting for an answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. STAIRWAY - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns and races up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. THE TWINS BEDROOM - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She opens the door softly. The night light casts a pale glow out low across the carpet. There they are, all tucked up in their quilts, breathing gently, little faces flushed with sleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sighs, closes her eyes with relief, softly closes the door behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. STAIRWAY - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Walks back downstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. KITCHEN - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenneth is pacing about the kitchen, opening another beer.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sound asleep, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
Kenneth, unsure what to do, tries to make a joke.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. What'd you bring me from the mall?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNETH>
<DIRECTION>
Della sighs, calmly pulls out the gun from her pocket, looks him right in the eye, points the barrel at his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shrinks back, silent for once, blind panic playing across his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But not hers. She's cold, cold as the icy night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls the trigger at point blank range. CLICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He recoils.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But no bullet disengages from the barrel. Nothing. She knew there were no bullets left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the click echoes throughout the silent house.
</DIRECTION>
<DELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELLA>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
