	<DIALOGUE>
	My missionary ancestors came to the islands and told the Hawaiians to put on clothes, work hard, believe in Christ, and stop surfing and hula dancing. They made business deals along the way -- buying an island, or marrying a princess and inheriting her land. Now their descendants wear bikinis and running shorts, play beach volleyball and surf, and take up hula dancing. Hawai'i has always been a place of contradiction.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My friends on the mainland think just because I live in Hawai'i, I live in paradise. Like a permanent vacation -- we're all just out here drinking mai- tais, shaking our hips, and catching waves. Are they nuts? How can they possibly think our families are less screwed up, our heart attacks and cancers less fatal, our grief less devastating? Hell, I haven't been on a surfboard in fifteen years.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

	<DIALOGUE>
	For the last 23 days, I've been living in a "paradise" of IVs and urine bags and endotracheal tubes and six-month- old US magazines. Paradise. Paradise can go fuck itself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
Matt looks up at the WOMAN we saw in the speedboat, now lying stiffly on an upright HOSPITAL BED, her head cocked to one side, a feeding tube in her nose, a ventilator in her trachea, IVs in her arm.

	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Elizabeth King, my wife. Twenty-three days ago she was launched from a powerboat during a race and hit her head, almost drowned. Now she's in a coma that scores 5 on the Glasgow scale and 3 on the Rancho Los Amigos scale, scores showing an extremely severe coma. Liz is very competitive. Whatever she does, she does to the fullest.

<NEUROLOGIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She reacts non-purposefully to stimuli in a non-specific manner, but occasionally her responses are specific, though inconsistent. Her reflexes are primitive and often the same, regardless of stimuli presented...

	Twenty-three days in a coma, and any day now the doctors will give me their final verdict if she's going to come out of it or not. Then I have a decision to make. Wait, that's wrong. Liz has a living will. Like always, she makes her own decisions. But I know she's going to pull through.

Matt confers with fifth-grade teacher MS. Hayashi and school counselor MRS. THULL.
</DIRECTION>
<MS_HAYASHI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We just don't think these photographs are appropriate for Scottie to be sharing with her classmates. Some of them went home quite disturbed, and we got some angry calls from parents.

	Yeah, she's sort of been going to town with the whole picture-taking thing, but I had no idea --

</MATT>
<MS_HAYASHI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't tell you how my heart goes out to you and your family, but Scottie just hasn't been herself. Principal Cruz agrees with us that it maybe would be better for Scottie to remain at home with you during this difficult time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MS_HAYASHI>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Home. See, I would think that sticking to her normal routine would be the best thing for her -- you know, keep her occupied. I wouldn't really know how to... I mean, I've kind of got my hands full. And her sister's away at school on the Big Island. I don't think Scottie would really want to hang out with me when she could be with her friends and people like you who specialize in children.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<MRS_THULL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. King, we see this every day -- children acting out at school when something's wrong at home. And your family is facing a devastating crisis. Have you been engaging Scottie in really talking about what's going on? Encouraging her to express her feelings? That's crucial.

	Scottie, that is not a good choice! Are you making a good choice?

	No, you're not. You're overdoing it is what you're doing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw it in a book. Some famous photographer lady took pictures of her mom in the hospital while she was dying, and they're considered art. That's what I'm doing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First of all, your mother's very sick, but she's not dying. Second, you don't share personal stuff like that with strangers. What's going on with Mom is private.

(V.O.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The last time I took care of Scottie by myself was when she was one. Now she's ten, and I have no idea what goes on inside her head. She's insane. And with Elizabeth in the hospital, I think she's testing me. I'm the backup parent. The understudy.

INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH! Scottie takes Elizabeth's picture again.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish you'd stop doing that. And rather than taking her picture all the time, you should talk to her. I'm tired of asking you. You heard Dr. Johnston -- people in a coma can hear you -- you know, well, some of them can. It lets them know they're still loved, might even help them wake up sooner. And it'll help you express whatever feelings and emotions you're supposed to be going through -- you know, make you feel better.

	The whole goddamned state is following my decision on who's going to buy 35,000 acres on Kaua'i my family has owned since the 1860s. My cousins and I meet in six days to approve a buyer. Ever since my father died nine years ago, I'm the sole trustee, the controlling trustee, so I hold all the cards. Why does so much have to depend on me -- my wife, my daughters, my family's land? I just want to hide.

	Hey, they all the same cards. You like buy all the same cards?

<BARB_HIGGINS>

	Scottie, the things you said were simply evil. Do you realize that? I don't know what's led you to be such a nasty young lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARB_HIGGINS>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, hey. We came over. She apologized. We're dealing with it. Kids are mean sometimes. They grow out of it. It's a kid thing. Here, Scottie, you're going to stop, right? And you're really, really sorry, right?

Scottie makes a big exaggerated nod.

	</DIALOGUE>
</BARB_HIGGINS>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, she won't. It's like the time Lani locked Scottie out of the house at her birthday party and Scottie sat outside by herself. It was a mean thing to do, but Lani here probably did it just to show off, right?

Lani thinks a moment, nods.

<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My great-great-grandmother was Princess Margaret Ke'alohilani, one of the last direct descendants of King Kamehameha. She was originally supposed to marry her hanai brother, but she fell in love with her haole banker and estate manager, Edward King, whose parents were missionaries. Between his land deals and her huge inheritance, all of their descendants for generations have watched the past unfurl millions into our laps through leases and sales. Now the Rule Against Perpetuities is forcing us to dissolve the trust, and we're selling the last parcel of undeveloped land.

</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unlike a lot of my cousins, I haven't touched my share of the trust money. Like my father before me, I live only on the income from my law practice. I don't want my daughters growing up entitled and spoiled. And I agree with my father -- you give your children enough money to do something but not enough to do nothing.

</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not only am I the sole but I'm a commercial real estate and transactional attorney, so the most involved of my cousins have been meeting with me regularly to analyze the bids -- Cousin Dave, Cousin Hal, Cousin Six, Cousin Wink, Cousin Lisa, Cousin Connie and Cousin Stan, both of whom oppose the sale entirely. Don't be fooled by appearances. In Hawai'i some of the most powerful people look like bums and stuntmen.

Matt and his cousins stand above the conference table, looking at blueprints and architectural drawings.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The proposals are virtually the same -- hotels, shopping centers, condos and golf courses. 3000 new jobs in the first five years. Support letters from the construction industry and unions. A Chicago group is offering half a billion dollars, but we're leaning toward a lower bid from a guy named Don Holitzer. He's actually from Kaua'i and made a fortune in Silicon Valley. Cousin Hugh is pushing us in that direction, and I say why not?

	Bad news, Matt. Dr. Chun, Dr. Mueller and I -- we believe her condition, which we call a multi-factorial anoxic encephalopathy, is deteriorating. We see no eye movement, no pupillary response, basically no brainstem reflexes whatsoever. The machines could keep her going, but her quality of life would be... very poor. Basically what you see now. She'll never be like she was, Matt. Never. We know that now.

<KAI>

	Oh, she's been looking a little pale lately all cooped up in here, and I just know she'd be mortified if no one had thought to help her out with some lipstick and blush. I know she'll grill me.

Matt and Mark exchange a look -- "Girls."

</MARK>
<KAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I don't want to have to start from scratch later. Oh, and Matt, on the way here we stopped by and left some more meals in your fridge, all ready to nuke.

Matt smiles -- he'd been expecting a grim moment alone with Elizabeth, but instead he finds a room full of warmth and life. Even if it's a little creepy.

<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what's the latest anyway, Matt? Any updates?

</MARK>
<MATT>

Matt notices a BUFF GUY and some FRIENDS headed to a nearby table, and his mood sours. Scottie follows his gaze.

</MATT>
<TROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, I just wanted to know the latest. I'm praying for her every day, you guys. Really hard. Seriously. So what I was saying was, when I was there, I talked to her, and her hand moved, so I was pretty encouraged. I thought that was an encouraging sign.

	You weren't supposed to be driving, Troy. She was supposed to be driving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<TROY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She wanted me to drive. And she's the one who told me to pass the other boat right before the turn. And just your whole attitude toward me, Matt -- I mean, I feel terrible. I wish it were me and not her. Plus I almost drowned myself when we capsized. And my rotator cuff is never going to be the same, and I'm going to miss Moloka'i.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TROY>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just because her hand moved, it doesn't mean anything, Troy. Mom twitches at weird times. When you cut off a chicken's head, it runs all around, but it's still a dead chicken.

The dorm supervisor knocks on an adjacent door. A moment later a ROOMMATE opens, groggy from sleep.

A coat over her nightgown, flashlight in hand, the dorm supervisor leads Matt and Scottie across glistening moist grass. They hear LAUGHTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO FIGURES grow more distinct in the moonlight -- GIRLS hitting golf balls -- ALEXANDRA KING and friend EMILY.
</DIRECTION>
<DORM_SUPERVISOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Girls! What do you think you're doing out here?

</EMILY>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Alex! It's me, Scottie!

</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
Emily takes off but doesn't get far -- she falls flat on her face, golf club in one hand, BOTTLE in the other.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I pay $25,000 year for this crap not to happen. Alex!

<ALEXANDRA>

	Dad?

<DIRECTION>
(laughing, to Emily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My fucking dad is here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
This cracks her up even more. Scottie laughs too, though she's unsure why.
</DIRECTION>
<DORM_SUPERVISOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't talk like that here. This is unacceptable behavior!
	</DIALOGUE>

	What's up, Dad?

</ALEXANDRA>
<EMILY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You come out to play a few holes with us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EMILY>

	You need to come home and see Mom.

Alexandra hears this, takes a few strides, flings her golf club into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck Mom!

Matt's car arrives back home, and he and Scottie get out of the car.

Matt carries a passed-out Alex upstairs. Scottie scampers ahead, opening the door to --

INT. ALEXANDRA'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

-- where Matt places Alex on her bed, takes off her shoes, covers her with a blanket, and watches this tsunami of a girl at rest.

INT. KING KITCHEN - DAY

<DIRECTION>
At the stove, Matt dishes out SCRAMBLED EGGS. Scottie sits in the kitchen nook.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>

(V.O.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	And Scottie, how can I protect her from... me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
As he brings her plate over --
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like eggs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't you say so before I made them?

</MATT>
<SCOTTIE>

Alex trudges in and pulls a Coca-Cola out of the fridge.

<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Does Mom let you have Coke for breakfast?

<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm pretty sure it's after eleven.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
Now that we get a closer look, we might recognize Alexandra from the postcards at the hospital. We also see a resemblance to her mother.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you feeling?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
Shrugging, she plops down near Scottie.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hungover, huh? Why am I not surprised? I don't know where to start, and we probably shouldn't in front of Scottie.

</MATT>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't mind.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you were supposed to be getting your act together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have gotten my act together. I was just drinking. I've been doing really well, but nobody ever seems to notice my grades are better, and how I was in that stupid play you guys didn't bother to see. Do you even remember the name of it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
It's on the tip of his tongue.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEXANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I thought. So what if I got drunk on the ONE night you happened to drop in? So the fuck what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, hey, hey. Watch your language in front of Scottie.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta go. I'll see you later.

</ALEXANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
Matt notices all the floating leaves and insects.

<MATT>

<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A really good friend from Punahou. We were in school together for years.

</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Okay.

</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wants to be there for me with all this shit happening.

Matt wonders his own version of "What am I, chopped liver?"
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I know his parents?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. He might stay over too. Is that cool?

Just then, Scottie runs out onto the patio dressed in a BRA AND PANTIES.

	What the fuck? Get out of my underwear, you freak.

	Scottie, get back inside and change into your swimsuit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now.

Scottie flips him off and runs back inside.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Real good job you're doing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's part of why I brought you here. You have to help me. I don't know what to do with her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
Alexandra slides into the water, swims to the other side and props herself on the edge, floating her lower body. Matt lowers himself into the water too.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe if you spent more time with her, she wouldn't act like such a complete spaz. Get her out of town -- go camp on Kaua'i. That's what mom did with me whenever I was losing it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Alex, your mother isn't well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Obviously.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They just told me she isn't going to wake up. It's for sure now. The doctors are going to stop caring for her. Do you understand what I'm saying? Your mom wanted it this way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
Alex remains silent.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She has a will, see, saying we have to do it like this. We both do. That's why I got you. We're letting her go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
Alex looks at him, takes a couple quick, loud inhalations, then slips --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UNDERWATER --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- where she SWIMS, FACE CONTORTED, hoping to stay down there forever. Finally she emerges --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ABOVE THE POOL --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- and gets out, grabbing a towel, crying now.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why'd you have to tell me in the goddamned pool?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
Matt climbs out and approaches her, arms extended.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>

</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>

Matt drops his arms, crestfallen. Alex scoffs, walks back into the house.

INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They sit together now on sofas. Alexandra appears drained from crying.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just found out yesterday. We have to go through this thing together, you and Scottie and I. And I need to go around and tell people what's happening -- our family and close friends. Sometimes I'll want you to come with me. Other times I need you to watch Scottie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to go around with you and tell everyone that Mom's going to die? What's the point of that? Breaking the news, watching them cry, dealing with their emotions. How depressing is that going to be? Just call them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alex, nobody wants to do any of this. But we need to tell Grandpa and Tutu, a few friends. They have the right to know and to be able to say goodbye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to talk about Mom with anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever you fought about with her at Christmas, you need to drop it. Grow up. You love your mother. Your mother loves you. Move on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't drop it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really don't have a clue, do you? Dad, she was cheating on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
Whoa.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEXANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what we fought about. When I was home at Christmas, I caught her with some guy. It made me sick to see her near you. I went back to school thinking that was it, I was done with her. I was going to call and tell you everything. But then the accident happened, and I was waiting until she woke up, I guess. And you, you didn't even suspect. Right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off his silence)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That disgusted me too. You're always so busy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Caught her with some guy? What does that mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brandy and I were on our way to swim in the Black Point pool, and suddenly I see Mom and some douchebag walk into a house. His house, I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a guy? It could have been anybody.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He had his hand on her ass. It was gross.

</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're sure it was her.

<DIRECTION>
(off her nod)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then nothing. She went into the house. A few days later I told her I knew what she was doing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First she acted like she didn't know what I was talking about. Like I'm blind. Then she got super-mad and started yelling at me and denied it. That's when I decided I didn't want anything more to do with her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is he?

</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>

</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Stupid.

</MARK>
<KAI>

	It's not stupid. He wants us to throw parties and have people over, which we do, of course, but who ends up doing all the work? Me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAI>
<MARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's work that's totally unnecessary. You don't have to do anything. Nobody's forcing you to clean and buy a new outfit and think of some goddamn theme cocktail. We can just invite people over last minute and drink whatever we have and hang out. It's more fun that way, anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARK>

As they continue their argument, Matt is struck by the pettiness of everyday life. He at once pities it, is impatient with it, and longs for it.

</MATT>
<KAI>

	Your marriage was not... You worked so hard to make partner, and no one can take that away from you. But then you made partner, and you only got busier. And it's not like you were so involved with the girls. She was lonely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAI>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're going to talk to me in clichés about women? Nothing is ever a woman's fault. Was it still going on when she had the accident?

Kai looks away. Mark nods.

<MARK>

</MARK>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(to Kai)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you what? You probably egged her on. Add some drama to your life without any actual risk. Whom do you think you're protecting anyway? She doesn't need your protection -- it's over. She's going to die.

<KAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't say that.

<DIRECTION>
Matt looks at him blankly, then at Kai. He'd like to know too.
</DIRECTION>
<KAI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can you ask about him when she's going to die? Who cares? Yes, she loves him, loved him, whatever. She's crazy about him. She was going to ask you for a divorce.

</KAI>
<DIRECTION>
Matt is stunned but oddly relieved. The truth, once revealed, blows a calming wind.

Since the last time we saw her, OTHER ITEMS have been added around her bed. Along with draped LEIS, we see a childhood DOLL, DIPLOMAS, and of course SPORTS MEDALS and RIBBONS. An antique QUILT covers her legs. Her father meant it when he said they'd bring her old things.

	You were going to ask me for a divorce? So you could be with some fucking fuckhead Brian Speer? Are you kidding me? Who are you? Because the only thing I know for sure is that you're a goddamned liar. So what do you have to say for yourself? Go ahead, make a little joke and tell me I've got it all wrong. Tell me again I'm too out of touch with my feelings and need to go to therapy.

	Isn't the idea of marriage to make your partner's way in life a little easier? For me it was always harder with you. And you're still making it harder. Lying there on a ventilator and still fucking up my life. You're relentless. You know what? I was going to ask you for a divorce some day.

Matt considers this. Of course she didn't see his recent outburst, and he's not about to let on.

<MATT>

Scottie pushes open the door, now accompanied by her friend REINA, 12, who looks around as if the room is dirty. She wears a terry-cloth tennis skirt and hooded terry-cloth sweatshirt.

	Well, Reina, thanks for stopping by, and, here, Scottie, let me give you some money, and you two can go get an ice cream or something...

</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>

	Look, Dad, it's no big deal. Kids do drugs and they stop. Unless they're like super-ghetto. And you sent me to boarding school, remember? I couldn't get anything anymore. So no, I'm not doing any drugs. But I still think they're fun. Okay, maybe a little pot once in a while.

	Yeah, there is. We shipped you off. Let them handle it. And now you're here, helping with Scottie, helping me. Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to know what really pisses me off? That she wouldn't end it. Not even when she knew she was busted. How are we supposed to feel about that?

<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess she really liked him.

	So how are we going to find this guy, Sherlock?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Well, why don't you two take Scottie to the beach? I'm going to call around a little. We're on an island, for Christ's sake. Everything's just one degree of separation.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Any luck?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The hotels were a dead end, but I took another shot with his office. He's definitely in Hanalei renting a house somewhere -- probably one of those cottages around the bay. Who wants to go for a walk?

	Can we swim with the sharks? I read in the hotel magazine how they put you in a cage in the ocean and throw shark feed in the water and sharks swim right up to you. Can we do that?

	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was with a law school buddy from the mainland, and I took him to the club. We were just coming in from paddling, and your mom was on her way out, and she looked at me and said, "Do you think it's going to snow today?" We all got beers when she came back in. I had already seen her around. That was it. I got her number.

	Did you think she was pretty?

	What do you love about her?

</SCOTTIE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love... I don't know. The way we are with each other, most of the time, anyway. I love how she's more capable of feeling joy than anyone I've ever known. I just like being with her, just riding bikes or going out to dinner, even if it's just a plate lunch at Rainbow's. Years ago we used to do a lot of paddling together.

</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were on Moloka'i with Mark and Kai, and your mom was out surfing and saw a shark right beneath her on a wave. Like right beneath her. She got down on her stomach and started paddling like crazy, and this big fin kept following her. She even paddled up onto the nearest rocks instead of all the way to shore. Got cuts all over her legs and hands. Only time I ever saw your mother scared, and she was really scared. She even threw up. Crying and shaking. I had to hold her for a long time. She really thought she was going to die. Of course she hid all that from the Mitchells, turned it into a funny "Me-versus-a-shark" story. I told her...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll ask you that same question, Scottie. What do you love about Mom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lots of stuff. She's not old and ugly like other moms. I like her stories -- like how she streaked at the wedding and the time she beat a wild pig with a shoe. How about you, Alex?

<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>

ANOTHER GUY jogs toward Matt wearing a "Stanford Lacrosse" T- shirt and running shorts with long slits up the sides.

BRIAN SPEER!

Suddenly TWO BOYS -- Brian's kids -- come running through the hedge and past Matt on their way into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Matt turns around to see Brian's wife JULIE SPEER dutifully trailing behind.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay in the zone, please! That means you, Skylar. And you too, Colt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Skylar and Colt?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
Matt watches the little boys flop into the surf. Mrs. Speer follows, wading in up to her calves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Matt stands to look whether Brian is coming down to the beach too. No such luck.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (to Alex)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be right back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
Matt gets to his feet, brushes off sand, and walks casually toward Mrs. Speer, maintaining a comfortable distance. Alexandra watches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE SURF --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Matt takes up a casual stance near Mrs. Speer and pretends to look out at the water, just hanging out. Mrs. Speer continues to keep a watchful eye on her boisterous boys.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like you got yourself a handful with those two.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must keep you pretty busy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're pretty non-stop, but they're at a really fun age.

</JULIE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How old are they?

</MATT>
<JULIE_SPEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eight and ten.

</JULIE_SPEER>
<MATT>

(pointing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have two girls. Ten and seventeen. That whole non-stop thing. That never changes.

<JULIE_SPEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys live here?

</JULIE_SPEER>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We live on O'ahu.

</MATT>
<JULIE_SPEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, so do we.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE_SPEER>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'm just getting my girls out of town for a couple days. Their, uh, their mother is in the hospital, so I thought I'd give them a little break.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She'll be fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong? If you don't mind my asking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a little boating accident. Hit her head a little too hard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
Does Julie recognize any of this, or even recognize him? Doesn't seem like it.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A sailboat? Or one with a motor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs, then --)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One with a motor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
She's actually sort of charming, this Julie Speer.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, good luck with that. I wish her well. Skylar, don't go so far!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys staying in one of the cottages over there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, my husband had to come here for work, so we thought we'd all make a little vacation of it. He knows the owner, so --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hugh King.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's my cousin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Then you probably know my husband. Brian Speer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
That hangs there a moment. Matt suppresses the sudden desire to spill the beans.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, can't say as I do.

</MATT>
<JULIE>

Matt looks over to see Scottie very agitated about something.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me. Nice talking to you.

</MATT>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You too. Take care.

</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Matt trots off.

<DIRECTION>
A MONTAGE --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Images of Hanalei as the sun begins to set over the magnificent taro fields. Wind rustles the trees. Mist falls into the valley.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can I forgive her for loving someone else? Did she even know about his family? Was she that in love? Does she miss him from her coma? Does she wish he could be with her and not me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>

EXT. HANALEI TOWN - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our friends walk along roadside tourist shops toward --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TAHITI NUI RESTAURANT - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lived-in hangout with a wood interior, woven mats on the walls, and tables carved into with steak knives. A UKULELE CLUB jams in a corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As our foursome enter the joint, Matt notices --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COUSIN HUGH yucking it up at the BAR with other REGULARS.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(to Alexandra)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's Cousin Hugh. Get us a table. Order me something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what?

</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE BAR --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Matt wedges his way in beside his third cousin, who despite his booziness and very local flavor is nonetheless a King family patriarch.
</DIRECTION>
<COUSIN_HUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heeey! Mattie-boy! What are you doing here? I didn't expect to see you until the meeting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUSIN_HUGH>

He looks over his shoulder to see whom Matt might have come in with.
</DIRECTION>
<COUSIN_HUGH>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUSIN_HUGH>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, Scottie and Alex.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<COUSIN_HUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Big girls now! So what are you doing here, man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUSIN_HUGH>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just getting the girls out of the hospital for a couple days, you know, change of scenery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<COUSIN_HUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, boy, what you've been going through. That's a tough deal.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(taking a drink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Elizabeth, hey, she's, she's a tough gal, I'll tell you that. A fighter. She'll make it. Get you a drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUSIN_HUGH>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, what're you having?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<COUSIN_HUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Barney, an old-fashioned for my cousin here. Nice to see you, Matt. How you been otherwise?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUSIN_HUGH>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not much otherwise. Between our business and the hospital, you know, I've just trying to keep my head above water. So listen, I see you have some people staying in the cottage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<COUSIN_HUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hey, Mattie, if I'd known you were coming, I coulda --
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUSIN_HUGH>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, no, I'm just wondering about the guy you're renting to. I think his name is Brian Speer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<COUSIN_HUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, yeah, real determined son-of-a- bitch. He's Lou's sister's... No, wait. Lou has a sister, and the sister's husband... Lou's brother-in- law is cousins with that guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUSIN_HUGH>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh? Who's Lou?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<COUSIN_HUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, wait. You mean the cottages on the bay or the cottage back by the trail?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUSIN_HUGH>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The bay. The guy with the wife and two boys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<COUSIN_HUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, that's right. Determined son-of- a-bitch. Anyway, the point is the guy we're doing business with is that guy's brother-in-law. Works for him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUSIN_HUGH>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brian Speer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<COUSIN_HUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUSIN_HUGH>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean, the guy we're doing business with?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<COUSIN_HUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who do you think? Don Holitzer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUSIN_HUGH>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holitzer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<COUSIN_HUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I'm saying. That's Don's brother-in-law in the cottage. You don't know him? I would have thought you'd know him. He's a realtor over by you. So if we sell to Don -- and that's what we're going to do, right? That's what you want too. Nice guy, Don. He'll do right by us. Then when Don develops and re-sells and leases and all that --
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUSIN_HUGH>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, yeah --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<COUSIN_HUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's letting this brother-in-law in the cottage handle the transactions. A lot of them, anyway. Big score for that guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUSIN_HUGH>
<DIRECTION>
It takes a moment for this stone to drop to the bottom of Matt's well.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>

</MATT>
<COUSIN_HUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?

</COUSIN_HUGH>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brian Speer -- what else do you know about him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<COUSIN_HUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not much. He's lucky. The bugga's lucky. His sister is married to the guy. Son-of-a-bitch is going to make a shitload of money on commissions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUSIN_HUGH>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not if we don't go with that bid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
Cousin Hugh's eyes emerge momentarily from their drunken fog to give Matt a firm, steely warning.
</DIRECTION>
<COUSIN_HUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We all want Don. You do too, Matt. You've said as much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUSIN_HUGH>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I know. You're right. Okay. Well. Good to see you, Hugh.

</MATT>
<COUSIN_HUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You too.

<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See you at the meeting.

</COUSIN_HUGH>
<DIRECTION>
TRACK TO THE TABLE firmly on MATT'S FACE as he processes this horrifying news delivered so casually.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE TABLE --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Matt takes a seat. Scottie and Sid eat fried appetizers. Alexandra just sits watching the musicians.
</DIRECTION>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This place rocks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Totally.

<MATT>

(low)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
The music grows more frenetic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Matt looks around the room, alienated from everything -- from the fried food and the tourists, from the umbrellas in the drinks, from his daughters enjoying the music and this cretin called Sid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Why can't a nuclear bomb blow the whole island up right now?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ROAD BY THE BAY - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light is swiftly fading, and our heroes are little more than SILHOUETTES as they walk back to the hotel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sid and Scottie talk and laugh together. Alex walks with her father.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, guess what. Turns out Brian Speer is connected to Don Holitzer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's Don Holitzer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The guy we're going to sell to. And that woman today at the beach. That was his wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whose wife?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then --)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The hottie with the hat? You sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off his nod)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So he's married. Nice. Why didn't you say anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's him I want to talk to, not her. I know where their cottage is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do? So let's do it right now. Let's go knock on his door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I'm saying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
Alexandra quietly exults.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do that. Don't be excited. This isn't fun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's what we came here to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you to talk to his wife while I talk to him. And figure out some way to distract Scottie and their kids.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got it. Sid, come here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
MOMENTS LATER --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The team are gathered for a little huddle.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Dad and I are going to go talk to some friends while Sid takes you back to the hotel, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to come too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't. Who wants to sit around talking in some house? Let's ditch these losers and go watch some serious TV.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah!
	</DIALOGUE>

Zero hour. Matt and Alexandra approach the cottage from the road and start to walk around it toward the beach.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you ready?

</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. What should I say?

	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll think of something. You're a lawyer.

</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry for sucking you into this. I should be doing this alone. It's selfish of me.

	I'm the one who sucked you in. I'm the one who knew.

	I'm Julie Speer. Yeah, I thought that was you. You've been in the paper so much lately. I figured you had to know Brian. He's been pretty involved.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, no, I know, yeah, super-involved. Maybe I've met him in passing. I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, I guess you guys are deciding really soon. A couple of days, right -- you and your family meet? I'm sorry. That's probably a conflict of interest or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, it's okay. You're right -- it'll all be over in a couple of days.

<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys want a burger?

As Alex and Matt agree, a figure appears at the screen door. BRIAN SPEER emerges, a bag of BUNS in one hand.

Alex is glad to keep her ringside seat for the moment. All buckle their mental seatbelts.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elizabeth is dying. Oh, wait. Fuck you. And she's dying. We unhooked her from the machines this morning. She'll be dead in a few days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not here to hurt you. We just thought she'd want you to know.

As they've plotted, Alex and Matt study Brian's paralyzed face. They exchange a glance, then look back at him.

	I can't... I'm sorry. I never thought it would come to this.

	I'm sorry for all of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN_SPEER>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, pal, like she said, I'm not here to wreck your life. I just came to give you a chance to go to the hospital. I don't know how long you're planning on being here, but I'm sure you can think of an excuse to leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must be good at that.

	You can be alone with her to say goodbye or whatever you want. Do you hear what I'm saying?

Brian seems deeply lost in his own thoughts. Then --

<BRIAN_SPEER>

	Okay, look, I can't have you here. You understand.

Julie returns with wine for Matt and a soda for Alex.

They all stand there a moment. Matt's unsure how to play this out. He shoots a quick panicked look at Alex, who scrambles to keep the ball rolling.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEXANDRA>

	Awesome cottage you're renting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, say, prime Hanalei location. I used to come here as a kid before it was a vacation rental. Alex, your great-uncle Warren and Aunt Lillian built it back in the 20s. Haven't been inside in years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. We'll give you a tour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or, Brian, maybe you could give my dad a little walk down memory lane, and Julie and I can chat out here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'd like that, if you don't mind. Just a quick look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<BRIAN_SPEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. But it's not like I live here.

Matt walks up to the door, making a point to let Brian open it for him.

INT. HANALEI BAY COTTAGE - NIGHT

Brian sweeps his hand around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN_SPEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN_SPEER>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you meet? I'm curious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
For a moment Brian looks tricked, as if Matt really did just want a tour of the house.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIAN_SPEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't do this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN_SPEER>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neither can I. How did you meet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<BRIAN_SPEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you said you came here just to tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN_SPEER>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I changed my mind. And I can't very well ask her the details. How'd you meet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<BRIAN_SPEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At a party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN_SPEER>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What party?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<BRIAN_SPEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Super Bowl party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN_SPEER>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(figuring it out)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At the Mitchells'.

</MATT>
<BRIAN_SPEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does that help? Does that make it better?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN_SPEER>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I'm doing you a favor here. I could go out there right now and fuck you up, so get a better attitude. Then what? How'd you get the nerve to ask her out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
Brian drops his head, rubs his temples.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to know what makes a person cross that line. Was it about the deal? Is that when you decided she was for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<BRIAN_SPEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no. It's not what you think. It just happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN_SPEER>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing just happens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<BRIAN_SPEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything just happens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN_SPEER>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was she going to leave me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<BRIAN_SPEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She would have. But I, I, uh... I didn't want that. That wouldn't have happened. I love Julie.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(anguished)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't tell her. Please. I don't know what I've done. I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN_SPEER>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did she say she loved you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
Brian nods slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you love her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
Brian looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't love her. You don't love her. You just used her to get to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<BRIAN_SPEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I told you. I wasn't trying to get to you. It was an affair, an attraction. Sex. And she got sort of... carried away with the whole thing, and I guess I went with it. I mean, I didn't exactly say no to things. I should have. I love my family.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN_SPEER>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I guess it's all working out. Her lips are sealed, and you don't have to go through the trouble of dumping her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<BRIAN_SPEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, hey, that's really unfair. I had - - have -- a lot of respect for her. She's a wonderful woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN_SPEER>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too bad her husband found out. You can't win `em all. One more question. Have you ever been inside my bedroom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<BRIAN_SPEER>
<DIRECTION>
(tortured)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Once.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN_SPEER>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could have had the decency to lie about that one. Well, she's in Queen's Hospital if you want to say goodbye. That really is all I came to say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<BRIAN_SPEER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shouldn't you be with her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIAN_SPEER>
<DIRECTION>
Matt's face slackens into overwhelming sadness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HANALEI BAY COTTAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Matt swings the screen door open. Alex sits with Julie. Skylar and Colt are still running around the yard.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, great, all remodeled, new appliances. Nice. Alex, we should be getting back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, hey, thanks for stopping by. Really nice to meet you both. Maybe we'll see you at the beach tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, maybe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
After Alex and Julie share a quick kiss goodbye -- a common custom in Hawaii -- Julie turns to Matt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Matt leans in, but instead of going for her cheek, he kisses her FULLY ON THE LIPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls away, and they exchange a brief, vaguely erotic look. Then he turns away and into the night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The plane is dark except for overhead READING LIGHTS. Again Matt, Sid and the girls sit at the very BACK OF THE PLANE.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So when do you think he'll show up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have no idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
Sid leans forward from the middle seat.
</DIRECTION>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was he sorry? I hope he was sorry, man. You could have told his wife, and you didn't. I hope he knows how lucky he is. I would have told her everything. She deserves to know. Or else she's going to be a dumb bitch the rest of her life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just saying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No need to get creepy. Anyway, doesn't matter. That's all behind us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, the one we have to worry about telling things to now is Scottie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've asked Dr. Johnston to help us break the news tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
They turn to look at little Scottie, dead to the world in the window seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPICE HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Matt and the kids walk slowly through this different, calmer wing of the hospital looking for the right room-number.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally they find it and push open the door into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPICE ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
While still a hospital room, there is no medical equipment present. Bucolic colorful paintings on the wall are intended to be uplifting. But unlike the expansive view outside Elizabeth's ICU window, here the window looks out partially at a CINDER-BLOCK WALL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sid and the Kings are greeted by DR. JOHNSTON and grief counselor DR. HERMAN, who affects a comforting smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_JOHNSTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, everyone. Matt.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off their greetings)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Dr. Herman, whom I told you about. She works with us in counseling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_JOHNSTON>
<DR_HERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(locking eyes with all)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, everyone. Hello. Hi. Hello.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The two professionals allow the Kings to turn their attention to Elizabeth, who now lies with no machines at all. Around her BALLOONS droop, FLOWERS wilt, get-well CARDS lie in a pile. Elizabeth too is wilting and drooping. Her skin is pasty, and her cheeks are hollow.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How come Mom isn't on any more machines? Is she getting better?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
The adults exchange glances. Dr. Herman approaches Scottie.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must be Scottie.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off her nod --)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scottie, I have a present for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Herman hands her a little squeaky RUBBER OCTOPUS she pulls from her pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. It's an octopus. Such a funny creature with its eight legs. But did you know octopi are actually extremely intelligent, like dogs and cats? They have unique personalities, and just like us they have a lot of defense mechanisms. I'm sure you know about the ink sac. She uses ink to confuse her predators. She can camouflage herself. She can emit poison, and some can mimic more dangerous creatures, like the eel. I keep her to remind me of our defense mechanisms -- our ink, our camouflage, our poison, all the things we use to keep away hurt. The reason Dr. Johnston invited me here today is to meet you, Scottie. I've heard a lot about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HERMAN>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DR_HERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've heard that you're a wonderful and unique and spirited girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Herman shoots a look at Matt before continuing.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_HERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I've heard your mom's not doing too well and that she's going to die very soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
All watch Scottie react to this news.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad, is that true?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Scottie. It's true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DR_HERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to have to be a very brave girl right now, and you're surrounded by people who love you. I came to meet you and tell you that if you ever want to talk about what you're feeling, I would like to talk to you too. I can help you face what's going on without all the silly defense mechanisms that work for an octopus but not for us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_HERMAN>
<DR_JOHNSTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Thank you, Dr. Herman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_JOHNSTON>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Herman looks at everyone with great sincerity before leaving. Scottie is left holding the octopus. She drops it, and it squeaks a little.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<DR_JOHNSTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, well, they say she's very good one- on-one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_JOHNSTON>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So Mom's going to die for sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DR_JOHNSTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. We worked really hard with her, but three other doctors and I agree she's in what we call an irreversible coma. Do you know what that means?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_JOHNSTON>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It means she doesn't have a brain anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DR_JOHNSTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not exactly, but... yes, that's the general idea. So we're doing exactly what she wanted us to do if that ever happened. That's why she's not attached to the machines anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_JOHNSTON>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's for the best, Scottie. Look at her. She's not happy like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<DR_JOHNSTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The purpose of medicine is to heal, and we can't do that now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_JOHNSTON>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. What will we do with her body?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Johnston looks to Matt for this one.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First Mom's going to give some of her organs to other sick people, so she can help save their lives. That's a really neat thing she's doing. Then we're going to... we're going to scatter her ashes in the ocean. You know how Mom always loved the ocean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her ashes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
Scottie looks at her mother, picturing her as ashes.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When will she die?

<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Sam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
The doctor leaves, and the room is quiet. Scottie is in a sort of trance.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come here, Scottie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
Scottie goes to her sister, who takes her in her arms.

INT. HOSPICE ROOM - THE NEXT DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Matt and the kids sit in a sort of vigil. Alex and Scottie read books, Matt has brought some paperwork, Sid reads a magazine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elizabeth emits a SIGH. All look up a moment before looking back down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Matt's PHONE VIBRATES. Checking the caller ID -- HUGH KING -- he opts not to answer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens, and Elizabeth's brother BARRY THORSON accompanies his parents Scott and Alice into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT_THORSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here we are.

<DIRECTION>
(to Scottie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Bingo. Alex.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you are again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT_THORSON>
<DIRECTION>
Matt and Alex maneuver seats for the Thorsons to sit near the bed. Barry gets his mother situated, then takes a seat himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Remaining on his feet, old Scott surveys his daughter from a distance.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTT_THORSON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what did you decide?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT_THORSON>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's not much left to decide. We're just sort of playing it by ear and making sure she's comfortable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<SCOTT_THORSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean what did you decide about the buyer? Who's your buyer?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT_THORSON>
<DIRECTION>
Even Sid and his daughters perk up at this question. Matt is taken aback.

	How much are you getting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT_THORSON>
<BARRY_THORSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad, I'm sure you'll be able to read about it in the paper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARRY_THORSON>
<SCOTT_THORSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't need to read about it. I can hear about it right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT_THORSON>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scott, let's not talk about that here. It's not the time for that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<SCOTT_THORSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All the same to you, I guess. A million here, a million there. Just ironic, that's all -- Elizabeth coming into this misfortune just as you're coming into a fortune. She gave you everything, Matt. A good, happy home, two beautiful daughters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT_THORSON>
<DIRECTION>
Matt looks to Barry for help, but Barry's silence and sheepish look imply he buys into his father's propaganda.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scott, what's your point?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<SCOTT_THORSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She wanted her own boat. She should have had her own boat, one she would have been familiar with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTT_THORSON>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She wasn't even driving! Her boat, someone else's boat -- it wouldn't have made any difference. You're not going to blame me for this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<SCOTT_THORSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, sure, quibble about the details. She was a faithful, devoted wife. She deserved more.

His point made, Scott looks at Matt and the girls and shuffles to Elizabeth's bedside, puts his hands on Alice's shoulder.

Matt walks around the property alone, taking it in and thinking. Like everywhere in Hawai'i, the nature here is powerful -- TREES, BIRDS, SPIDERWEBS.

Matt plops heavily into a chair on the lanai.

	We didn't do anything to own that land. It was entrusted to us. And now we're just...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
Hugh and Six exchange a concerned look. For a moment we go VERY CLOSE on Matt's eyes. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't do it. I won't do it. I'm not going to sign.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<COUSIN_HUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you doing, Matt? I mean, we know you have a lot on your plate right now, but you're not going to fuck this up for us. It's over. If we don't sell now, it'll be a mess when the trust dissolves. Just sign, go to your wife, done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUSIN_HUGH>
<COUSIN_SIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's inevitable, Matt. You know that. We'll get out of debt -- the taxes and maintenance have been leaching us for far too long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUSIN_SIX>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want it to go to Holitzer. I don't want it to go to anyone. I want to keep it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<COUSIN_SIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For Christ's sake. We can't move without your approval. And we don't want to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUSIN_SIX>
<DIRECTION>
Hugh tries forcing Matt's hand. Matt resists.
</DIRECTION>
<COUSIN_HUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your head's not right, Mattie. Your head's not right. You want a couple days to think it over? Take a couple days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUSIN_HUGH>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't need a couple days. I have the authority, and this is what I want. I haven't wanted something in a long time. We have other businesses we're converting to corporations. We can figure it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<COUSIN_SIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it's utterly unproductive land. It doesn't generate enough income to pay the goddamn taxes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUSIN_SIX>
<COUSIN_HUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the trustee. You know better than anyone we only have seven years left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUSIN_HUGH>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I have seven years to figure out how to keep it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
Cousin Hugh draws a long breath, looks up at the sky, then back at Matt.
</DIRECTION>
<COUSIN_HUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll come after you. Just because you're a lawyer doesn't mean the rest of us would be afraid to come after you. But nobody wants to do that. We're family.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUSIN_HUGH>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People will be relieved, Hugh, the whole state. I sign that document, it's over. End of the line. Something that was ours to protect will be gone. Even though we're haole as shit and go to private schools and clubs and can't even speak pidgin, let alone Hawaiian, we still carry Hawaiian blood, and we're still tied to this land. And our children are tied to this land. It's a miracle that for whatever bullshit reason 150 years ago, we own this much of... paradise, but we do. And for whatever bullshit reason now, I'm the trustee. And I'm not signing. And if you sue me, it'll only make us closer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
Cousin Hugh releases a long breath more like a belch, quickly picks his nose, exchanges a look with Cousin Six. Then he brings his fingers to his mouth to WHISTLE.
</DIRECTION>
<COUSIN_HUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, everybody, listen up. Cousin Mattie has an announcement. Get ready.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COUSIN_HUGH>
<DIRECTION>
Rising to his feet, Matt scans the faces of his relatives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the way Matt, Sid and the girls are positioned around the room, we can tell their presence there is now way of life. Scottie snoozes on the little sofa. We may notice that Elizabeth is even more shrunken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A KNOCK is followed by --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A VASE OF FLOWERS appearing in the doorway, topped by blonde hair and held by thin bronzed arms. It's JULIE SPEER.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Julie. What are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
He rises to help her find a spot to put the flowers. She nods to the girls.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know we just met, but I was thinking about you guys these past few days, and I knew your mom was here. I don't know. I just felt I should stop by.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You remember Alex. This is Scottie. Sid. This is Mrs. Speer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Julie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were you friends with my mom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, we never met. But I know a lot about her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
As they now do often, Matt and Alex exchange a look.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we appreciate your coming by. The flowers are lovely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<SID>
<DIRECTION>
(heading to the door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scottie, Alex. Let's go to the cafeteria.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<DIRECTION>
The girls follow Sid's prompt, leaving Matt alone with Julie, standing, a dying woman between them.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I, uh, I'm not sure how much you know about my wife's condition, but she's going to die very soon. Any minute, really. That's sort of why we're all here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. That's why I came. Because I know. I came because my husband wouldn't. And that just didn't seem right. I thought someone from my family should come.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Wow.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry I came to your house like that. Just barged in on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right. I assume you're angry. Of course you are. I'm angry too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So he told you, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After you left that night, he was acting really weird. Then I started smelling it all over him. I'd already smelled it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I finally got it out of him. We've been going crazy ever since. Not easy with the kids around. It's all something I never could have imagined. And then your family's decision about the land. I think you're doing the right thing, but Brian is -- well, it's all so complicated and confusing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brian told me everything. Well, how can I ever know it's everything? When did you find out? Have you known for a while?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a few days ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm angry, but I'm just so sorry. I can't imagine what you're going through. Do you mind if I say something to her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Matt is unsure but what else can he do? Julie approaches the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elizabeth, I'm Julie. Brian's wife. I just want to say I forgive you. I forgive you for trying to take Brian. I forgive you for almost destroying my family. I have to forgive you. Even though I want to hate you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. All right. That's enough, Julie. I think... I think that's enough.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
Matt walks to the door and opens it. Alex and Sid -- who've clearly had their ears against the door -- scamper away, unnoticed by Matt and Julie.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He didn't love her. Just so you know. He didn't really love her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<JULIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why I'm here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIE>
<DIRECTION>
Julie heads to the door. At the door, she looks at Matt. Matt looks at her. She leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Matt is left alone with his wife, and he realizes suddenly that this is his moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks to the bed, takes her hand, rubs his palm over her hair. He says something to her as though silently praying, then realizes he should say it aloud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He presses his lips to hers and puts his hand on her stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, Elizabeth. Goodbye, my love, my friend, my pain, my joy. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPICE HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door to Elizabeth's room opens, and Alexandra emerges, a far-away sadness on her face. She walks slowly toward --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A NEARBY WAITING AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- where Matt sits with Scottie and Sid. Matt and Sid rise to comfort her, but she's not in the mood. She allows them each to hug her briefly before turning to Scottie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Signaling to Matt to let her do this, Alex escorts a fearful Scottie toward Elizabeth's room, and, reassuring her, guides her little sister inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Matt and Sid are left alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE OCEAN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PADDLES in the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BOX ENCIRCLED BY LEIS sits tied to the seat of a small outrigger CANOE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MATT AND THE GIRLS navigate the canoe through the surf.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How far do we have to go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not that far. Just past the break.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Steer straighter, Dad. And a little faster, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm trying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
LATER --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Matt and the girls simply FLOAT, glancing from time to time at the urn in Scottie's lap. In the distance loom the hotels and high-rises of Waikiki.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, here we are, just the four of us. For the last time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then --)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alex, why don't you start? Scottie, hand her the box.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
Scottie does so. Alexandra takes the box reverently -- she wants to perform this sad, strange ceremony without messing up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She opens the box and pulls out a scoop of ashes, which Scottie looks at unblinking. Alex looks to Matt, who gives her the go-ahead, and without further ceremony pours them into the sea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ASHES fall densely in one spot, then slowly darken the water and disappear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alex looks down, struck by the weirdness of it all, before glancing up at Matt.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scottie, you're next. Go ahead, it's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
Alex passes the box and scooper to Scottie.
</DIRECTION>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What should I say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just say goodbye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
Scottie looks at Alex and scoops out a pile, holds them at eye-level, and pauses.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Scottie. It's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
(finally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bye, Mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
A sad Scottie pours her scoop into the water. All look down as the ashes descend.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, Scottie, here. Pass that to me. Good job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
Now Matt takes his turn. He looks directly inside the urn at the ashes that were once his wife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE ASHES -- HIS POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A complex series of emotions passes over his face -- love, grief, disappointment, resignation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without further ceremony he upends the BOX over the water and pours the rest of Elizabeth into the ocean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All three take a long look as the mass of ashes disappears. Matt takes off his LEI and places it into the water. The girls follow suit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE ANGLE of the boat floating as the leis float away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KING HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scottie lies on a sofa watching television, draped with the QUILT that lay atop her mother's hospital bed. Matt comes over with TWO DISHES, hands one to her.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One scoop strawberry, one scoop mocha chip.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<SCOTTIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTIE>
<DIRECTION>
Matt gets under the quilt with her. Moments later Alexandra wanders in, notices what they're watching, sits next to Matt, pulls the quilt over her legs.
</DIRECTION>
<ALEXANDRA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I have some?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALEXANDRA>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes not leaving the TV, Matt hands Alex his ice cream. As they sit there on the sofa, the CREDITS roll quietly over them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
