INT. UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GIRL'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
fills the screen, twenty-one years old, pensive, pretty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Camera lingers on her in CLOSE UP, noticing details: hair worn stylishly messy, no makeup, double-pierced ears (though no earrings today), the corner of her bottom lip a little frayed where she's been chewing it ruminatively.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's the kind of beauty who can withstand such bad lighting: institutional lighting, florescents HUMMING overhead, joining the chorus of ambient noises: a COUGH, papers RUSTLING, the SCRIBBLE of a pen, someone SHIFTING in their chair, etc. The shot lingers until it becomes uncomfortable, invasive, scrutinizing this unhappy girl in an unguarded moment, then -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A new sound breaks her reverie, a muted BUZZING o.s., and her eyes cut down to -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER CELLPHONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
skittering sideways across the closed cover of her blue final exam book, like a bug. She has an INCOMING TEXT MESSAGE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDEN TO REVEAL:

INT. UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL - ESTABLISHING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our GIRL is just one of two hundred other STUDENTS filling a big auditorium-style lecture hall. Around her, classmates sit grim-faced, scribbling to beat the clock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUR GIRL traps the buzzing cellphone before it skitters right off the edge of the half-desk, looks at the display.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT CELLPHONE DISPLAY -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our girl leans back a little in her seat, gives a little nod to her friend seated across the lecture hall. Types a reply.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT CELLPHONE DISPLAY -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
yes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT: CELL PHONE DISPLAY / OUR GIRL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks down as her friend text-messages:

<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Typing.

<DIRECTION>
bus. She sends the message, a moment later the reply appears:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sux 4 U. She glances up, sees her friend shoot her a sympathetic look.
</DIRECTION>
<PROCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it, people! Wrap it up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PROCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
There's a collective GROAN and the sound of two hundred panicked asses twisting in their seats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our girl feels her phone buzz, looks down to see a final text message from her friend:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
y don't u check the ride board?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A slow smile lights up her face at the idea, as all around her students rise and begin stampeding out.
</DIRECTION>
<PROCTOR>

(O.S.) (cont'd) (shouting to be heard)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Test results will be posted on the Philosophy Department's web site in two weeks... Enjoy your break and have a Happy New Year.

</PROCTOR>

She gathers her things, begins to make her way down the stairs when -
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
- she's JOSTLED from behind by a CLASSMATE bolting past her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hands in her exam book, waves to her friend, and exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NEW ENGLAND UNIVERSITY - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Campus is a ghost town, most students having already left for the holidays: the DORMS abandoned, the LIBRARY STACKS empty, the LABS silent, the DINING HALLS eerie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our GIRL hurries across the deserted college green dotted with little hillocks of snow from an earlier storm. She passes a forlorn pine tree decorated with CHRISTMAS LIGHTS, on her way to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UNIVERSITY - QUAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She arrives at a large, partially-enclosed KIOSK covered with dozens of student-made notices, printed in a rainbow of eye- catching computer fonts and colors. A sign at the top reads: RIDE BOARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She scans the posted notices. One catches her eye: torn hastily from a spiral notebook, on which is scrawled a handwritten message:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NE1 Need a Ride 2 Delaware 12/23? Call 607-154-9835.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gust of wind riffles the notice.

EXT. UNIVERSITY - STUDENT PARKING LOT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our girl wheels her suitcase across a largely-empty parking lot. It's late afternoon, and already dark enough for the sodium vapor streetlights to have come on. A few snowflakes swirl in their sickbed glow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow her to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat-to-shit 1988 OLDSMOBILE idling in the middle of the lot. An unbroken dusting of snow indicates it's been the only vehicle here for some time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An underclassman GUY, 19, is asleep behind the wheel of the Oldsmobile. He's skinny, dressed in thrift-shop clothes, has the complexion of someone who doesn't get out in the sun much. His car is filled with all of his earthly possessions: books, CD's in plastic milk crates, dirty laundry, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She knocks on the driver's side window, startling him awake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stirs, blinks uncomprehendingly at the empty parking lot.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think you could have parked any further from the entrance?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
The sight of her quickly snaps him awake. He scrambles out.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(still a little groggy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There were still cars when I got here. I thought we were going to get an early start to stay ahead of the snow?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What time is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quarter past three.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm two hours late?! Shit. Sorry. You should've just left without me. That's what I would've done. Hurry up and pop the trunk so I can stow my shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
He does.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks back to the trunk, which is stuffed to capacity with more of his things: CLOTHES, a bag of GROCERIES, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (calling to him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, I'm just going home for Christmas. What are you doing? Pulling up stakes and movin' your Oakie family to Californey?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She starts rearranging the trunk, making room for her bag.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm kinda getting kicked out of my apartment. I didn't have time to find someplace new before exams.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
She takes out some of his things. Puts them on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, let me help you with that-
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you just get the engine started and put the heat on? I can handle this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
He watches her rearrange his things, a little flummoxed.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well? What are you waiting for? I thought you wanted to stay ahead of the snow?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
He hurries back to the driver's seat. Starts the engine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hurriedly crams everything back in and slams the trunk. Then runs around to the passenger side and pulls on the door handle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stuck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now it's her turn to look impatient. She jerks on the handle again, until he leans over to open the door from the inside.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry... it sticks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
She rolls her eyes, climbs in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OLDSMOBILE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She climbs in, tries to power her window all the way to the top. It keeps getting stuck, leaving a half-inch gap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She shoots him a look: "What the hell?"
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's as far as it goes. Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
She rolls her eyes, never once interrupting her phone conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He puts the car in gear and they set out on their six hour roadtrip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. UNIVERSITY - STUDENT PARKING LOT - THAT MOMENT

As they drive off, reveal: a forgotten bag of GROCERIES, still sitting on the ground.

They leave campus. He eavesdrops as she rattles on.

	No, we're just rolling out...

<DIRECTION>

</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. OLDSMOBILE - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks out at the passing landscape as they cruise south on the interstate. The road is wet, though the snow hasn't yet started to stick.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs; on her cell)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, are you kidding? I'm bored to tears... No, we're still on the highway... how should I know, all highways look exactly alike.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She looks up, catches him shooting irritated looks her way.

</GIRL>
<GUY>

	You going to be on that thing the whole-

</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't finish the thought, just chokes back whatever he was about to say. Focuses on the highway ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(on her cell)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh oh, somebody's upset. I better call you back.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who do you think? Ride Board Guy. Okay, `bye.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She hangs up, aims the camera phone lens his way, and snaps another digital picture of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She puts the cellphone away, looks up to see him glaring at her.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>

	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't cool. If I have to drive, you have to talk to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, I'm the in-flight entertainment?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's how this ride-sharing thing works. Division of labor. We split everything fifty-fifty... Get it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got news for you, I don't get much more entertaining than when I'm on the phone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
He darkens, mutters under his breath:
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(sarcastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is turning out great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
They ride in silence for a moment. She tries to strike up a conversation, by way of extending an olive branch.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're from Wilmington, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd you go to school?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(falters for a second)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um... Saint Vitus Academy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	St. Vitus? You're making that up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're acquainted with every school in the area?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty much, yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Including all the Catholic ones? Because that's where I went. Saint Vitus Academy for Catholic Boys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, fine...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
They drive for a few moments in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We had a class together, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Intro to Modern Philosophy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her expectantly, as if she should remember him.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? There were about a million people in that class. It was like Woodstock. Did you ever see so many Eastern religion types?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, what's your major?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eastern religions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
She hoots with laughter. But he's not kidding. He seems surprised by her response.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You aren't majoring in philosophy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I just assumed...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would you assume anything about me? We just met.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(a little defensive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know... I guess you just... look like a philosophy major.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try engineering.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She enjoys the pained look of surprise on his face, lets him twist for a second before explaining:
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I only took Philosophy because I need a humanities credit. I heard it was an easy `A.'
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, that reminds me. What'd you put for the extra credit question on the final?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nietzsche's theory of eternal recurrence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which is basically reincarnation, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, they're not really the same thing. Reincarnation is when you come back as something different and eternal recurrence is when you live the same life over and over again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
He looks out at the road, reciting Nietzsche from memory:
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The eternal hourglass of existence is turned over and over, and you with it, a grain of dust.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him as if he's nuts. A beat, then:
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He died of syphilis, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
He stares grimly at the road ahead, biting back a comment.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	High school and philosophy. Pretty much covers everything, don't you think? Guess that concludes the entertainment portion of today's flight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>

She turns on the radio, finds a station with Christmas music.

INT. OLDSMOBILE - EVENING

Her bare feet are propped on the dash, as she removes the old nail polish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Widen. She's turned the front seat into a nail salon. Cotton balls, emery boards, bottles of clear and colored varnish are strewn everywhere.
</DIRECTION>

She picks a bottle, opens it, begins painting her nails.

<GIRL>

	Next gas station you see, do me a favor and pull over. I gotta pee.

</GUY>
<GIRL>

	That phrase. `Keeping your eyes peeled.' It's kind of creepy, if you think about it.

</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh. Actually, yeah, it is sorta.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes linger on her freshly painted toes on the dashboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She catches him staring. He blushes, embarrassed. Says:
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Speaking of peeling eyeballs. Did you know that's how they do that corrective eye surgery?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They use a laser.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, yeah, they do... But there's definitely peeling involved too. I saw it on Discovery Health. If more people knew about the peeling part they might think twice before going under the knife.

</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Laser.

</GUY>
<GIRL>

<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But they look good on you.

She frowns.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>

	How do you know? I don't wear them outside my dorm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
He gets a cornered look.

He breaks off, saved by the sight of a gas station up ahead.

He starts the pump. Notices her still seated in the car.

He knocks on her window. She opens the door.

<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you had to pee?

He looks over the roof of the car, sizing up the distance across the slushy parking lot.

	Hold on.

</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?! Wait -

</GIRL>

Suddenly he's rising and she throws her arms instinctively around his neck.

Unsettling as the deeply-weird moment is, she decides it's best to just humor him. But first -
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)

	I need my purse.

The door JINGLES as he enters, carrying her. His face is red from effort, hers from embarrassment.

<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.

He just stands there. She taps him on the shoulder.

	You can let me down now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.

</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
He crouches so she can slide off. She gives him a look, slips on the pair of flip-flops she's brought with her, then heads off in search of the ladies bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, our guy saunters up toward the front of the convenience store. He nods to the twitchy CLERK, 20s, engrossed in a tattoo fetish magazine behind the counter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PENN-WAY QUICK MART - BATHROOM - THAT MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The toilet is gross, tiled a queasy green, graffiti-covered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our girl finishes peeing, gets up from the toilet, uses her foot to flush and her elbow to turn on the faucet. She washes her hands, holding them under the automatic dryer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Broken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She wipes her hands dry on her jeans. Is about to exit when she catches sight of her reflection in the dirty mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On impulse she takes out her glasses from her purse. Slips them on. Checks herself out in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cool? Sexy?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With her glasses on she notices something scratched into the dirty mirror.

<J_C_R_12_24_88_R_I_P>
<DIRECTION>
She frowns, slips her glasses back in their case and moves to exit. But when she grips the doorknob she finds it LOCKED. She frowns. Rattles the doorknob a few times.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A look of panic crosses her face, and she starts rattling the doorknob harder. Did someone lock her in?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the doorknob comes off in her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pounds on the door with the heel of her palm, shouts:
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HEY. HEY, I'M LOCKED IN HERE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns, scanning the filthy bathroom, notices something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER POV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A VENT above the sink, near the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She puts a foot up into the sink, testing it to see if it can take her weight. Then climbs up and straightens on wobbly legs, until her face is near the filthy dust-clogged vent.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (calling into vent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HEY. CAN ANYBODY HEAR ME?! HEY!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Her voice ECHOES weirdly. When the echoes die down she hears something from the vent that makes her scowl: LAUGHTER. As if our guy and the clerk are having a good laugh at her expense.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pissed off now, she climbs back down, and attacks the broken doorknob with renewed urgency.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And finally succeeds in getting the door to open.
</DIRECTION>

As she exits she sees the CLERK and our guy talking quietly, as if they know one another. She hesitates for a second, spying on them around a display of chips. Suspicious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE COUNTER:

<DIRECTION>
She strides up as the guy pays for the gas and a couple bottles of water.

He gathers up the bottled water, heads toward the door. The clerk calls to him:

	Remember, highway's your best bet-

As they exit and start toward the car she offers him a twenty. He looks at the money, as if he's never seen U.S. currency before.

<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that for?

	I don't take money from friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Since when are they friends?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They separate, walking around to their respective sides of the car. She tries the passenger door handle, only to find it stuck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She rolls her eyes, waits for him to open it from the inside.

INT. OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stares out at the road ahead, lulled by the sound of the windshield wipers sweeping snowflakes from side to side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER POV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A nondescript exit comes up fast for a side road. Which wouldn't be cause for alarm or even interest except-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He suddenly turns the wheel sharply, taking the exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OLDSMOBILE - THAT MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car veers off the interstate onto a much smaller two-lane road marked with a simple sign, paint-on-wood, faded to illegibility: Scenic Route 606.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tires crunch across an old chain which had once prevented access to the road but is now half-buried in the snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Attached to it is a diamond-shaped warning sign of a more modern vintage reading: Rough Road.

He looks a little pissed she's questioning his judgment.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you chill. It's a shortcut. We'll be back on the highway before you know it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Hard to argue with a shortcut...

Nonetheless, she glances back with a look of trepidation OUT THE BACK WINDOW at the highway receding into the distance.

The Oldsmobile cruises by, the only car on the two-lane scenic highway.

As it leaves FRAME camera PANS to the dead grass on the roadside where it finds a sad little SHRINE half-buried in the snow: two homemade crosses, candle stumps, a rotting stuffed bear, deflated Mylar balloons.

Scrawled on the crosses are:

She watches him suspiciously out of the corner of her eye. His face is eerie in the green light of the dashboard.

He scans the radio dial for something other than static.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not many radio stations out here.

Then he drives in silence. Still stewing over her most recent digs.

He's right. On the passenger side the road abuts a steep wooded hillside. Opposite that it drops off into a ravine.

They are both too distracted by the ONCOMING HEADLIGHTS to notice the Christmas SONG that's just come on the RADIO: Brenda Lee's 1958 hit "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree."

Snow boils in its headlights.

<DIRECTION>
The interior is dark.

The girl has been thrown under the dash. It's hard to tell in this light whether she's still breathing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally she stirs, disoriented.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She climbs back into her seat, piecing together where she is. It takes her a beat to remember him. She looks over slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's not moving, though thanks to his seatbelt he's still upright behind the wheel. His head rests limply against the driver's window, which now looks out on nothing but snowbank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A link of blood trickles down the glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dead?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's not taking any chances. Without a sound she slips into her shoes, coat. Gropes for her cellphone among the detritus at her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he stirs, groaning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The seconds ticking by on the DASHBOARD CLOCK.

When he doesn't wake, she resumes fumbling for her cell.

Finds it. Then eases open the creaky passenger door.

And launches herself into the frigid night.

He puts his hand to the left side of his skull and pushes on it. Like someone testing a melon for ripeness.

Come to think of it, his speech is a little wooden.

She watches as he turns and takes a few aimless steps away.

She's completely forgotten all about the other vehicle until now. She turns to look, puzzled.

<DIRECTION>
There's no sign of the other vehicle anywhere. They're alone.

	I don't know. I guess maybe he decided just to hit and run.

	So where are his tire tracks?

</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks, sees an unbroken expanse of fresh white snow.

<GUY>

(points)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but you can still see our tracks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
The mystery of the missing tracks seems to have penetrated his post-accident fog, bringing him back into sharper focus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She watches as he walks out in front of the Olds' headlights to the middle of the road, where the other vehicles track's should be.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)

	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell?!

He walks back to the Olds and opens the passenger door (the only access into or out of the stranded car, thanks to the snowbank). He begins searching the glove compartment for a flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON HER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Deliberating whether to seize this moment of distraction to make a break for it.

<DIRECTION>
She looks back down the long dark road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looks back at him bent over rummaging in the Oldsmobile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Too risky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Curiosity getting the better of her, she walks out to the middle of the road to have a look for herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just an expanse of fresh powder and a few of his footprints.

(to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This doesn't make any sense...

</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment he emerges from the car with a flashlight. He spokes it, sweeps the strong beam over their surroundings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The left side of the road falls off into a darkness so deep even the flashlight's beam can't penetrate it. A precipice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He cups his hand and calls out at the top of his lungs.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
His voice is swallowed by the dark. After the echoes subside the only sound in the hush is the SIZZLE of falling snow and a weird otherworldly HUM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He snaps off his flashlight, thrusts it into his coat pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>

He holds the passenger door for her while she scrambles in, scooting over into the driver's seat. He leaves the door open so they can communicate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks back to the rear of the stranded Oldsmobile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's pulling on gloves when something half-buried in the snow nearby catches his eye. He takes out the flashlight, shines it at the roadside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Little wooden crosses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just two this time. Another sad shrine, to a different set of anonymous victims of Route 606.

Their proximity to the stranded Olds obviously unsettles him.

Cranking... cranking... cranking...

Finally turning over.

She slips the Oldsmobile in gear, and he starts pushing.

She floors it; the tires SCREAMING.

He puts everything he's got into pushing, but it's no use.
</DIRECTION>

Suddenly his face contorts in pain and he clutches his side. He drops out of view, disappearing in a cloud of red exhaust.

A beat later he pulls himself up, pounds on the trunk.

She's sitting in the driver's seat of the idling car when she hears the crunch-crunch-crunch of his approaching footsteps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In that moment she makes a decision.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Scrambles across the front seat, pulls the door shut hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - THAT MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He arrives at the passenger side door handle just as the power locks all go THUNK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's locked out.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, open up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
He tugs at the handle a few times. Knocks on the window.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanna pop the locks?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
When there's no response from her he puts his lips to the half-inch gap at the top of the stuck window.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gonna unlock the door or what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
She sees him cup his hands and peering in through the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She keeps her eyes down, focuses on her shaking fingers as they frantically dial her cellphone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No signal.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, c'mon, it's freezing out here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better get used to it, asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
He rattles the door handle, starting to get panicked now.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell is wrong with you? What did I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
But she's in full-blown paranoid mode now, near hysterics.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You drove us here, that's what you did!! What the hell did you think you were doing!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought I was driving you home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not driving me home because one, you don't live near my home and two, this piece of shit isn't driving anywhere. Now what are we doing here? Why did you get off the highway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you, this is a shortcut. Anyway, you were the one who said she was so bored on the highway. This used to be called `Scenic 606' because there's an amazing view of the valley-
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One, you've never been anywhere near here before so don't pretend you knew it's a shortcut, and two, there's an amazing view of shit BECAUSE IT'S PITCH BLACK OUT!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
He stands there as she freaks out.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me get this straight. You think I intentionally arranged for us get stranded out here?! It was an accident! You saw the other car. You think he was in on it, too?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(raving)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe! Maybe he's like your Black Pete or something! Why the hell did you tell me that story anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're crazy...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(lying)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, I've got news for you... I got through to a friend's voicemail while you were supposedly unconscious. I'm sure she's called the cops by now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you listen to yourself? What kind of psycho do you think I am?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
He straightens, exasperated, puts a hand to his injured head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him standing there, hugging himself against the sub-zero cold, his teeth chattering. He doesn't look like an ax-murderer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't know what to do. There's a long beat. Finally, he throws up his hands in disgust, decides to go to Plan B.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna walk back to the gas station for help. You've got the heater and the radio, so you should be all right here. Though I really think you should consider coming with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bet you do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(pissed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. Whatever. If you feel a draft and you want to patch this...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Sticking his fingertips through the half-inch gap at the top of the stuck passenger side window.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I keep duct tape in the back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(sarcastic)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bet you do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
He looks in at her one last time, exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She listens to the crunch of his footsteps until she can't hear them anymore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly there's a loud BANG against the passenger side window. She jumps.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	BUT IT'S MY CAR!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
He goes crazy on the stranded Olds: punching the roof, jerking the door handle, kicking the door, screaming at her the whole time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She cowers inside, scared to death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally he gives up, and with a final BANG to the roof, exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and heads back down the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We watch through the rear window as he trudges robotically away, his boots crunch-crunch-crunching in the snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops. Leans his weight against a tree. Looks back at the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whatever it is he's doing, he's clearly not walking to the gas station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He straightens, and continues on until he's out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE / ROADSIDE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stranded Oldsmobile sits on the roadside, engine running, hood and windshield covered in white. The interior lights are on, giving it an enchanted look, like a cottage in a Grimm's fairytale.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's in the back seat ransacking his suitcase and other possessions, looking for the duct tape. Despite the heater it's cold enough in the car (thanks to the gap in the window) to see her breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT plays on the car's radio.
</DIRECTION>
<RADIO_PSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... The National Weather Service has issued a Winter Storm Warning for the entire Eastern Seaboard...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Boxer shorts. Socks. Box of condoms. A copy of the Tibetan Book of the Dead. A cheap Radio Shack TELEPHONE wrapped in its cord. A CROW BAR, which she tosses up to the front seat.
</DIRECTION>
<RADIO_PSA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Carbon County residents can expect snow accumulations of four to six inches...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly we see -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BLUR OF MOVEMENT outside the car's foggy REAR WINDOW...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But she's too busy searching through the junk in the back seat to notice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally she finds what she's looking for: silver DUCT TAPE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Also a PAIR OF SCISSORS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She holds the scissors like a dagger, clearly thinking they could come in useful if she needs to defend herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She climbs up front, rips off a three-foot length of tape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again, in the b.g. -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MORE MOVEMENT outside the car...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But she's too busy sealing the passenger's side window against the frigid draft to notice that someone's outside.
</DIRECTION>
<RADIO_PSA>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... State and local officials are urging residents to remain indoors, as wind chills plunge to fifteen below overnight...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Finally -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She glimpses MOVEMENT outside the passenger window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gasps, ducking out of sight below the car's dashboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't move, listening, her eyes bright with fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a long beat she risks a peek over the steering wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The windshield is fogged, so she wipes a peephole in the condensate. It's too dark to see much beyond the car's hood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches shaking fingers toward the steering column.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flicks on the headlights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A STRANGER is walking away down the middle of the dark road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She screams, reaches instinctively to check the power locks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stranger, a black man dressed in a dirty suit, walks with hunched shoulders. Snow swirling around him in the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Who the hell takes a stroll in the middle of a snowstorm?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over her initial shock now, she reaches for the door handle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROUTE 606 - ROADSIDE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She gets out of the car, clutching the SCISSORS in both hands like a dagger. She stands behind the protection of the open car door and calls out to the stranger moving down the middle of the snowy road a dozen yards ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a weird HUMMING noise in the air she can't place.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
No reaction from the stranger.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Do you live around here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Again, nothing. Maybe he's deaf?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She moves out from behind the safety of the car door and starts after the stranger, keeping her distance as she calls:
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We had an accident. My friend went for help. He'll be back any second.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
The stranger's dapper suit is more than dishevelled. It's soaking wet, caked in motor oil or some other dark slime.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kinda crappy night for a walk, don't you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
And there's something definitely "off about his shuffling. It's like he's crippled, or injured. In fact he seems to be CRYING. (Or is it moaning?)
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, wait!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
But the stranger just keeps shuffling toward the shoulder of the road, headed in the direction of the DARK STAND OF TREES beyond. Soon he moves beyond the reach of the headlights and disappears into the gloom.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell - !?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Spooked, she begins to back toward the stranded Oldsmobile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Backs into -
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
She SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus! Calm down. It's just me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay away from me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She brandishes the SCISSORS. He puts up two hands defensively.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa! Take it easy. What's wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You! Everything! The guy-
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What guy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, it was weird. I saw some guy walking down the road.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did he go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Into the woods.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes keep cutting back and forth between him and the woods where the stranger disappeared, as if not sure which is the greater threat.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look. It's freezing out here. Let's just get in the car and you can tell me what happened...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(paranoid)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing back so soon? What about hiking to the gas station?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was closed. I was going to leave a note, but I didn't... You know. Have anything to write with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
She clutches the scissors tighter, not believing a word.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But those places are supposed to stay open 24/7! Why wasn't it open?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How the hell should I know?! Independent operator. Look, can we continue this conversation in the car, `cause I'm freezing my balls off standing out here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(shrieks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not getting into the car with you, you psycho!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
He closes his eyes and shakes his head, beyond frustrated.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. Whatever. I'm getting in. You're welcome to join me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and trudges back to the Oldsmobile, climbs in, and pulls the door shut after him. Leaving her there in the snowy road, clutching the scissors, her teeth chattering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stands there, shivering, looking very small and alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLD on her as she weighs her options: stay out here and freeze. Or risk seeking shelter with a stalker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not much of a choice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks over as the door wrenches open and she climbs in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls the door shut behind her, then huddles against it. Eyeing him warily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to reach toward her and she brandishes the scissors-
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
- and switches off the overhead interior lights, explaining:
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need to conserve the battery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
With the interior light off the car fills with an otherwordly blue glow reflected off the snow. She pulls her knees up as if trying to make herself as small as she can, to position herself as far away from him as is humanly possible on a bench seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes cut to the DASHBOARD CLOCK. She frowns.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not right. The clock...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(checks watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh? No, it's not. It should read...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
He frowns, looking down at his watch. He holds it to his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My watch stopped. Oh well... Guess we'll just have to rely on my precisely calibrated body clock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
He tosses his useless watch over his shoulder into the back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly she notices a trickle of blood coming from his head.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're bleeding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
He touches two fingers to the left side of his head. They come away bloody. As he lifts his watch cap we see the left side of his head is matted with frozen blood, now beginning to melt. The collar of his coat is soaked with it.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's nothing...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It doesn't look like nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scalp wounds bleed a lot. Head wounds in general. That's why, if you're ever in a bar fight, the thing to do is pick up a bottle and smash the other guy across the bridge of his nose. It'll make his eyes fill with blood and snot, and buy you enough time to run away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(softening, amused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's really useful, thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
A tense silence fills the car. He closes his eyes and leans his head back, as if trying to catch a few Z's.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So where are you from, really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(eyes closed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Place called Glens Falls...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not in Delaware.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's, like, in the complete opposite direction!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's like twenty minutes from school!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, all right, so I lied... Obviously.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Eyes still closed, he answers in a flat uninflected voice.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just thought you seemed cool. I don't have a line or a `game' or whatever the hell it's called. So when I saw a chance to get you alone for six uninterrupted hours, I took it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
She ponders this for a beat, one piece still not clicking.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But how did you know where I lived?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Asked around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which explains how you found out I was from Delaware... But not how you knew I needed a ride home. I mean, I always fly. How could you possibly know that for, like the first time in my college career, I was planning on going Greyhound-
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Just then her eyes go wide, as it suddenly dawns on her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SERIES OF QUICK CUTS revisits events from earlier that day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- The text message, "y don't u check the ride board?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- Her looking up, smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- Sitting behind her, reading the message: OUR GUY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- Who bolts from his seat the instant class is dismissed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- Who turns out to be the one who jostled her on his way out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- He races across the empty quad, scribbling on the run.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- Tears the improvised notice out of his spiral notebook.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- Slaps it up on the RIDE BOARD just in the nick of time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- As she enters and sees: "NE1 Need a ride 2 Delaware 12/23?"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK ENDS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - AS BEFORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him, the pieces all finally falling into place. He makes no effort to explain. Doesn't even open his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(bitter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive me for attempting a romantic gesture.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Romantic? Try stalkerish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not if things worked out between us...I would've told you everything eventually, and then it wouldn't be stalkerish. It would just be this sweet funny story we'd have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
He sits up sharply, temper boiling over, glaring at her.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, you've made your point! I'm a creep who gets off on chauffeuring women under false pretenses. Can we drop this already?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(changing subject)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ. I'm starving. You hungry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
He leans over the seatback, begins rummaging in the back.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you see a bag of groceries in the trunk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
At mention of groceries she temporarily drops the topic of the gas station. Remembers:
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Oh, shit. I think I might've left it in the parking lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. It was an accident-
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit! I spent sixty bucks on this gourmet crap you like! Saint Andre's cheese and Carr's crackers and those stupid little French pickles, I forget what they're called-
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cornichons... I love cornichons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
He sighs, slumps back behind the steering wheel, defeated.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROUTE 606 - ROADSIDE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wind blows. In between gusts it's quiet, except for the strange HUM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's still huddled up front, still holding her scissors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's in the back seat, scouring the car for anything edible, scrounging Tic Tacs, stale pretzel nibs, a candy bar, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I remember losing pack of Big Red down the back seat cushions last week...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
He thrusts his hand between the seat cushions like a scuba diver feeling for lobster under a coral reef.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWN THE BACK SEAT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His hand fumbles in the dark space below the seat cushions, among the seatbelts, lost nickels and dimes, lint.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly his eyes go wide as something lurking under the seats seizes his hand and jerks him in hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She GASPS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His face contorts in agony.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then changes to a smile, as he pulls his hand free, unhurt, holding a stick of gum.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kidding.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him in mute fury and disbelief. He shrugs, unwraps a stick of Big Red and pops it into his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly his hand shoots out and seizes her wrist holding the scissors. Her eyes go wide in terror and she starts to resist, but his grip is too strong.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(gritted teeth)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let go, goddamnit...

The kids have retreated to the front- and back seats for privacy while they change. Not an easy proposition in the cramped quarters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She strips down to bra and panties as demurely as possible. Puts on his insulated underwear and the rest of their things.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slips on his woefully inadequate shirts and pants. It's obvious he gave the warmest stuff to her. Also that he took the backseat because it's more cramped than the front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once they're finished dressing he reaches up, switches off the interior light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They lie in the blue darkness for a few moments of silence, watching their breath plume in the cold air. [Note: from this point on, their breath will always be visible in the car.]

She climbs out into the bitter cold, hunched against the howling wind, and moves off as far as she dares from the car.

She fumbles with the buttons and zippers of her multiple layers, turns her back to the car, squats to pee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her teeth chatter as she does her business, one wary eye peeled to catch the guy peeking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, out of the gloom appears -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DARK FIGURE, moving by very near her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She GASPS. Tumbles back onto her ass. As she's struggling to pull up her pants -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MORE DARK FIGURES appear, moving in the same direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the figures enter the woods their leader turns so she glimpses his face: elderly and unremarkable at first glance, then for an instant CHANGING into a twisted ashen deathmask.

Her SCREAM brings our guy BOLTING out of the car.

Our guy ducks back into the car, retrieves a flashlight from the glove compartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He eases the door shut, carefully so it doesn't latch and accidentally lock them out.

Only to find NO ONE THERE.

She looks where he's pointing with the flashlight-

HER POV:

On the wooded slope on the opposite slope of the ravine are SEVERAL TALL OLD MEN IN DARK COATS, dispersing through the woods. As if whatever somber occasion that brought them to the ravine has ended.

She trudges on ahead, her footsteps growing FAINTER, finally fading entirely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's alone now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leans against a tree to catch his breath, wincing in pain. For an instant it seems like he's going to be sick. But then he just hocks up phlegm and spits into the pure white snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blood.

<DIRECTION>
Though still winded, he pushes on.

A few minutes later he trudges into view. Looks around. No sign of our girl.

He arrives at the top of the hill. Silhouetted against the night sky. Treeless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His flashlight finds the few vertical objects still standing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A RUINED BUILDING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Windowless and long-abandoned, its ceiling and walls caved in around a large stone chimney.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crunches inside and examines the black maw of the large stone fireplace, now stuffed with trash and dead leaves. His flashlight beam finds a SMALL IRON DOOR built into the side of the chimney.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FIREBOX.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He kneels in the snow and tugs the little iron door open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gingerly slips his arm inside the firebox.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Retrieves a bunch of OLD NEWSPAPERS. He stuffs them inside the front of his jacket. Continues rummaging around in the firebox.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he rises he winces in pain, one hand going to his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes slow breaths until the pain subsides.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns in a slow circle. His flashlight sweeps over the interior of the abandoned ruins, the beam picking out what look like branches -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HUMAN HANDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
frozen into claws, reaching from...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FROZEN BODY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's lying on the bare springs of a metal bedframe: teeth clenched in a terrible rictus, icicles dripping from nose, clawlike fingers, eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's so startled he nearly drops the flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wayward light finding ANOTHER FROZEN CORPSE in a nearby bed mere feet away: another rictus grimace, clawlike fingers seeming to reach for him. And then another. And another...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All OLD MEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frozen in their death throes, like the bodies from Pompeii.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONE OF THE BEDS is EMPTY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our guy sweeps the flashlight beam to the side and finds the bed's occupant: frozen sitting upright in an old wooden wheelchair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eye to eye with him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reels in horror, trips, LOSES THE FLASHLIGHT as he goes sprawling. Then recovers, snatching the flashlight up again and sweeping it back in the direction of the frozen bodies -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And sees NOTHING: No beds. No old men...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just his footprints in the snow.

Our girl emerges from the trees, having decided to give up the chase and return to the safety of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as she's reaching for the door handle she GASPS -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As a FIGURE suddenly appears out of the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's the black STRANGER from earlier, shuffling and mumbling. This time he's close enough for her to make out some of the words he's muttering:
</DIRECTION>
<STRANGER>

	...please, officer, please don't...

</STRANGER>

Determined not to let him vanish again, she takes off in pursuit, coming alongside him and keeping pace as he shuffles down the middle of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<STRANGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...don't put me in the river...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STRANGER>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly she glances down, sees why he's shuffling so oddly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His ankles above his sodden dress shoes are bound with BALING WIRE, as are his wrists.

She reaches toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The instant her hand nears him the wind HOWLS DEAFENINGLY. She experiences a sudden powerful JOLT, almost as if she's grabbed a live wire... only instead of electric heat she feels a terrible otherwordly cold...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frostbite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The jolt stuns the stranger out of his daze, and for the first time he becomes aware of her. He raises his frightened eyes to her slowly, and in doing so reveals his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A scream builds in her throat at sight of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stranger's face is bloodless, bloated, swollen with rot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sludgy gargling noise comes from his throat and his mouth moves, as if he's trying to speak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But instead of words emerging, his throat suddenly bulges. Something's in there, fighting its way up his esophagus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She watches in horror as it emerges, blind and wriggling like a blood-fattened leech. Forcing its way out through his lips to land at his feet with a wet PLOP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It lies there writhing in the fresh snow.

The girl, quicker to catch on than the guy, puts a hand on his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(whispers)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a shake-down. He's probably partners with the guy who ran us off the road. Wouldn't be surprised if he has a deal with the tow guy, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to her, says in an angry whisper -
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think this whole thing was a scam? Jesus, he could've killed us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
But she's already digging cash out of her purse.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(fierce whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much cash do you have on you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her in disbelief. Sees that she's serious. He digs out his wallet, starts to climb over her to exit. She stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How many speeding tickets have you sweet-talked your way out of?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
He concedes her point silently. She plucks the money from his hand. Opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE / ROADSIDE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She exits the stranded car into the frigid cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cop waits, facing away, in the spotlight-like glare of his IDLING PATROL CAR's headlights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks back toward him, finds him mopping the back of his neck with a handkerchief.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is all we have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<HIGHWAY_PATROLMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Some weather we're having...

	So what do you say? How `bout a little Christmas spirit here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<HIGHWAY_PATROLMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(still facing away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, this is one bad stretch of road. All kinds of trouble going on up here: Kids drag racing. Niggers hauling booze across the state lines. Lady drivers breaking down, no-one ever hears from them again...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HIGHWAY_PATROLMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Her bravado begins to flag. This isn't the kind of police officer she's used to dealing with. She glances worriedly back in the direction of the Olds.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We just want to get out of here, so if you could just-
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She holds out the money, but he ignores it.
</DIRECTION>
<HIGHWAY_PATROLMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me tell you, I've seen a lot of fatalities on this road...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HIGHWAY_PATROLMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He takes off his hat so he can mop his brow. As he turns, she gets a first good look at his face: handsome but hard, with cruel snake charmer's eyes looking back at her...
</DIRECTION>
<HIGHWAY_PATROLMAN>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're lucky I came along when I did. So why don't we get in my car...

</HIGHWAY_PATROLMAN>
<DIRECTION>
She's scared now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks past him to where the HIGHWAY PATROL car sits idling in a red plume of exhaust fumes.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(backing away)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think maybe I just want to go back-

</GIRL>
<HIGHWAY_PATROLMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HIGHWAY_PATROLMAN>
<DIRECTION>
She startles as if slapped, too horrified to parse his meaning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She continues backing away until she's backed up against the trunk of the Olds.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
The cop is advancing toward her when suddenly he catches sight of something high on the hillside behind her that makes him stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She glances over her shoulder to see what he's looking at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LIGHT on the hilltop, where the burned-out ruins stand. And weirder still, there's a FIGURE in silhouette standing nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Someone watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cop darkens, enraged by this unwanted audience. His face contorts, fury building in him until he trembles with it. He rests his hand on the butt of his service revolver, says to her in a low urgent voice:
</DIRECTION>
<HIGHWAY_PATROLMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get in the damn patrol car...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HIGHWAY_PATROLMAN>
<DIRECTION>
She starts walking toward the parked patrol car ahead of him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The highway patrolman's boots CRUNCHING behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The patrol car's HEADLIGHTS are blinding. She moves towards them, squinting, as if moving down a tunnel of light.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(terrified; beginning to cry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please... just let us go...

(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get away from her you bastard!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the guy appears brandishing a CROWBAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He swings it in a lethal arc toward the patrolman's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cop's head crumples inward. The cop's expression of FURY suddenly STUTTERS, like film slipping in the projector -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As two worlds that should never intersect, do, violently -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For an instant, the cop's face appears...charred. Like a human face projected onto a scorched and melting balloon. The image flickers -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And on an ear-splitting HOWL we -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH CUT TO:

Suddenly, jarringly, the kids are seated BACK INSIDE THE CAR.

As if someone hit RESET.

</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Our guy winces in pain. TILT DOWN to reveal:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS HANDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frostbitten, still clutching the crowbar. She tries to take it out of his bloody, blackened hands and he GASPS in agony.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Jesus. OK. Hold on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>

She pours water from a plastic bottle over his palms to try and break the seal between the fused skin and metal.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>

	<DIALOGUE>
	OK, hold on, this is going to hurt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
She fights her own gag reflex as she pulls the crowbar free. It comes away with several long black strips of dead skin still attached. His palms are bloody pulps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He fights to hold himself together as she ministers to him. The pain is so bad it brings tears to his eyes. His teeth chatter; he's teetering on the edge of shock.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How bad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't make fun. What else do you have going on when you're thirteen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She stretches herself out alongside him in the back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tugs up her layers of sweaters to expose her stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm kinda not in the mood anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have to rewarm your hands. You have ice crystals in your blood. If we don't get circulation restored you could lose your fingers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She takes his frostbitten hands and gingerly as possible presses them against the warm skin of her belly, rewarming them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They lie there in silence for a beat, faces inches apart.

</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then how do we make it stop?

<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something Book of the Dead.

<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tibetan. It's not a How-to manual. It's an 8th century Buddhist guide on death and dying.

(despairing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God. Why is this happening to us?

She closes her eyes, imagining the meal that might've been.

<GIRL>

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's pretty much the exact meal I'd order for my last day on earth. I swear to god, if we ever get out of here I'm going to have to get a restraining order against-

If they ever get out of here. Her eyes brim, tears spilling down her cheeks. He tries to sound optimistic.

	Hang on. I think I have a few Tylenol-with-codeine in my purse.
	</DIALOGUE>

She climbs into the front seat and searches through her purse for the prescription bottle. With the poor light and without her contacts she has trouble finding it. She takes out her glasses and, a little embarrassed, slips them on.

There's a faded PHOTOGRAPH of a group of ELDERLY PRIESTS gathered around a MANGLED `55 FORD CROWN VIC. We recognize one of them, glancing back over his shoulder at the camera, as the LEADER of the mysterious procession of DARK FIGURES from earlier.

Both kids are asleep in the back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's dreaming, her eyes roving behind closed lids. All of a sudden she stirs, eyes fluttering open in the dark. Shivers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Woken by a cold draft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She shivers, sits up, disentangling herself from the guy snoring quietly beside her in the cramped back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She locates the source of the draft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The STUCK PASSENGER WINDOW up front, where the duct-tape- newspaper patch has come loose. She shivers as a gust of wind blows a few snowflakes in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs the roll of duct tape, climbs up into the front. Tears off a fresh strip of tape off to replace the old one. She smooths it in place, her teeth chattering between yawns.

Just then the radio SNAPS on by itself.

She holds still, scared to move, scared to even breathe.

Her eyes cut to the interior light as it starts flickering in a weird staccato way that's more Morse Code than loose wire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a few seconds it stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The seconds creep by on the dashboard clock.
</DIRECTION>

She peeks over the front seat looking out the back window, wondering where his highway patrol car is.

Which is when a gloved fist PUNCHES THROUGH THE WINDOW and hauls her kicking and screaming out of the Oldsmobile...

... and into a sweltering summer night in the late 1950s...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What follows is brutal and hallucinatory: a SERIES OF SHOTS that thrust us into the sickening first person POV of a BLONDE young woman, 19, in the final moments of her life. The RASP of CICADAS in the treetops provide the only soundtrack to the assault, as we see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- CLOSE ON their feet, high heels and boots, doing a violent two-step as he drags her along the gravel road shoulder
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- HANDHELD footage as she's dragged toward his idling patrol car
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- POV of a FULL MOON in the tree-tops, dispassionate spectator to the assault going on on this lonely stretch of road
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- CLOSE UP of the COP'S MOUTH, twisted with lust as he whispers something obscene we cannot hear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- CLOSE ON his HAND working it's way up to her throat, forcing his thick hairy thumb between her lips and making her suck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- POV underneath his patrol car, as his boots kick her feet apart, and take up position between them
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- The brim of his hat lifting to reveal him looking up with a scowl of surprise
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- And the cop's scowl curdles into a look of outrage at sight of --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- SILHOUETTES of old men watching on the hilltop, roused by the commotion down on the road below --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- The cop wrenches open the back door of the car, hurls her in, slams the door shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- He shoots a warning look in the direction of the SILHOUETTES ON THE HILLTOP that says, "Don't fuck with me..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Then he climbs behind the wheel of his car and drives off.

<DIRECTION>
He doesn't get to finish his sentence: Her eyes roll back in her head and she collapses again, as if yanked down by an undertow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She starts violently CONVULSING in the cramped confines of the back seat, limbs flailing, feet kicking windows, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our guy tries everything to wake her: shaking her shoulders, slapping her face hard. But it's no use: the nightmare has her again.
</DIRECTION>

He sits back, helplessly looking on.

Suddenly the radio SNAPS ON mid-song, scaring the crap out of him.

In a SERIES OF HALLUCINATORY SHOTS we see the BLONDE'S LIFELESS BODY -- shoeless, dress torn -- being dragged through the undergrowth and left in a secluded wooded spot. The COP kicks leaves and dirt over the body, then exits.

<DIRECTION>
BACK TO:

<DIRECTION>
INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - AS BEFORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON the RADIO, midway through "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our guy listens to the CRUNCH CRUNCH CRUNCH of the cop's boots outside in the snow, circling the snowbound Oldsmobile. Whistling along with the song that always accompanies him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the dashboard air vents all OPEN SIMULTANEOUSLY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A gust of supernaturally frigid cold blows in, like the icy breath of Old Man Winter himself. White frost spreads with time-lapse velocity from the air vents across the dashboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our guy scrambles up front, slapping the air vents closed. Begins ripping off strips of duct tape to plaster over the vents to keep out the lethal chill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON OUR GIRL as her nightmare becomes even more violent-

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NIGHTMARE - EXT. WOODS / STREAM - NIGHT (1956)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another night, and a different victim. In a SERIES OF SHOTS we see: the black STRANGER pleading for his life as his WRISTS and ANKLES are bound roughly with baling wire by the COP. Ignoring the stranger's desperate pleas, the cop drags him by the bound wrists through the woods and shoves him down a muddy incline. He splashes facedown in a shallow stream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - AS BEFORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And our girl finally surfaces from the dream as if coming up for air, with a huge GASP and eyes wild with fear. Only to find herself in a waking nightmare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car interior flooded with red. Our guy terrified.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's happening!?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's him! Hurry! Help me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
She climbs up front to help our guy frantically taping over the vents. A shadow moves by the WINDSHIELD and she gasps-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As another shadow goes by in a blur past the BACK WINDOW and he gasps-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The assault coming from everywhere at once now, the cop an elemental force, like the storm itself. Skittering along the undercarriage one moment, across the metal roof the next. Even appearing -- fleetingly, impossibly -- in the snow on the blocked driver's side window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the electronics in the car start going crazy, power locks opening and closing, the interior light flickering, the dashboard clock hands spinning wildly, the windshield wipers sweeping back and forth, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then stop all at once.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Even the radio SNAPS OFF.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dead silence for a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then an odd SCUTTLING SOUND underfoot, something crawling along the undercarriage of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our guy sits there frozen with fear, too scared to move, to even breathe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Likewise, the girl sits nervously, watching her breath in the cold. Her eyes happen to wander to the rear view mirror-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A blue-faced DEAD BABY stares back at her from the rear window ledge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She SWINGS around, looks back at the window. But nothing's there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns back, he looks at her with concern. Unsure of her own senses, she shakes him off. Exhales slowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the scuttling noises outside EXPLODE into to a full- blown assault.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's the shriek of RENDING METAL, the thing outside begins HAMMERING at the car's hood, doors, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car gives a violent shudder side-to-side tosses our kids around like plastic flakes in a snow globe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The radio snaps back on: the saxophone solo in the Brenda Lee song, accompanying the violent CLANGS and GROANS of metal being torn asunder as the thing under the car rips away muffler, brake lines, wrenches the handles from the doors, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<BRENDA_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rockin' around, the Christmas tree, Have a happy hol-i-day...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Our guy claps hands over his ears so he can't hear the sound of the cop's rage as he attacks the car, fury growing and growing until it's indistinguishable from the HOWLING wind outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The attack ends.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The red police light in the rear window FADES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leaving them sitting there in the dark in stunned silence.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think... he's gone. I guess when he couldn't get in he gave up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly grinning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you these `88 Olds were built like tanks!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
He turns around in the front seat to shake a bandaged fist at the rear window.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (nervous relief)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HAH! Next time pick on someone driving a Hyundai-
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
She claps a hand over his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shhh! How do you know it's not a trick! He could still be out there waiting-
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not! Listen!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
They sit in silence, listening, but hear only the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But what if he comes back..?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We just have to stay in the car until morning. Then we'll be safe. That can't be more than, like, a few more hours... Someone's bound to come along once the sun comes up... Someone human I mean. Think you can hold on until then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(shy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if, you know. We have to pee?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can use the empty water bottles. From this point on, the back seat is a co-ed bathroom. Sound like a plan?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Sounds like a plan.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you try to get some sleep? I'll take the next watch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head, eyes full of fear.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
He nods, understanding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
So they just hunker down in the front seat, staring at the snow covered windshield, and start the long wait to morning.

EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE / ROADSIDE - NIGHT

The snow is slacking off. The stranded Oldsmobile is now completely snowbound, a car-shaped hillock of white on the roadside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The interior of the car is eerily QUIET, cocooned in snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kids sit in silence in the front seat, fighting to stay awake. His face is pale, skull visible beneath the skin. She stares at the black, snow-covered windshield.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta pee...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Again?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
She climbs over into the back seat and crouches down, urinating as demurely as possible into an empty bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (teasing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I swear, I never met anyone who had to go so much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop talking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should ask Santa to bring you a bigger bladder.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm serious! It's hard enough doing this in front of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, are you one of those people who can't pee with the bathroom door open?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. But it's not something I usually do until much later in a relationship...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She catches herself at the last second, but it's too late: the word "relationship" hangs in the air. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finished peeing, she twists the cap on the water bottle. Sets it on the floor with the other URINE-FILLED BOTTLES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Noticing ONE BOTTLE that doesn't look like the others.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She climbs over into the front to confront him with the urine bottle, which is tinged with PINK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blood.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell is this? Is this blood?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
No answer.

	<DIALOGUE>
	How badly were you hurt in the crash?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No big deal. Just your average day in the NHL...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
But she sees through his tough-guy facade. He's frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long have you known?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Since I tried hiking back to the gas station. You were right, I never got anywhere near it. I started hurling blood, so I turned around and came back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why didn't you tell me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't want to scare you-
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly he goes rigid in pain, his teeth clenched. She looks on helplessly.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got to get you some help now. You won't make it to morning. I'm going to try and hike back to the gas station-
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How far do you think you'd get out there before running into Mr. Freeze?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going to just sit here and watch you die!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
They sit there a moment in silence. She digs out her cellphone and checks for a signal: NO SIGNAL BARS.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd) (to herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn it! We need a land line ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she's struck by an idea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She switches on the wipers to clear snow from the windshield. Wipes at the foggy glass until she's got enough of a peephole to peek out.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you looking at?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Telephone poles. They must have a junction box or something to test the lines ... There! See that one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She indicates a TELEPHONE POLE twenty yards up from them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a SMALL GREY STEEL JUNCTION BOX near the top.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
She turns, leaning over the seatback to rummage among his junk in the back. She retrieves his old wall TELEPHONE, examines the jack at end of its cord.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So maybe there's some way I can... I don't know... jack into it or something. Try and call for help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to climb a telephone pole?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I don't want to! But it's got rungs. Can't be any harder than the climbing wall at my gym. Big fat repair guys do it all the time, right? Right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Trying to convince herself.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you're forgetting one thing...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's out there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
They both go quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sits there with the phone in her lap, brooding on this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Until something clicks.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The song! That old Christmas song on the radio. It always comes on just before he shows up...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She switches on the RADIO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They hear Elvis Presley's 1957 "Blue Christmas" playing.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep listening. If `Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree' comes on, yell like hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to convince herself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hopefully I'll have enough time to get back.

EXT. ROADSIDE / TELEPHONE POLE - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

Looking down at the stranded Oldsmobile from the top of the telephone pole. The grey JUNCTION BOX in the foreground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The weird HUMMING is louder here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He watches her prep for her mission out into the bitter cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She disconnects the TELEPHONE RECEIVER from it's base, wraps it in its chord, stows it for safekeeping under her sweater.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's ready.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(weak)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been thinking...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eternal recurrence. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What wouldn't?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Repeating this life. Over and over. Exactly the same each time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even the last twenty-four hours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
He shows a weak smile. Even the last twenty four hours.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but it's even nicer to think maybe we get a chance to fix all the things we screwed up the first time around, don't you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
They fall silent, both thinking about this.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Know what I'd do different? Next time I'd just to walk up to you after class... and say "Hey."
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should. Definitely. Do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She uses her sweater cuff to make clean spot on his cheek.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kisses him tenderly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kiss working it's way to his mouth, lingering a beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Their lips part.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He catches her arm as she reaches for the power window switch, holds tight.
</DIRECTION>
<GUY>
<DIRECTION>
(urgently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't let me die out here-
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUY>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him with fierce eyes full of determination. The look calms him, at least a little.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She keys the ignition, lowers the passenger side window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The duct tape rips away as the window glides down, admitting a mini-avalanche of powdery snow and a frigid blast of cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She climbs out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROADSIDE / TELEPHONE POLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Viewed from high atop the telephone pole she looks small and vulnerable as she climbs out of the Oldsmobile-shaped igloo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROADSIDE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An eerie HUSH has fallen, snow muffling sound except for the occasional forlorn wailing of the WIND through the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sets out through deep powder toward the TELEPHONE POLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Teeth chattering, he watches through the windshield as she begins her long trek across the MOONLIT EXPANSE OF WHITE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns up the VOLUME on the radio, which is now playing a funereal church-organ instrumental of "Silent Night."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROADSIDE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The deep powder makes her trek difficult, and she's soon winded. Her breath plumes in the frigid arctic cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE BACKLIT RADIO DIAL as "Silent Night" concludes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In between STATIC we hear a pre-recorded PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT.

	The State Weather Bureau has issued an extreme cold warning...

She leans into the wind as it gusts, the cold bringing tears to her eyes. She puts her head down and soldiers on.

</RADIO_PSA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROADSIDE / TELEPHONE POLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Arriving at the base of the telephone pole, she peers up at the grey JUNCTION BOX high above. From here the top of the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
telephone pole looks much higher than it did from the car. And the iron rungs look a lot narrower, too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's losing her nerve.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She glances back to check no police lights are coming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steels herself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then puts her foot on the first rung and hauls herself up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - THAT MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE RADIO, where, between increasingly long snatches of STATIC we can just discern Gene Autry's version of "Here Comes Santa Claus."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROADSIDE / TELEPHONE POLE - AS BEFORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rungs are icy, forcing her to climb slower than she would like. She keeps her eyes forward, never once looking down. When the wind gusts she pauses and waits for it to subside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's midway to the top when her foot SLIPS on an icy rung.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She clutches the pole tightly, wind whistling in her ears. She waits until her heart slows and she's recovered from her near fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then looks up to gauge the distance left to the JUNCTION BOX.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Keeps climbing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches the last rung at the TOP OF THE TELEPHONE POLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's noisy up here, thanks to the WIND and the icy telephone wires, source of the mysterious HUMMING she's been hearing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tries the little metal door of the grey JUNCTION BOX.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Locked.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She fumbles in her coat, takes out the SCISSORS, uses them to try and pry open the junction box (which turns out to be frozen shut, not locked after all.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It finally yields, opening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Revealing a rat's nest of multicolored WIRES and PHONE JACKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hurrying now, she tugs her glove off with her teeth, and with her bare hand retrieves the cord-wrapped RECEIVER from inside her sweater. In her effort to juggle all these items she loses her grip on the SCISSORS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Which drop all the way down to disappear in the snow below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She concentrates now on the receiver. But her fingers are so clumsy from the cold, she fumbles it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the receiver FALLS too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then jerks to a STOP a few feet below as it reaches the limit of its cord.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Which she's managed to catch. She winds the receiver up by its cord, finally plugs the jack-end into the junction box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hears a DIAL TONE.

<DIRECTION>
The connection SPARKS and she feels a small shock that makes her drop the phone. When she retrieves it and holds it back to her ear the line is DEAD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No way of knowing if her message got through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a moment of such soul-crushing despair she shuts her eyes and leans her head against the pole, as if wanting to just quietly die up here thirty feet above the earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - THAT MOMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE RADIO playing nothing but STATIC now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROADSIDE / TELEPHONE POLE - AS BEFORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes open, and she commences climbing back down to earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches the second set of rungs from the bottom and drops the last several feet. The snow does little to cushion her fall and she goes sprawling, lays there for a dazed moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She starts crawling on all fours back toward the stranded Olds. Suddenly she stops as she comes upon-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WOMAN'S BARE FEET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
standing in the snow, veins visible through gravid skin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A thick spatter of mud lands on the bare foot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our girl raises her eyes to see -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DEAD WOMAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's the blonde we saw raped and murdered in the summer of 1958. Her dress is in tattered ruins, coated in leaves and dirt like someone recently exhumed from a shallow grave.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her head is twisted at an unnatural angle on a broken neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our girl GASPS and scrambles to her feet, fleeing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only to stop dead in her tracks as she nearly collides with-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO DEAD TEENAGE BOYS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The joyriding teens killed on Christmas Eve 1958.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Both wear blood-soaked letterman jackets bearing the DISTINCTIVE COUGAR INSIGNIA and stand in a post-accident haze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One's chest is concave, stove-in by the impact with the steering wheel. The other's teeth are visible where his cheek has been torn away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reels away in horror, forced to take the long way back to the Oldsmobile. She runs the last few yards to the car where we can hear the eerie sound of STATIC emanating from the radio as she hurls herself -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside. Safe!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sits there, out of breath. She glances over quickly at our guy, gravely pale, slumped unconscious behind the steering wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She chafes her hands to get the circulation going again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns down the volume on the radio.
</DIRECTION>

When this too gets no response from him she looks over, frowning. She scoots a little closer across the front seat toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Which is when WE SEE -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS GHOST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
standing outside the car, slack-expressioned and staring.

He stands there a beat, then drifts off into the night.

<DIRECTION>
Tears spill down her cheeks as she fights hysteria. She shakes him harder. His inert body spills to one side, slumping against her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her grief turns to something else, instinctive and immediate: revulsion, at the feel of his cold dead weight against her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She scrambles across the front seat to put as much distance as she can between herself and the corpse.

Cowers against the passenger door.

	Sorry... sorry... I'm sorry...

</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
She strains to move his dead weight. Her feet slip on the ice and she lets go of him, catching herself on the open door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs the body under the armpits, hauls with all her strength. Drags him a few yards away from the Oldsmobile. His boot heels ploughing twin gouges in the snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind her, gravity pulls the heavy car door shut with a soft THUNK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly her feet go out from under her as she hits a patch of ice. She goes down hard on her ass, sprawling. Sits there a beat, as-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEADLIGHTS appear on the dark horizon. We see them a split- second before she does...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's coming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she glimpses the oncoming headlights out of the corner of her eye she turns her head slowly in their direction, and for an instant it almost seems as if they don't register.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then her eyes widen in terror, she lets out a small whimper, and leaps into action.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She scrambles to her feet and makes a mad dash toward the Oldsmobile -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only to find when she tugs on the handle that it's STUCK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She yanks on it harder, getting frantic now, as -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The HEADLIGHTS get brighter, bearing down, close enough now that we can hear the ROAR of the oncoming engine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She kicks the handle, tugs with all her might, rocking the car but not succeeding in getting the door open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the headlights become BLINDING...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly there's the sound of BRAKES being engaged, and the headlights slow to a stop just a few yards shy of where she's standing in the middle of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She shields her eyes with an upraised hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a SNOWPLOW.

There's a metallic GROAN of hinges as the snowplow's driver's side door opens and the SNOWPLOW DRIVER, dazed but unhurt, climbs out.

He calls down into the gloom below, where we hear the faint sounds of the highway patrol car's RADIO playing "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree."

She looks up in time to see through the windshield -

The SNOWPLOW DRIVER making his way down the steep slippery ice-and-leaf-covered embankment.

And the HIGHWAY PATROL CAR.

It's resting on its roof in the snow at the bottom of the ravine, wheels in the air. It looks like an overturned beetle.

Something moves in its front seat.

Despite being pinned upside-down and in pain from injuries sustained in the accident, he chuckles at his predicament. We realize he's been drinking.

Widen to reveal -

A DOZEN ELDERLY PRIESTS in black winter coats and fedoras are standing all around them on the snowy embankment, faces grim.

The residents of St. Christopher's Home for Retired Clergy.

Suddenly there's a WHOOSH as the engine fire spreads across the car's undercarriage, moving toward the FUEL TANK.

The old priest crouches down, reaches through the open window past the trapped highway patrolman.

<DIRECTION>
Rips out the chattering TWO-WAY RADIO by its cord.

The cop's face registers disbelief, then fury, as he realizes the priests aren't going to help him. Are in fact condemning him for years of crimes committed on this stretch of road.

Skin peeled and blackened, he starts crawling over the rocks, dragging his paralyzed lower body after them.

We hear the sizzle of instant FROSTBITE, the frost spreading with time-lapse speed up the snowplow driver's limbs as he shrieks in agony.

Suddenly she loses her grip and starts to slide back down on her belly toward the cop a dozen feet below.

Unscathed.

Standing right outside the snowplow, restored to his former glory, grinning at her.

Then the smile curdles. He reaches through the shattered window. Grabbing for her.

She instinctively starts back to the stranded Oldsmobile -

Stops -

<DIRECTION>
Looks at the ghost.

And in that moment decides, for better or worse, to follow him.

It's almost light out now, and SHE'S ALONE, staggering along the road as quickly as her exhausted state allows. It's like running in a dream, never fast enough to outdistance an unseen pursuer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But then she hears it -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HIGHWAY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She can't believe she's made it back to civilization.

<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.

The gas pumps are crowded with EMERGENCY VEHICLES and PERSONNEL. The morning calm is broken by the BEEP BEEP BEEP of trucks backing up, the BLEET of arriving ambulances, the constant CHATTER of two-way radios.
