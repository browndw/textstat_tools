INTERIOR METROPOLITAN MUSEUM - LONG SHOT - ONE OF THE ROOMS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a group of children -- about ten years of age -- standing before one of the paintings. It is obviously a class. A middle-aged woman is lecturing to them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA GOES CLOSER and we see the woman and children more closely. The woman -- Miss Spinney -- seems remote and far away -- her lecture for the most part a cold recital of facts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS UP TO A CLOSE SHOT OF THE PAINTING - "CARDINAL NINO DE GUEVARA" -
</DIRECTION>
<SPINNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cardinal Nino de Guevara -- painted by El Greco around 1596. El Greco is of the Spanish school -- although he was really a Greek. That is what El Greco means -- "The Greek." El Greco cared nothing for the charms of the flesh --

<DIRECTION>
(suddenly she catches
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	herself, hesitates
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
and hurries on)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is -- I mean -- I mean he was only interested in -- well -- in the spirit of a person. For example, in this painting he didn't try to make the man look just pretty -- he tried to show us what the man thought and felt -- what the man's spirit was!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINNEY>
<ROMANTIC_LITTLE_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was he a real Cardinal?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMANTIC_LITTLE_GIRL>
<SPINNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. El Greco's portraits are of real people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINNEY>
<LITTLE_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But sometimes a painter paints people who aren't real.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_BOY>
<SPINNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's true, Johnny. Different artists are inspired by different things. Sometimes it's their wives -- or their mothers --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINNEY>
<CYNICAL_LITTLE_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or their goil-friends --
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNICAL_LITTLE_BOY>
<DIRECTION>
The children giggle a little.
</DIRECTION>
<SPINNEY>
<DIRECTION>
(seriously, but smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Freddie -- or their girl friends.

(her smile fades as
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	she looks away a

little)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, of course, some artists are inspired by things that only they can see --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINNEY>
<CYNICAL_LITTLE_BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw! How can dey see anything no one else sees? Are dey crazy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CYNICAL_LITTLE_BOY>
<SPINNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. A lot of people do think artists are crazy, but that's only because we ordinary people haven't the vision of genius -- We miss so much... so much... Things we just don't see -- until that --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she turns to Freddie, smiles a little)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	that craziness you speak of, Freddie, shows them to us.

She pauses a moment. We HOLD her for a foot or two as she's lost in her thoughts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CHILDREN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watch her -- and the Cynical Little Boy makes a gesture to the other children covertly, indicating that Miss Spinney is a bore or nuts or both. After a moment we hear over this, Spinney's voice:

We hear Spinney's voice over the painting, then CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Spinney and the children in front of the painting.
</DIRECTION>
<SPINNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blake seldom used models for any of his figures. He saw what we see -- but he also saw the spirit -- and that's what he painted. Just before he died he said, "I should be sorry if I had any earthly fame, for whatever natural glory a man has is so much taken away from his spiritual glory. Why, when Blake was only a little boy --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she turns to Freddie)
</DIRECTION>

	-- about your age, Freddie -- he saw a whole flock of angels sitting on the boughs of a tree.

ANGLE ON FACES OF SPINNEY AND CHILDREN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are staring at a portrait (behind CAMERA), and are obviously very much taken with it. After a moment:
</DIRECTION>
<ROMANTIC_LITTLE_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My! Isn't she pretty?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMANTIC_LITTLE_GIRL>
<SPINNEY>
<DIRECTION>
(a little surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty?... Yes, she is pretty... very pretty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINNEY>
<ANOTHER_CHILD>
<DIRECTION>
(advancing a step,
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	looks down and reads
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
slowly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Portrait... of... Jennie... by Eben... Adams."
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANOTHER_CHILD>
<DIRECTION>
During the last couple of words, the CAMERA HAS MOVED UP AND FORWARD TO A CLOSEUP OF SPINNEY. We see in her face how much this portrait means to her; her emotion and her pride.
</DIRECTION>
<SPINNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes... "Portrait of Jennie -- by Eben Adams."
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINNEY>
<DIRECTION>
There is almost a suggestion of a tear in her eye as she looks at the portrait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE ON THE GROUP - COMPARATIVELY LOW CAMERA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
During the following, we SLOWLY PULL BACK to reveal the portrait bit by bit until it is in full view over the heads of the group at the end of the following:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At first Spinney is again the professional teacher, but as she gets toward the end of the speech, her personal interest and emotion and increase in feeling take hold of her again.
</DIRECTION>
<SPINNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- And it might be well to note -- with some pride, perhaps -- that here we have a portrait painted by an American -- and not so many years ago -- that has been considered of sufficient merit to hang here in the Metropolitan... In this portrait you can feel the extraordinary spiritual vision of the artist -- not only his talent as a painter, but the genius that we can only sense -- and not quite understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINNEY>
<DIRECTION>
A SHOT OF THE PORTRAIT ITSELF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(NOTE: It is suggested that in the staging of the whole scene we try to get the effect of a slightly changing light; and that we also try to get this in the Long Shot Exterior with which the picture opens in order to justify this slightly changing light. This in order that we might be able to take full advantage of Joe August's stunningly successful test experiments with the slightly changing light on the portrait in this particular angle. But we should have protection without the changing light in the event that this does not work out well.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is nothing under this shot of the portrait but the MUSIC. Here it is suggested that we introduce for the first time the "WHERE I COME FROM" theme, starting its use during and under Spinney's speech and giving it full play without dialogue under this shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - PERHAPS PROFILE AND LOW CAMERA - ON SPINNEY AND THE CHILDREN -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(The shot in any event should feature Spinney -- and this is an excellent opportunity to make superb use of Miss Barrymore's profile.)
</DIRECTION>
<ROMANTIC_LITTLE_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was Jennie real?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMANTIC_LITTLE_GIRL>
<SPINNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well now, Millicent, there's a strange legend about that. I never saw Jennie, but --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she stops herself
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	short and the far- away look comes into
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
her eyes)
</DIRECTION>
<ROMANTIC_LITTLE_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did anyone ever see her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMANTIC_LITTLE_GIRL>
<SPINNEY>
<DIRECTION>
(pulling herself
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	together, coming out
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
of her thoughts)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, of course. Eben Adams saw her. There's the portrait. It's proof that he saw her. I remember he once said...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINNEY>
<ROMANTIC_LITTLE_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, did you know Eben Adams?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMANTIC_LITTLE_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Pause as Spinney realizes she has gone too far, but now she must proceed and answer the question.
</DIRECTION>
<SPINNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew him in the days before he painted this picture -- and in the days after -- when he --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINNEY>
<DIRECTION>
The Cynical Little Boy gives an elaborate and noisy fake yawn. She looks at him, realizes that she's been carried away for a second. She is embarrassed, lowers her eyes, then regains her dignity and composure.
</DIRECTION>
<SPINNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That will be all for today, children. Class is dismissed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINNEY>
<THE_CHILDREN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Miss Spinney. Goodbye, Miss Spinney.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_CHILDREN>
<DIRECTION>
The children are delighted that the class is over. The Cynical Little Boy is out first and way ahead of them. The Romantic Little Girl trails behind a few feet reluctantly, looking back at the portrait and Miss Spinney.
</DIRECTION>
<ROMANTIC_LITTLE_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
(tenderly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, Miss Spinney...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMANTIC_LITTLE_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Spinney doesn't answer, for she is again lost in her thoughts as she looks at the picture. CAMERA MOVES UP SLOWLY to Spinney so that we see clearly she is not speaking, and we hear her voice in almost a stage whisper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(NOTE: Mr. Stewart will please note that we should experiment with Miss Barrymore's voice before we reach this scene and see what effects we can get with this and other narrations through the picture.)
</DIRECTION>
<SPINNEY_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eben -- Eben -- how slowly the years go by -- such tired, dead years -- if I could only turn them back to you. Yes, back to the days when you were poor -- and cold -- and friendless -- your work unknown. Harsh, harsh years for you, Eben --

CENTRAL PARK - WINTER

(already shot)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Along the deserted walk we see Eben Adams, walking slowly and dejectedly. He is a slender young man in his thirties, bare-headed, dressed in a thin shabby overcoat hanging loosely from his hunched shoulders. He is carrying a large portfolio containing sketches. His face is weary, bitter, preoccupied.
</DIRECTION>
<SPINNEY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For those were the years when there was a hunger in you for more than food. There was a suffering in you that was worse than anything a winter, or poverty, could do. It was a winter of your mind when the life of your genius seemed frozen and motionless -- and how did you know if spring would ever come again to set it free?

Adams decides to go in and enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
During the above action, we hear Spinney's voice:
</DIRECTION>
<SPINNEY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Eben, I will never forget the day you first came into our place. There was a desperation that had taken hold of you, a dreadful feeling of the world's indifference. Your courage was running out fast, like sands from a glass. You were at the bottom -- without money or friends -- without hope --

INTERIOR MATHEWS GALLERY - FULL SHOT

(NOTE: It is suggested that we not see Adams' face very clearly, if at all, in scenes 12, 13 or 14 until the place indicated. We've built up to Adams and let's raise the curtain on him.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a small place -- a one room gallery in the rear. There is nobody in the room when Adams enters (CAMERA is on his back -- Adams walks away from CAMERA. We still have not seen his face), but when the tinkle of the doorbell is heard, a man emerges from the office. It is Henry Mathews. He approaches Adams. CAMERA DOLLIES IN TO A MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT OF ADAMS AND MATHEWS, SHOOTING OVER ADAMS' SHOULDER AT MATHEWS.
</DIRECTION>
<MATTHEWS>

	Yes, sir. What can I do for you?

</MATTHEWS>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - OVER MATHEW'S SHOULDER AT ADAMS

<DIRECTION>
Adams is opening his portfolio. In the middle of this angle, he rather slowly, but not unnaturally, raises his head and for the first time we see his face.

	I don't know. You could buy one of my pictures, perhaps.

The camera trucks with them to a small table near the window. Adams starts to open his portfolio.

Adams has opened the portfolio and stands aside to let Matthews look at them.

	Those are some studies I did at Cape Cod... That one is the fisheries at North Truro.

As they are speaking, a woman comes in from a rear room and quietly looks over Matthews' shoulder at the sketches. She is a lean frosty-eyed woman of about forty-five -- and we suddenly realize that it is MISS SPINNEY -- years younger.

	Yes... Yes, it's a good bridge. I just don't happen to like bridges. They come in every day by the dozen.

Adams grimly starts to put his pictures back in the portfolio.

	Don't be in such a hurry! Let's see what else you've got.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing, I'm afraid, that would interest you or your partner.

<SPINNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're probably right. But do you mind if I take a look at what interests you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Spinney's brusqueness seems to intimidate Adams. He lets her take the portfolio away from him, and she starts to turn through the pictures. Adams looks somewhat helplessly at Matthews, who shrugs his shoulders, having bowed for many years before the natural force that is Miss Spinney.

As he walks along, he is deep in thought. From far away, the sound of a piano can be heard. Some one is playing a simple tune with one finger. Curiously, this melody seems to drift out of an open window across the square, clearly and distinctly, in spite of the city noises.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(already shot)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shooting across their shoulders down on the portfolio which is resting in Jennie's lap. Adams watches her closely as her face puckers up with concentration. Silently, she turns a few of the sketches -- mostly landscapes of the Park and the City -- until she comes to a sketch of Cape Cod. It shows a church with its steeple standing near the bay. A dark, stormy sky stretches across the landscape.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those are awful little windows for such a big church.

	<DIALOGUE>
	He was. A long time ago.

	You're wrong. Cecily Brown's father is in Germany now. He sees him all the time.

</JENNIE>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But he...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<JENNIE>

	He says the Kaiser rides around on a white horse and he likes to fight. I can fight, too. I can fight Cecily. She's bigger but I'm stronger. I can fight her good.

<ADAMS>

	I thought Cecily was your best friend.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know a song, too. Would you like to hear it?

</JENNIE>

As they walk along, she sings, camera pulling back with them. It is the same simple, haunting tune we have heard before played on the piano.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIE>

(singing)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Where I come from Nobody knows; And where I'm going Everything goes. The wind blows, the sea flows -- Nobody knows. Where I come from Nobody knows.

They stop walking.

<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who taught you that?

Everything is quiet for a moment, and then the front door opens cautiously and we see Adams come in. He closes the door quietly behind him and starts softly toward the stairs. As he about reaches them, we hear a voice o.s.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that you, Mr. Adams?

<DIRECTION>
Adams hurries toward his room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ADAMS' STUDIO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a big, high room with a dark, dusty ceiling. The studio window overlooks a line of roofs and chimneys, and through one narrow gap one catches a glimpse of the Hudson River. At intervals, one can faintly hear the hooting of river boats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is in quite a state of disorder. A typical artist's studio without maid service. In addition to the easel there are palettes, tubes of color, sketches and crayons littered on the work table and floor. There is a worn narrow couch, one rather beautiful oak armchair, and a number of stools and rickety furniture pieces as would be found in a cheaply and carelessly put together place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adams enters room, sees a man dressed in his hat and coat, absorbed in looking at one of his pictures. He recognizes him, and bursts out.

	Of course. It is a flower.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ARNE>
<ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
(smilingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's silly. It's a painting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<ARNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. A painting. Then why do you fool yourself calling it a flower... besides, if I want flowers, I get them at a flower shop; they cost less and smell better... here, I'll show you something.

	Don't we live in a mad world? If you want to remain sane in a mad world, you are doubly mad... open your eyes. Look through the window. There is an airplane flying; before you take your shoes off, it will be in Europe. On the rooftops -- everywhere -- radio towers. Sneeze here, and in a split second they hear it in Ethiopia. In times like these, you are sitting here painting a flower... Soft... sweet... a child licking an ice cream cone...

	All right. But if you must paint an ice cream cone, paint it like a rocket to the moon! Paint the ball of ice cream as if you were licking a bomb with your lips. But who wants ice cream? If I want ice cream, I go to a soda fountain... say, do you have some bicarbonate of soda, by any chance?

	No, not at all. I guess you're right. I guess my stuff hasn't much feeling of the world today. As a matter of fact, I guess it hasn't much feeling at all. I know it, and so I've about made up my mind to quit and get a job.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
A moment's pause. Arne looks at Adams, seriously. We suddenly realize Arne at the moment is not the buffoon that he seems to be. We see that underneath he is sincere and honest. He senses Adams' depression. He puts his hand on Adams' shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<ARNE>
<DIRECTION>
(simply and sincerely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Adams -- I never thought you were a genius -- but one thing I have always admired about you. Your sincerity! Do not lose that sincerity, Adams! Be true to yourself! Sincerity is the most important thing of all!

	There's nothing insincere about taking a job, is there?

<ARNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is the most insincere thing of all! You think a man can have a job and be sincere?

<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't see why not.

</ADAMS>
<ARNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Impossible! That is what the very word "job" means! You are doing one thing -- when you should be doing another! Can you name me one man who has a job who doesn't wish he was doing something else! Here is a clerk -- who wanted to be a doctor. A truck driver who wanted to be President. A President who wanted to be a haberdasher! Instead of being true to themselves -- they took jobs! Bowed down to life! Never make that compromise, Adams. Never, never take a job... Well, salute.

(he reflects a second)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If they'd only buy my pictures, I'd salute them with champagne. And that brings me to the point of my present visit. Have you some filthy lucre on you, by any chance?

He fishes in his pocket, peels off one bill, leaving himself two other bills. Arne peers at the remaining bills.

<ARNE>
<DIRECTION>
(resigned, as though doing him a big favor)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't apologize. I'll take it. And do you know why I'll take it? It's because you have a soul -- the soul of an artist -- if only you could paint. Well, so long.

(he walks off)
</DIRECTION>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, Arne. Thanks for the visit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
Adams remains standing looking after him a moment, thoughtfully. Arne's quick appearance has done more to enhance his loneliness. He closes the door quietly and stands looking around the room. We feel that he is miserably alone. He picks up the sketch of the dynamo and looks at it a moment, then puts it down. He picks up one of his own sketches, looks at it a moment, then puts it away from him, shaking his head dismally. He crosses slowly to the window and stands looking out. Leaning his head against the cool window pane, he stares at the dark jagged line of roofs, outside and the river beyond. We hear the mournful hooting of the tugboats on the river. He listens to them. Slowly it seems as though there were some pattern to the sound -- it seems as if for a moment, a little of the sound of Jennie's theme song is heard. Adams listens, a slightly puzzled expression on his face. He sits down and picks up his concertina and begins to play idly. Jennie's theme song creeps in this too. He plays for a moment, then puts the concertina down and moves to his drawing board. He sits before it, staring at the blank paper. Then slowly, almost subconsciously, he picks up a crayon and starts to make a sketch of Jennie. As we PAN TO A SHOT OF NEW YORK FROM THE WINDOW.

Adams, his portfolio under his arm, is walking down the street. He has the paper of Jennie's that he picked up from the bench in his pocket. He comes to a corner and, as he hesitates a moment, we hear --
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'ya, Mack?

</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Adams looks up and smiles and walks over to the garage. Near the entrance stands Gus, a driver. He has his cap on, but his sleeves are rolled up and he has a wrench or some kind of repairing instrument in his hand. He is looking at Adams.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, Gus.

He starts walking into the garage, Adams at his side, towards his cab. During the following they reach the cab which has its hood up -- and maybe it's on some round platform or instrument so the motor can be worked on:

	You know, Gus -- I don't get you at all.

(after a moment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I don't like to see people hungry.

Gus gets under the engine and the following is played with Adams leaning against the cab, his foot on the running board or in any other fashion that the setting makes possible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(NOTE: Gus' cab and the other cabs that are visible should be, if possible, those of about 1930 and certainly not any later than the early 1930s, avoiding the streamline models of the 1940s)

During the following Adams pulls the door closed as Gus gets himself seated in the cab in his own seat.
</DIRECTION>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Most of the time a guy's got the feelin' that there's nothin' to life but just gettin' through it as easy and as comfortable as he can -- makin' a quarter here -- a dollar there -- and eatin' an' sleepin' an' dyin'. An' then a guy like you comes along who's not thinkin' too much about them things and it starts you wonderin'. Wonderin' if you're not missin' something.

	<DIALOGUE>
	throws the gear shift into first, but doesn't release the brake yet. He leans over the wheel and without turning back

to Adams, continues:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, Mack -- since meetin' you I'm beginnin' to think that there is somethin' more to life. It gives you a kind of faith. It makes you think different about your fellow-man.

Gus and Adams are seated at one of the tables, plates of corned beef and cabbage before them and glasses of beer. Other people at other tables. Gus and Adams have just started eating.

<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put some linin' in your stomach... When'd you last have anything to eat?

</GUS>
<ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I see. You think I'm just imagining it all. Oh, no, she was real enough, Gus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not arguin' with ye, but my mother always says: "If you don't have enough in your stomach, you get too much in your head."
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
(good-humored)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. I'll eat my lunch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
They eat a moment in silence. As Adams bends over his food, we see Gus studying him thoughtfully. He shakes his head and whistles softly between mouthfuls of corned beef and cabbage. He looks around the room thoughtfully. He suddenly spots some one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moore, the proprietor, waves and calls.
</DIRECTION>
<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Gus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
GUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He waves and calls back.
</DIRECTION>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Mack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<DIRECTION>
MOORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He starts forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A quizzical expression comes to his face. He studies the brown panelling of the room. He looks over at Adams, thoughtfully. An idea seems to be forming in his mind. Moore strolls up.
</DIRECTION>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's things? Meet my friend Mack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Adams)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello.

<GUS>
<DIRECTION>
(to Adams)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mack here's the owner of the joint.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<DIRECTION>
NOTE: The remainder of this scene should be shot in over shoulder angles; across Gus to Moore; and across Moore to Gus; together with individual shots of Gus, Moore and Adams. Adams closeups should show him turning from Gus to Moore, almost as though watching a tennis match.
</DIRECTION>
<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, sometimes, I don't know if I'm the owner of the joint or if the joint's the owner of me. Business ain't too good these days. Mind if I sit down a minute?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A pleasure.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Moore sits)
</DIRECTION>
<MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Adams)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything all right, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Couldn't be better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad to hear you say it. An' you, Gus, Everything all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, sure -- I guess so, Mack --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly sensing something)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean I guess so? Anything wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No -- no -- I guess not --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<DIRECTION>
They eat a moment in silence. Adams looks at Gus in surprise. Moore regards him thoughtfully. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The food is all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, sure, sure --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then what's gripin' you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<GUS>
<DIRECTION>
(hesitantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I kind of hate to say this, Mack... you're not a man I'd like to hurt... your feelin's, I mean... but --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he dwindles to a pause)
</DIRECTION>
<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if you don't see me around for awhile, don't be surprised. I've sort of been thinkin' I might start eatin' down at Nick's for a change.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick's?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick's!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter with Nick's?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. Moore shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
(slowly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No-o-o... there's nothing the matter with Nick's... I suppose -- if you like that type of place --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a slight pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're goin' to start eatin' down at Nick's.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Pause. Moore turns to Adams; pleasantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a nice day, we're havin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beautiful day.

</ADAMS>
<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all that and more.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he pauses and studies
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gus who is eating
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
diligently. Then:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're goin' to start eatin' at Nicks, eh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just thought I might for awhile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Adams)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It takes all kinda people to make a world... all kinds... and some of them haven't a trace of friendship, or loyalty, or --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he whirls on Gus)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You get as good a cornbeef and cabbage down at Nick's?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't even get it there, Mack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the beer is better down there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Same beer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
(vehemently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then what in the name of all the saints are you goin' to eat down at Nick's for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Mack, nothing personal. But a fellow likes a change once in awhile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A change from what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's... er --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks around, and
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	then with a shuddering
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
gesture)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the joint... it's... it's the room... it's --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's dark, Mack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dark?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The woodwork... that dark woodwork --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Motions at the
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	panelling. Then,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
almost cheerfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick's got nice, bright tile down there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tile!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. You should brighten it up... brighten up the joint, Mack. Everytime I polish that hack of mine, I do good business... People like things to look good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. Adams and Gus eat. Moore regards Gus a minute, then looks thoughtfully around the room. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be puttin' no tile in this restaurant and bar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... no... I wouldn't want you to anything like that, Mack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would you want me to do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<GUS>
<DIRECTION>
(at first he seems puzzled for a solution)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know exactly... It's not an easy problem with all that dark wood... but the other day I was sittin' here, I got lookin' at that wall... an' all of a sudden I says to myself: "Timothy Augustin, wouldn't it be cheerful to be lookin' at some nice green trees, with maybe a sup of river runnin' between them... an' maybe a little Kerry cow or two, munchin' the grass... or maybe --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<DIRECTION>
Adams looks at him quickly, suspicious.
</DIRECTION>
<GUS>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- a whole scene from Killarney itself... or may be, the Gap of Dunlow --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it pictures, you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I don't know, Mack. I hadn't thought that far.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
(dubiously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suppose I could hang a stray picture here and there...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<GUS>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, they'd have to be the right kinda pictures... an', anyway, I don't think a few pictures would do it... It's a cryin' shame that you couldn't have a big scene painted right on the wall... but --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he pauses)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I know that can't be done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why can't it be done? Didn't ye ever hear of muriels?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Muriels, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're painted right onto a wall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't tell me --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he begins to get excited)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ye know, Mack, I think you hit on the very thing yourself --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he stops in astonishment)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What d'ye know about that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now what's bitin' ye?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This guy --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(points to Adams)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's an artist, Mack... one of the best in the world... He can tell us all about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to Adams)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That so?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<GUS>
<DIRECTION>
(cutting in fast)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is Mack right? Is it possible to paint a picture right on the wall?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
(playing up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course it's possible... It's done often.

</ADAMS>
<MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Gus)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, ye dumb ox!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As a matter of fact, that wall would lend itself to a mural very well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<GUS>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly, to Moore)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, what are we thinkin' of! Here we got one of the grandest artists in the world sittin' right at our table. Why don't we talk him into doin' somethin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he turns to Adams)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could squeeze it in, Mack?... Oh, I know, I know, you're as busy as a fiddler at a hurling match... but somehow you could squeeze it... I mean, between all your other -- ah --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he reaches for the word)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- commissions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I don't know, Gus --

</ADAMS>
<GUS>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating Moore)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mack here is one of my oldest friends. Anything you do for him, you're doin' for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd have to think it over --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
(butting in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute -- wait a minute -- This is goin' to cost money!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An' what's money to an artist? If we can talk him into doin' this, it won't cost you a cent.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Adams)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could drop in just now an' then in your spare time -- say around noon or suppertime -- you got to eat somewhere, haven't you, Mack?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I suppose I have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then that solves the whole problem... Come in here for your meals. . .an' take a few minutes out after each breakfast an' dinner an' supper... just a few minutes to paint after each meal --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns to Moore admiringly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a smart man, Mack. Gettin' yourself a work of art for a few meals a day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. Gus and Adams continue to eat industriously. Moore looks from one to the other, speculatively. He smells a rat. He looks down at the poster in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me a moment. I've got to post this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up and slowly goes to the wall and tacks up the poster.
</DIRECTION>
<GUS>
<DIRECTION>
(without looking up from his plate)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lost him! Had him and I lost him!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
(uncomfortable)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let it go, Gus. Don't say anything more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Had him and lost him! Smelled a rat!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he looks up slyly
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	and sees Moore is posting the poster. It is an announcement concerning St. Patrick's Day. Gus thinks shrewdly for a moment. Then he raises his head and his beer. He calls

<DIRECTION>
to Moore)

</GUS>
<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never did an' I've always regretted it.

	He musta been the boyo!... A real Irish patriot!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<MOORE>
<DIRECTION>
(coming back to them)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was all that, an' more.

</MOORE>
<GUS>
<DIRECTION>
(firing his last broadside)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An' we sit chatterin' of trees an' rivers an' Kerry cows!... A fine collection of idiots we are!... Here's what you should do, Mack... Right over that service door there... a painting of Michael Collins... Mic Collins himself, an' he leadin' his men into battle against the might of England.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<MOORE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now wait a minute, Gus --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOORE>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man alive... it'd be the greatest thing to ever hit this town... Moore's Alhambra would be the rallyin' place for every Irish patriot to come to... Can't you see them gatherin' in droves to buy a beer an' get a good look at Mic Collins himself?... Why, you wouldn't have standin' room at the bar... An' all you have to do... an' you with the gift of the gab... is to talk Mack here into painting it for ye. An' it wouldn't cost ye a penny in cash.
	</DIALOGUE>

(reflectively)

CAMERA PANS with Gus as he gets up and walks toward the service door. He plants himself in front of it, looking at an imaginary painting above it.

<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here's how I see it:
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(with a nod to Adams)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or should I say how my friend Mack sees it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(dramatically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's early dawn on a small hill in Ireland... Wisps of fog are floating over the ground, but the sun is already rising behind Loch Allen. And there...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he points)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There on a carpet of Shamrock, under an old elm stands Mic Collins. He's leaning on his gun -- waitin' for zero hour. And all the Murphys and Flannagans and O'Sheas are waitin' with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Moore)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An' you know what they're waitin' for? They're waitin' for the day of liberation. They don't know it yet, but this is the day! In a brief moment, Mic himself will lead them into battle and will lead them to victory!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he raises his glass)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Up the rebels!

Adams and Moore have come up behind him. Moore's eyes are shining as he raises his glass to the imaginary painting of the Irish Patriot.

<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got to do it, Mack!

A second's pause as they wait for his decision. Adams looks from one to the other, slowly rises and pounds his fist on the table.

Mathews is standing looking through Adams' portfolio, Spinney looking over his shoulder as he runs through the sketches.

</MATTHEWS>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

<MATTHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because there's a quality about that girl reminds me of long ago...

<SPINNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes -- there's something -- timeless about it --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINNEY>
<MATTHEWS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it. And there ought to be something timeless about a woman -- something eternal. You can see it in all great portraits of the past; they make you feel you could meet those women -- anywhere -- and be inspired by them.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Adams. He squares his shoulders,

<DIRECTION>
defiantly)
</DIRECTION>

	Well, then, Mr. Adams, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll take that girl and I'll give you twenty-five dollars for it -- and I don't care what Miss Spinney says.

TWO SHOT - ADAMS AND MISS SPINNEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Adams sinks into a chair near where she is sitting. There is a comfortable, cozy feeling. A fire is burning in a little fireplace.
</DIRECTION>
<SPINNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were brought up in Maine?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINNEY>
<ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
(grinning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	South Paris, Maine. Pretty swanky, eh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
Spinney smiles at him.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice little town. Lakes and mountains and rivers -- My father ran the General Store until he died.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<SPINNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How old were you then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINNEY>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, fifteen or so. My mother died a couple of years later. So I pulled out and worked my way through three years of college, and then --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he pauses a moment and looks at her)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fascinating, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<SPINNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's interesting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Adams leans forward, serious.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Miss Spinney. I don't feel sorry for myself, the way you said. And I don't even think I'm particularly bitter. I know that every artist that ever lived -- if he was worth his salt -- went through a lot more than I have -- But they were great artists. They knew they had something. You can take a lot of beating if you're reasonably sure you've got something inside of you that makes it worthwhile. But I'm faced with a very practical problem. Have I got anything like that in me -- anything worth saying? There're thousands and thousands who haven't. Who do I think I am?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<SPINNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Adams, you say that every great artist went through more than you. What do you mean by that? You mean they went through hunger, poverty, loneliness? Why, of course they did. But do you think that's all they suffered? You think they didn't also suffer -- doubt? Do you think they knew -- anymore than you do -- whether they had anything in them worth saying? Of course they didn't. You should know that. Certainly you can take any amount of punishment -- if you know you're going to win in the end. And of course it's the not knowing that's brutal. But don't think for a minute this doubt is unique with you. It's what every artist has faced since the beginning of time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINNEY>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. Adams looks at her. Then, quietly:
</DIRECTION>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right, Spinney.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
Adams rises, goes slowly to the window. Spinney's eyes follow him. There is a sad, nostalgic, almost misty light in them. It is the first time he has called her "Spinney." She gets up and stands behind him at the window.
</DIRECTION>
<SPINNEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a lot simpler when you were a kid in Maine, wasn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINNEY>
<DIRECTION>
Adams smiles at her.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And more fun, too... How's about you and me taking a whirl on the ice right now?

</ADAMS>
<SPINNEY>

Spinney watches Adams who is looking off in awe and puzzlement. As CAMERA MOVES IN a little, we hear Spinney's voice, and on this we start a SLOW DISSOLVE:

	No. I never saw Jennie.

INT. MOORE'S RESTAURANT - LONG SHOT. LOW CAMERA UP AT ADAMS; LONG SHOT. HIGH ANGLE FROM ADAMS' VIEWPOINT DOWN AT SPINNEY; INDIVIDUALS OF EACH; AND MASTER SHOT

As Spinney's voice continues over the scene, we see Adams on a ladder at work on his patriotic mural of Michael Collins. He seems very gay at his work, painting easily and happily.
</DIRECTION>
<SPINNEY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something had happened to you, Eben. I don't think you were quite aware of it yourself. Your work on your mural was coming well - but it wasn't only that. There seemed to be a new Eben Adams. During those next few days you were gayer than I had ever seen you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINNEY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
As she is speaking, we see Adams turn, look down and wave gaily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spinney is seated at a table, a glass of beer before her. Adams' coat and a rolled up sketch is on a chair beside her. She is looking up at Adams and we see that her expression is one of tenderness. We see her wave back to Adams.
</DIRECTION>
<SPINNEY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must confess, Eben, that you made me wish I were young again. That I could go along with you -- carefree -- happy -- sharing whole-heartedly your happiness...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINNEY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Adams makes an elaborate Bohemian gesture with his paint brush and looks down at her. She looks up at him and laughs. He comes down the ladder and joins her. He uses her glass, pours himself a glass of beer and drinks.
</DIRECTION>
<SPINNEY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But of course those days were long past and I could only feel a deep thankfulness that I could be with you even a little -- and watch you -- and laugh with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINNEY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
While Adams talks to her, excited and eager, Spinney listens, her eyes glued on him.
</DIRECTION>
<SPINNEY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll never forget that Saturday as I watched you -- trying to see into you -- scarcely listening to what you were saying --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINNEY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Adams reaches over and picks up the rolled sketch of Jennie and shows it to Spinney.
</DIRECTION>
<SPINNEY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- you showed me another sketch you had made of Jennie. And then you suddenly looked at your watch -- jumped up -- and said you had to go -- that you had an appointment. I half suspected that it was with Jennie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPINNEY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
During the above we have seen Adams look at his watch, jump up, and apologize as he gets into his coat. Now we see him lean over and kiss Spinney on the cheek, then turn and leave. Spinney looks after him a moment - then slowly we see her hand rise and caress her cheek. She looks down at the new sketch of Jennie.

We see Adams waiting impatiently. He is looking all around. He looks at a cheap nickel-plated watch, shakes his head anxiously, and begins to walk up and down. He comes back to the bench. Again he looks at his watch, looks all around, and then decides to start off.

90A. LOBBY - MASTER SHOT AND INDIVIDUALS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pete is in uniform. He is in his late seventies, amiable, pathetically dapper in a threadbare way, his once handsome face now a ruin, his eyes watery and vacant. He just stands at one side as the people pass in -- occasionally saying: "Better seats to the left, please." He has obviously just been "kept on."
</DIRECTION>

He sips his coffee, looking at Pete with a hopeless smile. Pete gets over the feeling of being a little harassed, and his mind wanders off again.

But Pete doesn't hear him and Adams' attempts are hopeless. Pete's mind is still on his own tragedy.

Then, as though to illustrate this point, slowly, like an automaton, Pete takes out his wallet, and removes a card which he hands to Adams. During this Adams makes one final attempt.

	Of course, I remember the Appletons. Frank and Mary Appleton. I remember all of the old acts as if it were yesterday.

Clara rises and goes to an old trunk in the other side of the room. Adams follows her as she digs into the trunk and takes out some old photographs. She looks through them as she talks.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARA>
<DIRECTION>

	Oh, no. I knew Jennie when this picture was taken. A darling little girl -- with big, sad eyes. She used to come back stage and sit on my lap. I used to give her rock candy. She was crazy about rock candy.

</CLARA>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know where she is now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<CLARA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I lost track of her after her parents were killed that night on the trapeze. That was many years ago. Jack Boles came to the dressing room and told me: 'The Appletons had an accident,' he said. 'The wire broke. They're both dead.'... Jennie was in the theatre -- looking -- when it happened.

Adams walks along, looking from right to left anxiously. A wind has risen. Mingled with the SOUND of the wind, we hear the haunting melody of Jennie's theme song. Suddenly we hear a weird sound that could or could not be the sound of the trees. Adams stops and looks.

ADAMS - CAMERA DOLLYING WITH HIM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He listens a moment, then moves on. There is a feverish anxiety in his eyes. He slows down his walk, his instinct making him believe that somehow Jennie is near. Suddenly he stops abruptly as he looks down and ahead of him. We see there is movement of shadows. We PULL BACK THE CAMERA (or otherwise move the CAMERA) to reveal it is merely the shadow of the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ADAMS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he sees what has caused the shadow. He starts again, looking around. Faintly, but we can't be sure, there seems to be the sound of sobbing mingled with the wind and the MUSIC. He stops, and the sobbing stops. Adams calls softly:
</DIRECTION>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jennie... Jennie...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking around)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's no answer. He takes another step or two, and the sobbing becomes more distinct.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - ADAMS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is sure now, looks for the source of the sobbing and follows it -- the CAMERA with him -- to the bench.

</DIRECTION>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jennie --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
He sits beside her, takes her hands. She turns to him and we see that it is Jennie, helpless and heartbroken, unable to control her sobs. She is in a different hair-do than when we last saw her, and is about fourteen or fifteen.

(almost to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tonight!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
He can scarcely credit his ears. He has only just heard that it was many years ago and here is proof that from Jennie's standpoint it was tonight. But he pulls himself out of it, for this child is clearly grief-stricken right now and brushes off the mystery to comfort her.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know how you feel, Jennie -- I know how much it hurts -- But it isn't hurting them. Try to think of it that way.

<DIRECTION>
Jennie's sobs have been gradually subsiding during his last speech. They have now stopped and she looks up at him, dazed and almost incredulous.

	Yes -- I shouldn't cry, should I? They wouldn't like it. They died the way they wanted. So I guess I'm only crying for myself -- because they're gone -- and because I'm lonely --

Adams looks at her, understanding nothing.

(kindly)

	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Jennie -- I wish I could -- but I don't understand. I don't understand any of it. It's all so strange. Each time I see you, you've changed -- you're older... You talk about things that happened -- well, that happened long ago.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Did they? Sometimes I kind of think that, too.

	-- the trees were covered with little yellow green leaves -- and the sky was a different blue -- and the clouds were a different white. And a robin sang. But you didn't awaken to the warmth of spring, Eben. You became restless, despondent -- almost melancholy. What was it, Eben? I was worried about you. All of your new- found eagerness toward life was gone. You wouldn't work -- you seemed lifeless. What were you searching for? I couldn't understand. The actual truth never occurred to me. How could it have? I wept for you, Eben.

He throws them down. He goes to a table and stares down at a half-eaten can of beans with a spoon in it. He takes a spoonful -- looks at it -- and puts it down. He goes to his drafting board on which there is a paper. He starts to sketch -- a bridge -- then stops. Suddenly he has an idea. He looks around and gets a large canvas and starts to prepare it, -- stretching it, mounting it, wetting it, and setting it out to dry. As he is doing so, there is a knock on the door.

INT. MOORE'S RESTAURANT - EVENING

Adams is at work putting the last finishing touches to his mural of Michael Collins. Several people are seated at the tables drinking beer: regular patrons and people who have heard about it and come to watch. There are also several people at the bar. There are several Irish cops in various places, watching. There is a general hubbub as the scene opens.

All look at the painting in silence, then look from one to another, wordlessly.

He thinks a moment, gets an idea, then starts to applaud.

On all fours -- or seated on the floor -- as she slowly raises her head to him. She is very beautiful in her convent dress. Her beauty is that of a girl of seventeen. As she looks up at Adams her eyes are aglow. Over this we hear:

<JENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are we now?

</JENNIE>
<ADAMS>

is)

<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's finished, Jennie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
Pause. Slowly, Jennie looks at him with a feeling almost of reverence. Then she rises. Together they go and stand in front of the painting. A moment's pause. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it really of me, Eben?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIE>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's you, Jennie. Portrait of Jennie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<JENNIE>

	I think it's a fine painting.

	Do you?

</ADAMS>
<JENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(nodding gravely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it will make you famous. I think someday it will hang in a museum and people will come from all over the world to see it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIE>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if they do, it won't be my work they'd come to see.

	It will be you.

(simply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Eben. And now, you must sign it --

She takes up his brush and hands it to him. He takes the brush and signs the picture.

RETAKE Adams finishes signing. They look at each other. Jennie goes into Adams' arms.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Eben -- I want so desperately just to sit and watch you paint.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIE>
<ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
(gaily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that I've found the perfect model, I want to paint her again and again --

</ADAMS>
<JENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting, seriously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no -- I don't mean that. I mean I want you to paint all the beautiful things in the world...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she is suddenly a little sad)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Although some of them...

(who has been playing

	<DIALOGUE>
	with her hair and has not noticed her

change of mood)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the most beautiful thing in the world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
She throws him a little smile of acknowledgment, but we see that she is still sad and thoughtful.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eben, you know those pictures of yours -- of the sea and the lighthouse?...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Adams nods.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Each time I think of them my -- my heart seems to stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(almost a slight shudder)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She puts her hand in Adams'; it is trembling a little. Adams pats it, looks at her sympathetically.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Land's End Light? Yes, I suppose it is a forlorn sort of place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
She has been very thoughtful during this.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(she smiles a little, uncertainly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't let's talk about it any more.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she walks away from him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me about --

(she stops in front

	<DIALOGUE>
	of a canvas -- a

landscape of Paris)

</JENNIE>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, indeed!

	Oh, I wish that someday we could see it together. It would be such fun!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
She sits and looks out the window. Adams crosses to her, eagerly.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll do it, Jennie! I'll take you to the Luxembourg, and to the fair at Neuilly...
	</DIALOGUE>

(eagerly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes, Eben, yes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIE>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll go out to the Forest of St. Cloud in the spring, and drink new wine under the trees.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<JENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Eben -- I feel as though we were already there... as though we'd been spending our whole lives together...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Adams takes her in his arms and kisses her.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jennie, what is it that makes a man and a woman know that of all the other men and women in the world, they belong to each other?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
Jennie looks up at him adoringly, touches his lips with her fingers. He kisses them, continues speaking, while Jennie thoughtfully absorbs his words and considers them.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And is it just chance -- their being alive in the world at the same time?... Were there others, in other times of the world, whom we would have loved and who would have loved us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<JENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking her head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... no others... Among all the people who have lived from world's end to world's end, there's just one you must love -- one you must seek until you find him. You, Eben -- you, my darling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
She cups his face in her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know now what I've been searching for... I know now why I was hurrying -- hurrying to grow up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
She presses her lips to his. He puts his arms around her and holds her close. Suddenly there is a gust of wind, not too great, behind them. The papers blow. Jennie rises.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Eben, I must go.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't, Jennie...

<JENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to, but -- it won't be for long. And then --

</JENNIE>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<JENNIE>

(thoughtfully)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Then it will be -- for always.

<DIRECTION>
(slowly, with a strange
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	calm, and yet
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
wistfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, somehow I'm sure. I don't know quite when it will be -- or where -- but I'm sure it will be for always.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Adams has been looking at her hungrily, but with fear and doubt. There is another gust of wind, this time much stronger than the first. Jennie releases herself gently, speaks casually.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get my things, Eben.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
She walks to the bedroom. Adams turns, closes the window, looks out moodily as Jennie exits. The CAMERA MOVES UP TO A WAIST FIGURE OF ADAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIE_S_VOICE>

	Oh, Eben. What a lovely scarf!

RETAKE Jennie is slipping into her coat. She has the scarf in one hand. We see clearly the door leading to the hall in the b.g.

	It's yours, Jennie.

<JENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(delighted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A present? For me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNIE>
<DIRECTION>
But her excitement has faded somewhat, and as the CAMERA MOVES UP ON HER we see a curious and rather half-frightened sense of recognition.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
183B. INSERT - SCARF IN HER HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RETAKE It is the same scarf that we have seen in the earlier sequences.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PULLS BACK as Jennie, scarf in hand, walks a few steps and looks at Adams. There is an expression of infinite tenderness and love on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
183C. LONG SHOT - ADAMS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RETAKE He is staring moodily out the window; he does not see Jennie looking at him.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad you like the scarf, Jennie. I've been saving it for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
He turns, walks toward CAMERA (and Jennie) INTO WAIST FIGURE, stops short as he looks. His face falls as he peers around the room, realizes she is gone.

RETAKE Adams starts forward, realizes the futility, lowers his head, advances slowly back towards the window, stops. As he does, the rain starts to come down, and on the tableau of Adams standing with his back to us, the rain behind him over the darkening sky, we

(already shot)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A typically masculine room, sparsely but neatly furnished, comfortable and homey. A Franklin stove, set in the fireplace, burning coal, gives out a soft glow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adams stands staring out of the window moodily. Everything is quiet for a moment. Then Gus comes in, from an adjoining room, presumably the kitchen, carrying two cups of coffee. He sets one down and then walks over and sets the other one beside Adams.
</DIRECTION>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here y'are, Mack. Just as ordered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<DIRECTION>
Adams looks around, absently. He smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh -- thanks, Gus --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
He turns back to look out of the window. Gus gives him a quick look and then, in silence, walks back and sits and takes up his coffee. A moment's pause. He sips.
</DIRECTION>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beautiful coffee.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Y'know, Mack, bein' the beautiful coffee maker that I am, has saved me a lot of misery. Everytime a girl gets to pluckin' on my heart strings a little too loud -- I come home and make a cup of coffee -- and as I sip it I sez to myself, "Timothy Augustin, me bould bucko, what are you thinkin' of? When you can make coffee the way you do, what would you be needin' with a wife?"
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he looks over. There's
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	no reaction. He decides to make

another attempt)

	Yes, Mack -- many's the time this coffee has saved me, an' right --

<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's an Irishman's privilege to answer your questions with one of me own.

	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Supposin' now... remember, I'm only supposin'...

(he dwindles to a pause)
</DIRECTION>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're supposing what?

</ADAMS>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I mean is... if she didn't come back...

	She's got to. She's...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm only supposin'... but if something happened to her... Don't you have to go on livin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<DIRECTION>
Adams stares at Gus refusing to accept the thought. Another idea strikes him and a slow smile breaks on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see what you're getting at. You don't really believe Jennie exists, do you, Gus?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<GUS>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be puttin' words in me mouth... all I sez was...

	<DIALOGUE>
	I know Jennie exists... I know she's somewhere in New England...

<DIRECTION>
(becoming suddenly intense)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I've got to find her, Gus. I've got to!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
They look into each other's eyes. Adams turns abruptly and strides to the window. Gus hums a few bars of his song. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<GUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Weren't you tellin' me she went to a convent?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's not there.

	The Sisters are great people for keepin' in touch.

</GUS>
<ADAMS>

(an idea is hatching)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was very fond of some of the Sisters.

	Sure -- anyway, you'd be doin' something -- not just sittin' around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUS>
<ADAMS>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Gus -- it's a chance! Will you drive me out? I can pay you for it later.

	It's a great pity you know nothin' about friendship...

The thought of action transforms Adams. He smiles.

At one end of the room Adams, his hands folded behind his back, is looking out of a narrow, recessed window into the sunny countryside.

At the other end of the room, a door opens and a young Sister enters.

</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why -- Jennie died -- many years ago.

Another slight pause. For a second a horrified look goes over Adams' face. The Mother Superior sees it and adds quickly, gently.

<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>

	Oh, I -- I'm afraid I've shocked you.

</MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
<DIRECTION>
Adams dismisses the thought and recovers.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, no... we're obviously not speaking of the same person. You see, the Jennie Appleton I mean only left here a few months ago. I haven't heard from her -- and I'm very anxious to find out just where she is. I thought she might have written you.

	She was brought here by her aunt shortly after her parents' death. She was young, sensitive -- she loved life. We became great friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she pauses)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't Mother Superior then so I had more time to spend with our young girls than I do now. Jennie stayed with us until she graduated -- and then her aunt took her up to New England for the summer. We corresponded a great deal.

MEDIUM SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Of the Mother Superior. PAN WITH HER to a large file. She opens a drawer, searches a moment, then extracts a bundle of letters held together with a silk ribbon. She handles them carefully, the way one handles a cherished possession. She slips the letter on top out of the bundle and opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>

	This is the last one she wrote me.

DOLLY IN on her.

<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>

	"My dear Sister Mary of Mercy: We are returning very soon. The summer has been a very long and lonely one. How I want to see you again and sit and talk to you about all that has been worrying me!"

<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>

	No. You see, she was so young when...

<DIRECTION>
(then gently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She didn't have time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she turns back to the letter and reads)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"I know you tried to teach me how beautiful the world is and how it keeps on being beautiful every day... no matter what happens to us... But sometimes I have the dreadful feeling that this beauty will never be complete for me... that I will never find some one to love... who will love me. It's a thought that terrifies me, dear Sister, and I need your comfort and your wisdom to help me. Your loving Jennie."

Slowly the Mother Superior folds the letter and looks at Adams.

<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>

	No -- she didn't.

<DIRECTION>
(very simply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was the year when the terrible tidal wave hit the New England coast -- October fifth. I remember it well. I always receive communion for Jennie on that day.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I learned -- later -- that Jennie was in the habit of sailing out every day -- alone -- to a little cove near an abandoned lighthouse -- and during one of these trips the wave struck -- and that was the last any one ever saw of her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Adams is on his feet. He is excited and desperate. We feel that he already knows the answer to the question he is about to ask.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAMS>

<MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
<DIRECTION>
(trying to calm him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't doubt the ways of providence, Mr. Adams. What vision has been vouchsafed you, I can't say. But be sure it is for a reason beyond ours to know. You must have faith that there is a greater design -- a greater plan to the universe than we are able to comprehend. We know so little -- so very little. Be calm, Mr. Adams.

<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>

	That's right. October fifth.

(as though to himself, thinking)

	Yes --

</MOTHER_SUPERIOR>
<DIRECTION>
Adams stops and turns to her. He seems suddenly calmer.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAMS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you so sure? You say we know so little -- Then how can you say it happened many years ago? You say that Jennie's parents were killed. I found her sobbing on a bench the night it happened... You say she was a student here. I visited her here... You say she went to New England with her aunt. I was with her just before she left... Yes -- we know so little -- and yet now I know a little more. I know now the pattern of Jennie's life. But I also know I am part of it. She herself said that the strands of our lives were woven together -- and that neither time nor the world could break them. This I have faith in. Thank you, Mother. I must hurry. Thank you for your kindness.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAMS>
<DIRECTION>
He turns abruptly and hurries out. Through the above speech the Mother Superior has been looking at him with bewilderment, as though at a revelation. As he leaves, she continues to look after him, then moves over to the wall where, in a niche, is the figure of Saint Mary. The Mother Superior crosses herself and bows her head in prayer. (Get technical advice on this last).

Adams, carrying Jennie's portrait wrapped in brown paper, comes hurrying into the gallery. He is wild-eyed and excited. Miss Spinney comes up to him. (The whole mood and tempo of the picture accelerates from this point on.)

INT. MARINE HARDWARE STORE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OPEN ON A BAROMETER which indicates "Fair" weather. PULL BACK to reveal the Marine Hardware Store where Adams is leaning over the counter talking to the old storekeeper. In the foreground sits another old mariner, puffing at a pipe. It is suggested that he be in silhouette with rim lighting, with strong light on the face of the old storekeeper and Adams, and the middle distance and other parts of the store in deep shadows, for contrasting lighting effect. Through the window we see that it is a very foggy night. All that is visible, perhaps, is the mast of a sailing ship, or two of them, on one of which lights swing slighty. (There is no wind.) In the distance we hear the bell on a buoy and a mournful fog horn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we have PULLED BACK, we have seen a large calendar with the single page revealing the date, October 4th, with the numeral very large.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the dialogue after we've held the barometer for a few feet and directly we start to PULL BACK.
</DIRECTION>

Adams' dialogue has a note of urgency in it by contrast to the New Englanders who aren't going to be shaken out of their customs and tempo and who are both old men.

Eke looks sharply and strangely up at him - then, after a moment, speaks.

	Wal, ye see, it wuz this way. I used ter rent 'er my bote. She liked ter sail 'round the point -- down yonder past the Land's End Light. I used ter watch 'er leave. They wuz sump'n 'bout thet girl -- sump'n 'bout the way she stood before the wind...

Sometimes I think she di 'n' hear me, but I don't rightly know how thet could-a ben. She waved back at me, an' then she smiled -- like I never seen her smile before. An' then she flattened thet mainsail in tight an' sailed right straight inter thet storm.

Adams takes this, absorbs this final proof that Jennie died in her first existence. He strolls away a few feet, looks out into the fog, thinking hard, his back to Eke.

NOTE: Adams has been fighting the elements for hours, running up and down the lighthouse, back across the rocks and peninsula. He must be breathless and speak with some exhaustion.

<DIRECTION>
There are two or three girls (16 or 17 years old) standing at the foot of the portrait, looking up at it (we do not reveal the portrait). We are probably on a PROFILE of them or SHOOTING FROM THE ANGLE OF THE PORTRAIT.

Slowly, the CAMERA STARTS MOVING IN ON JENNIE'S PORTRAIT and faintly, as if a whisper, we hear:
</DIRECTION>
<JENNIE_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's a fine painting, Eben. I think it will make you famous. I think some day it will hang in a museum and people will come from all over the world to see it. And -- maybe they'll even know me because of it.

The CAMERA stops on the portrait.
