	This is the story of my older brother's strange criminal behavior and disappearance. We who loved him no longer speak of Wade. It's as if he never existed. By telling his story like this, as his brother, I separate myself from his family and those who loved him. Everything of importance -- that is, everything that gives rise to the telling of this story -- occurred during a single deer-hunting season in a small town in upstate New Hampshire where Wade was raised and so was I. One night something changed and my relation to Wade's story was different from what it had been since childhood. I mark this change by Wade's tone of voice during a phone call two nights after Halloween. Something I had not heard before. Let us imagine that around eight o'clock on Halloween Eve, speeding past Toby's, Route 29, comes a pale green eight-year-old Ford Fairlane with a police bubble on top. A square-faced man wearing a trooper's cap is driving the vehicle. Beside him sits a child, a little girl with a plastic tiger mask covering her face. The man is driving fast --

Wade Whitehouse, wearing a reflective vest, waves a district school bus into the parking lot. Noisy, jostling grade schoolers emerge from the bus. Jill's former classmates. Straight as a statue, Wade holds back traffic. Cars and trucks are backed up on the unplowed road. Horns honk and bleat; a woman's voice yells, "Whitehouse, we 'ain't got all day!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wade, daydreaming, seems oblivious to the commotion. Oblivious -- or just plum contrary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shiny black BMW approaches, speeding, passing traffic on the shoulder. A man and a woman in a fur coat sit in front, two children in back. Whitehouse waves for it to stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BMW accelerates through the intersection, ignoring Wade and the traffic. It whizzes past, spinning Wade, and is quickly up the road, spewing ice and exhaust. Wade slips to one knee. Honking ensues; every car goes where it wishes.

Wade, brushing off snow, follows the last bus as it pulls in. LUGENE BROOKS, 60, school principal, rushes over:

	Okay. It's likely there are people in the union who don't want Twombley to testify. They probably include his son-in-law who's vice-president and will probably be the next president. I read that in the papers. What's his name, Mel Gordon?

<DIRECTION>
Wade, driving Gordon's 4x4 with running lights and roll bar, takes 29 toward Pop's farm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pickup passes him: Jack Hewitt's burgundy Ford. Wade stops. Jack turns up Parker Mountain -- the road to the accident scene. Something's up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wade turns and follows. Jack's fresh tracks lead the way. Hewitt is driving fast. Wade keeps up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack, far ahead, approaches the accident scene. Stops. Night has fallen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wade comes over a low rise, spots Jack's pickup. He kills the lights, parks to block Jack's exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Footsteps in the snow. Wade watches, listens. What's he doing? Looking for evidence?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The burgundy pickup engine suddenly ROARS -- Jack's back and at the wheel -- the tires squeal, spit snow as he spins past Wade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wade starts his engine, gives pursuit. The pickups gun their engines, bumper to bumper, down mountain roads, lumber roads, rocky trails. Wild headlamps their only guide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

EXT. POND - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A trail turns sharply past a shallow beaver pond -- too sharply for Jack. He crashes through a stand of skinny birches straight out onto the pond. The pickup's momentum carries it across the pond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wade drops into first gear, follows, his headlights reflecting ice. He drives directly to Jack, bumper to bumper, headlight to headlight. Jack sticks his head out:
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You crazy sonofabitch! You'll sink us both! Get off the fucking ice! Get off!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Wade doesn't budge. Jack backs away; Wade inches forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hewitt's trapped. Trees behind him. Neither truck has traction on ice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jack steps out, swinging his fists wildly. Wade gets out. Jacks grabs his rifle, points it:
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll shoot you, Wade, I swear it! I'll fucking shoot you dead if you don't move away from that truck!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Wade backs off.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't move! I'll shoot you dead if you move!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
Jack gets back in his pickup, maneuvers it slowly around the Dodge, crosses the ice and is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wade stands in darkness. The only sound his idling truck, the wind. Then a third sound -- the snap of ice. Ice cracks ripple from the middle of the pond. Ice planes tip around the truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LaRiviere's snazzy Dodge slips, descends, disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Headlights glow under water, then go out. "Our Business Is Going In The Hole."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wade, alone in darkness, plops into the water, paddles to shore. Freezing, he finds Jack's tire tracks in the snow. He bangs his jaw.

He pulls over, lets it pass. He's parked in front of Alma Pittman's house. A sign on the lawn reads, "Alma Pittman, Town Clerk."
</DIRECTION>

He looks at the house, decides to go in. Wade walks up the shoveled steps, knocks on the door. ALMA, 60, wearing plaid shirt and slacks, greets him with a smile:

Wade, flaring, reaches across the counter and grabs Nick by the shirtfront! Nick's arm knocks over a cup of coffee.

The diner goes silent. Hunters look up. Jill's face is white; she starts to cry.

Wade looks over -- it takes him a moment to react -- bends down, comforting her. He wipes her nose with a napkin.

Wade and Jill pull up the drive, past Margie's car, into the barn. Her trunk and two side doors are open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margie comes out back with a battered suitcase, goes to her car. She's leaving. A plastic bag of clothes sits in the trunk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wade and Jill get out, approach:
</DIRECTION>
<WADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Going somewhere, Margie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADE>
<MARGIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.

	Don't lie to me. You're leaving me, I can see that.

	Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.

Jill, suitcase in hand, looking pathetic, tries to smile. A sadness passes over Wade's face.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Marg.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADE>
<DIRECTION>
Margie, watching him, quivers, starts to cry. She drops her suitcase, out of nowhere bawling like a baby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wade goes over, puts his arms around her, pats her back. His face is racked. He, too, seems about to cry -- if he could.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In his arms Margie feels trapped, overwhelmed by Wade's circumstances and terrible sadness. She pushes:

<JILL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave her alone! Leave her alone!

</JILL>
<DIRECTION>
Wade moves back like a bear, covering his face and arms. Jill, near hysterical, keeps after him, arms and fists flying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wade stumbles backwards into the snow. Jill still swings. Margie dashes to intervene as Wade swings his arms wide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jill flies into Marg. Her nose is bleeding. Wade's caught her across the mouth and nose. She takes cover behind Margie, crying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margie and Jill stand side by side, saying nothing. Wade looks up stunned, as if hit by a rock. Marg slowly backs away, her arms behind her holding Jill.

<MARGIE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Get in.

She closes the front door, starts the car. She backs out the drive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In her rear view mirror she sees the image of Wade receding, standing frozen, staring down at the snow. Pop emerges from the house, looks at his son, grinning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wade looks at his old man, that dumb devilish grin plastered on his father's face. Glen Whitehouse holds an empty whiskey bottle like a pistol.

Hunters' gunshots echo in the distance.

INT. BARN - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Wade unloads the cardboard boxes filled with his office belongings from the back of the truck and sets them on the ground. He gathers up his rifles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly! A whiskey bottle SLAMS against the back of his head. He drops to his knees, the guns scatter. He looks up with child's fear and guilt at his father.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Glen Whitehouse hovers over him, huge and ferocious: a colossus, lifting the bottle like a jawbone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wade cringes, scrambles for the dropped rifle. He grabs it by the barrel and, twisting around, swings it in a slow motion arc, smashing the edge of the wood stock against his father's head. A cold hard CRACK of bone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Glen Whitehouse -- shriveled again, no longer mythic -- flies back like a stuffed dummy. He collapses beside the empty C.C. bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wade, bleeding from the head, stands, staggers off Pop's inert body, aims his rifle at the old man's face.
</DIRECTION>
<WADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you now. I love you too.

Wade bolts the rifle, flicks off the safety, fires -- a loud CLICK. The gun's empty.

<WADE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joke. You scared me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WADE>
<DIRECTION>
He kneels down, lovingly touches the old man's face, caresses his lips, cheeks, nose, brows, smoothes back his stiff gray hair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pop's eyes are clouded. Blood suddenly drips from his ear to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wade rests the rifle against the truck. He bends over, slips his hands under his father's body, lifts him up. He carries Pop over to the workbench, lays him out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Groping beneath the bench, Wade finds the kerosene lamp. He unscrews it, pours kerosene the length of Pop's body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wade takes out his cigarette lighter, ignites it, holds it for a moment, places it to Glen Whitehouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fire spreads the length of Pop's body, bursting like a shroud of yellow flame. The oil-stained bench crackles; flames shoot up the old weathered wall.

Burning flesh and heat drive Wade backwards.

	The historical facts are known by everyone -- all of Lawford, all of New Hampshire, some of Massachusetts. Facts do not make history. Our stories, Wade's and mine, describe the lives of boys and men for thousands of years, boys who were beaten by their fathers, whose capacity for love and trust was crippled almost at birth and whose best hope, if any, for connection with other human beings lay in an elegiac detachment, as if life were over.

Wade spots Jack poised in a spruce grove, watching for deer. Wade bolts his rifle, releases the safety, aims and FIRES.

Unless the police happen to arrest a vagrant who turns out to be Wade Whitehouse -- or maybe he won't be a vagrant; maybe he will have turned himself into one of those faceless fellows working at the video store and lives in a town-house apartment at the edge of town until his mailman recognizes him from the picture at the post office -- unless that happens, there will be no more mention of him and his friend Jack Hewitt and our father. The story will be over. Except that I continue.
