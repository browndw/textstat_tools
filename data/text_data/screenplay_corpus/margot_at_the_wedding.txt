INT. TRAIN CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A cashier hands a boy, 13, his change across a counter. The boy stuffs the coins in his pocket. He lifts the cardboard tray with two hot dogs, a bag of chips, and two Cokes. This is Claude.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow him: He carefully carries the meal down the aisle, balances it in one hand as he opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train noise blares as he traverses the area between cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He enters the new car repeating the balancing act. He waits while a man shoves his back-pack onto the metal rack above the seats. Claude hurries a bit more now, his concentration alternating between the food and the path.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits next to a brunette woman. He hands her a hot dog.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
He's met by a severe and pinched face. The eyes have black circles -- there is a scar above her lip. Claude instantly blushes and mumbles:
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up and hurries a few seats further. He slides next to a pretty brunette woman, late 30's, with straight shoulder length hair. Her name is Margot.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was quick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I sat next to the wrong person.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Where?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She stretches up and peers over the seats. He grabs her shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't look. She'll see you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Careful with my blouse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margot is sleeping, her head against the window. Claude listens to his iPod. He takes out the earphones, gets up, and walks to the front of the car. Opens the door and goes between cars.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train roars and screeches. Claude screams. He stops, looks around. He screams again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claude and his mother gaze out the dirt streaked window at a river. An old castle-like structure emerges from the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Houses are run-down. In the distance there's a power plant. Electrical lines crisscross the sky. Claude puts his finger against the glass and traces the wires.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will the wedding be crowded?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I think she doesn't know anyone anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long has she known Malcolm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only a year.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that short?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
(pointedly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you marry someone you'd only known a year?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going to ever get married.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't say I have a lot of hope for the whole thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are we going then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're supporting her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought she wasn't speaking to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...no...I wasn't speaking to her, but I'm over it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FERRY DOCK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ferry is docked. Cars pull up onto the boat. Margot runs, clutching a suitcase, holding down a floppy wine colored sun hat. Claude hurries alongside her, a bag slung over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FERRY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rumbling and sputtering of the boat. People get out of their cars and stretch their legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claude leans against the rail and lets the spray hit his face. Margot's cell vibrates. The caller ID: HOME. She stuffs the phone in her pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why aren't you wearing your new shades?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think I need them right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You begged for those glasses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, but...I will wear them, I just feel like people might think it's weird that a kid is wearing dark shades.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's ridiculous.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Claude reluctantly takes out a pair of thin wrap-around punk sunglasses and puts them on. He looks around self- consciously.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look very cool.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He takes them off.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't need them right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margot and Claude wait. The ferry has emptied out.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do they know we're here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
A maroon Volvo station wagon peels around a bend and stops across the road. Two eyes peer out from just below the backseat window. A man, 40, in dumpy cargo shorts rolls down the window. He has a small moustache -- he's harried and sweaty. This is Malcolm. He points at Margot and Claude.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VOLVO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm drives. He smokes with the window open. Margot is in the passenger seat. In the back, Claude and the girl, Ingrid, sit shyly, their hair blows turbulently in the wind. Ingrid, 11, wears shorts, sandals, and a batik shirt with a panda on it.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul apologizes for not coming, she's still getting the house ready.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry it was such short notice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care. Paul's frantic, but I don't give a shit. Oh, and Ingrid wants me to tell you that she made us all bracelets.
	</DIALOGUE>
<INGRID>
<DIRECTION>
(embarrassed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I wanted...I wanted to wait...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I thought you asked me to tell them. Anyway...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm holds up his wrist and shows a knit blue and orange bracelet.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got Knicks colors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<INGRID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're not Knicks colors!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INGRID>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's beautiful, Ingrid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<INGRID>
<DIRECTION>
(to Claude)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I made this one for myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INGRID>
<DIRECTION>
She shows him the purple and green one around her wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<INGRID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yours is yellow. Is that okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INGRID>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<INGRID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's your dad and Josh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INGRID>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They might come later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Josh's spring break is next week. Jim teaches through Friday and then they open the house in Vermont on the weekend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
(bluntly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It means a lot to Pauline that you're here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Margot nods awkwardly -- she blushes.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Good.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A car suddenly pulls out of a driveway, but nowhere near their car. Malcolm swerves anyway.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy Jesus! Watch it, dicksack!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Ingrid giggles. Margot clutches the handle above the door.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you're wondering about the moustache --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I wasn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had a full beard for a while and then when I shaved it I left this part for last, you know to see how it looked, and... It's meant to be funny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Margot nods politely. The sound of tires on gravel:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trunk slams shut. The Volvo is parked in a driveway alongside a grey Colonial house that sits above the water. They lift bags. An old mutt ambles toward them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline emerges from the house. She's pretty like her sister, late 30's. She walks briskly toward them. Margot smiles and opens her arms, but Pauline passes her and dips down to embrace Claude. She kisses him on the lips.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're so handsome.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
Now she hugs Margot. They both tear up. Claude beams.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never thought I'd get you here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
A loud thud. They all turn toward the property fence. A large pile of dead flowers and rotting plants has been dumped into their yard. There's whispering and movement through brush on the other side. Margot looks at Pauline with concern.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're arriving in the midst of a drama. Ingrid, make sure Wizard is inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm trudges over to the trash cans.
</DIRECTION>
<INGRID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the Voglers.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The neighbors want us to cut down our tree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
She indicates a large oak that extends up and into the adjoining property.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that's our tree!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<INGRID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They think it's sick and rotting their property.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INGRID>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're having the ceremony under it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You took the swing down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pauline thinks this is their way of trying to be friends. I think they resent us because we're...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
He searches for the word, but can't come up with anything. He says wearily:
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what we are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLAUDE'S GUEST ROOM/INGRID'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claude sits on the squeaky bed, a yellow bracelet on his wrist. An old flip-clock hums on the night-table. A door opens onto a bathroom which has another door open onto another bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ingrid sits on her bed observing Claude. She holds a realistic-looking stuffed rooster in an old-style tuxedo.
</DIRECTION>
<INGRID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is my room.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
<INGRID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you like showers or baths?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Showers. What about you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Ingrid shrugs. She says, already bored with the topic:
</DIRECTION>
<INGRID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INGRID>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRWELL/MARGOT'S GUEST ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline and Margot carry bags up the stairs. Margot now wears a knit red bracelet. They're tentative with one another.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is Malcolm what you thought he'd be?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I didn't know what to --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The moustache is temporary. He left it for last when he was shaving. It's meant to be funny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He told me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
They enter the guest room. The windows are wide open, the curtains blowing, but the room is very neatly made up.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry -- with so little time to prepare, we had to put you in Malcolm's storage room --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was Becky's room. Poor Becky.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, poor Becky. Now it's a storage room. I've just started to feel like it's our house not my parents. You know?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our parents.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course. It might still smell like paint, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought he was a musician.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline jimmies down the stiff windows. Margot begins to unpack and hang up clothes in the closet.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, music's officially a hobby... He's painting now. And writing letters to newspapers and magazines. He's very meticulous, he'll spend up to a week writing a response to a music review. He's incredibly smart. Maybe too smart. I don't know. We're doing very well.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. I mean, you must be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know where to begin. What can I tell you? It seems I'm pregnant, but it's really early so... I haven't told anyone. I mean, I haven't told Malcolm or Ingrid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, if it sticks. We'll see. I hope so. Things are good. We did a couples seminar two months ago or so in Maine. They give you exercises and things to do. I know you're not convinced, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
(vaguely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mm hm.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got engaged right afterwards. The guy who runs it, Strickland, wrote a really interesting book about loving which I'll lend you if you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
(non-committal)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But only if you'll read it. Because I need it back. I made notes in the margins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I may not get to it for a while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm not going to lend it to you if you're not going to read it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
They meet eyes. Pauline quickly turns away.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's going to be very informal by the way. Just Mom and Becky. Malcolm's brother. Few friends. And now you and Claude. Nothing like the first one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>

<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was going to say, "I'd really like some white wine."
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Yeah. We have a... Well...I'm glad you changed your mind and came. I never heard from you after I sent the invite...I even wondered if you got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
(quickly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm so pleased we're here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you get it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline waits for an explanation.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry you were so angry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't angry. I was...disappointed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh huh. But you see when you say, "disappointed" it puts me in a crummy situation. Like I let you down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you did in a way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't see it like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. I felt betrayed. Is that word okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Again, you're making me the aggressor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were the aggressor.

	Let's not... I've become a really good cook.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE DAY Malcolm strums his guitar and smokes. Pauline sits at his feet with Ingrid and Claude. The kids look at a record sleeve. Margot is curled up on the sofa writing in a little brown notebook. She wears oval tortoise-shell glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe you've still got all of our old records.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Ingrid pulls an album toward her. Her eyes widen at the scary image on the cover. She quickly turns it over and hands it to her mother.
</DIRECTION>
<INGRID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom, can you hide this please.
	</DIALOGUE>

Pauline puts the record sleeve on top of a shelf.

	Malcolm played with Ric Ocasek once?

	In the late `80's. It was a solo gig after he left the Cars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>

	So, you're kind of famous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>

Malcolm reddens.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No. Believe me, I'm not. I used to want to be, but, No. Do you want to be famous?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claude wants to be very famous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, make sure you can handle rejection. I can't. For me, expectation just turns to disappointment. So, ultimately I'd rather not try. It'll all go black for us soon enough anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claude, ignore him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline sneaks a look at Margot who is watching Malcolm with an expression of either contempt or confusion. Pauline grows uncomfortable. She says to Claude:
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When your mother moved to New York she used to send me books and records. She sent me REM's Murmur...
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the Pixies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And X. She was very cool your mother.

</PAULINE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You only liked top forty.

</MARGOT>
<PAULINE>

</MARGOT>
<PAULINE>

	No, that was our dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline and Margot crack up laughing. Malcolm raises an eyebrow at Claude.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our father used to strip down to his skivvies and beat us with a belt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That man had a sexual screw loose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's awful -- that stuff that happens to kids. Malcolm was fondled by a male baby-sitter.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just use that information however you want...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. We're with family. I figured...
	</DIALOGUE>

Claude looks at Malcolm. Malcolm doesn't meet his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think Becky got it the worst.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did she ever. Raped by the horse trainer...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>

Margot breaks into laughter. Pauline spits her seltzer back into the glass. They both laugh hysterically. Tears stream down Margot's face. Claude watches.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. PATIO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm, Pauline, Margot, Claude and Ingrid sit with a homosexual couple, Alan, 40's, and Toby, 30's, and their son, Bruce, 8, at an old wooden table eating crab, salad and soup. Part of Alan's face is paralyzed.
</DIRECTION>
<TOBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alan rolled over in bed and looked at me and he said I can't feel my face. It took three doctors before we knew it was Bells Palsy.

	They say a brush of wind can do it.

	Feeling is slowly coming back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOBY>
<MALCOLM>

	We're all getting older... Which is terrible -- I don't care how universal it is. I can't remember names anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>

	I have that. I blank out on certain words now too. Like the other day, I couldn't remember the word for...

	I've forgotten it again. The stuff in wine. Sediment! That was it.

<MALCOLM>

	I know that. I was talking more about not remembering who was the bassist for Motley Crüe.

Malcolm lights up a cigarette. He offers one to Claude who shakes his head, No.

Claude reluctantly follows Ingrid and Bruce. He looks back longingly at the table of adults.

We follow the kids inside. We hear in the background:

	It's vital. If you keep telling him he's like everyone else he'll wonder why he isn't. He's suffering.

<TOBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's tested very well. He does B's in school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOBY>
<DIRECTION>
Claude stops -- his mother and Toby are arguing out the window. Her eyes meet his for a second -- they make no connection -- she goes back to Toby.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, that's how autism works. One part of the brain can work fine while the other is damaged.

<MARGOT>

Pauline unloads the plates onto the kitchen counter. She hesitates and exhales a deep, anxious breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margot paces while talking on a cell phone in the herb garden. She drinks a white wine with ice cubes and smokes a joint. The bottle lies at her feet, three-quarters empty.
</DIRECTION>

	You haven't spoken to her in years - -
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM_S_VOICE>

	Well, we're speaking now. She is my closest friend despite it all... You're the one who's been trying to get me to call her.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you tell Claude what you're doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jim, this guy, Malcolm. He's exactly what you'd imagine except I think he's clinically depressed. Not ugly, but completely unattractive. And he has no job. The best I can make out is that he's a letter writer. I don't know, the house looks weird to me...she's trying too hard and it's kind of a mess...they took down the swing...

Silence on the other end.

<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?

	You said you weren't a hundred percent on this. You said that like a week ago. Can I come up there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM_S_VOICE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I don't want to see you -- I feel happier already having done it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<JIM_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? You feel happier...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Please don't tell Claude anything please, until we've talked more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM_S_VOICE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to tell him. And we need to tell Josh. Did he do his homework?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<JIM_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

INT. CLAUDE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT Claude sleeps in bed. Margot gently touches his face. She whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you asleep?

</MARGOT>
<CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>

<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just talked to your dad...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
Claude's eyes remained closed, but he smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm only going to tell you if you won't remember.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Margot hesitates. She changes her mind and says thoughtfully:
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone finds you so funny and charming. I always get compliments about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
Margot stands. She catches herself in a warped mirror and smears some eye make-up off of her face.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you having fun? Is it nice to see Pauline?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<CLAUDE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I really like her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. She is crazy though.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In what way?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's really berserk. Maybe it's hormones. You don't notice anything different about Pauline?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's pregnant -- she told me. But she's keeping it a secret -- I mean from Malcolm and even Ingrid. Which I think is unforgiveable. Now she'll have to marry him. What's she planning -- to get married and not drink champagne? Then she'll just be lying. I guess she's afraid she'll miscarry. She probably will. I think on some level she's ambivalent about the marriage and that's why she's not telling him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you stoned, Mom?
	</DIALOGUE>

Water runs from the bathroom. Malcolm cradles a glass of whiskey and stands nude in front of a full length mirror.

<MALCOLM>

(shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My scrotum is longer than my penis.

He turns around and looks at his ass. Pauline walks out of the bathroom. She wears mens pajamas, the top open.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's sweet how Claude looks up to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He waits for a reaction and gets none.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Margot doesn't seem as crazy as you made her out to be.

<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What she did to Toby and Alan tonight didn't seem crazy enough for you?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, she cares deeply.

<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, she's really worried about Bruce.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

	Nothing, you keep changing your position -- I'm just trying to figure out if I should agree with you or not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, can't she be both, care deeply and be crazy? Do people have to be all one thing?

</PAULINE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess not.

<PAULINE>

INT. MARGOT'S GUEST ROOM - SAME

Margot lies on her front, her hand underneath her. She tries to masturbate. The bed creaks. Finally, she flips over and gives up. She wears a rubber night-guard in her mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A croquet game in progress. Pauline and Malcolm play Margot and Claude. Ingrid lies in the grass singing to herself. The dog next to her. Malcolm concentrates -- he carefully lines up his shot. Finally, he swings --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ball misses the wicket. He shakes with frustration.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Claude looks through a slit in the wooden fence and into the neighbor's yard: A naked man, 40's, crouches. Arms extend from below and pull him downward. His ass pokes up over the weeds.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, you're up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
Claude shakes out of his reverie. He walks briskly up to his ball and smacks it. It bullets forward and lands just short of Pauline's ball.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claude, don't just whack it. Think about it before you hit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.

Pauline knocks her ball into Claude's. She holds her ball down with her foot and prepares to swing.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul, what are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sending Claude's ball into the bushes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take the extra hit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to do that.

</PAULINE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the smarter play.

She whacks -- Claude's ball travels about two feet.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pauline! See, I knew you couldn't... Your feet are too small!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Margot steps up to take her turn. She regards the house.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You took the awnings down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
Claude looks back into the adjacent yard: Flashes of skin. A breast. Pubic hair. Claude crouches to see more clearly -- the bodies disappear from sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm draws a deep breath and takes a few practice strokes. He swings -- his ball rockets past Margot's, rolls up over a ridge and onto the cement drive. It quickly sails down into the road and bounces into a ditch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm shakes furiously. He lifts his mallet, turns toward house, rethinks momentarily, and hurls it up over incline and down to the water. Pauline puts her hands on her hips.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>

Malcolm hesitates then tramps down the stairs to the beach. Claude watches the pink of flesh moving up and down.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honey, you're up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He approaches his ball and smacks it toward the double wickets.

	You're going the wrong way.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.

Pauline cackles loudly. Margot turns around and stares at her. Malcolm calls from the stairs:

The five eat a salad nicoise lunch.

	Malcolm, do you notice how Pauline sometimes can't make eye-contact. How her gaze hovers just above your head.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I kind of know what you mean.
	</DIALOGUE>

Margot strides toward the tree. The group follows behind.

She grabs hold of a branch and lifts herself.

Claude grins, impressed.

With brisk dexterity, Margot scales the tree.

<DIRECTION>
Claude, Pauline, Malcolm and Ingrid watch with glee from below.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Margot reaches a perch near the top and looks down at the gang. They wave. She waves back. The sun is hot. She sweats, flushed. She takes a deep breath and relaxes against the bark. Trees for miles. The neighbors' house is faded and grey. In the far distance, toxic white smoke comes out into the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An earwig walks across her arm. She flicks it off, slips for a moment and catches herself. Her breathing grows more rapid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bug buzzes around her head. She swats at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her family has stopped watching. Claude and Malcolm throw a baseball. Pauline's gone back inside. Ingrid clears the table.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
(under her breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
She wipes her face, her shirt is almost entirely soaked. The buzzing continues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close on Margot's ear. A small black gnat lands on the lip of the lobe. It hesitates and darts inside the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margot gasps. She jams her pinky in her ear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline comes back out with an ice tea.

Ingrid swims beneath Claude -- long strands of hair stream up from beneath the surface.

Margot gets out of the water and Dick wraps her in a towel. For a moment it's an embrace. Margot looks quickly over at Claude --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His foot slips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He topples in. Water roars around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens his mouth. Bubbles spurt out. He drifts down. Lying next to the drain is a field mouse. Its eyes are white.

<DIRECTION>
Splash. Hands wrap around him. He goes up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sounds of wind and blurry voices now clearer.

Pauline brings Claude to the surface and pushes him to the ladder. She helps him climb out. Ingrid and Maisy are grinning. Their expressions slowly shift as they see Claude's face.

Claude is sobbing.

	I didn't say I didn't want him to. Why do you care? It's not in his life -- we're New Yorkers. If he wants to learn when he's older, he can. I'm curious why you're so interested in the whole thing.

	Are you excited about the talk? I thought I'd come if that's okay. My friend, Agnes, asked me, "What's it like to have a celebrity as a sister?" I said, I've got no problem with celebrity. Alice Munro taught at Bennington and was kind of a friend of mine.

EXT. FOREST - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margot walks the path alone. She hugs herself as a light breeze kicks up. Her footsteps echo in the trees. The little pink sneaker still lies in the dirt. She crouches down and takes it. CUT TO: CLOSE: A note is being written.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"...and if you are acting with any sort of abuse toward your child I will call the police."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The word "any" is then underlined twice. The page is torn from her little brown book.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VOGLER HOUSE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margot's fist is raised about to knock on the front door. She stops herself. She puts the note on the Welcome mat and holds it in place with the child's shoe. She wanders around to the back of the house. She looks into a lighted window:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a white tiled bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wet brown animal body covered in clear plastic is balanced on the sink. Mr. Vogler tears into the plastic. The carcass is butterflied open exposing the innards and ribs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Vogler runs the tub. She pours salt from a box in the water. The man slides his hand in her waist-band. She rubs against him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margot chews her cuticle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man saws the legs. His arm jerks back and forth, straining to cut through the bone. Sweat pours down his temples.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margot raises her hand to her face and presses against the window. She peers through her fingers. The blade pierces the bone with a violent release and the hoof falls to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margot moves to another window. The pig's face now looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blood drips and leaks into the crevices of the tile. The woman brandishes a syringe filled with an orange liquid.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a face appears in the glass. Margot leaps back. It's a thin boy. He says something. The family turns to the window. The father flicks off the bathroom light. From inside Margot illuminates like an apparition. Margot scampers into the trees. She pushes through branches, her shirt tears. She runs. INT. CLAUDE'S GUEST ROOM - EVENING Claude sits on the bed. The record sleeve from Blondie's "Parallel Lines" rests in his lap. He reads the lyrics to the song, "Sunday Girl." He depresses the red record button on an old portable tape recorder. He sings a cappella and full voice, passionately, as sweetly as he can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maisy appears in the doorway and watches. Claude turns mid- lyric. He jumps, startled.
</DIRECTION>
<MAISY>
	<DIALOGUE>

Fumbling, Claude shuts off the tape recorder.
</DIRECTION>

</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
She drifts into the room and hovers closely above Claude who remains on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margot passes by in the hallway, disheveled from her escape. She watches: Maisy takes the lyric sleeve from Claude's hands. Her T-shirt hangs above her waist showing her smooth stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<MAISY>

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's probably for the best. I have this theory, I think, historically, women have been held back in so many ways that when they get power, like they do behind the wheel, they can't help but abuse it. It's akin to Hannah Arendt's Eichmann theory about prison guards and prisoners switching rolls.

Margot watches from the upstairs window. The mother and daughter walk arm in arm down what will be the aisle. Finally, Margot turns away -- she's in Pauline and Malcolm's room.

She opens drawers: Underwear, socks, bras. Topless photos of Pauline posing in the bedroom. A photograph of Margot and Pauline in their teens on Halloween dressed as Pat Benatar and Patty Smyth respectively.

Margot grins.

Another photo of Margot, Pauline and an obese woman -- Becky - - in their 20's.

Margot's expression saddens. She opens another drawer. Polaroids of Pauline and Malcolm in different sexual poses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She flips through these and drops them on the bureau.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amidst the underwear and socks she finds pill containers. She squints to read the labels. She opens one and shakes out a few blue pills into her palm. She swallows one and puts the rest in her pocket.

</PAULINE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess I said something.

</MARGOT>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did. You don't have to tell him everything.
	</DIALOGUE>

	He wants to know. If I don't tell him, he figures it out.

Ingrid sinks into her mother's body. Claude and Margot walk ahead.

	Why would you think I'd do something like that? That's awful.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margot enters and opens the refrigerator. She gets out a white wine bottle. She turns around and jumps, startled.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Woa!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm sits at the table, eating saltines out of the box, a pad and paper in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, sorry. I'm here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I... I should've looked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just writing my vows. Trying to do something appropriate but also funny -- not jokey, more character based humor.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Margot pours herself a glass of wine. She looks to Malcolm to see if he wants some. He shakes his head. She takes a long drink. Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You having an okay time?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah. Besides Wizard getting --

	Yeah, we'll...we'll find him...or else, I don't know...

</MALCOLM>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We won't.

<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right, or else he's dead or something.

</MALCOLM>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Malcolm mumbles a tune.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God, this is the same toaster we had here as kids. Paul is so weird.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hear you've heard the news.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Congratulations.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty cool. Hard to fully take in. It's a little abstract still. I haven't had that thing yet where you realize that you're not the most important person in the world. I'm anxious for that to happen. I guess I have to thank you -- I wouldn't know yet if you hadn't arrived.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're welcome.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I can't help but worry I'll pass some not so great genes onto the kid. I mean, in my family there's a lot of hand washing, you know. I don't have it, but my brother does.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You working on anything now?

He nods. She nods. Silence.

<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm working on some acrylic paint --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody fills the ice cube trays.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm stops, immediately embarrassed. Margot is looking in freezer. She takes out the trays and brings them to sink. She runs the water.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, what were you --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing. It doesn't matter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, what were you saying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It really... Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
She treads back to the refrigerator, balancing the full trays.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was saying I'm doing these abstractions in acrylic paint. But it's not... I'm not getting paid or anything. I don't know, I hate that question, "What do you do?"
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You asked me.

<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, but...

Malcolm exhales in frustration.

EXT. FIELD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline and Malcolm open the gate to the Vogler's property.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we shouldn't mention the tree, we should let them know that there will be people and music on Saturday and it will be louder than usual.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And that they can come for a glass of champagne. But you tell them. I think they respond to you better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
They approach the Vogler's sun-worn and paint chipped house.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I am ultimately one of them. You shouldn't've made me shave the stache.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hey, Ingrid is asking me if I was ever gay. Do you know what that's about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
Mr. Vogler, wearing a fleece vest and carrying a hatchet over his shoulders, tramples out of the brush.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Vogler stops. His face is jagged and worn.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, I'm Pauline. This is Malcolm. We've met before. We're your neighbors.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The man watches them strangely with icy blue eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<VOGLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gonna cut that tree down?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOGLER>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we grew up with that tree and we're getting married under it Saturday and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
She waits for Malcolm to jump in. He doesn't. Vogler says softly, but sternly:
</DIRECTION>
<VOGLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The roots are growing into our property. It's rotting, it's killing our plants.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOGLER>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We had a tree doctor out and he said it was healthy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline smacks Malcolm's arm.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would it hurt you to say anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? What do you want from me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're making me do the whole fucking thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You brought up the tree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He brought up --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
She stops herself. She says to Vogler:
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry... This was better thought-through back at the house.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline's gaze goes above Vogler's head -- like Margot described earlier. He runs his hand through his hair as if something might be caught in there.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We were wondering if you and your wife -- I'm sorry I forgot her name -- would like to come over for...
	</DIALOGUE>
<VOGLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should ask her. She makes the plans. I'm going to go in now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOGLER>
<DIRECTION>
He tramps inside. The screen door bangs.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I felt like you didn't give me a chance to say what I wanted to say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline hits him in the chest and starts to walk away. Malcolm comes after her, his rage growing.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to punch that guy in the nose!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've never hit anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have too!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lots of -- You don't know them. They're not around because I've punched them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
A smile breaks across Pauline's face. Malcolm seethes.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't laugh, Pauline. It's not funny. I'll fucking punch your sister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm clenches his fists. He points at Vogler's place.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The threat is not out there. It's in our house. It's sleeping in my studio. I mean, I wouldn't actually hit her, but I feel...I feel like doing it. She's such a fucking idiot.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's not an idiot. You might not like her --
	</DIALOGUE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She is. She is an idiot! You're an idiot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're both fucking morons. I'm so fucking... I'm trying so hard. You don't give me any credit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, I have the emotional version of whatever bad feng shui would be. I don't know. You tell me, you understand this shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you drink your teas?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I drank my fucking teas! Don't judge me now. Really, I think when you look back at this you're going to see I'm not acting like a crazy person. That this is the right reaction. In proportion with what is going on. This is right!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm looks around furiously. The only thing available to him is a leafy stalk. He pulls on it, but it won't uproot. He tears the leaves off in a rage.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have the most oddly self- conscious form of rage I've ever --
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Exhausted he approaches her. He says, still with anger:
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's make love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline walks back to the house, buttoning her dress. She looks up suddenly and stops: A man watches her from the lawn. He holds a bouquet of flowers. Pauline runs to him.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jim...

EXT. PATIO - LATE DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline, Malcolm, Margot, Jim, Claude and Ingrid eat fish stew and peasant bread. Jim's flowers sit in a vase. He wears a tan knit bracelet that Ingrid made.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a difficult decision because Claude has so many friends at school now, but it is expensive and Bronx Science is a great public school.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't get into Stuyvesant.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd rather stay at Packer, but it's so expensive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm lifts up a bottle of Jameson from the floor near his chair and pours himself another stiff drink.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Josh is a great test taker, but Claude thinks more abstractly. He's more creative. Right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Jim smiles warmly at his son.

<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw the one armed man who really has two arms at the bodega.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you give him confusing change?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did. I tripped him up with some nickels. And a Canadian quarter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I tried the other day? Sitting down to pee. Have you done this, Jim?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did it as a lark. As a joke really. I was going to call Pauline in and say, guess what I'm doing here...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry I didn't get to have that experience.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was thinking, you know, my dad used to say, "Why stand when you can sit." And this is a really good example of that. I mean, it took me so long to try because I was embarrassed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the sisters)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys do it all the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never sit down in a public place. I squat and hover.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Ingrid goes wide eyed for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, I recommend it. At least to try it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jim, I'm sorry about the room. It's usually Malcolm's storage room so it's kind of make-shift right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
Margot stares at Jim.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Margot, open your gift.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<DIRECTION>
An unopened present in blue tissue paper sits beside Margot's plate.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I get self-conscious opening presents in front of people. This weekend is about Pauline.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh...poo. Open it Margot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
Margot slowly unties the white ribbon and peels away the tape. Pauline groans:
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, get to it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
Margot takes out a pair of furry slippers.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those look warm.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember last year in Vermont you said your feet were freezing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes find Claude who watches his parents carefully. She leans across the table to Jim and they kiss chastely and briskly on the lips.

<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.

<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's okay. Two sets are fine, right?

</JIM>
<MARGOT>

	It makes me sad to get a present that I already have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>

She jams her pinky into her ear trying to get at the bug.

<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's wrong with your ear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I asked you not to come. I was so clear and you did it anyway so blithely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We need time alone to sort this out. You can't just run away --

	Okay, so we're here. I'm giving you this time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIM>
<DIRECTION>
(trying a joke)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, now you're putting too much pressure on me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jim smiles crookedly at her. She half-smiles back. He takes a moment, preparing to speak. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
His headlights catch a woman cowering at the roadside. They pass.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep driving.
	</DIALOGUE>

Jim slowly pulls over to the shoulder.

Jim gets out of the car. A sobbing woman crouches, cradling a bloody dog.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please help me.

Jim comes toward her.

INT. RENTAL CAR - NIGHT Jim drives, his front covered in blood. Margot is shot-gun. The lady rides in back with the panting pit in her lap.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>

	Hurry...he's dying. He's dying.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Margot puts her hands over her ears. Jim speeds up.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>

Jim comes outside tucking his wallet in his back pocket. Margot sits on the car hood smoking a joint.

<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You paid, didn't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course you would've.

Margot stubs out the joint on the car roof. Jim suddenly removes his sweater and puts it around her shoulders. He fishes into his pants pocket for his keys. Tears start down Margot's cheeks.

Margot leans in to him, her forehead presses against his cheek. After a moment, he puts his arms around her.

INT./EXT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margot smokes by the open door. She drinks a glass of white wine. Pauline eats from a left-over Chinese container.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it were someone else I'd understand it, I'd feel sympathy even. But since it's me, I just feel bad. And horribly critical. I haven't been able to tell Claude what's happening. And I have to. I'm going to.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(frustrated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can I be all these people? How can I be married to Jim. And fuck Dick. And want them both and then neither of them...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. We're at the age where we're becoming invisible to men and if a guy wants to fuck us, it's very tempting.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you saying?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm saying, if you get your sense of self from being fuckable and that starts to wane -- it's very hard. I almost had an affair too. But you know, you don't have to do it. You can, I don't know, get a manicure or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
Margot grows furious. She turns to hide her face.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know I tell people you're my closest friend. I really miss you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
(barely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I can't help feeling that you really came to my wedding because I live a mile away from the guy you're fucking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Pauline. You make it sound like I'm using you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
There is a long silence between them. Finally, Pauline indicates to Margot that she has something in her nostril.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a...

Margot clears her nose quickly with her finger.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I get it?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I think so.

</PAULINE>
<MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Paul, what are you doing getting married to this guy? He's not good enough for you. He's so coarse, he's like guys we rejected when we were sixteen. You know...don't make a mistake like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, maybe I have no right to say that, but you know I'm truthful so... Would you rather I lie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who should I be with then?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
A smashing sound. Margot steps outside: Two hooded figures turn over a recycling can, glass smashes on the ground. Garbage is strewn across the driveway.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Hey, you! You pick that up. I will call the police. This is our property. Pick that up.

Claude and Ingrid idle in the tall grass calling to Wizard.

	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to see me dance?
	</DIALOGUE>
<INGRID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.

Claude dances. The gangly weeds blow around him. There's a rustling in the brush. A patch of fur catches Ingrid's eye.

<INGRID>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Wizard...

The animal is gone.

A figure appears in the distance behind Claude. The boy, the Vogler's son, approaches shirtless in swimming trunks. Ingrid's attention goes to him.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not watching.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
The boy comes into focus. He holds a dead squirrel by its tail. Ingrid backs up next to Claude. The boy stops a few feet away and hurls the squirrel at them. The kids jump back as it lands at their feet.

Claude takes Ingrid's arm and they start to walk away.
</DIRECTION>
<INGRID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a Vogler.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INGRID>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's just a stupid boy.

Claude sneaks a look over his shoulder -- the boy follows. Claude's gait quickens.

<INGRID>

</INGRID>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Ingrid.

</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Ingrid slows, lifts her leg and removes a sandal. The boy is behind them. Claude yanks Ingrid's arm and she topples over.
</DIRECTION>
<INGRID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oww!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INGRID>
<DIRECTION>
Claude leans down to help her. The boy leaps on Claude. They both crash to the ground and roll through the grass.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get him off me. Ingrid!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Ingrid hesitates then runs toward the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claude wrestles with the boy. The boy growls. He grabs hold of Claude's arms and sinks his teeth into Claude's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ayy! Help me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>

Claude kicks and yanks himself free. He runs wildly.

Close on Claude. Tears stream down. He coughs and spits.

Claude bursts through the front door. Ingrid sees Claude and runs to the kitchen. Margot, in a suit, goes over notes.

He tilts his head, she leans down and looks at his neck. There are red and purple bite marks.

Claude grabs her arm.

	No, don't! It'll get worse. Why did you say anything to them?

</CLAUDE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claude, this isn't my fault.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That boy bit me because you couldn't keep your fat mouth shut.

INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY

A placard reads: A Conversation with Margot Zeller and Dick Koosman. People mull about with drinks. Pauline and Claude admire the display of Margot's books.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really want to know? I'll tell you. She wrote a story about Lenny and me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(flips through pages)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it's in here. I mean we were talking almost every day at this point and there was no warning. Maybe a couple of remarks that she'd used some things of ours... Then The New Yorker comes -- we have a subscription -- and there's the story and... It's things we said and did -- stuff I told her in confidence. I think it helped end our marriage. I read it and thought, "She hates me."
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She doesn't hate you.

</CLAUDE>

Pauline stares at a blown up author photo of her sister.

	I told him to go to Vermont without me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd love to see him tell a linear story for a change. Jim never wanted to make it easy for the reader, did he. The nicest man I've ever met, but he can't play the game.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not joining him. I'm going to stay here and then...we'll see. Right. Okay?

Margot and Dick sit on stools holding microphones in front of rows of fold-out chairs. Only a few empty seats remain. Pauline and Claude sit in the back.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm very interested in your story "Middle Children."
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<DIRECTION>
Some people applaud, but it trickles off before it gets started.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The father is a loathsome character yet we also feel a strange sympathy for him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well I was very interested in exploring a father-daughter relationship. While he clings desperately to her, suffocates her really, he also silently resents the responsibility of parenthood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's this sexualized push-pull with Daphne which I find --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He craves isolation really. I always thought of him as someone who so over identifies with everyone around him that he begins to lose all sense of himself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You make his only recourse to abandon his family, including his beloved daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right, that's true. That's true.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I write historical fiction so I don't have to answer to this, but I wonder for someone who writes so nakedly about family, how autobiographical is this portrait?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
Margot rests her lips on the tip of the microphone.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father was a loving person. He had his days, of course, but...he was devoted to us as children. I wouldn't have written this portrait were it true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline nods slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm interested in how the father could be in fact a portrait of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Margot stares, dumbstruck.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Umm...I don't... Why do you assume it's based on... We all take from life. I had to have our refrigerator repaired the other day at our apartment in Manhattan. I was alone with a guy, I think he was Puerto Rican, sent over by...Whirlpool, I think it is who made our fridge. Although he said he worked for an independent organization who Whirlpool subcontracts. I think he was retarded. There was an anger in him and suddenly I became afraid for my life. I called Jim at NYU. I asked him to come home.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
Margot stops. Her face is awash in sweat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline takes Claude's hand and presses it to her chest. His eyes widen, fixed on his mother.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>

	It might be Frigidaire... I'm sorry... I don't... I'm not sure what I'm... I think I need to take a moment...

She stands and walks off the stage. She realizes she still has the mike. She goes back and places it on her seat.

	But they're married. It's different.

</CLAUDE>
<PAULINE>

	Are you okay? It's hard to see your mom like that -- get attacked like that. Right? It was mean what he did. I think it was really shitty.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mm hm.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, I think your mom's going through a rough time right now and...whatever she tells you...like if she says she's leaving your father...remember that she often changes her mind and... I don't want you to worry about anything right now.

Claude says nothing.

Pauline's Volvo rolls into the drive. She and Claude get out of the front seats. Margot climbs out of the back holding a big cake box. No one speaks.

Malcolm, in a fleece vest and safety goggles, drags a chainsaw toward the oak tree. Ingrid runs to her mom.

Margot sits on the back stairs drinking a glass of wine with ice. The tent is up. The tables and chairs are placed around the lawn. She watches Malcolm prepare to take the tree down. She puts her pinky in her ear and twists. Claude approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>

	I told Paul I didn't want you guys to come.

Margot tosses the remainder of her drink into the weeds.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>

	Pauline told me she's very disappointed in you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She thinks you laze about the house. Ingrid is always offering to help clean or cook. She made bracelets for all the guests. Even Malcolm puts up the tent. You just wait until everyone else does it for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not true.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>

<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch the tent.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The jagged blades pierce the trunk. Pauline crunches her face. Malcolm stops suddenly. He walks around the tree and inspects the bark.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating his fleece)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I liked how it looked on Vogler.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline starts to say something -- stops. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's over between Dick and Margot. He was so cruel to her today. And poor Claude had to watch it all. She should just get out of the marriage and then she can fuck whoever she wants, you know. It's cowardly. And Dick Koosman. What a choice. I mean...you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I agree. I hate the idea of Dick fucking Margot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What does that mean? You want to fuck Margot?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pauline, that's not what I said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you have a crush on her, you already told me that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm reddens and starts the chainsaw again. They yell over the noise:
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't say that. I said I thought she was attractive after you grilled me. She has no interest in me anyway. Not that it would matter if she did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever done anything like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever cheated on me?

<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!

Malcolm shuts the motor.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I do this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those emails you had with that student of mine.

(exhales)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did that...I know you said it was nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just... Can you say it again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just did. Now, can I cut down the tree?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never did anything with her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. She emailed me after we met at that reading at the college and... You know we were friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right, just a regular friendship between you and a twenty year old girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pauline, how many times do I have to say it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But...why don't I believe it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because Margot can't understand why you're with me and now when she's around you look for things.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAULINE>

(hesitates)

	<DIALOGUE>
	You promise.

Pauline looks at him long and hard. Malcolm takes off his goggles.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm and Pauline continue to stare at one another. He guns the chainsaw. Tears spill suddenly from his eyes. Pauline startles. He flicks the switch off.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to tell you something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
(suddenly terrified)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

</PAULINE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to lose you, though. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>

Pauline's face goes pale.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to tell you... Just let me... Maisy...

</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline teeters.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...we didn't really do anything. We were goofing around, I was making fun of her cause she dates a jock...
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I shouldn't've put myself in that position, I know that. We brushed lips really. It was barely a kiss. And then we stopped. That was it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
His nose runs. He wipes it messily with his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our tongues touched. I don't want to under-sell it either. I mean... We made out. I made out with her. I don't know why. I don't even like her. It's been a heady time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Pauline says nothing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you thinking? Please, tell me what you're thinking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline rushes at the tree -- she smacks her hands on the trunk and throws all her weight behind one great shove. It doesn't budge. In frustration and rage, she runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ingrid is the only one on the patio as Pauline approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<INGRID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Has anyone seen Wizard?

</INGRID>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Where's Maisy?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Upstairs, I think with Claude.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INGRID>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PAULINE'S BEDROOM/HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline enters in a daze. A toilet flushes. Maisy comes out of Pauline's bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<MAISY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hi. Sorry, I had to go. I hope that's okay I used yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAISY>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline nods strangely. She goes to the window. Her dove grey wedding dress hangs on the back of the door.
</DIRECTION>
<MAISY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love your wedding dress. It's so unconventional and great.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline nods. Her eye catches the Polaroids of her and Malcolm nude which lie on top of the bureau. Maisy looks at the pictures too. Maisy shifts uneasily and leaves the room. Pauline follows. Maisy walks down the hallway, aware that Pauline is right behind her.
</DIRECTION>
<MAISY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is everything okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAISY>
<PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
Maisy stops at the landing. Claude sits at the bottom of the staircase playing with a string.
</DIRECTION>
<MAISY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Claude, do you want to play croquet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAISY>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline raises her leg -- her foot hovers at Maisy's lower back. She hesitates. Claude reacts with horror. Maisy turns around to see Pauline with her foot in the air like she's doing karate. Pauline's eyes dart around aimlessly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Maisy stares, confused. Pauline slowly lowers her leg. Something dawns on Maisy. She races down the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The deafening shriek of the blade as it cuts into the tree. Malcolm is soaked in sweat. Ingrid watches from a few feet away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance -- Dick's orange BMW grinds into the driveway. Maisy hurries toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ingrid says, buried in the noise:
</DIRECTION>
<INGRID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's Dick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INGRID>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm sees Dick. He pushes the blade harder into the wood.
</DIRECTION>
<INGRID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it almost ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
(distracted)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Almost.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Maisy is talking to her father. Dick spots Malcolm. He immediately starts toward him. Malcolm hesitates. Cold fear creeps up his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dick speeds up. Malcolm backs up slowly -- drops the chainsaw -- and bolts toward the water. Ingrid watches, confused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dick takes off after him. Malcolm stumbles down the long wooden stairs to the beach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm runs wobbily -- he pants, already out of breath. Sweat pours down his face and body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dick's gait is swift -- his arms stiff, bent at the elbow. His jeans make a swish swish. He takes the stairs two at a time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm grasps the railing, moving as fast as he can sideways, trying not to fall. He reaches the beach, his feet sinking in the sand. He trips and topples forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up -- Dick lunges.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dick pounds Malcolm's head and face. Malcolm throws his arms up and tries to block the punches.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't do anything! I didn't do anything!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fucking sleazebag!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<DIRECTION>
Dick gets up. He kicks Malcolm hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't ever want to see you again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DICK>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm balls himself up against a rock. He cries:
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck off, dickhead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
Dick marches forward and kicks Malcolm again hard.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ow!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Dick lights a brown cigarette and walks away. Malcolm screams:
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fucking dickbag! She's lying!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He touches his face and sees the blood on his fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
(choking on tears)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<DIRECTION>
There's a rustling noise in the wind. Malcolm looks -- a mud- and sea-coated Wizard watches him with a panting smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wheels sputter in the gravel. Dick's car peels out with Maisy in the passenger seat. Claude and Margot watch from the porch.
</DIRECTION>

INT. LIVING ROOM/DINING ROOM - SAME

Pauline is seated at the table with place cards, flowers, silverware, napkins, dishes. Margot enters. Claude follows.

Pauline looks at Claude strangely. She leans down and kisses him on the lips.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you love me?

	Okay, I told you and I was right. He's done an insane thing. You don't know this man. What he did is criminal.

	Margot, I can't...

</MARGOT>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline shoves a stack of plates and silverware off of the table. The plates shatter. Silence save for their breathing.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Becky and I talk about you -- about what a monster you are. Is it cause Mom gave me the house? Can't I have anything? What was I thinking? I let you in. Get! Out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? What are you saying? I don't recognize you -- it's like you're channelling someone.

EXT. FIELD - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The purple of Ingrid's batik shirt shines in the grass beneath the tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The trunk -- a gash at its base -- teeters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline takes off into the field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ingrid sings to herself and traces the branches in the air with her finger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline sprints --
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ingrid!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
Ingrid says to no one in particular:
</DIRECTION>
<INGRID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</INGRID>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline's breaths are rapid, jagged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ingrid stands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wind whips up. The tree sways.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline thrusts her arms out, seizes Ingrid and hurls herself away from the tree.
</DIRECTION>
<INGRID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ow!
	</DIALOGUE>
</INGRID>
<DIRECTION>
Ingrid sobs as they run. Pauline looks back. The tree is still standing. They embrace a few feet out of its range.
</DIRECTION>
<INGRID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't going to fall!
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm trudges up the stairs. He's bloody and tattered. Wizard trots behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<INGRID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wizard!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She hugs the dog and holds him by the collar. The three of them stand a few feet apart. There's a horrible creak -- and suddenly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- crack --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Malcolm pulls both girls toward him --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tree topples -- the thick trunk rips through the wedding tent and crashes through tables and chairs and the fence --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- onto the Vogler's property.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. VOLVO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The speedometer needle wavers around 30. Margot clutches the steering wheel. Claude looks morose. Pauline and Ingrid sit stonily in the back seat. The Volvo jerks into the oncoming lane and back. Margot draws a deep breath.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you couldn't drive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
(irritated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can drive. Why does everyone say that? I used to drive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
They inch up a small hill. A car cascades down past them. The Volvo shakes. Pauline suddenly snaps out of her daze:
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have to call people and cancel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<INGRID>
	<DIALOGUE>

Margot rolls down the window.

	You do smell.

</MARGOT>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm not wearing any deodorant.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They reach the top of the hill, over the crest, and descend. The vehicle picks up speed. Margot presses down on the brake.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<CLAUDE>

<DIRECTION>
The car coasts faster down the hill.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Margot places her arm stiffly across Claude's front.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline wraps her body around her daughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margot swerves into the shoulder -- she makes a sharp turn into the forest and crashes through the bramble and muck. The car slows until it comes to a sudden stop at the base of a tree.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margot and Claude, Pauline and Ingrid trudge through the bony white trees of the forest -- their bags weigh them down. They're all covered in sweat and there's dirt caked on their feet and ankles.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ruined these shoes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline's face screws up. She's suddenly in pain. She races behind a tree. Margot follows.

Margot steps to see around the trunk. The kids follow behind. Pauline removes her panties from under her skirt. She tosses them in the brush.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Margot turns to the kids. Ingrid hides a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did she poop in her pants?

EXT. FERRY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margot and Claude sit, streaked with mud and perspiration. Margot drinks a beer, Claude a Coke. Margot pops a blue pill in her mouth and swallows. Ingrid swings on the rail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline hangs up a cell phone and hands it back to her sister. She takes the beer and swigs.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I left mom and Becky a message.

Margot puts her pinky in her ear.

	You should take care of that. It can hatch eggs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>

Claude turns his head. In the Chevy next to them sits Mrs. Vogler and the Vogler boy. She sings along to the radio. She runs her hand through her son's hair gently. He nestles into her shoulder.

The four of them get out of a taxi. A small, peeling hotel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dark tight space with a faded and dirty green wall-to-wall carpet. Pauline combs Ingrid's hair on one of the two double beds. Ingrid practices her wedding song. Claude sits on the other bed and looks into the open bathroom door: Margot stands with her back to him. She talks on her cell phone in a whisper. She hangs up. Claude walks inside. The sink drips.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweety, there's a bus that leaves to Vermont from town tomorrow morning. I just talked to your dad and he's going to pick you up.

<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to go tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The distant bong of a low drum and beneath that -- chanting. Claude follows Margot to the window. Ingrid and Pauline are already looking out. Clumps of demonstrators march in the street. Some people hold up signs with slogans -- NO MORE -- BRING BACK -- the rest is obscured from the window. Some marchers are dressed in black hoods with white face paint and carry cardboard coffins.

Pauline points to a guy in a vest. As he turns around we see it isn't him. Pauline withdraws, suddenly on the verge of tears.

	But what do you think of that idea?

</PAULINE>
<MARGOT>

	Don't say that. Come on, you'll come home with us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't even know where you're going to live. You might have to move in with mom too.

Margot tightens.

Pauline emerges from behind the armoire doors wearing a long nightshirt that reads: I Spent The Night With Arsenio Hall. She enters the bathroom. She mutters to herself.

	What have I done? What have I done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
Margot jimmies up the stiff window to let in some air. A few stragglers still march in the street. Trash and pieces of signage line the gutter. Margot turns into the room. She puts her hand to her cheek and strokes her smooth skin. She watches her son who removes his jeans for bed.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

Pauline tucks in Ingrid who lies next to Claude. Margot sits on the other bed scribbling in her brown notebook. Pauline marches around and across to the other side of the room. She snatches the book out of Margot's hands.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey!

</MARGOT>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You cannot write about this. You can't have it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't writing about you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You already took a part of my life, you can't have any more. And that goes for Ingrid and Malcolm and Wizard. We all own our own rights. They're not for sale.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give it back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>
<DIRECTION>
Pauline glances at the book.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I could read your handwriting I'm sure I'd be furious. But if I ever see a story that involves a hotel room or any of this shit, I will fucking take your bowels out.

	Get used to it... Mom and Becky share a bed -- you and I will probably get the other.

<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should just go to Vermont.

	I was thinking -- you know if you want -- you and Ingrid could go to Vermont. Keep Claude company and Jim adores you.

INT. BAR/RESTAURANT - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cheap plastic tables. A small karaoke stage in front. Margot, Claude, Pauline and Ingrid sit at the bar. Margot drinks her wine with ice. She wears Jim's sweater. The kids have Cokes. The remains of ketchup-soaked french fries in a plastic red basket lie between them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man with a mullet climbs up on the karaoke stage. The music begins. The man sways and sings "On and On" by Stephen Bishop. He croons sweetly and beautifully. Claude's eyes moisten. Margot swallows a blue pill and chases it with the wine. She takes her son's hand and whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, sweety. There's something wrong with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to call him.

Margot quickly turns to her sister.

<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Don't. I'm telling you.

<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I...I need some clothes and things.

Pauline walks over to a pay phone.

Pauline holds the receiver to her ear. She stares at a drawing of a monster fucking a woman on the wall above the pay phone. Malcolm is crying.

EXT. HOUSE - INTERCUT

Malcolm sits in the grass, the tree and wreckage behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. And it's smashed. I'm such a fucking idiot. Please don't take me seriously. I mean take me seriously, but not the fucked up parts, you know. I love you so much. Please marry me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALCOLM>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't do what you did again. Do you understand?

<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No matter how tempting.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
At the bar: Margot watches her sister carefully. She absent- mindedly picks through her red knit bracelet and drops it onto the floor. Ingrid slides something small and grey across the bar to Claude.
</DIRECTION>
<INGRID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You left it in my room.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INGRID>

It's a piece of fingernail. He hesitates then puts it in his pocket.

At the phone: Pauline rests her head against the wall. Malcolm is bawling on the other end.

Malcolm clutches Wizard and sputters:

	It's not too sweet? They sometimes make their stuff too sweet.

</PAULINE>
<MALCOLM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe. Maybe it was. I didn't even notice... They fucked up the cake. How sad. I love our little baby. I miss you.

</MALCOLM>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I miss you too. Maybe we should do another seminar.

Malcolm says something incomprehensible.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't understand you, honey.

Margot finishes her glass of wine, her eyes still on her sister.
</DIRECTION>
<INGRID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's gramma and Aunt Becky!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Margot startles and looks out the window. Across the street is an older woman, 70's, and a large woman, mid 30's, eating ice cream cones and looking in a boarded-up shop window.
</DIRECTION>
<PAULINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They didn't get my message.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PAULINE>

Pauline now stands above them.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you she can't work the machine --

Ingrid's chair scrapes as she stands. She takes her mother's hand. Margot remains seated.

Pauline and Ingrid head for the door. Claude waits for Margot.

She grabs her bags and drops some bills on the table.

Margot takes Claude's arm and walks quickly in the opposite direction. Claude, confused, glances over his shoulder.

A huge parking lot. A bus in the distance. Claude tries to keep pace with his mother.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>

</CLAUDE>
<MARGOT>

	I mean, why is the wedding not happening? Is there something that you did?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pauline has transferred all her stuff onto me. I don't understand her anymore. Why'd she pick this man? It is really berserk. And you know, she referred to me as her closest friend. We never see one anoth --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
An unfamiliar sound comes out of Margot. The sadness is unexpected -- she sobs uncontrollably. She tries to speak:
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean we're not close. Even if we want to be. You know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But was there anything real?

Margot is sweating. She wipes her brow with her sleeve. She periodically looks behind her. Nobody seems to be following.

She watches a man sustain a long embrace with another man. Margot closes her eyes. She breathes deeply.

</CLAUDE>
<MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
(vaguely)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you first started to play with friends, you wouldn't do it unless I watched you. You were afraid I would go out the back door. I don't know where I would go. Our yard didn't lead anywhere anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
She takes off her sweater and reveals an old faded yellow T- shirt. She isn't wearing a bra. Claude says suddenly:
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I masturbated last night. While everyone was asleep I went into the bathroom and did it.

Margot ties her sweater around her waist and takes Claude's hand. They approach the bus. Claude's body tenses.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How will you get home?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>

	Uh huh.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at her longingly.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. You always don't want to leave me and you always have a good time once you do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(provocatively)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think you like getting away from me.

</MARGOT>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do not. I like hanging out with you.

She hugs him. He clutches her.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The world feels strange to me right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<DIRECTION>
Margot nods sympathetically. She kisses his lips and releases him. He reaches into his bag and shyly puts on his wrap-around punk sunglasses. Margot makes a face.
</DIRECTION>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They make your face look too wide.

Claude removes them and puts them back in the bag.

<CLAUDE>

	See you soon.

<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>

<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say, you'll see me "soon."

She backs away --

<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't see Dick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLAUDE>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. I don't think he wants to see me anyway.

Claude doesn't move. Margot points at the bus and mouths "Go". She turns in the other direction. Claude, frustrated and anxious approaches the vehicle.

<DIRECTION>
INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claude hurries toward the back and finds a window seat. He puts his bag next to him and looks out the dirty glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Claude's POV: Margot, her back to him, puts her finger in her ear and shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sweater around her waist loosens and drifts to the pavement. She starts walking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bus hisses and lurches forward. Claude strains to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Margot looks back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bus groans as it picks up speed. Margot sprints.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
She's runs full speed, waving her arms wildly.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait! Wait!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
She pants, breathless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bus brakes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She passes Claude's window. We stay on Claude. He waits. Finally, she appears next to him, covered in sweat, and panting. She kisses him on the head. The bus starts moving.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
<DIRECTION>
(almost euphoric)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you see me running out there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARGOT>
<CLAUDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>

Margot cranes her neck to see outside.
</DIRECTION>
<MARGOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. That was a lot of running. I'm out of breath.

Claude turns away from his mother and looks out the window.

CUT TO BLACK.
