:SC: INT. CAVE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a huge ancient hourglass made of animal skins, and acorns plop through the waist of the hourglass one by one. It sits in a pool of water. In the water swim EYELESS CATFISH in geometric patterns. An underground stream feeds the pool of water and then flows into a huge underground crevasse that on occasion emits a LOW RUMBLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INDIANS with torches surround the hourglass, which now we can see is in a cave. And as soon as the acorns have finished passing through the hourglass, a crew of Indians turn it on its opposite end. One of the Indians appears to be JAPANESE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONE INDIAN stands at the wall of the cavern in front of a series of symbolic carvings and scratches, with stone in hand he makes a few hatchmarks, and keeps an eye on the CREVASSE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CREVASSE RUMBLES once more, loosening a few chunks of rock from the cave.

View of the chartkeeper's drawings. One is of a crane with a very long neck. Another is a primitive drawing of a naked girl, who has long flowing hair. She also has, pointed out from her sides, thumbs that are three times normal human proportions. A MUSICAL CHORUS sounds at the sight of this drawing of a girl with the thumbs. The chartkeeper puts the finishing touches on the drawing.

<MADAME_ZOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmmm. I'd say that you have an intelligent, kindly, somewhat artistic nature. However, Sissy, however, there is a heavy quality to the second phalanx- the phalanx of logic -- that indicates a capacity for foolish or clownish behavior, a refusal to accept responsibility or to take things seriously and bent to be disrespectful of those who do. Your mama tells me that you're pretty well behaved and shy, but I'd watch out for signs of irrationality. All right?

She pulls her thumb to her breast.

Views of vast vistas of arid grasslands, open and unmodulated, thirsty and exposed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the western edge of the DAKOTAS, the monotony of the landscape, now gradually tilting toward the Rockies, is interrupted by the Badlands -- sculptured canyons so deep and chaotic they can break a devil's heart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Between the grasslands and the eerie badlands ruins, there lies a narrow band of humpy hills, green and pastoral. The hills are carpeted with midlength prairie grass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Rubber Rose buildings are clustered at the badlands end at the base of a butte, higher, broader and longer than any in its vicinity, known as Siwash Ridge. a sign over the entry of the ranch reads:

<DELORES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've traveled through the Yucatan with a circus, popping false eyelashes off a trained monkey with a bullwhip. When I ate peyote one night and had a vision. Niwetükame, the Mother Goddess, came to me on the back of a doe, hummingbirds sipping the tears she was shedding, crying 'Delores, you must lead my daughters against their natural enemy. You must come to the Rubber Rose Ranch and prepare for your mission, the details of which will be revealed to you in a third vision....' That night I whipped the shit out of my black lover and ran away. For a while I drove around, making a living selling peyote buttons to hippies, until I made my way here...

A snake crosses the road in front of her, and she takes her whip and whirls it around her head. The snake that is crawling across the dusty road that leads to the ranch is carrying a card under its forked tongue.

</MAN>
<SISSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace.

	<DIALOGUE>
	The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.

<THE_COUNTESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance/walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.

<THE_COUNTESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.

	Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.

The cowgirls frolic until, as suddenly as it has come, the rain goes away. Play ceases. They are panting like puppies as they lean against one another or pick clods of mud from one another's hair.

In the lobby, the doors of an elevator open revealing Sissy inside wearing a buttoned up dress. Very formal looking for her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is Julian standing in the lobby. He turns and walks toward Sissy. He is wearing a rather formal looking plaid sport coat with blue cummerbund. He extends his hand to meet her, and (perhaps at the sight of Sissy's thumbs) Julian has an asthma attack, doubling over in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sissy doesn't know whether to assist Julian or flee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the other side of the lobby, two WELL-GROOMED COUPLES, white, mid-thirties and upper middle class come to the rescue. The younger of the men, RUPERT, takes charge. He breaks an inhaler of dinephrine under Julian's nose.

In the red of embarrassment, Julian looks more Indian than he had previously. Wheezing, he speaks:

	I'll tell you why, it's that plague of cowgirls. They've gradually infiltrated every sector of our program. The one named Debbie considers herself an expert on exercising and diet. With Bonanza Jellybean's permission and against my explicit orders, she's been coercing the guests into trying something called kundalini yoga. Do you know what that is? It's trying to mentally force a serpent of fire to crawl up your spinal column. Miss Hankshaw, our guests can't comprehend kundalini yoga, let alone do it. Yesterday, she ordered a new cookbook by a Tibetan Negro, entitled Third Eye in the Kitchen: Himalayan Soul Food. God knows what that will be like. The little barbarians are destroying everything that I've built, mocking all that the company stands for. And there's a new one, one they call del Ruby. She has the good will of a scorpion. I've considered it prudent to avoid a confrontation that might further upset the guests.

	</DIALOGUE>
</SISSY>
<JELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'

</JELLY>
<DIRECTION>
Jelly pauses.
</DIRECTION>
<JELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah, now that I think of it, the Chink taught me something about cowgirls. Did you realize that cowgirls have been around for many centuries? Long before America. In ancient India the care of the cattle was always left up to young women they called gopis. Being alone with the cows all the time, the gopis got awfully horny, just like we do here. Every gopi was in love with Krishna, a good-looking young god who played the flute like it was going out of style When the moon was full, this Krishna would play his flute by a river and call the gopis to him. Then he would multiply himself sixteen thousand times -- one for each gopi -- and make love to each one the way she most desired. There they were, sixteen thousand gopis balling Krishna on the river bank, and the energy of their merging was so great that it created a huge oneness, a total union of love, and it was God. Wow! Quite a picture, huh?

She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.

	I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet.

Jelly takes Sissy's hand, carefully avoiding the thumbs and helps her feel the depression in her belly. The depression is a dimple, like another navel.

AFTER A HUNGRY STILLNESS, like intermission at a wolf dance, rhythms are established. Jelly and Sissy are socked into one another now, and they arch and push and corkscrew and jackknife softly but with pronounced cadence.

Everything becomes scrambled. They rock each other in cradles of sweat and saliva, until we can see nothing.

AND THERE HE IS. Standing only ten yards away.

Warily he stops and turns, poised to flee again.

SHE RAISES her ripe right thumb. And jerking it and swooshing it, she hitchhikes the Chink and his mountain.

AND AS THEY FINISH, the Chink goes into a cave and returns with a tiny peppermint-stripped plastic transistor radio. He switches it on and the silence is broken by "The Happy Hour Polka."
</DIRECTION>

Still clutching the radio in one hand, the Chink hops into the wheel of firelight and begins to dance.

Sissy walks around the fire watching the old geezer heel and toe, skip and hop. He flings his bones; he flings his beard.

Night birds fly past with fluttering feathers. A bat flies out of the cave.

	The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.

	<DIALOGUE>
	The Clock People mistook me for Chinese. And the name stuck. In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled "Indians" through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that "Indians" misnamed me. The Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes. They have lived together since 1906.

Insofar as it is possible, all Clock People deaths and births occur in the presence of the clockworks. Aside from birthing or dying, the reason for the daily visits to the clockworks is to check the time.

	These people have no other ritual than this one. Likewise, they have but one legend or cultural myth: that of a continuum they call the Eternity of Joy. It is into the Eternity of Joy that they believe all men will pass once the clockworks is destroyed. The destruction must come from the outside, must come by natural means, must come at the will of this gesticulating planet whose more acute stirrings thoughtless people call "earthquakes."

	The Earth is alive. She burns inside with the heat of cosmic longing. She longs to be with her husband again. She moans. She turns softly in her sleep. In the Eternity of Joy, pluralized, deurbanized man, at ease with his gentle technologies, will smile and sigh when the Earth begins to shake. I loved those loony redskins, but I couldn't be a party to their utopian dreaming. After a while it occurred to me that the Clock People waiting for the Eternity of Joy was virtually identical to the Christians waiting for the Second Coming. Or the Communists waiting for the worldwide revolution. Or the Debbies waiting for the flying saucers. All the same. Just more suckers betting their share of the present on the future, banking every misery on a happy ending to history. Well, history is ending every second - happily for some of us, unhappily for others, happily one second, unhappily the next. History is always ending and always not ending... ha ha ho ho and hee hee.

Then he says nothing. And his silence makes Sissy weep. They sit down on a grass floor, illuminated by the fire outside the cave.

Then the Chink, without hesitation, grasps her thumbs. He squeezes them, caresses them, covers them with wet kisses, telling them how beautiful they are.

One of evolution's most ingenious inventions; a built-in tool sensitive to texture, contour and temperature: an alchemical lever; the secret key to technology; the link between the mind and art; a humanizing device. The marmoset and the lemur are thumbless; none of the New World monkeys has opposable thumbs; the spider monkey's thumbs are absent or reduced to a tiny tubercle; the thumbs of the potto are set at an angle of one hundred eighty degrees to the other digits.

	But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SISSY>
<DEBBIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The way I see it, is that the peyote mellowed them out. Made them less uptight. They were afraid of bad weather and humans. That's why they migrated and kept to themselves. But the peyote has enlightened them. It's taught them there is nothing to fear but fear itself. Now they're digging life and letting the bad vibes slide on. Don't worry, be happy. Be here now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEBBIE>
<SISSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fear in wild animals is completely different from paranoia in people. In the wilderness ecosystem, fear is natural and necessary. It's merely a mechanism for maintaining life. If the cranes hadn't had a capacity for fear, they would have disappeared long ago and you'd be having to get loaded with common old everyday meadowlarks and mallards.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SISSY>
<JELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This here discussion is destined to become academic. Because we've got less than half a bag of peyote buttons left and Delores's run ended up in the Mottburg jail. So any day now we'll get a chance to see how the whoopers behave when they come down, to see if the peyote experience really changed them or not. But in the meantime, I want to say this about fear.....

:SC: EXT. HILL DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jelly stops her horse, looks down at her waist, and sees her sixguns.
</DIRECTION>
<JELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better get rid of these. Might give those greenhorn dudes a fright.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JELLY>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH the scope of an FBI rifle, Jelly is drawing her gun out of her holster.
</DIRECTION>
<AGENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's going to fire....
	</DIALOGUE>
</AGENT>
<DIRECTION>
He squeezes the trigger, and Jelly is caught in the stomach with a bullet. She falls off her horse to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CHINK sees Bonanza Jellybean cut down from a vantage point on the hill, and makes a beeline for the government barricades, SHOUTING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE COWGIRLS scream and cry, and grab their weapons. A couple of them leap from the barricade and are immediately riddled.

	You've got two minutes to come out with you hands over your heads!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
RANDOM G-MEN are sniping at the cowgirls, making it impossible to surrender.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A stray bullet SENDS THE CHINK back down the hillside, beard, robe and sandals flying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE HUSH that follows, in the echoes of the explosive fire, the whooping crane flock rises in one grand assault of beating feathers - a lily white storm of life, a gush of albino Gabriels -- swarm into the waiting sky, and circle the pond one time before flapping south toward Texas...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...they cast shadows over a dead Jellybean who is literally biting the dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sissy lifts Jelly out of the dust and holds her. Sissy lifts Jelly's satin shirt tail and pulls down the waistband of her skirt. Bright red blood is running out of her scar.
</DIRECTION>
<JELLY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right in the scar where I fell on a wooden horse when I was twelve. Haw, I wasn't really shot with a silver bullet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JELLY>

Confessing to Sissy.

<DIRECTION>
A brown paper bag is sitting on the side of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<A_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The brown paper bag is the only thing civilized man has produced that does not seem out of place in nature. Crumpled into a wad of wrinkles, like the fossilized brain of a dryad; its kinship to tree
	</DIALOGUE>

(to knot and nest)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	unobscured by the cruel crush of industry; absorbing the elements like any other organic entity; blending with rock and vegetation as if it were a burrowing owl's door mat or a jack rabbit's underwear, a No. 8 Kraft paper bag lay discarded in the hills of Dakota and appeared to live where it lay. Once long ago, it had borne a package of buns and a jar of mustard to a kitchenette rendezvous with a fried hamburger. More recently, the bag had held........ love letters.

</A_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
View of a bunkhouse trunk.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As a hole in an oak hides a squirrel's family jewels, the bag had hidden love letters in the bottom of a bunkhouse trunk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Hands lift the contents of the trunk away, rope, spurs, and blanket and find the hidden sack of letters.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then one day after work, the button- nosed little cowgirl to whom the letters were addressed gathered bag and contents under her arm, slipped out to the corral...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
We see the Cowgirl saddling her horse late in the day.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...past ranch hands pitching horseshoes and ranch hands flying Tibetan kites, saddled up and trotted into the hills.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
We see the Cowgirl riding along a ridge.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A mile or so from the bunkhouse, she dismounted and built a small fire; she fed the fire letters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
And this we see also, the lonely Cowgirl feeding the letters to a fire in the dusky early night. We can see the cowgirl is Sissy Hankshaw.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...one by one, the way her girl friend had once fed her french fries.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
She is crying now and feeding the fire, close of words like "always" and "forever" burning up.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As words such as sweetheart" and "honey britches" and "forever" and "always" burned away, the cowgirl squirted a few tears. Her eyes were so misty she forgot to burn the bag.

Kym kisses the lips quickly of the despondent Cowgirl, and the bunkhouse lights go out.

Delores plunks a carefree song on an old Gibson, looks up at the moon.

</DIRECTION>
<DELORES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, but it's good to be a cowgirl.

And the bunkhouse lights are turned off. There are some giggles from the cowgirls.

	The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!

Sissy shows a picture of the Countess recovering in a hospital bed, posing next to Doctor Robbins.

<CHINK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?

</CHINK>
<SISSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.

The Chink mourns a bit.

	But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.

</DELORES>
<DIRECTION>
The Chink looks over and sees that Delores is standing in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<CHINK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't help it if I grew up in an antipoetic culture. Language will be different when I'm with the Clock People though. They're from an oral tradition. And I'm not talking about what you horny hop toads do in bed every night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHINK>

The Chink smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Delores blushes.

	Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.

serious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHINK>
<DIRECTION>
He begins to caress Sissy's belly. His eyes are smiling. Sissy is surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<CHINK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHINK>
<SISSY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?

	That's your problem.

The Chink coughs.

<CHINK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to the way I'm babbling. That bullet must have loosened one of my transistors. Don't pay any attention to me. You've got to work it out for yourself. The westbound choo-choo leaves Mottburg at one-forty. I want to be on it. Will you drive me to the station?

A LONG DARK PAUSE, UNTIL finally we are inside the cave where the Chink's Clockworks are at work..... poing!

It is revealed that Sissy is with Delores snug in the old hermit's living quarters. She listens to the clinking of the Chink's Clockworks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And feels her belly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The swell of her belly has forced her to sleep on her back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE VIEW of Sissy's belly, and a little foot kicks from inside. Or is it a foot?
</DIRECTION>

VIEW INSIDE THE BELLY of Sissy's unborn baby. It is half- Japanese, one thirty-second Siwash and all thumbs.
