OVER BLACKNESS, we HEAR a BACH HARPSICHORD CONCERTO. And then a WOMAN -- breathing hard -- straining, harder and harder -- until finally we HEAR a NEWBORN BABY CRYING -- and we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VULCAN FAMILY HOME - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The image is spectacular, aglow in DUSK LIGHT: a beautiful BABY, just born, held in a WOMAN'S HANDS. It is being cleaned; warm water runs down its face and body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON the MIDWIFE (female, 60's) who holds and cleans the baby as it CRIES. Another, younger, Midwife can be seen behind her, assisting with the pitchers of water. As she cleans the baby, she says to someone OFF-CAMERA:
</DIRECTION>
<MIDWIFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is strong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIDWIFE>
<DIRECTION>
The baby, now calm, gets SWADDLED. He is then gently held out to the new MOTHER:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AMANDA GRAYSON, late 20's. An original beauty. She lies on a divan, spent but eager to hold her first child. She tenderly takes the infant into her arms, tears in her eyes, mesmerized. She holds the wrapped baby tight and whispers sweetly:
</DIRECTION>
<AMANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... hello.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMANDA>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON the YOUNGER MIDWIFE, standing at the rear of the room. She raises an eyebrow as she quietly speaks:
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNGER_MIDWIFE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The baby is healthy. Why does she cry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNGER_MIDWIFE>
<MIDWIFE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat; then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She is human.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIDWIFE>
<DIRECTION>
A distant, quiet BUZZ -- and the elder Midwife stands, looking into the distance. And this is when we see, for the first time, that the Midwife has POINTED EARS.
</DIRECTION>
<MIDWIFE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sarek arrives.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIDWIFE>
<DIRECTION>
The Midwife moves away -- we PUSH IN on Amanda, who looks up for a moment, clearly disquieted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VULCAN LANDSCAPE - DUSK (FORMER SC. 14)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A planet of massive, tortured ROCK FORMS, distant cities constructed atop and underneath them. A HOVER-SPEEDER in the mid-ground kicks up dust, backlit by the sun, as it traces the horizon. We PAN WITH IT, revealing a FAMILY HOME, built seamlessly into a rocky mountainside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SUPER READS: STARDATE 2230.06.

<DIRECTION>
The speeder parks outside the home --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VULCAN HOME - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAREK (late 40's, a Vulcan) comes out to the balcony through the rear doors of the home. He moves to Amanda and kneels. He looks at the child -- his child -- and says:
</DIRECTION>
<SAREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAREK>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at him for a beat, then says, flatly -- with just enough rancor:
</DIRECTION>
<AMANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMANDA>
<DIRECTION>
He regards her. Knows he's in TROUBLE --
</DIRECTION>
<SAREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your tone suggests disappointment. The Science Council required my presence for a session regarding--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAREK>
<AMANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't do that. You knew I wanted you here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMANDA>
<DIRECTION>
The Vulcan Midwives share a look. Sarek glances at them. Nods. The two women excuse themselves. Sarek reaches over, touches a small touchpad -- the HARPSICHORD MUSIC STOPS. He says, clinically:
</DIRECTION>
<SAREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you are aware, the Vulcan male is traditionally not present at the moment of delivery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAREK>
<AMANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well traditionally, I'm not the one giving birth.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I moved here -- to another planet -- to be with you. I needed you to be with me today. Holding my hand and telling me I'm doing great, even when I'm just... breathing the best I can.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMANDA>
<DIRECTION>
Sad that she has to tell him this at all, she just looks back at the baby -- finding comfort in his innocence. Sarek considers this. He moves closer to her. Whispers intimately:
</DIRECTION>
<SAREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are correct. I should have been here. I am sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAREK>
<DIRECTION>
And with her free hand, she pulls Sarek closer -- and kisses him. And the two look at the baby.
</DIRECTION>
<SAREK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had a thought. That we might name the child after one of our respected early society-builders. His name was "Spock".
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAREK>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at the baby, not immediately taken by the name.
</DIRECTION>
<SAREK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your silence does not suggest enormous enthusiasm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAREK>
<AMANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... Spock.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles, touches his face)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Spock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMANDA>
<DIRECTION>
She looks at Sarek: Spock it is.
</DIRECTION>
<SAREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The child has your eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAREK>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls back the baby's swaddling, revealing his ears. She gently rubs the top of his right ear -- AND IT UNFURLS, revealing a small, soft pointed VULCAN EAR.
</DIRECTION>
<AMANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and your ears.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMANDA>
<DIRECTION>
And off the image of this TINY BABY, half-human, half-Vulcan, we... FADE OUT. And over BLACKNESS, we BEGIN TO HEAR an ALARM SOUNDING -- GROWING -- and the SUPER "THREE YEARS LATER" APPEARS -- and finally the BLACKNESS IS SPLIT BY TURBO-LIFT DOORS OPENING and we REVEAL THAT WE'RE ON:
</DIRECTION>

INT. U.S.S. KELVIN (FORMER SC. 15A)

<DIRECTION>
With URGENCY, we MOVE DOWN a corridor with CAPTAIN ROBAU and OFFICER PITTS:
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN_ROBAU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- our sensors haven't made sense of the anomaly?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN_ROBAU>

	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER_PITTS>
<DIRECTION>
SHWISH! The doors part and we enter THE BRIDGE OF THE SHIP -- a flurry of activity -- the MASSIVE SHIP they are approaching on the VIEWSCREEN. Robau moves to the center -- then he asks:
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN_ROBAU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Report.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN_ROBAU>
<DIRECTION>
-- turning to the ship's FIRST OFFICER: 32, all-American face, swiveling in a console chair to FACE US:

	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, new contact bearing zero-three-four.

</FIRST_OFFICER>
<CAPTAIN_ROBAU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are they transmitting on any frequency?

</CAPTAIN_ROBAU>
<FIRST_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Negative, Captain -- all communications appear to be shut down.

<CAPTAIN_ROBAU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hail the ship. What's the closest match on registry?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN_ROBAU>
<FIRST_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing even close, Sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRST_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
Robau moves to Pitts:
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN_ROBAU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any response?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN_ROBAU>
<OFFICER_PITTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No Sir -- hails met with silence.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER_PITTS>
<CAPTAIN_ROBAU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe they're incapable -- any identifiable damage?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN_ROBAU>
<OFFICER_PITTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Negative, Sir -- but our readings seem confused--
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER_PITTS>
<CAPTAIN_ROBAU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Confused?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN_ROBAU>
<OFFICER_PITTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- not only is the ship unregistered -- but even its construction materials seem unrecognizable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER_PITTS>
<DIRECTION>
Robau sits in the captain's chair his eyes on the ship as they approach -- and we SEE IT on the VIEWSCREEN -- THE NARADA -- ENORMOUS AND THREATENING. He doesn't even realize that he says:
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN_ROBAU>
	<DIALOGUE>

Crew members are glued to their telemetry, working consoles:

	Sir, should we initiate an invasive scan?

<CAPTAIN_ROBAU>

Suddenly, a WARNING BEEP --

</CHIEF_ENGINEER>

As the crew regains their footing, the First Officer pulls himself to his console, true fear in his eyes as he places an inter-ship call -- it's RINGING -- his fear grows with every passing RING -- then, we INTERCUT WITH:

INT. U.S.S. KELVIN - MEDICAL BAY - CONTINUOUS (FORMER SC. 26B)

A WOMAN, 25, answers her communicator -- she lies on an exam table, afraid -- and pregnant. This is WINONA.
</DIRECTION>
<WINONA>

	-- what was that-- what's happening?!

</WINONA>

But the First Officer is just relieved that she's still alive:

<FIRST_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- you're okay-- thank God-- where are you?

</FIRST_OFFICER>
<WINONA>

And he STOPS. They all do. A fucking FACE is now on their VIEWSCREEN. A ROMULAN FACE -- the FIRST OFFICER of the Narada, whom we'll come to know as AYEL:

<AYEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My commander requests the presence of your captain in order to negotiate a cease-fire. You will come aboard our ship via shuttlecraft. Your refusal would be unwise.

Screen goes DEAD. All eyes on Robau... and he feels them. A tense, horrible moment. Finally, to the First Officer:

	Walk with me.

<DIRECTION>
The First Officer follows Robau OFF THE BRIDGE AND INTO:

As they walk, briskly:

Robau heads into a waiting TURBOLIFT, turns -- they lock eyes, knowing what this means. Finally:

<CAPTAIN_ROBAU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're Captain now. Mr. Kirk.

He's gone. And we realize this is GEORGE KIRK, Jim's father.

All eyes on Kirk as he enters -- moves to the captain's chair. Sits. Not a small moment. Speaking his first words as Captain:

In a moment, Robau's VITAL SIGNS appear on various monitors -- his HEART RATE, OXYGEN LEVELS, BLOOD PRESSURE, all of it. A LOW- PITCHED BEEPBEEP of his HEARTBEAT is now HEARD --

Sparks dripping from the ceiling, everyone is motionless -- eyes on the monitors -- and we're TIGHT ON GEORGE KIRK -- the BEEPS of Robau's heart might as well be representing his own. He realizes he's sweating -- wipes his forehead as:

ALL WE HEAR IS THE LOW-PITCHED BEEPBEEP as the small shuttle seems to get swallowed up by the massive forward-facing spires of the Narada -- the distant floodlights creating EERIE SHADOWS everywhere.

Robau is led into the enormous, dark bridge. A dozen Romulans at controls. Robau does his level best to portray confidence as he is led up a walkway to AYEL. Behind him, sitting silhouetted and motionless, turned away and looking off, is his captain. A presence always felt in this scene. This is NERO.

Ayel touches a panel, then THROWS AN IMAGE into the air before Robau. A ROTATING HOLOGRAM OF A UNIQUE-LOOKING SPACECRAFT (we will refer to it as the JELLYFISH).

	Then ask your commander what right he has to attack a Federation vessel.

<AYEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was hardly an attack. My commander will easily destroy your ship. If you do not respond to the question.

Robau considers the hologram again. And what his answer might mean for the fate of his crew.

	-- Which is precisely when reason must guide his actions above all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAREK>
<AMANDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- I want him to embrace Vulcan, you know that... but he has to be himself-- which means, occasionally, being human.
	</DIALOGUE>
</AMANDA>
<SAREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- His "humanity" is very the source of his ostracism.

And Amanda walks away, leaving Sarek standing there. He turns -- sees his son down the corridor. Approaches. And we're PUSHING IN on Spock, studying the fear in his eyes. His father stops in front of him, looming there, looking down stoically:

<YOUNG_SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... between you and mother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_SPOCK>
<SAREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never, my son. But you may choose the ethic of logic. Logic offers a serenity humans seldom experience. The control of feelings... so that they do not control you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAREK>
<YOUNG_SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They called you a traitor.

	You suggest that I should be completely Vulcan... and yet you married a human... why?

<DIRECTION>
Sarek is clearly conflicted by this. But he holds steady:
</DIRECTION>
<SAREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As Ambassador to Earth, my duty is to observe and understand human behavior. Marrying your mother... was logical.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Spock seems disquieted)
</DIRECTION>

	Spock. You are fully capable of choosing your own destiny. The question you are faced with... is which path you will take. This is something only you can decide.

	This isn't about toys, it's Uncle Frank. I can't take him anymore -- Mom has no idea what he's like when she's not here-- d'you hear him talking like he's our dad?! And that's not even his car you're washing! That was Dad's car! You know why you're washing it? Because he's gonna sell it!

EXT. IOWA FARMHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk washes a VINTAGE CORVETTE. Red, white top. Dumping the sponge in bucket, he's sadly cleaning, his mind spinning over his brother's departure. Devastated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And he's wiping the soapy passenger window (SQEEEEEEAK!) with the sponge, when he STOPS -- seeing the KEYS in the ignition. PUSH IN ON HIS FACE as a devilish idea comes to his mind. PRE- LAP A LOUD SCREECH and we CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. IOWA FARMHOUSE - DAY - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CORVETTE BLASTS ONTO SCREEN, FISHTAILING ONTO THE ROAD, young Jim Kirk behind the wheel (NOTE: The SOUND of the engine is a metallic WHIR -- not a gas engine). TIGHT ON JIM'S FACE as he drives -- having never done this before, he's as nervous as he is determined --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. IOWA ROAD - DAY - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CORVETTE SPEEDS -- while inside the car, Jim turns on the updated, modified RADIO -- scans stations, momentarily losing control of the car -- but he's back on track as he finds a HARD ROCK SONG -- and HE'S STARTING TO FUCKING LOVE IT -- PILOTING SOMETHING THIS FAST FEELS GOOD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches for a CONVERTIBLE ROOF latch -- then the other -- but with the speed he's driving, THE ROOF RIPS RIGHT OFF THE FUCKING CAR -- Jim glances back, wide-eyed -- and the roof TUMBLES through the air, landing on the road -- and we PUSH AND ARC AROUND, as a POLICE OFFICER runs out from taking a roadside PISS -- he races back, jumps on his HOVERCRUISER and TAKES OFF -- SPEEDING AFTER HIM, SIREN BLARING!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK IN THE CORVETTE -- BLOOPBLOOP!!! -- Jim's eyes dart to the REARVIEW as the cruiser WEAVES behind him -- then PULLS UP BESIDE HIM -- the COP sees a CHILD driving and is AMAZED -- he calls through his PA:
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son, you pull over that car!

EXT. IOWA ROAD - CONTINUOUS

George, bag over shoulder, thumb out. He turns at the SOUND of the SIREN -- sees what's approaching... that car... looks... familiar... and the THE CORVETTE SHOOTS PAST HIM, JIM AT THE WHEEL -- then the POLICE HOVERCRUISER! George runs into the middle of the road, mouth agape --
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE_JR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- no... way.

Back at the Corvette, Jim YANKS the steering wheel TOWARD THE COP -- who RISES to avoid the Corvette, which SCREECHES onto a perpendicular DIRT ROAD, kicking up wild dust as the Cop ARCS QUICKLY to follow --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jim is now officially LOVING THIS -- and he DRIVES THROUGH a FENCE -- CRASH! The Cop RACES through it, in the Corvette's DUST -- and we PUSH IN on a SIGN that reads "DANGER - QUARRY AHEAD -- IOWA MINING CO." In fact --

KIRK, EYES INTENSE, ALMOST SUICIDAL -- this is where he's been headed all along -- and for a moment we think holy shit -- this is how James Kirk dies. He speeds toward the edge -- CLOSER -- CLOSER -- but at the last second, Kirk SLAMS the brake -- the car SKIDS -- PIVOTS -- and he LEAPS FROM THE CAR, WHICH SAILS SIDEWAYS OFF THE CLIFF EDGE -- FALLING... falling... the COP comes to QUICK a STOP in CLOUDS of DUST as the Corvette EXPLODES ON THE QUARRY FLOOR --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The angry Cop hops off his hovercruiser, hand on weapon, as Jim Kirk, out of breath, exhilarated, gets to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your name, son?

And as he stands, we PUSH IN on him -- LOW and WIDE -- damn if that kid doesn't have a swagger. It's like the first time he's ever stood in his life.

And the Guards look at each other... seemingly with concern...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOMENTS LATER EIGHT GUARDS WALK TOGETHER -- and we PAN WITH THEM to reveal the HORRIFYING EXPANSE THAT IS THE KLINGON PRISON YARD. We realize that the constant shocks of light was LIGHTNING, that apparently never stops here. A SUPER READS: "RURA PENTHE - KLINGON PRISON ASTEROID". And we see they're heading for a MUSCULAR FIGURE, using a SLEDGE HAMMER, SPLITTING ROCKS, lit brilliantly by the lightning strikes. BOOM UP to find that it's NERO. And he stops, SENSING the coming Guards. And he manages a small smile. And he QUICKLY TURNS to them -- THEY ALL STOP, SUDDENLY. Afraid of him. One of them tosses Nero a set of MANACLES. Nero picks them up. Puts them on. And offers his cuffed hands, willingly.

She just smiles as she works his collar. He sees this and it annoys him. He tries to move her hands away, to stop with his collar -- his annoyance, her love for him, all sweet-- but he doesn't let go of her hands. A meaningful silence between them.

	You have surpassed the expectations of your instructors. Your final record is flawless. With one exception. I see you have applied to Starfleet as well.

<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was logical to cultivate multiple options.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<SCIENCE_MINISTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Logical but unnecessary. You are hereby accepted to the Vulcan Science Academy. A distinction all the more significant given that you will be its first half- human pupil. It is truly remarkable, Spock. That you have achieved so much despite your disadvantage. Welcome to the Academy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCIENCE_MINISTER>
<DIRECTION>
They all start to rise. But Spock is suddenly unsettled:

<SPOCK>

	If you would clarify, Minister-- what "disadvantage" are you referring to?

</SPOCK>
<SCIENCE_MINISTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... your human mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCIENCE_MINISTER>
<DIRECTION>
As the council disperses, we PUSH IN on Spock's face -- the same look he had when he took punches as a kid. He glances at his father to say something, but Sarek's the consummate diplomat. His eyes command: remain calm. Spock STRUGGLES... then makes the first spontaneous -- human -- decision of his life --
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Council -- ministers. I must decline.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>

Everyone STOPS. A solid BEAT. Confused looks turn cold:

<SCIENCE_MINISTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No Vulcan has ever declined admission to this academy.

</SCIENCE_MINISTER>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then as I am half-human, your record remains untarnished.

<SAREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spock. You have made a commitment to honor the Vulcan way--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAREK>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At the moment, Father, I can think of no greater way to honor our race than to attend Starfleet as its first Vulcan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<SCIENCE_MINISTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did you come before this council today? Was it to satisfy your emotional need to rebel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCIENCE_MINISTER>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came with the intention of enrolling, as my father wished. However, your "insight" has convinced me otherwise. Therefore, the only emotion I wish to convey is gratitude. Thank you, Ministers, for your consideration.

<DIRECTION>
(a contained "fuck you")

Kirk pulls up to us, kills the bike. Camera starts to MOVE AROUND HIM -- he's dramatically BACKLIT and we COME AROUND for an INCREDIBLE REVEAL of a SHIPYARD -- at its center, the skeletal frame of a NEW SHIP under arclights.

INT. ACADEMY COUNCIL CHAMBERS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIGHT ON a stern STARFLEET ACADEMY PRESIDENT:
</DIRECTION>
<ACADEMY_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	James T. Kirk. Step forward.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACADEMY_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
It's a huge Starfleet chamber. Golden Gate Bridge visible through huge windows. 500 cadets, a nervous KIRK among them. He stands, moves to one of two PODIUMS.
</DIRECTION>
<ACADEMY_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An incident has occurred today that concerns the entire student body. Academic immorality by one is an assault on us all. It will. Not. Stand. Cadet Kirk, evidence has been submitted to this council suggesting you violated the ethical code of conduct pursuant to regulation 17.43 of the Starfleet code. Is there anything you care to say before we begin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACADEMY_PRESIDENT>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(uncomfortable beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yessir. I believe I have the right to face my accuser directly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
President nods toward the assembly. SPOCK RISES. He and Kirk MEET EYES for the first time. It's clock-stopping.
</DIRECTION>
<ACADEMY_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Step forward please. This is Commander Spock, one of our most distinguished graduates. He's programmed the Kobayashi Maru test for the last four years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACADEMY_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
Spock steps up to the OTHER PODIUM. President nods.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cadet Kirk. It is obvious you somehow managed to install and activate a sub- routine in the programming code, thereby changing the conditions of the test.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
We happen to find GAILA, in the crowd, fucking pissed.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your point being?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<ACADEMY_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In academic vernacular, you cheated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACADEMY_PRESIDENT>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Respectfully. Define "cheating".
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To deceive by trickery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now let me ask you something I think we all know the answer to: the test is rigged, isn't it? You programmed it to be unwinnable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<ACADEMY_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Kirk, I don't see how the intent of the exam is relevant to these proceedings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACADEMY_PRESIDENT>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because if I'm right, Sir, then the test itself is a cheat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your argument precludes the possibility of a no-win scenario --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe in no-win scenarios --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
FIND PIKE amongst the officers in attendance. His eyes locked on Kirk. This is his boy. His recruit. And he's INVESTED.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then not only have you violated the rules, you've failed to understand the principle lesson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, enlighten me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You, of all people should know, Cadet Kirk -- A captain cannot cheat death.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
ON KIRK. The first punch by Spock that landed. The cockiness slips away as he senses where this is going --
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"I of all people?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your father, Lieutenant George Kirk, had assumed command of his vessel before killed in action, did he not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Shit. The DADDY card. Kirk, a mix of ANGER and EMBARRASSMENT --
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long did it take you to look that up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long did it take you to program the virus that allowed you to cheat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
The President smirks; considers ending this now but doesn't, it's just too damn entertaining...
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you just don't like that I beat your test.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am Vulcan. "Like" is not a verb in our vernacular. I've simply made the logical deduction that you're a liar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What an idiot I am for taking that personally --
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Agreed. Furthermore, you have failed to divine the purpose of the test.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enlighten me again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The purpose is to experience fear. Fear in the face of certain death. To accept that fear and maintain command of one's self and one's crew. This is a quality expected in every Starfleet captain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk absorbs that. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're telling me the point. Of the whole thing. Is to be afraid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fear is necessary, yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you taken the test, Commander Spork?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spock. As a Vulcan, I require no additional training to control my narcissism when making command decisions.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
No he DIN'T! Kirk's hit guys for a lot less -- The crowd all but "OOOOOOHs." But Kirk ain't fucking done yet.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You keep reminding me that you're Vulcan. And I'm sure you're really proud of that, who wouldn't be-- but isn't it true you people don't experience fear at all?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
ON SPOCK. He raises that eyebrow. And Kirk sees... no matter how subtly... that he has fucking made CONTACT. Smelling blood - -
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if that's the case -- What's that say about your ability to make command decisions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Well. Looks like Kirk just hit him in HIS fucking weak spot. And before this lovefest can continue --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A REDSHIRT bursts into the HALL -- Kirk turns to look -- they all do -- now we're SPEEDING IN behind the REDSHIRT, who runs to the President, hands him a DATAPAD. President reads it. Everyone watches, on edge -- finally, quietly:
</DIRECTION>
<ACADEMY_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
(to all)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've received a distress call from Vulcan.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Spock reacts concerned)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cadet Kirk -- you are on academic probation pending the result of your hearing. Cadets, report to Shuttle Hangar One immediately -- this hearing is at recess until further notice -- dismissed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACADEMY_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
Everyone's on their feet, MOVING QUICKLY, Kirk suddenly irrelevant. PIKE passes by him, all fucking business, but before he goes --
</DIRECTION>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cheating isn't winning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
And as that settles on Kirk, McCoy now joins him. The two exiting with the rest of the cadets as Kirk eyes SPOCK --
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who was that pointy-eared bastard?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<MCCOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, but I like him.

INT. STARFLEET ACADEMY - HANGAR - CONTINUOUS

<DIRECTION>
DOLLY THROUGH HUNDREDS OF CADETS, racing to their shuttles -- BARRACKS LEADERS stand on platforms, calling out SHIP ASSIGNMENTS -- cadets HURRYING OFF as they're called --
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Blake! U.S.S. Newton! Counter! U.S.S. Odyssey! Fugeman: Regula One! Gerace: U.S.S. Farragut! McGrath! U.S.S. Wolcott! McCoy! U.S.S. Enterprise! Welcome to Starfleet and Godspeed!

	</DIALOGUE>
</FEMALE_BARRACKS_OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
As the last of the cadets head off, Kirk stands there without a home -- he moves to his exiting Barracks Leader --
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, you didn't call my name. Kirk, James T..
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<BARRACKS_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
(checks his tablet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're on academic probation. That means you're grounded until the Academy Board rules.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARRACKS_LEADER>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk is POLEAXED as Leader heads off -- McCoy, needing to run:
</DIRECTION>
<MCCOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Jim, the Board'll rule in your favor. Most likely.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Kirk is just rocked)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Jim -- I gotta go --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCOY>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... yeah-- yeah, you go... I'm good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk forces a half-smile. Torn, McCoy hurries off. PULL AWAY from Kirk, alone as the mass of newly-minted cadets criss- crosses around him. At the hangar entrance, McCoy suddenly STOPS: a lightbulb. He quickly returns to Kirk, pulls him off:
</DIRECTION>
<MCCOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come with me --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCOY>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- what're you doing --?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
TRACK with them as they hurry through the throng of cadets -- and suddenly we're moving in the OTHER DIRECTION as a pissed-off Uhura serpentines through the group to SPOCK --
</DIRECTION>
<UHURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Commander, a word?
	</DIALOGUE>
</UHURA>
<DIRECTION>
Spock moves away from the officers, a private moment with her:
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Lieutenant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<UHURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was I not one of your top students?
	</DIALOGUE>
</UHURA>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Indeed you were --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<UHURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I not receive a Gold rating for Exolinguistic skills, giving Starfleet first place over Kyoto and MIT at the Oxford Invitational?
	</DIALOGUE>
</UHURA>
<DIRECTION>
A LOUD nearby SHUTTLE LEAVES BEHIND THEM -- it gets WINDY --
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	An exceptional achievement, to be su--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<UHURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- and did I not, on multiple occasions, demonstrate exceptional aural sensitivity and, I quote, "unparalleled ability to identify sonic anomalies" in subspace transmission tests?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</UHURA>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Consistently, yes--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<UHURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And while you were well aware that my unqualified desire was to serve on the U.S.S. Enterprise, I was assigned to the Farragut.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UHURA>
<DIRECTION>
Spock reacts unusually; he seems almost embarrassed. Quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was an attempt to avoid the appearance of favoritism.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
She gets closer, voice low, all pride and defiance:
</DIRECTION>
<UHURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No. I am assigned to the Enterprise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UHURA>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes hold. He checks his tablet, makes an change:

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Yes, I believe you are.

</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHUTTLE HANGAR MEDICAL BAY - CONTINUOUS

McCoy and Kirk enter fast. McCoy goes through a cabinet, preps a med in a hypospray SYRINGE.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<MCCOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doing you a favor. I couldn't just leave you there, looking all pitiful-- roll up your sleeve, I'm gonna give you a vaccine against viral infection from Melvaran mud fleas.

</MCCOY>
<DIRECTION>
McCoy FIRES the Hypospray --
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ow-- what for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<MCCOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To give you symptoms.

McCoy ushers Kirk to a shuttle -- a SCANNING OFFICER stops them:

<SCANNING_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Kirk, James T." -- he's not cleared for duty aboard the Enterprise --
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCANNING_OFFICER>
<MCCOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I am, and Medical Code states the treatment and transport of a patient's to be determined at the discretion of his attending physician, which is me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(re: scanner)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can see he's suffering, he needs me as his doctor, so since I'm assigned to this ship, so's he, or would you like to explain to Captain Pike why the Enterprise warped into a crisis without one of its medical officers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCOY>
<SCANNING_OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... as you were.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCANNING_OFFICER>
<MCCOY>

Kirk, in agony, sweating, sits beside McCoy as they pass through the stratosphere. McCoy's peering out a window --
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I might throw up on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<MCCOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should look at this.

The shuttle approaches a massive DOCKING STATION where a dozen STARFLEET VESSELS ARE DOCKED. But the ship we're approaching is miraculous: "U.S.S. ENTERPRISE NCC-1701" IS REVEALED ON THE HULL OF THE FLAGSHIP. THE QUEEN OF THE FLEET IS FULLY CONSTRUCTED AND READY FOR HER MAIDEN VOYAGE. The shuttle glides to the underside of the Enterprise.

Officers move quickly on the ship -- Kirk and McCoy enter. Kirk WIPING HIS BROW, pretty much SOAKED.

Kirk looks up -- SPOCK moves towards them, not seeing them -- Kirk yanks McCoy out of the way -- Spock passes and enters a TURBOLIFT -- Kirk looks back as the doors close.

Then we go INTO THE TURBOLIFT -- for just a moment -- as the doors open and we enter with Spock:

	Do you. Okay then: are you out of your Vulcan mind? Were you doing the logical thing? Maybe. The right one? Debatable. But one thing's for damn sure -- that kid doesn't know how to lose. Just isn't in his DNA. Back home we have a saying: "If you're gonna ride in the Kentucky Derby, don't leave your prize stallion in the stable."

Echo. Nothing. They head down. After a beat, a SMALL, DARK, ODDLY ALIEN CREATURE STEPS OUT. Eyes them curiously. This is KEENSER.

Keenser looks them over. Then:

<KEENSER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... no. This way.

</KEENSER>
<DIRECTION>
And they follow Keenser into a MASSIVE WAREHOUSE, filled mostly with junked space parts. A large, tarped SHUTTLE in the background. In the middle of the huge, depressing space is a table. And a STARFLEET OFFICER who is ASLEEP, legs kicked up, leaning back in a chair, a hat covering his face. Keenser taps the Officer's boot.

	You are in fact the Mr. Scott who postulated the theory of trans-warp beaming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK_PRIME>
<SCOTTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes! That's exactly what I'm talking about! How d'ya think I ended up here? I got into a debate with my instructor on the issue of Relativistic Physics as they pertain to subspace travel... He seemed to think that the range of transporting say, a roast turkey, was limited to a few hundred miles -- so I told my instructor I could not only beam a bird from one planet to an adjacent planet in the same system -- which is no big deal anyway -- but if I were so inclined I could actually do it with a lifeform! So I tested it on Admiral Archer's prize beagle. Which... was a mistake.

</SPOCK_PRIME>
<SCOTTY>

	I haven't been stationed here that long. If such an equation had been discovered, I'da heard.

Kirk and wet Scotty race through the ship -- only to finally turn a corner and be faced with PHASERS, AIMED RIGHT AT THEM.

But suddenly PHASERS are at their heads. Two SECURITY GUARDS -- one, THE GUY HE GOT INTO THE FIGHT WITH AT THE BAR, YEARS AGO.

INT. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE (SET CHANGE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WOOSH -- bridge doors open -- Kirk and Scotty are ushered in by the Security Guards. Spock moves to them, containing his anger and dismay. McCoy is here as well. Spock walks right up to Kirk... raises his eyebrow.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>

	Surprise.

Kirk stares at the young Spock -- a different experience now --

<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're the genius, you figure it out.

</KIRK>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As Captain of this vessel I order you to answer the question.

Spock nods back to the SECURITY GUARDS, over this --
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Escort them to the Brig.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
But before the guards can do so --
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it about you, Spock? Your planet was just destroyed -- your mother murdered -- and you're not even upset?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your presumption that these experiences interfere with my abilities to command this ship is inaccurate--
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<KIRK>

Kirk gets close to Spock --
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why don't you stop me.

Sarek watches, tense. McCoy, too. Spock blinks --

<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Step away from me, Mr. Kirk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<KIRK>

</DIRECTION>
<SAREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spock!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAREK>
<DIRECTION>
And everything -- everything -- STOPS. Spock, red-faced, releases his grip. Kirk GULPS air and tumbles to the ground. Spock staggers back. Kirk's hardly able to speak, close to collapsing. But despite his brutalized face, his expression isn't about spite, or hatred... but compassion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spock sees the faces of the STUNNED CREW staring at him. But worst of all? Sarek. His father. Spock levels his chin. Quickly wipes his eyes. Trying to regain some semblance of dignity... looks to McCoy. Softly --
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doctor. I am no longer fit for duty. I hereby relinquish my command on the grounds that I have been... emotionally compromised. Please note the time and date in the ship's log.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
JESUS. Spock just... QUIT. And after a beat, he leaves the room. Sarek follows a moment later.

The crew just stands there in stunned SILENCE. Finally --

<SCOTTY>

McCoy turns to Kirk, exasperated --

<CHEKOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Based on the Narada's course from Vulcan, I've projected that Nero will travel past Saturn. If we could drop out of warp behind one of Saturn's moons, say, Titan, the magnetic distortion from the planet's rings will make us invisible to Nero's sensors. We could follow him to Earth by staying in his blind spot.

CLOSE ON NERO -- his face illuminated on the DARKENED BRIDGE of the Narada by SOFT BLUE LIGHT. Light radiated by EARTH. A BEAUTIFUL HOLOGRAM before him. He doesn't notice behind him, as those BLADES from his STAFF APPEAR BEHIND HIS NECK. Nero tenses, only now sensing this unforeseen danger: AYEL HOLDS THE WEAPON. Strong. Tough.

As Spock Prime walks off down the corridor, he passes right by a man conferring with a nurse -- the man pauses, turns... it's SAREK. Suddenly overcome by a feeling that the stranger who's just passed him is... oddly familiar.

INT. STARFLEET ACADEMY - COUNCIL CHAMBERS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MUSIC STILL BUILDING -- glass walls reveal THE ENTERPRISE at dock, UTILITY CRAFTS floating around it, repairing. Standing at attention in rows, THE ENTERPRISE CREW -- over four hundred of them wearing DRESS UNIFORMS -- TRACK DOWN the faces, all proud -- and we STOP ON YOUNG KIRK. Composed, focused, a man. The ACADEMY PRESIDENT stands at a podium:
</DIRECTION>
<ACADEMY_PRESIDENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This assembly calls Captain James Tiberius Kirk...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACADEMY_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk breaks from formation, pivots, marches down the hangar -- past UHURA... SULU... CHEKOV... SCOTTY. All Beaming. Notably absent, is Spock. Kirk ascends the stairs, snaps to attention:
</DIRECTION>
<ACADEMY_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your inspirational valor and supreme dedication to your comrades are in keeping with the highest traditions of service and reflect utmost credit to yourself, your crew, and the Federation. For your... unique solution to the Kobayashi Maru, it's my honor to award you with a commendation for original thinking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACADEMY_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
He opens a BOX -- glorious in repose, a MEDAL:
</DIRECTION>
<ACADEMY_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By Starfleet Order 28455, you are hereby directed to report to Commanding Officer, USS Enterprise, for duty as his relief.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ACADEMY_PRESIDENT>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk turns. Walks to... PIKE. In a wheelchair now, wearing an ADMIRAL'S UNIFORM. Overnight, his hair's turned totally grey -- but despite his trauma, his pride's overwhelming. They SALUTE:
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I relieve you, Sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<PIKE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am relieved. Congratulations, Captain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIKE>
<DIRECTION>
Pike containing a smirk, pins the medal to Kirk's chest.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk turns to the crowd. Eyes shining. WILD APPLAUSE. As Kirk rejoins his crew for hugs and congratulations, we go to the BACK of the hangar... SPOCK PRIME. Watching. Moved beyond words. He turns and leaves them to it... and our MUSIC SWELLS as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. U.S.S. ENTERPRISE - BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The turbolift WHOOSHES open and in walks Kirk -- to every fan's delight, wearing his iconic GOLD SHIRT. All around him, our crew -- young and fresh-faced but no longer children -- in charge of the greatest starship ever built:
</DIRECTION>
<SULU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maneuvering thrusters and impulse engines at your command, Sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SULU>
<CHEKOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Weapons systems and shields on standby.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHEKOV>
<UHURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dock control reports ready. Yard Command signalling clear.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UHURA>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scotty how are we?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<SCOTTY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S. OVER COMM LINK)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dilithium chamber at maximum efficiency, Captain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCOTTY>
<MCCOY>
<DIRECTION>
(wry grin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Same ship, different day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCOY>
<DIRECTION>
And Kirk pauses. His eyes go over to the empty science console with a sense of incompleteness. In fact, everyone on the bridge feels it. A bitter truth they'll have to accept.
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Sulu, prepare to engage thrus--
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOSH: the turbolift door opens. SPOCK!!! Wearing his BLUE UNIFORM. Our hearts soar --
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Permission to come aboard, Captain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Permission granted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<SPOCK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As you have yet to select a first officer, respectfully, I would like to submit my candidacy. Should you desire, I can provide character references.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK>
<DIRECTION>
Kirk nearly laughs. Spock's eyebrow goes up. Something passes between them... it carries acceptance, and trust...
</DIRECTION>
<KIRK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would be my honor, Commander. Maneuvering thrusters, Mr. Sulu. Take us out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIRK>
<SULU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aye, Captain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SULU>
<DIRECTION>
As the ship maneuvers out of dry dock, Spock takes his place next to Kirk. Gold and blue, side by side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STARBASE ONE - DRYDOCK - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the ship crests the drydock portal, drifting into space... blessed one last time by the voice of our Vulcan hero:
</DIRECTION>
<SPOCK_NIMOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Space... the final frontier. These are the continuing voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Her ongoing mission... to explore strange new worlds... to seek out new life forms, and new civilizations... To boldly go, where no one has gone... before...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SPOCK_NIMOY>
<DIRECTION>
The TREK THEME SOARS as the Enterprise warps off into a universe of infinite possibilities...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BEGINNING
