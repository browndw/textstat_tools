<DIRECTION>
The faces of several young children are presented in CLOSEUP, as they walk TOWARD US across a ploughed field. On the SOUND TRACK, the haunting SOUNDS OF A GREGORIAN FUNERAL CHANT. The CAMERA PANS UP to the faces of older brothers and sisters, then to parents and grandparents. These are not familiar faces, but faces from another age, strong and open. All are dressed in the distinctive clothing of the Amish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRY LANE – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the last traces of early morning mist another group of black-clad figures make their way down a lane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRY LANE – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An Amish buggy, black and highwheeled, stark against the landscape, appears, a spirited chestnut in the traces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Framed in the glass window of the narrow buggy is the stern figure of an Amish man in black topcoat and flatbrimmed hat, his bonneted wife in muted colors, the face of a boy, attired like his father, peering out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The horse's breath smokes on the frosty air, the buggy CREAKS on its springs, and there's the rhythmic CLIP-CLOP OF HOOVES on the pavement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER LANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two Amish buggies reach a crossroads, join a procession of three others. They disappear as the lane wends through a leafless thicket of hickory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VALLEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BIG SHOT... now the procession numbers almost a dozen buggies... it is headed toward a distant farmhouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BARNYARD

Where literally dozens of carriages are parked. The horses have been taken from the traces, removed to the shelter of the barn.

As the black clad mourners begin to move into the house (women and children presumably first).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The coffin has the upper half open. We see that the corpse has been dressed in white linen, a piece of white linen partially covering the bearded face.

END TITLE SEQUENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Partitions have been removed, making the central rooms of the farmhouse a spacious hall. The place is packed, a hundred- fifty or more Amish, all sitting in absolute silence on rows of wooden benches. A wooden coffin rests on a bench in the f.g., and near it the close relatives of the deceased occupy a special Place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RACHEL LAPP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A young woman of perhaps twenty-seven. Her face is pale and drawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In happier circumstances, although there haven't been too many of late in Rachel's life, we would see a robust, sensual woman of full figure, spirit and intelligence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eight-year-old SAMUEL LAPP flits next to his mother; he would appear stunned, possibly not entirely comprehending events.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the patriarch, ELI LAPP; his stubborn, weathered – yet not unkind – features grief-stricken.

FAVORING PREACHER

As he removes his hat. As one, the men in the congregation remove their hats also.

Then the preacher begins to speak in a formal German dialect:
</DIRECTION>

SUBTITLES OVER.

	...a brother has been called home. God has spoken through the death of our neighbor, Jacob Lapp...

Where Rachel, Samuel and Eli are SITTING - SOUNDS of emotion and grief not quite suppressed are heard throughout as:

<PREACHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...husband of Rachel, father to Samuel, son of Eli.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(and)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His chair is empty, his bed is empty, his voice will be heard no more. He was needed in our presence, but God needs such men, too. That one should be taken so suddenly. Treat sorrow. Still, we would not wish him back. Rather we should prepare ourselves to follow him.

TIGHTENING to the Lapps, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CEMETERY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mourners have gathered about the grave, standing in silence as four pallbearers are lowering the coffin into the pit. The many buggies are aligned in the b.g.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the pallbearers begin to shovel soil and gravel into the grave, the Preacher begins to read a hymn in German... a slow atonal litany which seems to hang forever on the frosty air.

DANIEL HOCHSTETLER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A brawny-armed, ruggedly-handsome, raffish looking Amishman. There is something atypical about his face a slightly sardonic set of mouth, a bold eye, a prominent set of jaw. Not exactly what old Jacob Ammann had in mind, maybe, but a well set-up man nonetheless, and at ease among men. He's among a group of men including old STOLTZFUS, the local healer, FISHER, BIEILER and Bieiler's stout young son, Tom.

</HOCHSTETLER>
<DIRECTION>
The others chuckle. But Hochstetler's attention is still on Rachel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RACHEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Hochstetler looms on the horizon, plants himself like a tree in front of her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At ease as he was with the men, he's a bit awkward at this. All the women, very much aware of Hochstetler's availability, tune in as Rachel looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<HOCHSTETLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was sorry to hear about Jacob. Let us hope he walks close with God.

	I'm sure he does, Daniel.

FIELDS, LAPP FARM – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is some time after the funeral and the Lapp family is hard at work breaking ground for the spring ploughing. The death of Jacob has increased the work load on all three – Samuel maneuvers a four-mule team while Rachel and old Eli work nearby, further breaking up the earth. Rachel looks up from the back-breaking labor as several figures approach – it's Daniel Hochstetler and two of his brothers. Without a word they fall in beside Eli and Rachel and take up various tasks associated with the work in hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Daniel works close beside Rachel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRY ROADS, LANCASTER COUNTY – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few BRIEF SHOTS of a lone buggy containing the Lapp family take us from the 18th century into the 20th century the reassuring RATTLE OF THE CARRIAGE WHEELS on quiet backroad, to the ROAR OF TRAFFIC as the buggy waits patiently for a chance to cross a busy interstate highway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY, LANCASTER COUNTY – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge tractor trailer rig hovers over the frail buggy as it trots down the interstate. The camera cranes up to reveal a procession of vehicles behind the truck for a chance to overtake it.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. PLATFORM, LANCASTER STATION – DAY
</DIRECTION>

Daniel Hochstetler moves through the crowd on the plat-form, Rachel turns surprised, as he approaches, a faint color coming to her cheek.

<HOCHSTETLER>

<DIRECTION>
There is an embarrassment between them broken by the arrival of the train.
</DIRECTION>
<HOCHSTETLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You will come back soon?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOCHSTETLER>
<DIRECTION>
Samuel can barely contain his excitement as he drags at his mother's hand.

<SAMUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quickly, Mother Quickly!

Rachel embraces Eli.

Daniel Hochstetler leaps into the driving seat of his open wagon and with a flick of the reins and a whoop sets his horse off at a fast trot.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRAIN – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ENGINE gives a WARNING BLAST before creeping slowly forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN (MOVING)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Samuel spots something out of the window that causes him to light up.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Mama...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMUEL>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV THROUGH WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A road runs parallel to the train track, and Hochstetler in his wagon urges his horse almost to the gallop as he attempts to keep pace with the train.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Rachel smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see, darling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
And Samuel cranes to look back, waving, for as long as he can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LANCASTER COUNTRYSIDE – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train moves across a broad panorama of fields, dotted with dolls'-house-sized farms and the tiny figures of Amish farmers working their horse-drawn equipment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF CUTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the train continues its eastward journey... Samuel stares raptly out of the window at the changing patterns of the countryside. He points in wonder at a brightly colored hot air balloon as it drifts slowly over timbered hills... he looks unsure as the pattern of field and wood gives way to suburbs, bustling shopping centers, restaurants, car lots and fast food outlets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PHILADELPHIA SLUMS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the train travels past dilapidated row houses, streets choked with cars and the gutters with filth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAIN (MOVING)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now Samuel is staring out the window with some confusion, almost apprehension:
</DIRECTION>
<SAMUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this where we're going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMUEL>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
And Rachel draws her son closer, turning her back on the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 30TH ST. STATION, PHILADELPHIA – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel is in a line at one of the counters. The plain dress of the two Amish – particularly Samuel's black coat and hat – are drawing curious stares.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAMUEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's uncomfortably aware of the shy looks and giggles of a little girl about his own age, standing in line with her parents at the next counter. He edges away from his mother...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Samuel comes upon a figure garbed in a long black frock coat and flat-brimmed hat... the man's back is turned, could, from appearances, be an Amishman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Samuel stares... A beat, the man turns to face Samuel and we discover that he is a Hasidic Jew.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAMUEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he reacts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO TICKET COUNTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Rachel's turn arrives. The TICKET SELLER glances up and she shows him her ticket.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have a ticket to Baltimore. Where is that train, please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<TICKET_SELLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Delayed three hours. You'll hear an announcement when it's time to board.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TICKET_SELLER>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to go without his hat, but Rachel collars him and puts it on his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE IN MEN'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Samuel enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a long row of sinks, urinals, and stalls... Samuel stops before one of the urinals – a long, trough-like affair with water drizzling down the rear porcelain panel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's set a little high for Samuel, and it is making GLUGGING FLUSHING NOISES that are, at least, intimidating. Samuel stares for a moment, then turns, looks toward the stalls, stoops to see which are empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV – TOILETS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beneath the row of doors we can see no feet visible. Samuel is alone in the restroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Samuel proceeds along the row of door, finally selects a stall near the end. He enters. As he does so, a heavily bearded youth in a dirty sweatshirt enters. With some urgency, he removes small notebook from his pocket and places it behind a paper towel dispenser. Suddenly he glances up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two other men have entered the men's room; one is a large BLACK MAN in a three-piece suit under an expensive, overcoat. His PARTNER is a Caucasian in designer jeans, half boots and a short leather jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They advance on the young man with unmistakable menace.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The young man whirls in terror; his two assailants lunge for him... a savage, wordless struggle ensues in the close confines of the lavatory.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE IN SAMUEL'S STALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the struggling men bounce off the door of his stall... he can see their feet under the edge of the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO FIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the struggle builds to a climax... ends with the young man stiffening with a grunt, his face draining of color.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two attackers step away, the blade in the black man's hand bloodstained. His partner stares at what they've accomplished with a stunned expression:
</DIRECTION>
<PARTNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus...
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARTNER>
<DIRECTION>
The young man's hand comes away from his belly covered with blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at it, staggers toward the sinks. Finally his bloodied hand reaches to smear at his face in the mirror. Then he collapses to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black man motions for his partner to watch the door, then quickly reaches up and removes the notebook from behind the dispenser.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE IN SAMUEL'S STALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he edges open the stall door a crack. Over his shoulder we can see the black man, his BACK TO US, rifling the backpack. But beyond him, in the mirror on the far wall, we catch sight of the black man's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAMUEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he stares out the narrow crack. A beat, then he closes the stall door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE IN STALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Samuel tries to make the latch work, but it's warped and won't fall closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he checks the notebook before placing it in his pocket. His partner is covering the door, an automatic in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black man makes for the exit, then on second thought, glances at the row of stalls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV – STALLS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All quiet, but...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black man whips out a .38 caliber revolver, and, starting at the near end, starts pushing open the stall doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE IN SAM'S STALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the black man approaches, Samuel working desperately on the latch. At the last minute he finally wedges it in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He elbows Samuel's stall... the door won't open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE IN SAM'S STALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fighting back panic, Samuel has retreated as far as he can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he gives the door a kick. It holds. He swears under his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE IN SAM'S STALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In desperation, Samuel does the only thing he can think of... he slips under the partition into the neighboring stall the black man just checked out. But he loses his hat in the process. His hand snakes back INTO FRAME to snatch it just as the black man gives the door a ferocious kick that splinters the lock and nearly takes it off its hinges. He's framed there, the big muzzle of the .38 revolver looking down our throats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As his partner snaps from the doorway:
</DIRECTION>
<PARTNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you come on, for Christ's sakes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PARTNER>
<DIRECTION>
A beat, then the black man holsters his weapon, turns to follow the partner out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SAMUEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we hear the SOUND OF THE TWO MEN EXITING the lavatory. A long beat, then Samuel opens the stall door a crack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POW THROUGH DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Samuel's own face reflected in the blood-smeared mirror... then PANNING DOWN to the still figure of the young man lying in the crimson pool of his own blood on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BENCH WAITING ROOM – LOW ANGLE – NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Samuel sits close to his mother, his face pale, his eyes staring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel holds his hand tightly in hers as the torsos of various police and officials pass through foreground, occasionally obscuring the lonely couple. There is considerable ECHOING NOISE as commands and requests mingle with the CRACKLE OF TWO-WAY RADIOS.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The diffused shape of faces behind the frosted glass of the Men's room door, which is pushed open to reveal, JOHN BOOK, who comes striding through to be momentarily lost in the crowd of police, reporters and others. He is about 40, with a rangy, athletic body. Behind him comes CARTER, Book's black partner – about five years younger than Book. Book is wearing a suit, Carter is much more casually – almost disreputably – dressed.

TIGHT SHOT – SAMUEL

Worry-eyed, still staring straight ahead. Then his eyes move suddenly to his left.

<DIRECTION>
BOOK'S LEGS – SAMUEL'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coming in at full stride, then stopping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAMUEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He doesn't raise his eyes... just looks at the legs. And, slowly, the legs begin to bend at the knees. We see Book's belt buckle, then his big pistol in its holster, then his face. He stares at Samuel for a moment, then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE – BOOK
</DIRECTION>

Samuel gives his mother a helpless look; exasperated, Rachel intervenes with Book. She glances at Carter:

RACHEL / SAMUEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They can't help but watch the confrontation between Donahue and Book... although they're keeping the volume down, it's obviously intense and angry:
</DIRECTION>
<SAMUEL>
<DIRECTION>
(alarmed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Momma... are they angry with us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMUEL>
<RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
(reassuring, but hardly in her own mind)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... No. It is just the English way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Donahue has lost the confrontation; he gives Book a smile:
</DIRECTION>
<DONAHUE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ought to think about coming back to Homicide, Johnny... Stick with Internal Affairs and you're not gonna have any friends left.

Book emerges from the terminal, looks about him, then crosses to a big Mercury Sedan which is parked nearby. Two men sit in the front seat. Book crosses to the driver's side and opens the door.

	Go get a cup of coffee, Stan.

The driver, a uniformed policeman, glances at the man beside him who nods in agreement. He gets out and Book gets in behind the wheel.

<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<SCHAEFFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHAEFFER>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.

</BOOK>
<SCHAEFFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.

INT. BOOK'S CAR (MOVING) PHILADELPHIA – NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Book drives around 13th Street, a ravaged corridor between neon lit restaurants, bars, porno shops and darkened storefronts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter sits beside him, Rachel and her son in the back seat looking out at the assorted array of desperate characters huddled in doorways or wandering aimlessly about. On the POLICE RADIO a description of the cop killing is BROADCAST EVERY FEW MINUTES.

<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have no right to keep us here.

</RACHEL>
<BOOK>

	You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!

	Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not a joke.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Book decides to try contrition:
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. It's not a joke. Listen, I know a little about the Amish. I know this has to be an ordeal for you; and I'm really sorry you an Samuel got involved.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
Samuel shoots a look at Book then mutters something to his mother in German. She responds in the same language. Book frowns.
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.

Book's car stops, and from out of the shadows darts a wizened little MAN. He looks about before crossing to the driver's side window.

Book lowers the window.

The little man stares at the weird-looking couple in the back seat.

</SAMMY>
<BOOK>

Book's car pulls up outside the bar and he and Carter get out, and move swiftly inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HAPPY VALLEY – NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sixty black faces stare as the police enter. A hush falls on the group. Book and Carter spot their man at the bar and move up either side of him. They've moved carefully to this point... no mistakes. From the back, the black man they've approached certainly looks like he could be the man who did the killing of Zenovitch. And, as Book and Carter make their move...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HAPPY VALLEY – NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Book and Carter explode through the door of the bar, violently propelling Coalmine along with them. Now we see Coalmine is not the killer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Book and Carter escort Coalmine out of the bar a police squad car pulls up, its headlights shining into Book's car. An alarmed Rachel holds Samuel close as Book forces Coalmine's face down next to the car window.
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put some light on him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
A cop pulls out a flashlight, begins to play the beam over Coalmine's face.
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
(continuing; to Samuel)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
Crazy as Rasputin on speed and booze, Coalmine glares at Samuel inside the car:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Samuel, white-faced, finally shakes his head in the negative.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coalmine tries to twist free of Book's grip. Book snaps, and slams Coalmine's skull into the window edge, finally crushing his face up against the front window. His face takes on a grotesque shape against the glass. Carter restrains his partner and Book cools down. Coalmine is led stumbling away by the uniformed police. This sudden show of violence has horrified and angered Rachel, and she glares at Book as he gets back in the car.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John Book, you listen to me! I will have no further part in this, nor will my son! As God stands between us!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>

Book sighs, starts the engine and moves off.

EXT. HOTEL – PHILADELPHIA – NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Book pulls up outside a hotel entrance as a uniformed DOORMAN moves to open the rear door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR – NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel and Sam recoil as the Doorman opens the door. He is puzzled by the sight of the reluctant guests.
</DIRECTION>
<DOORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ma'am?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOORMAN>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>

An attractive woman in her early thirties in robe and slippers stares in disbelief as Rachel and Sam file into the house. This is ELAINE, Book's sister. She stops Book as he tries to follow Rachel inside.

<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could you do this to me tonight? I told you I had company

ANGLE IN GUEST ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Samuel is asleep in one twin bed in a tiny, cluttered room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel, in a plain nightgown, is preparing to climb into the other one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Off screen we hear a DOOR CLOSE, presumably Book leaving. A beat, then Elaine opens the door and looks in.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything okay?

EXT. DRIVE-IN FAST-FOOD JOINT – PHILADELPHIA – DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter exits the cafe carrying burgers, donuts and a couple of beers. Book wakes from a brief nap as Carter gets into the car.

Book chews into his burger while Carter takes a doughnut. Its clear they've worked through the night.

Elaine's house is situated on the corner of a row of terraces, which stretch into the distance on both sides of the street.

As Samuel comes out of the guest room in his night-shirt, turns up the hall and opens the door to the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But it's not the bathroom; it's Elaine's bedroom. She and FRED are tangled in the sheets, furiously making love. Elaine gasps, Fred manages to grunt.
</DIRECTION>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wrong door, kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>

As Samuel quickly shuts the door. A straight-faced beat; then, barely suppressing a giggle, he hurries on...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE IN LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Rachel appears in the living room entry. Samuel is sitting on the floor with two boys of about his own age, watching television.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're eating cold cereal out of a box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RACHEL'S POV – TV SCREEN
</DIRECTION>

Some artless Saturday morning cartoon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO RACHEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she frowns, watching her son and the other two staring hypnotically. And...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE IN LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's later in the morning now, as Elaine, a bit blearily, appears in the entryway, stares in groggy disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER POV – KIDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her oldest boy and Samuel are busily washing the windows while her youngest is pushing a carpet sweeper. The TV is off.

As she stares.

Rachel is standing in the middle of the now immaculate kitchen finishing a brisk mop of the floor. The coffee is perking. Elaine appears.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(and)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aganishish? Yeah, that sounds like John.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a seat at the table, still shaking her head.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(and)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel means no harm by this, but Elaine's eyes begin to storm.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, is that so?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(and)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No offense, lady, but I'm not so sure I like the idea of your coming in here and turning the place upside down!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel's smile fades at Elaine's trembling outburst:
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, I didn't mean...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Abruptly Elaine rises and snatches the mop from Rachel's hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She mops furiously as she Continues:
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know exactly what you meant! Listen, maybe I'm not a world-class housefrau, but maybe I don't have time to polish the goddamn china and keep after the kids!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(and)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's none of your business, but I don't happen to have a man around here full time. So I sell cosmetics in a goddamn drugstore and sometimes I can even pay the rent on time! So maybe I'm not Mary Poppins, but maybe I don't need to have it jammed down my throat like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
She finishes the floor, hurls the mop aside with a CLATTER:
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is that clean enough for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel is speechless, Elaine is on the point of bursting into tears. At which point Fred appears at the entry in his undershirt, taking in the sparkling kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, Elaine... Somebody die and leave you a broom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<DIRECTION>
Not a politic observation on Fred's part.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go to hell, Fred!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
And, bursting into tears, she flees the kitchen. Fred stares after her.
</DIRECTION>
<FRED>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's bugging her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRED>
<DIRECTION>
Unperturbed, he crosses to the counter and the coffee pot, letting his eyes take in Rachel's full figure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELAINE'S BEDROOM

As Rachel comes in with Elaine's coffee, closes the door behind her. Elaine is lying across the bed, sobbing.

</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a seat next to the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, Elaine starts to pull herself together:
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(and)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I shouldn't have blown my top. It's like... somehow... I've let everything get away from me. And you sort of made me face it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the cup, sips the coffee. Rachel smiles at a private thought.
</DIRECTION>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's so funny?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.

	<DIALOGUE>
	God, Fred...

</RACHEL>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No? Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELAINE>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<ELAINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, I don't know what's going on or how you got mixed up with him, but don't you let that self-righteous son of a bitch push you around, okay?

<BOOK>

	Now what's the problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.

Book gives her a look:

Samuel has been glancing at Book; finally he says something to his mother in German. Book gives her an inquiring look.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says you look very tired. I thought the same thing.
	</DIALOGUE>

Book says nothing.

She doesn't bother to explain; Book settles even deeper into his funk as Samuel glares at him with hostility.

INT. IDENTIFICATION ROOM – POLICE H.Q. – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Samuel sits with Book at a desk, Rachel just behind. They are looking at a police line-up of known black drug-dealers. Samuel shakes his head – another negative.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Book winks, slyly reaches into a pocket, produces a yellow gumball. He surreptitiously shows it to Samuel, gives him an inquiring look. It's a peace offering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Samuel grins, nods imperceptibly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Book rolls the gumball down the table to Samuel. But just as Samuel is about to cover it with his hand, Rachel reaches over and plucks it off the table. She shakes her head at Samuel.

Book, Sam and Rachel sit on a park bench eating a lunch of hot dogs heaped with kraut.

Book watches with amusement as Samuel wolfs down his lunch. Rachel eyes him a beat. then:

	She thinks you should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility.

Book gives her a look:
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh? Anything else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>

Book is staring at her. Rachel nods.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think that's what she said.

Just then Samuel belches with huge satisfaction, drawing looks from Book and a couple of passersby. Rachel smiles proudly.

INT. SMALL OFFICE, NARCOTICS DIVISION – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Narcotics Detective enters the room laden with several volumes of mug shots. He puts them on the desk beside a similar book which Samuel is intently studying. Sam sits on the chair cushions in a big swivel rocker.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Detective, SGT. KAMAN, eyes Book a little suspiciously – internal affairs officers are not greeted warmly by the working policemen in any department.
</DIRECTION>
<KAMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a Sgt. Carter on the phone for you.

</KAMAN>

Book gets up and moves to the door.

INT. DETECTIVES ROOM, NARCOTICS DIVISION – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through glass partitions we can see Book on the telephone in a cubicle of an office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Samuel has drifted out of the office and is idling amid the bustle of the squadroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses to a glass case which holds a collection of plaques and framed newspaper accounts which denote instances of outstanding duty and achievement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE THOUGH GLASS CASE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Samuel moves along, only half interested in what his eyes are taking in, not really old enough to comprehend anyway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Until suddenly he freezes.

<DIRECTION>
SAMUEL'S POV – NEWSPAPER ACCOUNT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Enlarged, prominently displayed. The headline reads: "Division Chief McElroy Honored For Youth Project". Accompanying the item is a large sidebar mug-shot of McElroy – clearly the black man who murdered the young cop in the train station men's room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SAMUEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares, transfixed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat, then Book, lowering himself to one knee next to Samuel, ENTERS FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's watching Samuel, knowing from the boy's expression that they've found their man. Samuel slowly raises his hand to point at the photograph. Book gently takes the boy's small hand in his, concealing the accusation from watchful eyes. He smiles gently at the boy.

Rachel shakes her head.

<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because – somehow – they knew I was getting close.

<DIRECTION>
Another beat, then:
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, they're thinking as long as they keep the killer out of Samuel's way, we can't make an I.D. There's no way they can know Samuel saw that photograph, so he's safe.

He glances at her, but she continues ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>

EXT. PARKING LOT – PHILADELPHIA – NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Book slams the front door of his car, checks it for being locked, glances at a roiled newspaper in his hand (the sports section of the Inquirer), starts across the parking lot toward his apartment, walking as he keeps glancing down at the sports section. He comes to a sort of crosswalk, stops, reads, starts to take a step... and looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAT HE SEES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McElroy, smiling nicely, starting across toward him from the other side of the parking lot crosswalk
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO BOOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Freezing, eyes widening. Utterly surprised and caught.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MCELROY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still smiling, he brings up his right hand out of a shopping bag (which he appeared to be carrying) – letting the shopping bag fall away as he does so – revealing a five-inch barrel Smith and Wesson .357 blue finish revolver with a silencer. Without hesitating, coming right on, still smiling, he FIRES once.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Already starting to leap away to one side, he is hit, driven into a half-turn. He clutches at the wound, as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MCELROY

<DIRECTION>
Coming right on, FIRING again... the pistol's report a WHOOSHING, like the opening of a bottle of cheap champagne. And McElroy still smiling as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hit... a grazing near-miss this time, but enough to send Book down hard and grasping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MCELROY

As the lights of an oncoming car – going very slowly, on its way to a parking space – sweep over him and we HEAR it come to a sudden, squealing stop. Book is already trying to get to his feet... now succeeds, lurching into a swaying stance, using an adjacent car for support. OFF SCREEN we HEAR a car door slam, and footsteps hurrying in our direction, accompanied by excited voices. Book HEARS, turns to face the oncomers,

A fat, middle-aged MAN has approached to within some feet of Book, looks on edgily:

	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Book stares at him, then looks down at his belly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOK'S WOUND

As Book removes his hand we can see one of the bullets struck him low in the side, just below the ribcage... the other just above it (but this one inflicting only minor damage).

By now the man's WIFE is hovering at a safe distance:

But the man is not content:
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up, Romona! Will ya look at that blood?

</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Book has tried to lurch toward his car; the man tries to intercept him:
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, buddy... you're gonna bleed to death!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Book whirls on him, his service revolver in his hand pointed squarely at the fat man's face:

<WIFE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Book doesn't trust himself to speak, but the .38 is sufficiently eloquent for the circumstances, He stares at the fat man another beat, then hesitates, turns, starts back toward his car.

Eli is about to inquire further when Samuel cries:

<SAMUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Momma – look.

</SAMUEL>
<DIRECTION>
They glance in the direction Samuel is looking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR POV – BOOK'S CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car has failed to take a bend in the road and is now bouncing across an adjoining ploughed field. It's knocked over a tall birdhouse by the roadside. The car finally comes to rest against a bank of earth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO RACHEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stares...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIELD – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Samuel races for all he's worth across the field, negotiates the creek via a fallen log – Rachel, now, also running toward the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STABLES – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli works fast harnessing his mules to an open wagon. He hops up to the front seat and urges them to trot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE AT BOOK'S CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see that Rachel has made Book as comfortable as possible in the front seat of the car and is packing the wound under his trenchcoat with material ripped from her apron. Momentarily he comes awake:
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no doctor...

<RACHEL>

	<DIALOGUE>
	But why?

</RACHEL>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But –
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Book reaches up to grip her arm fiercely:
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And when they find me, they'll find your boy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
He slips under again. Rachel stares at him, realizing the price he's paid in returning them to safety.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches out, touches him gently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the moment is broken by...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Eli reins up in the springwagon. He climbs down, crosses to glance into the car.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is the English dead?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No...

</RACHEL>
<ELI>

And together they begin to lift Book from the car and place him in the back of the springwagon. And...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LAMP FARMHOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where Eli is looking out a window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV – BUGGY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An Amish buggy coming up the drive, past Book' s car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE IN BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where Book lies on a bed. Rachel is bathing his wound with warm water from a pan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli appears in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stoltzfus is coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel looks at him, nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli frowns at Book's holstered pistol lying atop his neatly folded clothes on a chair near the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That has no place in this house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know.

She picks up the pile of clothes and the pistol and places them in a chest.

</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Samuel comes in with old Stoltzfus and Stoltzfus's teenage son, LEVI.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you for coming, Stoltzfus.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Stoltzfus's eyes have gone to the bed:
</DIRECTION>
<STOLTZFUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the English is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOLTZFUS>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SICKROOM – TIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Stoltzfus runs his fingers lightly over the vicinity of Book's wound:
</DIRECTION>
<STOLTZFUS>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel... burning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOLTZFUS>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Stoltzfus, in his shirt sleeves and concentrating mightily, moistens his fingertips with saliva, continues the examination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally he steps back.
</DIRECTION>
<STOLTZFUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This man should be treated in town.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(indicates)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The bullet entered there... and came out there. But there is the danger of infection, and he has lost a great deal of blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOLTZFUS>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel looks at Stoltzfus, then turns away, torn by her dilemma.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes fall on Samuel. Gently she ushers him from the room:
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go help Levi with the car, Samuel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
She closes the door after him, then turns to face Eli and Stoltzfus:
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, he must stay here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Stoltzfus gives Eli a puzzled look. And:
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws –
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know God help me, I know that, Eli.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel beseeches them helplessly:
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What else can we do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LAPP DRIVE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Levi has hitched Eli's mules to the rear of Book's car and is towing it up the drive toward the barn, with Samuel catching a ride on the bumper.
</DIRECTION>

RACHEL

Where she's waiting with the big barn doors thrown open. As the mules tow the car in, she closes the doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LAPP FARMHOUSE LIVING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Stoltzfus and Levi are about to go: Stoltzfus turns to Rachel:
</DIRECTION>
<STOLTZFUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make a poultice... three parts milk, two parts linseed oil... for the infection.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOLTZFUS>
<DIRECTION>
I'll send Mary by with some teas I will brew myself.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Stoltzfus turns to Eli:
</DIRECTION>
<STOLTZFUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lapp, I'll have to speak with the diener on this matter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOLTZFUS>

INT. SICKROOM – LAPS FARM – NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Rachel enters, turns up a kerosene lamp which is burning low at bedside. She's carrying the poultice Stoltzfus ordered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Book's brow is beaded with sweat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel seats herself next to the bed, strips away the sweat- soaked sheet. Her eyes take in his bare torso, and we should get the feeling that there's rather more male animal on display here just now than she's quite comfortable with.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She begins to apply the poultice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Book rouses to semi-consciousness, in his delirium he recoils with alarm.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all right! You have got to lie still.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Book stares up at her without recognition, but some of what she says seems to penetrate. He quiets.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
(soothingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, much better...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Book lapses back into sleep. Rachel hasn't removed her hand from his chest. Abruptly she does so.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She finds herself wondering about this man lying before her, so suddenly a part of her life. She notices details; bruises, scars, the knuckles are hard, grazed, a tattoo on one shoulder. While lost in this reverie, the delirious Philadelphia policeman begins to mutter. Incoherently at first, then the words take shape – swear words; curses; fuck this and that; shit; etc. Rachel rises abruptly, her cheeks coloring, as the barrage of language pours from his mouth. She beats a hasty retreat closing the door swiftly behind her.

INT. SCHAEFFER'S OFFICE – DAY

<UNDERSHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...want to help any way we can, Chief, but you got to understand we've got upwards of seven thousand Amish over here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNDERSHERIFF>
<DIRECTION>
And that's just Lancaster County.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT SCHAEFFER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Who is trying to control his impatience:

<SCHAEFFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got the woman's name, Sheriff. Lapp. Rachel Lapp. That should simplify your work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHAEFFER>
<DIRECTION>
The Undersheriff frowns. He doesn't like being talked down to.
</DIRECTION>
<UNDERSHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about an address?

</UNDERSHERIFF>
<SCHAEFFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHAEFFER>
<DIRECTION>
The Undersheriff is not impressed.
</DIRECTION>
<UNDERSHERIFF>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Problem is, Chief, 'bout every third Amishman around here is named Lapp. That or Yoder. Or Hochstetler.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(and)

	Chief, if the Amish have taken your man in, I wouldn't want to hang from a rope until you find him.

Schaeffer is tight-lipped with contained fury:

<SCHAEFFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Sheriff. It's been an education.

</SCHAEFFER>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up. A beat; the man is a study in frustration. Then he glances up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE

Standing in his doorway are the two plainclothesmen who spotted Carter in Book's office in the earlier scene. And...

Where Book lies in the bed. His fever seems to have subsided. He's coming awake, tries to focus on the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOK'S POV – CLERGY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PANNING the four men in Amish black who are standing around the bed looking down at Book, muttering among themselves in German.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
These include TSCHANTZ, the district bishop, a hawk-nosed, sterneyed old fellow; Stoltzfus, a deacon as well as a healer; and two preachers, ERB and HERSHBERGER. Eli stands somewhat apart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another moment of silence, then Book opens his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tschantz rumbles in German.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Stoltzfus, another Lazarus to your credit.

<RACHEL>

</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to rise, falls back faint. Rachel rearranges the sheet.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See. Anyway, you don't have any clothes on. And besides that, Bishop Tschantz wants to talk to you when you feel better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
The elders appear to have concluded their conference, and are filing out. Stoltzfus pauses at bedside.
</DIRECTION>
<STOLTZFUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rest, Mr. Book. That's the ticket. And drink my of my tea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOLTZFUS>
<DIRECTION>
He goes. Book is still fending off the dizziness. Rachel puts the teacup to his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell him his tea stinks.

</BOOK>
<RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)

	<DIALOGUE>
	You tell him. When you're able.

He looks like he's about to drop off again. Rachel rises.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
(from the door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're all very happy that you're going to live, John Book. We didn't quite know what we were going to do with you if you died.

That penetrates for a moment just before Book slips into sleep again.

	...but a gunshot wound. Very serious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HERSHBERGER>
<TSCHANTZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is not the first time we have done this. In the Englischer war of the revolution, old Elmer Miller's grandfather took in gunshot English soldiers.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a tad of pride)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Saved them, too.
	</DIALOGUE>

They all nod. What Tschantz says is well known. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<ERB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still, he should be among his own people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ERB>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel enters on this last.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'll leave as soon as he is able. He already wants to go.

Hershberger gives her a gloomy look, turns to Stoltzfus:

Schaeffer quickly – but gently – prevents her from shutting it.

INT. SICKROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Samuel comes in with a fresh bedpan. Book is lying asleep on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Samuel puts the bedpan down, checks to make sure Book is indeed asleep, then quietly crosses to the foot of the bed and opens the clothes chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Book's big .38 revolver lies holstered atop his folded clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fascinated, Samuel picks it up, admiring the heavy burled pistol grips. Unable to resist, he starts to remove the weapon from the holster, then pauses to steal a look. OFF SCREEN...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes are open and watching Samuel icily, which gives the boy something of a jolt.
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
Mutely, Samuel hands Book the pistol from arm's length. He looks on as Book takes the pistol out of the holster, shoots the boy another look, then snaps open the cylinder and shakes out the heavy, copper-jacketed bullets into his palm. He snaps the cylinder closed again, then nods to Samuel.
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come here.

<SAMUEL>
<DIRECTION>
(grins)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Mr. Book.

Book smiles. Then he gives the boy a playful, John Wayne- tough guy wink as he cocks and uncorks the pistol, demonstrating the action.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He finally hands it over to Samuel, butt first.
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call me John.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
The boy tries to imitate Book's one-handed expertise, but his hands are too small. Book smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Samuel finally manages to get the thing cocked, using two hands, and Book reaches over to guide the muzzle away so that it's not pointed at him.
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't want to point that at people you just started calling by their first name.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
Samuel levels the pistol at the door and, just as he snaps the trigger, Rachel enters, pulls up short in some dismay to find her son has a gun pointed at her. Samuel blanches and Book winces, knowing there's heavy weather ahead.

Samuel quickly hands the pistol back to Book, who holsters it:
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait for me downstairs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Samuel quickly exits, and Rachel angrily advances on Book.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not the gun. Don't you understand... It's you. What you stand for.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(and)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is not for Samuel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Book looks at her thoughtfully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel softens a bit:
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, it has nothing to do with you personally.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
He hands her the holstered gun and the loose bullets.
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put it up someplace Samuel can't get it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
A beat, then Rachel, takes the pistol and starts to go. Book stops her:
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Friends?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel glances back at him, smiles and nods. And...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN – LAPP FARMHOUSE – NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Book's holstered gun and bullets at center table. Eli sits on one side, a chastened Samuel on the other. Rachel looks on from the b.g.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli knows that this is as important a dialogue as he will ever have with his grandson: at issue is one of the central pillars of the Amish way.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The gun – that gun of the hand – is for the taking of human life. Would you kill another man? Eh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
Samuel stares at it, not meeting his grandfather's eyes. Eli leans forward, extends his hands ceremonially.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you take into your hands, you take into your heart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
A beat, then Samuel musters some defiance.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would only kill a bad man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMUEL>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only a bad man. I see. And you know these bad men on sight? You are able to look into their hearts and see this badness?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<SAMUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can see what they do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMUEL>
<DIRECTION>
Now he meets Eli's eyes:
</DIRECTION>
<SAMUEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have seen it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMUEL>
<DIRECTION>
Eli expels a deep sigh; then:
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And having seen, you would become one of them?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(intent... gesturing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you see...? The hand leads the arm leads the shoulder leads the head... leads the heart. The one goes into the other into the other into the other... And you have changed, and gone amongst them...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
He breaks off, bows his head for a moment. Then he fixes the boy with a stern eye and, driving he heel of his palm firmly into the tabletop with enormous intensity:
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate, saith the Lord!"
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<ELI>
<DIRECTION>
(indicating pistol;

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Corinthians 6:17)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"And touch not the unclean thing!"
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
His intensity tinged with righteous anger, he is hugely impressive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WASHHOUSE – NEAR KITCHEN – NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Book stands near the door to the kitchen, and has heard most or all of Eli's words. He turns, and painfully makes his way into the washhouse, moving quietly, hoping no one will come out from the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BARN – LAPP FARM – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Samuel harnesses up the family mare, and backs her into the traces of the buggy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOOK'S BEDROOM – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Book stands at the window in a worn robe. Below, through the window, we can see Samuel and Eli in the barnyard. A beat, then Book crosses impatiently back to his bed, sits down, picks up a dog-earred copy of The American Dairyman. There's a stack of well-thumbed farm magazines and copies of The Budget (the Amish newspaper) on the bedside table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a knock. Rachel enters carrying a pile of clothing. She smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enjoying your reading?

She passes the clothes to Book.
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your husband's?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
She continues, cheerfully.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should tell you these do not have buttons.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quaint? Can't imagine why.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles.

<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's the nearest telephone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I'd want a public phone.

</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel's face clouds.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... the store at Saltzburg...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(then briskly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going this morning.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know what he said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can go with Eli. He's taking Samuel to school. But you'll have to hurry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel turns to leave when Book calls her back.
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rachel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to look at him. It's the first time he's used her name.
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FARMHOUSE – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli calls impatiently from the buggy. Samuel sits beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hurry up now, John Book!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel washing dishes turns on hearing Book enter. She laughs out loud at the sight of him in his Amish gear, and rightly so – the pants are highwater, the hat low-rise, the jacket ill-fitting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Book looks self-conscious, even a little sheepish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside another SHOUT from Eli.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd better go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Book looks embarrassed.
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My... eh... gun?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
The smile fades from Rachel's face as she reaches up into a cupboard. She passes the gun in its holster to Book. He fastens it about him. The contradiction of an "Armed Amishman" increases the awkwardness between them. Book turns his back to her and checks the weapon. He turns back to her smiling in an odd way.
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The... bullets?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. The bullets.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
She takes them out of a disused coffee jar, passes them to Book.
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
(attempting a joke)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not much good without them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUGGY – COUNTRY ROAD – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Samuel sits between Eli and Book. Both men stare straight ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli looks particularly stern. It's pretty clear he doesn't like this Englishman wearing the clothes of his faith.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AMISH ONE-TEACHER-SCHOOL – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With awave Samuel runs into the schoolyard to join his friends. A teacher begins ringing a bell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STORE – SALTZBURG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Book on the telephone waiting for his call to be answered. He looks about him – several Amish and Dithers mingle in the shop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Book-has gotten a coke from a machine, seems a bit self- conscious shout it sips at it surreptitiously... A voice comes on the line; it's that of Book's partner.
</DIRECTION>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
A silence.

A beat as Book considers that.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I hear you. I'll stay in touch.

<DIRECTION>
(and)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you at, anyway?

</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
Book allows himself a small smile, regarding his Amish image reflected in the window of the store.
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where I'm at is maybe 1890.

</BOOK>

He hangs up. A beat, then he stares toward the door of the store.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BARN – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Book works on his car. The battery has gone flat and he's trying to charge it up by running wires to a battery mounted under the front seat of the Lapp buggy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli stands at the barn door staring at him, again the disapproving look.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you are well enough to do that thing, you can do work for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
Book is genuinely apologetic.
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe milking.

</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOOK'S ROOM – LAPP FARM – NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where Book lies asleep. A beat, then Eli comes in carrying a lamp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pauses a moment to peer at the sleeping figure with undisguised anticipation. Then he gives him a jarring thump:
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
<DIRECTION>
(briskly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Veck oufl. Time for milking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
Book comes groggily awake as Eli exits. He gropes for his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSERT WATCHFACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It reads 4:30 a.m.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO BOOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he stares at it in disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BARN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the milk herd of half dozen or so cows ambles in with Samuel prodding them along, headed for the milking stalls. Book looks on in the lamplight, nonplused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAMUEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where he's pitching hay into the cow's feed-troughs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOK, ELI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where the old man is showing Book how to milk a cow by hand. We see Rachel watching from the milkhouse door (steam from scalding milk cans rising behind her).
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good, firm twist and pull, eh?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(and)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Now you try it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
Book gives him a look, takes over the milking stool. The cow shoots him a rather skeptical look over her shoulder. Book bends to his task.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
(grimly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not one this big.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
Eli unexpectedly finds this hilarious, cackles, gives Book a comradely, man-of-the-world thump on the shoulder that jars him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he moves off. Book bends to his task, and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE – RACHEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grinning, giggling, covering her mouth with one hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he pours a pail full of milk into a large, stainless steel milk can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BARN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the milk herd is released back into the pasture. Book crosses into the f.g., stares OFF SCREEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOK'S POV – HORIZON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And dawnfire etching the hilltops. The BELLHOUSE behind the house, the sun reflecting from the heavy bell beneath its small roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO BOOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something in him can't help but respond to the beauty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat, then he blows on his hands, rubs them briskly together against the morning chill, and turns back to the barn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LAPP FARMHOUSE – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is later in the morning. Rachel comes out onto the porch, tosses a pan of dirty dishwater off onto the grass, looks toward the barn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE – THE BARN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli and Book standing in one of the open doorways, looking in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE BARN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE FAVORING Luke, one of Eli's team of fine mules as Samuel opens the stall gate. The beast is skittish, obviously afflicted with something of a behavioral problem.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But he allows Samuel to lead him out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOK, ELI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Samuel brings Luke out. Eli is now harnessing the other mule of the team to a large manure-spreader. But as Luke nears Book, his eyes widen and he shies, almost hauling Samuel off his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
(alarmed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Careful, son –
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
Book moves to Samuel's aid; a gesture which proves a serious mistake. Luke erupts into a SCREAMING, bucking cyclone. Samuel – who no doubt has been here before – dives nimbly for cover as a flying hoof nearly takes Book's head off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Eli hustles into the fray, pushing Book aside as he BELLOWS belligerently in German at the rearing animal. Finally he gives Luke a swat upside the head that seems, somehow, to have the effect of quieting the beast instantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Samuel gives the shaken Book a look:
</DIRECTION>
<SAMUEL>

	That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.

Eli leads the pacified mule back to the traces, grunting at Book.

EXT. FIELD NEAR FARMHOUSE – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Book collects the pieces of the birdhouse which his car knocked down the day of his attempted departure. He pauses as a figure approaches. We recognize Daniel Hochstetler, Rachel's would-be suitor. He heads for Book with an outgoing smile and outstretched hand. Here's a likable man who likes people.

	You bet. you take care of yourself.

</HOCHSTETLER>
<DIRECTION>
Hochstetler heads for the house. Book stares after him with some interest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Rachel emerges from the house to greet him. She also catches sight of Book and she pauses, a shadow of confusion crossing her expression for an instant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Hochstetler doesn't miss it either.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she gives her suitor a genuine smile of welcome.

HOG PENS

Book, having gathered up the pieces of the bird house, is headed toward the outbuildings, passing by hog pens. He glances toward the house:

HIS POV – THE BACK PORCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where Rachel and Hochstetler are sitting in a porch swing, sharing a pitcher of lemonade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO BOOK

EXT. / INT. BARN – NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Rachel, lamp in hand, walks up to the barn. She looks in to find Book tinkering with the battery hookup to the Lapp buggy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He glances up as she enters:
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
As she sets her lamp down near the one he's using.
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When will you be going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not long... A few days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
Another beat as Rachel watches him... Book, checking out the battery power, hits the radio – and suddenly from the Twentieth Century comes the sound of one of its major inventions – rock and roll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It fills the barn, but Book turns up the volume a click more even and, eyeing Rachel, starts moving with the beat. It's his culture, coming through loud and clear, as incongruous as it all might seem with the tough Philly cop decked out in Amish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel can't help but laugh... Sensing her response, Book sweeps her up and they boogie in the lamplight, Rachel alternately protesting and laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You like it... Don't you?

Rachel, confused, protests:

	No... You just stop –

But she doesn't really want to. Book grins:

As Book and Rachel's dancing comes to a sudden halt. Both turn, look at Eli. Rachel regards him level-eyed, without discernible alarm. Book, looking a bit sheepish, goes over, turns off the radio, as:

INT. SCHAEFFER'S OFFICE – NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter sits, Schaeffer prowls... slowly, letting silences grow before he strikes again with another softly-snarled question or statement.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHAEFFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know where he is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHAEFFER>
<CARTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wrong.

</SCHAEFFER>
<CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
(cool)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
Schaeffer snaps around, glares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHAEFFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You admit you're lying?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHAEFFER>
<CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I admit I don't know where he is.

	You're the first one he'll contact.

<CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
(sighing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's got my number.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARTER>
<DIRECTION>
Schaeffer stops, stands in front of Carter, takes a deep breath... suddenly smiles. And is abruptly (as he is capable of being) the man of charm and gentlemanly reason. He even CHUCKLES as he begins:
</DIRECTION>
<SCHAEFFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's funny. I know he's hiding somewhere with the Amish, I know it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a quick glance at Carter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you imagine John Book at a prayer meeting? Our John Book?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHAEFFER>
<DIRECTION>
Schaeffer CHUCKLES again, looks hopefully again at Carter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Carter looks back, stony-eyed. Schaeffer makes another abrupt shift in form... but still speaks softly.
</DIRECTION>
<SCHAEFFER>

	Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton.

As Book pauses by the barn door, glances over his shoulder.

<DIRECTION>
HIS POV – BUGGY

<DIRECTION>
With trace horse harnessed... Samuel and Eli loading provisions into the buggy, standing down by the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO BOOK – INT. / EXT. BARN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he goes into the barn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Book approaches Luke's stall warily... and as he does so the temperamental mule, reacting to form, starts to skitter, his hooves CRACKING against the walls of the stall. Book flinches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Book starts to talk gently to the animal:
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, you nasty son of a bitch, we're going to be friends whether you like it or not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
Then, summoning his resolve, he carefully opens the stall gate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Luke eyes him balefully, Book reaches into his pocket, brings out some lumps of sugar.
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See... Sugar. You like sugar, don't you for Christ's sake?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, keeping a mistrustful eye on Book, Luke condescends to eat. Book nods with satisfaction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel has entered the barn, is watching Book with a puzzled expression.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...
	</DIALOGUE>

Book turns, grins with some pride of accomplishment!

	But I hope you have a lot of sugar.

(then, going)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RACHEL>
<DIRECTION>
Just then Luke skitters impatiently... Book gives him a nervous look; one last tentative pat as Luke eyes him skeptically, then closes the stall gate and turns to go:
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Later.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
And we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ZOOK FARM – LANCASTER COUNTY – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BIG SHOT... it's early morning as the Amish buggies are arriving at the Zook farm for a barn-raising.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the b.g. we can see big stacks of lumber all around the construction site where a couple of dozen men have begun raising the main supports on the already laid foundation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elsewhere, long tables have been set up and women are spreading them with cloths, setting out big tanks of hot coffee and cold lemonade for the men,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LAPP BUGGY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Eli, Book, Rachel and Samuel step down, Book eyes the construction site.
</DIRECTION>
<ELI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait here 'til I find a gang you can work with.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELI>
<DIRECTION>
He goes. Book glances around as even more buggies arrive and more workmen and their families climb out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eli appears with Hochstetler in tow. Hochstetler's broad face breaks into a grin:
</DIRECTION>
<HOCHSTETLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Book! Good to see you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOCHSTETLER>
<DIRECTION>
He pumps Book's hand with his usual vigor, smiling a greeting and pleasantry to Rachel. She looks on, amused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hochstetler gives Rachel a look, and we realize that his showing up just now to appropriate Book was no happenstance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Book realizes it as well.
</DIRECTION>
<HOCHSTETLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eli says you're a carpenter, Book.

</HOCHSTETLER>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>

<HOCHSTETLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No matter. Come with me. We can always use a good carpenter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOCHSTETLER>
<DIRECTION>
With that he throws a huge arm around Book's shoulder and ushers him away. Rachel calls after them:

<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good luck.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty much.

Hochstetler nods with satisfaction:

<HOCHSTETLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. Then you can go home.

</HOCHSTETLER>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the morning progresses:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Book and Hochstetler sawing and augering out heavy timbers on big sawhorses. There's an unmistakable atmosphere of competition between the two men, which doesn't go entirely unnoticed by the half-dozen or so other young men on the gang.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...or, indeed, by Rachel; in fact, she seems – without leaning on it too heavily – to be measuring the two men as the morning progresses, and she occasionally passes within proximity of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Eli and a couple of other elders prowling the job with sheaves of hand-drawn sketches under their arms, supervising the construction. All around them the structure is rising with remarkable rapidity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Rachel, where she's helping the women set out the huge noon meal. Other women are sitting on benches in the b.g., knitting or doing quiltwork.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Samuel, where he's banging away with a hammer, with a group of boys his own age. Elsewhere we see little girls "botching" (a hand-clapping game played to German rhymes).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...The very elderly; sitting on the grass or in wheelchairs in the sunlight, looking on – the old men kibitzing in German, the women gossiping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Until...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BIG SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Of the barn-raising with the noon sun high overhead... at least a hundred and fifty men are swarming over and about the barn framework...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...some aid the rafters, some hauling lumber to the job, others sawing, hammering, drilling, joining, planing and what-all... so many that the barn seems almost to be rearing up before our very eyes. And there isn't a power tool in sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WOMEN'S AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Rachel crosses near the benches... we can see other women eyeing her, whispering among themselves, some tittering. Rachel ignores them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She joins the stoutly amiable Mrs. Yoder from the funeral sequence earlier. The older woman is emptying a big pan of fried chicken into serving platters. She smiles, obviously liking Rachel.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_YODER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone has an idea about you and the English.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_YODER>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All of them charitable, I'm sure.

</RACHEL>
<MRS_YODER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hardly any of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_YODER>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE – THE ROOFBEAM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Book and Hochstetler astride the roofbeam studs, holding them together prior to nailing them to the roof-beam. They are, therefore, crotch to the mast and facing one another, way out at the far end of the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, as Hochstetler raises his hammer, the studs start to part, threatening to de-ball the both of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hochstetler drops his hammer, grabs both sides of the roof with incredible brute strength, and, literally, pulls it back together.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Book stares at Hochstetler with nothing short of awe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hochstetler, straining and grinning, looks to Book:
</DIRECTION>
<HOCHSTETLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nail it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOCHSTETLER>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
And he does nail it while Hochstetler, grinning and holding, looks on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BIG SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The barn is done, the workmen climbing down from the rafters. It's late afternoon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON BOOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hesitates. His face is pale and covered with sweat. The exertion of the day has taken its toll. He's in danger of fainting and is some forty feet above the ground. But he's determined it won't happen, determined that he won't fall, nor will he humiliate himself by calling for help. Hochstetler guesses the situation. He moves beside Book, claps an arm about him, says nothing, doesn't even look at Book. From below, someone TELLS them to hurry up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hochstetler shouts:
</DIRECTION>
<HOCHSTETLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We admire our work!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HOCHSTETLER>
<DIRECTION>
The moment passes for Book, and he's okay. Hochstetler removes his supporting arm. Book looks him in the eye, nods his appreciation almost imperceptibly. Hochstetler wants no thanks, and Book knows it. Hochstetler gives him a resounding SLAP on the back, and starts climbing down. Book follows.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. ZOOK FARM – LANCASTER COUNTY – EVENING

<DIRECTION>
The gathering has congregated to hear Bishop Tschantz offer up a blessing on the new barn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CONGREGATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PANNING the faces as they listen to the heavy German words rolling out over the still evening air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Book stands a little to one side of the Amish. The prayers he cannot share with them. Rachel is aware of this, feels something of his emotion. She looks toward him, then she too closes her eyes and drifts away from him, into the soothing prayer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

Book stands outside, listening to the NIGHT SOUNDS. He turns, walks up toward the porch.

Book takes a seat in a chair, SIGHS, looks toward the night sky.

There is a SOUND, but it's a moment before he turns his eyes toward the door.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that, Sam?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
The boy hesitates, holds for a time, then suddenly darts across to Book, wraps his arms around him, hugs him tightly... then breaks away, turns and runs hack into the house, leaving the door open behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE – BOOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking after the boy, genuinely moved. After a moment, he speaks softly:
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Same to you, Sam.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
After another moment, he gets up, moves to close the door that Samuel has left open behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE – BOOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the lighted/shadowed area outside the door. He comes to the door, starts to close it, then hesitates, looks into see where the light is coming from. He looks down the corridor. The light is obviously coming from the kitchen. He speaks softly:
</DIRECTION>
<BOOK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. Book steps inside, pulls the door shut behind him, moves down-the corridor toward the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LAPP WASHHOUSE – NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where Rachel, dressed only in a plain cotton camisole, is pouring a pail of steaming water into a tub.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She replaces the pail on the stove, turns and slips out of her camisole. Naked, she folds the garment across the back of a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she pauses, containing a startled intake of breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RACHEL'S POV – FRYING PAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gleaming bottom of a large copper skillet hanging over the stove with other cookware, we can see Book's image reflected there, framed in the kitchen doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel hesitates for a moment – and in that moment she makes a choice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly she turns, to face him, without shame, meeting his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And for a moment she attempts something: a look, a flash of eve... a lovely, heartbreakingly innocent effort to become, for an instant, a woman of Book's world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he stands in the doorway, willing himself to leave, unable to make it happen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And suddenly the moment has passed. Rachel lowers her eyes, picks up the camisole, covers herself with it without putting it on, looks away.
</DIRECTION>

A beat, then Book approaches from behind her. A moment, as she senses his presence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Book watches as Rachel begins to gather the eggs, placing them in the fold of her apron.

<DIRECTION>
When he speaks, he speaks softly, and she pauses in her work.

A beat, then a large produce truck roars past them. It's all Book can do to keep from flinching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel stares straight ahead. Book glances at her.

Rachel gives him a look, and... gives the reins a flick – the race is on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RACE MONTAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hochstetler has a couple of older folk on board, together with his young sister – at first they're not aware of the race, until Daniel can contain his excitement no longer and gives his horse a couple of whoops. The buggies are neck and neck, and the older people are not protesting loudly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's all Book can do to refrain from grabbing the reins off Rachel, but she's something of a horsewoman and finally she gains the edge and pulls ahead of Hochstetler, to the cheers of Samuel and Book.

EXT. SALZBURGSTORE – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a Saturday afternoon in the tourist season, and they're everywhere – taking shots of anything Amish. There's a ROWDY YOUNG ELEMENT amongst them who are making their presence fast, and generally making a nuisance of themselves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Book and Rachel get out of the buggy. Samuel stays inside; the crowds make him nervous. A huge tourist bus billowing smoke pulls up nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel enters the store, but before Book can follow he's stopped by a TOURIST LADY with an instamatic camera... She waggles the camera at him...

	Lady, if you take my picture, I'll rip your brassiere off and strangle you with it.

The Tourist Lady stares at him in stunned disbelief, her grin frozen on her face. Then she begins to scuttle back from whence she came.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STORE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel is browsing among the stocked shelves in the company of a young Amish woman, Ellie Beiler. Rachel is carrying Ellie's tiny baby, and the infant is getting as much attention as the shopping.

Book is standing at a wall pay phone in the b.g. We TIGHTEN to him, and...

A beat, then we hear the FILTERED VOICE of the Philadelphia Police Department switchboard:

	I'm sorry. Last night Sergeant Carter was killed in the line of duty...
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Book hangs up. His breathing is thrown out by the shock of the news and he takes a couple of deep breaths to regain control. He hesitates, unsure of his next move. He makes to move away, then he turns back, finds more coins and dials a second number.

</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
Book hangs up the phone and the dead CLICK registers on Schaeffer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Book has gripped the phone so tightly that it takes a second to unclench his fist. Then it takes something else to resist his first impulse, which is to smash out at something... Training. Get it under control. Deal rationally with the situation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He straightens his jacket, wipes the sweat/tears from his eyes, turns and walks stiffly out of the Saltzburg General Store.

INT. BUGGY – MAIN STREET – SALTZBURG – DAY

Book, as Rachel eyes him. She has noticed his changed mood, but doesn't ask about it. He stares straight ahead, oblivious to the surroundings of the street, now crawling with tourists and traffic.

EXT. NARROW SIDE STREET – SALTZBURG – DAY

The buggy turns into the side street. Some hundred yards ahead another buggy is stopped in the middle of the road – several youths gathered about it. A pickup truck is stopped, facing the buggy.

Rachel is at first puzzled, then makes a small face, looks at Book.

Rachel puts a restraining hand on Book's arm.
</DIRECTION>
<RACHEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do nothing. This happens from time to time.

She senses him about to get out, grips his arm tightly.

EXT. HOCHSTETLER'S BUGGY – DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hochstetler and his family sit, impassive, ignoring various jeers and taunts from the English lads – various jokes about them being dirty etc. One jabs an ice cream cone into Hochstetler's forehead, which leaves a curious white circle on his forehead. Another fools about with the horse causing it to shy. A third notices the slow, sure, approach of John Book.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUTH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here comes another one!
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUTH>

Book stops, his path blocked by the third youth. The youth flicks off Book's hat.

	Pick up the hat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOOK>
<DIRECTION>
The youth momentarily unsure – something about Book's tone of voice. The youth does pick up the hat, crumples it, stamps on it, and puts it back at a crazy angle on Book's head. A pause, then Book explodes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The kid never knew what hit him or where it came from, he hits the road surface already unconscious. A second youth grabs Book from behind. A mistake. Book is smashing into him, spatters of blood from his nose flying in all directions. He's hitting too hard, too often. It's Schaeffer he's hitting. Hochstetler is pulling him away, Rachel is there too. A crowd is gathering, but as suddenly as it began it's over. Book shakes Hochstetler off him, straightens his hat, and in a kind of daze, begins walking past the scene in the direction of the Lapp farm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The youths are picking up their wounded, helping them back to their truck, aided by none other than Hochstetler. An OLD LOCAL addresses Rachel.

He has offended her, immediately knows it, but can't bring himself to make an instant apology. But he's chewing on it when she takes the moment unto herself. She pulls herself up, speaks with great dignity:

	I could never love a man who was so... little.

He looks at her, sad-eyed, his anger ebbing and gone, realizing that he'll never meet a finer woman... never even get close to such a one. He appears to start to speak, but then does not.
</DIRECTION>

She turns, moves away a few steps, stops, looks back at him. she holds for a moment, blinking tears, then speaks with some difficulty, emotion welling in her words.

Fergie at the door to the upper barn, moving very cautiously, gun up. He eases around the doorpost, looks within.

INT. BARN – ANGLE PAST BOOK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beyond Book, now at the top of the ladder, we see Fergie easing into the barn. Book pulls himself up, crawls behind the wall of the mule stalls, opens gate, eases in beside Luke, urgently whispering and patting the animal to calm him. He gets to the animal's head, crouches, strokes Luke's nose. The mule's huge flanks quiver, his nostril's and eyes widen, but he makes no untoward sound. Book closes the gate.
</DIRECTION>

BACK TO FERGIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He comes on warily, muzzle first, eyes darting.

DOLLYING WITH him as he reaches the first mule's stall, opens the gate. An edgy mule turns, eyes him, shuffles nervously. Fergie backs off, moves on.

<DIRECTION>
As he approaches Luke's stall, reaches for the gate-latch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BOOK – FLASH CUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the gate swings open, Book shouts and gives Luke a whack on the back. The mule's pent-up nerves and feral energy explode in an horrendous SCREAM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FERGIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bowled backwards by the rearing animal as the gate flies open, involuntarily FIRING, suddenly finding himself under the lethal hooves of a twelve-hundred pound beast. Staggering backwards, he SCREAMS, FIRES again, the load striking the mule in its heaving chest as a flailing hoof smashes into Fergie's head and the other hoof snaps his shotgun in half like a matchstick.

As he starts to move even further back, he nudges into a rope fastened to the wall behind him, He looks at it, looks up.

<DIRECTION>
HIS POV – THE ROPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It runs from where it is fastened to the wall straight up to the center roofbeam of the barn to a trolley fixed to a track that runs the length of the roofbeam. Attached to this trolley is a big hayfork (Paul Krantz has one), U-shaped, sharply- pointed at each end of the U. the points hanging toward the floor. The thing weighs about eighty pounds, and is suspended in place by the rope anchored at the wall next to Book.

Moving out toward the center of the barn, almost under the suspended hay fork. He stops short, listens. Then, either spotting a moving shadow or hearing a SOUND, he FIRES. His shot rattles off the side of a manure spreader. He SHOUTS:

Samuel, at the top of the barnyard, stops at the SOUND OF THE SHOT, wide-eyed. He listens for an-instant, starts a step toward the barn, then stops again, looks to a large bell suspended in a cupola by one of the outbuildings. He moves quickly to the bell, seizes the rope, pulls. The bell CLANGS loudly, Sonorously.
</DIRECTION>

Samuel RINGING the bell. The bell rope is short, and so is Samuel and his feet go off the ground with every swing of the rockerarm.

He hangs on grimly, his black hat clinging to the back of his head, his face set against the tears that move down his cheeks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCHAEFFER

Comes hesitantly down the path toward the barn, looking toward the sound of the bell, but also looking back in glances toward the house to make sure Rachel and Eli stay where they are. He still can't see Samuel.

Beyond Samuel, well out in the fields of the Stoltzfus farm, Stotlzfus and others – including Hochstetler and his brothers – are baling the first cutting of June hay.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the operation has come to a halt. All are looking in toward the Lapp farm, hearing the RINGING OF THE BELL (the Amish cry for help), wondering, hesitating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But now, as we watch, led by Hochstetler, they start in toward Samuel.
</DIRECTION>

<SCHAEFFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut that out!

</SCHAEFFER>
<DIRECTION>
Samuel looks at him, keeps on pulling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schaeffer quickly crosses to him, grabs him by the back of the neck, tries to pull him off the bell rope. Samuel hangs on grimly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Schaeffer yanks hard, succeeds in yanking Samuel free, shoves him roughly aside. Then Schaeffer turns, FIRES a shotgun blast into the top of the bellrope. It still hangs by several threads, so he FIRES again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rope drops to the ground. Schaeffer reloads, turns to look at Samuel, just getting to his feet. A moment... when Schaeffer, recognizing Samuel as the Amish kid who saw McElroy kill Zenovich, perhaps thinks of disposing of the witness right then and there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But a glance toward the oncoming Amish gives him pause. He SNARLS at Sam:
</DIRECTION>
<SCHAEFFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get down to the house and stay there!

Samuel gets to his feet, turns, trots off.

He stands below in a cowpen, using the cows for cover. The cows stare balefully at him. A large goat nuzzles him, hooks at him with its horns. Book waits, watches.

He turns now to a door at the back of the pen. He un-hooks it, pulls it open, moves inside.

ANOTHER ANGLE – BOOK

<DIRECTION>
He is now in a small passageway giving on to the entrance to a nearly-empty silo. Above the entrance, a ladder (interior) rises to the top of the structure.
</DIRECTION>

Book looks in, and up. We should get the impression that Book's been here before, expects what he sees.

Forty feet up, a patch of blue sky through an open hatch.
</DIRECTION>

Very carefully he shoves the cowpen door (which opens outward into the cowpen). It begins to swing very slowly open. Book immediately turns, darts back into the silo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MCELROY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Turning slowly toward the cowpen... then FIRES twice as his eye catches the motion of the swinging door. His shots blow half a row of Eli's precious tools off an adjacent wall. McElroy reloads, starts across toward the door.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rachel holds another beat as she stares at the old man helplessly, then she rushes to where she hid Book's gun, takes it down... her trembling hands take the bullets out of the coffee jar. She drops several as she tries to figure out how to open the chamber to load it.

Bullets are already CLATTERING to the floor from her trembling fingers as she raises her eyes to Eli's.

A long beat as Rachel looks at him... Finally her fingers release the pistol and it CLATTERS to the floor. She closes her eyes.
</DIRECTION>

Samuel, who has gotten up, moved to a window, watches Eli and Rachel silently.

Startled, REACTING. He sets his feet, leans back against the back wall of the ladder well, brings the shotgun up, puts the muzzle against the kickboard, clicks off the safety.

<DIRECTION>
Quietly:

<SCHAEFFER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Move! Or you die right here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCHAEFFER>
<DIRECTION>
Book's right hand snakes out, grabs Schaeffer by the gunhand wrist, twists viciously, Schaeffer SCREAMS in pain, the gun falls out of his hand, he starts to his knees under the force of Book's grip.

Schaeffer staggers against Hochstetler, who – partly to keep him from falling, and partly (it appears) to congratulate him on his surrender – wraps one brawny arm around Schaeffer's shoulders, gives him a short approving nod... holds Schaeffer as:

He eases down beside Samuel. They both stare into the pond.

Sam grins. Book takes him in his arms, holds him.
