Melissa, sparkling, beautiful, surrounded by people, in intense conversation with a bunch of downtown types.

<MELISSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--Oh, please, you think professional women mentor one another? You think there's some mutually supportive empathetic touch-feely network of kindly pie- bakers? --Those bitches hate each other! Quick, who was the worst boss you ever had? A woman, right?! We can't delegate, we can't command -- I mean, there's a reason we're not generals--!

<DIRECTION>
THE LITTLE WHITE PILL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EDDIE'S BUILDING - STAIRWELL - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a former tenement, fourth-floor walk-up. Eddie trudges up the old stairs, the tiny tiles worn away in spots, the Victorian moldings disfigured from a hundred and twenty years of paint.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie is suddenly seized by a racking cough -- a horrible smoker's cough that makes him double over. He sounds like he's 80 years old. He finally gets it under control, gets a glimpse of himself in the storefront window. He looks bad, and he knows he looks bad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches into his pocket. THE PILL sits teasingly in the palm of his hand, looking up at him.

</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
There seems to be more definition, more dimension, a little more light -- he can see more clearly. The SOUND drops out for a moment; he can see VALERIE'S FACE, mouth contorted, continuing to heap the abuse, but there's something in her eyes that's not mean... something anxious.He looks at her with a sudden keen intelligence. And sympathy.

	Cal Berkeley has her oral history. I'd start there. Her son is still alive. You could Google him. Sons of famous people always want to dish dirt about their parents. You'd get something no one else has, and you'd've gone the extra mile, a nice little apple for the professor.

EDDIE'S POV - HIS LIVING ROOM

It's the first wide shot we've seen of it, and it hammers home: what a mess. Books scattered across the floor, dirty dishes, broken Venetian blind sashes. The nest of a slob.

INT. EDDIE'S BEDROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie, in his underwear, is sleeping soundly. He stirs, rolls over, cracks open an eye.

Eddie standing on the street, the crowd flowing around him. He turns this way and that, clearly anxious, impatient. Where to go? What to do to kill the time?

<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - DAY - THREE SHOTS:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1. Eddie orders a PRETZEL from a food cart. He is having to dig into his pockets to come up with the change. The VENDOR becomes so impatient he won't give him the pretzel, and serves another customer first. Eddie looks at HIS CELL PHONE. Makes sure it's on. No call.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
2. Eddie sits on a stoop, slowly nibbling on his pretzel, his eye glued to his phone. No call.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
3. Eddie tosses the finished pretzel's wrapper and SHAKES HIS PHONE in frustration. A RING! Eddie jumps up, fumbles with his phone just as a passing male WALL STREET SHARK pulls out his phone and answers. The ring wasn't for Eddie.

Leaving the door open, Vern turns around and motions at Eddie with his left hand to come in. The place is all mismatched antique furniture -- the possessions of someone who collected once, with enthusiasm, but who's letting it all go to hell. Vern sits, keeping his injured arm elevated.

</EDDIE>
<VERN>

He arrives at Vernon's door. He takes out the keys Vern gave him, but he doesn't need them. The DOOR is AJAR.

INT. VERN'S APARTMENT - DAY - EDDIE'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Eddie pushes the door open, he can see Vernon sitting, quite normally, on the couch. As he enters the room, though, he sees that the place has been RANSACKED. Destroyed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie wheels back to ask Vern what the fuck. And then sees it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERN'S FACE -CLOSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the center of his forehead is a neat little BULLET HOLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDDIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is no tough guy, and sweat springs to his brow. He starts shaking... then, seized with horror that they might still be in here, he edges to the bedroom. We hear THE POUNDING OF HIS HEART as he peeks in...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EDDIE'S POV - VERN'S BEDROOM

It's been ransacked, too. Torn to shreds, bureau drawers opened and dumped, pillows ripped open with knives. But no one is there.

Eddie's shaking hand can barely hold the phone.

Eddie, cleverly wearing kitchen gloves, is now furiously tearing through the rubble the thieves have left behind, the scattered clothes, under the bed...

Eddie pokes quickly through the medicine cabinet -- nothing but Tylenol.

<DIRECTION>
INT. VERN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie sits on the couch with (dead) Vern, staring at him, as if a corpse could give up a secret. He looks down at VERN'S BREAKFAST CONTAINER.

Eddie's eye falls on VERN'S STOVE. Unlike the rest of the kitchen area, it's pristine. Unspattered. Eddie jumps up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VERN'S STOVE - CLOSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie opens it. The inside is as clean as the outside. We HEAR SIRENS now -- the cops are finally coming, and Eddie must rush. Eddie pulls out
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BROILER - CLOSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taped to the inside is A LARGE BROWN PADDED ENVELOPE. Slowly, Eddie pulls out the package, reaches into it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDDIE'S HANDS - CLOSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is holding about TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS in cash. But that's not all. He reaches in again... there's something else inside... Eddie's hand pulls out a LITTLE BLACK ADDRESS BOOK. But there's still something else.. he reaches in again. And now Eddie's hand pulls out A PLASTIC CONTAINER WITH AN AIR- LOCK SEAL... he pries the seal off... Inside are FIVE HUNDRED OF THE LITTLE WHITE PILLS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie HEARS THE THUD OF APPROACHING FEET, voices. Making a decision, he quickly tucks the envelope into his jacket, jumps down from the chair... JUST AS A COP pushes through the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sees Eddie, spins, POINTS HIS GUN right at him.

Eddie tries not to look panicked. The cop looks up, taking in the entrance of THREE newly arrested HIGH CLASS HOOKERS.

They are young. They are blond. They are wearing very short skirts and fuck-me heels. The cop eyes them appreciatively.

Eddie sounds almost regretful.

<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but I now see that writing, as a profession, is for marginalized whiners not fit for anything else.

Sutton thinks Eddie's kidding. He laughs nervously.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I mean it, look at the life. Incarceration, loneliness, burrowing down into your own psyche, increasingly insulated from any truth, because you're not in the currents of the world any more, you're rattling around inside the cage of your brain, self- cannibalizing...

	Oh, if you're good, there's some remuneration, eventually, after paperbacks, but at best your career'll be oozing along like a snail, a few thousand more copies, whoop-dee-doo, you're "developing a readership," -- for what?

	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
The two men stare at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<GENNADY>

Gennady barely glances at the papers Eddie pushes in front of him and snorts, half amused, before pushing them back.

<GENNADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, you take this... you mine. You don't pay, you know what we do? We cut you around the waist, peel your skin, pull it up over your head and tie knot in it. And you don't die from that. You suffocate.

The martini is put down on the table. We tilt up to CARL VAN LOON, a young 50, no less vital and intense than the hungriest 27-year-old shark on the make. But he affects geniality. He sits; the middle-aged man with him, PIERCE, does the same.

	Look, there's no time for human judgement anymore. You see a chance, you blink, and it's gone.

<DIRECTION>
Eddie and Van Loon regard each other. Finally, Van Loon speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<VAN_LOON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know who you are, Eddie, or what your game is, but I'm sure of one thing: you don't work in this business. I'm up to my ass in investment guys, and you don't have their half-cocky, half-terrified line of bullshit. Which is not to say I like yours any better.

He picks up a file, hands it to Eddie.

<VAN_LOON>
<DIRECTION>

Eddie snaps the file shut, hands Van Loon back his pen flashlight.

	Well -- you're upmarket energy -- what do you want with these little solar/windmill/hippie outfits?

Van Loon's gaze is expressionless.

<EDDIE>

He eyes Van Loon, who is sitting up straighter. Eddie's hit a nerve. He smiels, whistles.

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa, whoa. This must be some big- ass merger you're contemplating.

</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
A flicker in Van Loon's eyes. Bullseye.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>

	And there's really only one company with enough bling to justify a merger with Van Loon Associates...

<EDDIE>

	Carl, it's just rationalization.

</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
He says it like it's the simplest thing in the world. Which, to a person on MDT, it is.

Van Loon grinds his teeth. Wanting to talk about it, but too skittish.

Eddie is walking down the plush corridor with an ATTRACTIVE MIDDLE-AGED LATIN WOMAN we saw at the artist's loft... Now it's just FLASHES --skimming stones of consciousness-A WINE CORK being popped. A PLATE OF MUSSELS swimming in wine sauce. Rumpled SHEETS. And then...A BLUR OF MOTION -- bodies, a swirl of riotous color --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FRENZY OF SHOTS: A CAB STOPPING. A GARGOYLE ON A BUILDING. A DOG LEASH ABANDONED IN A PUDDLE. No rhyme, no reason, just image, image, image...

And then blackness.

Eddie dials the last number. Instantly, there is a RING. We RACK FOCUS TO-The MAN in the TAN COAT, sitting a discreet distance from Eddie. His phone is ringing. Eddie turns white.

The man takes out his cell phone and answers.

The man suddenly looks up. Locks eyes with Eddie. Knows that he knows. Eddie leaps up, begins to run. The man leaps up and follows.

Eddie runs desperately, as fast as a person off MDT possibly can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He still has the limp from his blackout escapade, too. He can't run fast.

Tan Coat is gaining. Eddie collides with pedestrians, steps on street sunglass displays, sends a saxophonist sprawling.

EDDIE'S POV - A HUGE TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is barrelling, unstoppably, right towards him--!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDDIE is frozen. The TRUCK SWERVES, up on the curb. Tan Coat must dive out of the way, knocking down pedestrians like bowling pins, as the TRUCK hits a STREETLIGHT, mangling it -- then is WHACKED -- twice -- by TWO CABS piling up behind it. When Tan Coat extracts himself from the pile of prone pedestrians, his last glimpse is of-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDDIE - DOWN THE BLOCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
disappearing down into a Subway entrance. Swallowed by a crowd.

Not one person in it could possibly be Melissa. Eddie sighs. Turns to go.

	Eddie...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FEMALE_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie turns back. There, sitting at a booth, is a thick- waisted, short-haired brunette middle-aged woman, wearing a large, shapeless sweater. Eddie had looked right at her... and not recognized her. She bears no relationship to the siren Melissa of his memories. Eddie tries to hide the shock on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Melissa...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to her, sits. Yes, it's the same person, but dramatically, tragically changed. Her face is puffy, her pallor blotchy. There are lines under her eyes and around her mouth, lines brought on by more than the passage of a few years.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie tries to conceal his shock.

Melissa snorts as if to say, typical.

	Well, when he told me about this amazing new drug... I was like, down the hatch. And it was amazing. I read Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe in 45 minutes and understood it. My work rate increased... just, insanely, overnight. My boss started to hate me -- they offered me his job. And then I got scared.

	Why?

	And...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<MELISSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got sick. Headaches, throwing up... I went back to Vernon to see if I maybe shouldn't take another hit, or half a hit, and then he told me about... about the people who were dying. One guy didn't die, but he's a vegetable, his mother has to sponge him down every day...

	Well, I didn't take more. And I didn't die. But after a while I found I couldn't concentrate on anything for longer than ten minutes. I missed deadlines. I got lazy... and slow... put on weight... the magazine let me go. My husband checked out. Sex? Get out of here.

Eddie leaves with Melissa. He is controlling his tears -- barely.

Lindy bolts from the cab just as TAN COAT puts his hand on the opposite door. She takes off into Central Park. And he's after her like a shot.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

Lindy veers off the path, through the trees, zig-zagging, trying to find a place not to be seen.

TAN COAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zig-zags too, not far behind her.

<LINDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Help! Help!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDY>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead, miraculously, A COP ON HORSEBACK. He steps the horse toward her. She races over and presses her body against the side of the horse.

She's so panicked and out of breath she can barely speak.

The cop seems to be paying attention, then suddenly GRUNTS and TWITCHES, his eyes flutter, glaze... and HE TOPPLES OFF HIS HORSE to the ground... ...revealing TAN COAT, on the other side of the horse. The BLADE in his hand is bloody. LINDY runs.... tries to lose herself in a WEDDING PARTY... comes to a section of huge, decorative BOULDERS and ROCKS. Dives behind one of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead, she can see the outdoor ICE SKATERS, couples, families, enjoying the ice. It seems surreal. Several yards behind her is TAN COAT, looking behind every tree, every trash bin. Lindy picks up the phone, keeping her voice low, although she's hyperventilating.

EXT. CENTRAL PARK - DAY

Tan Coat is perhaps five yards behind Lindy and getting closer. But she's not crying any more. She's looking at-THE ICE SKATING RINK, and the skaters, whirling across the ice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LINDY'S
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
eyes flash. She knows what to do. Suddenly, she BOLTS from her hiding place behind the rock, tearing down the hill as fast as she can. Tan Coat is behind her like a shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE ICE SKATING RINK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lindy races down the hill, pushing past the line of people, and onto the ice... Tan Coat is clearly desperate --he doesn't give a shit who sees him chasing her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a flash, he's on the ice after Lindy, running and sliding. People collide with him, he pushes skaters aside, sending them sprawling... Just as he's closing in on Lindy...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lindy wheels around, grabs a SIX YEAR OLD GIRL under the arms, and HOISTS HER INTO THE AIR, swinging her legs at Tan Coat as hard she can! The little girl's skates arc through the air --whoosh! -and connect, CUTTING Tan Coat's FACE. Badly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sinks to his knees, hand to his cheek, welling blood. People scream and scatter. Lindy keeps her wits about her. She runs, sliding across the ice, and leaping the fence, with surprising grace. She's gone.
</DIRECTION>

They look at each other, a look of understanding.

INT. W HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY

Eddie takes Lindy's hands, sits her on the bed.

<GENNADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I think guarantee.

	Carl Van Loon and Hank Atwood remained unaware that soon, I would be in a witness lineup as a possible murderer.

Eddie is making a presentation to the Van Loon Associates -- and a skeptical-looking OLDER GUY -- HANK ATWOOD.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...well, a unified front between Van Loon and Atwood would be lethally effective, and not a moment too soon.. SyCorps, Andine and others are jockeying for the same industrial concessions in Mexico that both our companies are secretly sniffing out...

<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, the governmental bribe structure is, in itself, corrupt, so of course information about its inner workings, like anything, can be bought. And there are other barbarians waving cash at the gates. I have a list here, in descending order of threat...

Eddie returns Van Loon's look coolly, implying that it really might be in Van Loon's best interest to trust him.

	Well, given the scale of my contribution, it can't be anything lese than forty. Let's say forty- five.

	Done. Forty five thousand dollars.

Eddie is being shown the apartment by a thirty-something female REALTOR. The apartment is still under construction -- brand new -- and enormous, with a wall of floor-to-ceiling windows in the living room showing off spectacular views.

<DIRECTION>
Eddie has to look away from her, biting his lip. He can't show her any sign of sticker shock. The face he turns back to her is composed, even blase. He shrugs -- no problem!

We see an almost sexual excitement dance in her eyes.

Eddie stands, waiting, his two security guys lurking 10 steps behind. GENNADY appears, now with TWO RUSSIAN THUGS of his own. This is new, and Eddie wasn't expecting it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gennady's security guys eye Eddie's security guys, and vice versa. Gennady is wearing a suit and looks much more sophisticated. Eddie hands Gennady a small envelope. Gennady takes it. In his eyes is a penetrating intelligence.

Gennady's eyebrow goes up. Gennady's security guys reach into their jackets. So do Eddie's guys. Gennady's eyes flick over the situation, motion to his guys to keep still. Gennady laughs, an unpleasant sound.

	I don't think your Forbes 400 new financial friends would appreciate the details of your little dilemma with the police?

With a huge, angry scar slashed across his cheek. Eddie and Tan Coat look at each other. A steely moment of recognition.

Eddie sits at his huge new steel dining table, the evil box on the table in front of him, head in his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(The room is filled with labeled boxes he has never had a chance to unpack.) The TV is on in the background. It's a financial channel. We see MRS. HANK ATWOOD is giving a statement.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_HANK_ATWOOD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is absolutely no truth to the rumor of this merger. None whatsoever. My husband is having some tests, this is a difficult time, and I would appreciate your directing further questions to our attorney...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_HANK_ATWOOD>
<DIRECTION>
She motions at the gentleman next to her. --Who is also Eddie's attorney, MORRIS BRANDT. The one who was so helpful with the police. The one who held his jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bitter amusement in Eddie's eyes. At least he knows. The APARTMENT BUZZER buzzes. Eddie freezes. Looks at the door. It BUZZES again.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.0.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't downstairs security, alerting me to a visitor. It was my inner door. Someone was in the building, ten feet away, right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie walks to his phone, picks it up. Pushes the button, puts it to his ear. It's dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes the "on" button again and again. Nothing. The buzzer BUZZES again. Eddie rushes to the door, opens the COAT CLOSET. In the closet is a state-of-the-art SECURITY MONITOR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gennady and TWO MEN are outside his door! Suddenly the MONITOR goes BLACK. Eddie flicks the switch on the monitor. Nothing. Eddie flicks the switch again. It's dead. Someone, somewhere, has figured out how to disarm it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The buzzer BUZZES again. Eddie backs away from the door. We HEAR Eddie's shallow, panicked breathing. He lunges for his briefcase, pulls out his CELL PHONE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CELL PHONE - CLOSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It reads "No Signal." BAM! The first slam on the door begins. BAM! The second. The door holds, but Eddie begins to back away in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We slowly FADE TO BLACK. And FADE IN ON:

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so... here I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>

And now we pick up Eddie where we left him, standing on the ledge.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew they would kill me, slowly and horribly. But this choice would at least be mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
We now hear the ZZZZZZZZ! of some major power tool drilling at the door, punctuated by more BAMS! -- one way or another they're going to get in. Eddie takes a breath, tries to jump. He can't.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.0.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we're instinctive creatures. We want to live. So, my foggy brain tried to remember... where one tablet of MDT... might be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
We PUSH IN on Eddie's eyes... We are still REWINDING in Eddie's mind... images of where we've seen him keep MDT... nothing... nothing... nothing... We STOP at the SUGARBOWL on Eddie's dining table. Then go forward --no, wait!-rewinding, stopping again on the SUGAR BOWL. Pushing in on the sugar bowl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie spins around, looks back into his apartment, eyes intense.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.) (CONT'D)

	It was possible. And possible was enough.

<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CELESTIAL - EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie is tearing through boxes as the POUNDING and DRILLING become deafening... he rips open a box labeled "Kitchen" - it's full of BOOKS. Mis-labeled. JUMP CUTS as he rips open other boxes... his hands frantically scattering CDs, cutlery, cans of food... The door begins to give. Under the deafening DRILL:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MORE JUMP-CUTS as Eddie hysterically tears the packing paper off of promisingly- shaped objects. --No. A glass. --No. A vase. --YES! The sugar bowl. With sugar still inside! Eddie rummages, frantically, among the sugar cubes as the door gives a few inches, groaning, and we glimpse blurred faces on the other side...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDDIE'S HAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pokes, wildly, among the cubes... pushing them aside, revealing at the bottom of the bowl-
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ONE MDT TABLET looks back up at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yes. It's really there! Eddie grabs it, just as, with a splintering CRASH! -- The door goes down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie steps back, brings the pill up to his mouth... But as he steps, he TRIPS on a SOUP CAN he's scattered... he FALLS backwards... his HAND hits the side of the coffee table...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MDT TABLET goes flying... (slow motion)... as... ...also in slow motion, Gennady and his two thugs smile as they advance into the room... THE MDT TABLET... flies... flies... towards a GRATE in the floor -- a heating vent -- and HITS it... rolling... ... before disappearing forever down the grate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie knows that's it. His life has ended. He sucks in his last breath -- then, with a YELL, he rushes back for the terrace... for his suicide leap...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thug #1 is quicker. Gets to the door first. Eddie will not have the luck to be able to jump. He's trapped between the two Thugs.
</DIRECTION>
<GENNADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you I want more. You don't listen. Maybe you think I'm joking...

	See, I dissolve pill in solution. You shoot it - goes straight into blood and to brain. Works much better.

He pulls the plastic sleeve off the needle. Jabs himself in the arm and injects the cloudy liquid.
</DIRECTION>
<GENNADY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now. Where do you keep yours?
	</DIALOGUE>

Eddie is backed to the wall. Nowhere to go.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm plum out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Gennady just smiles -- that was an unfortunate choice. He gives an order to the Thugs who grab their tools and disappear deeper into the apartment. WE HEAR them starting to tear things up. Gennady and Eddie are alone.
</DIRECTION>
<GENNADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They will find it. Or I will make you tell me. Which is quicker? We see, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENNADY>
<DIRECTION>
He clicks open a BLACK ATTACHE CASE. It is filled with sinister-looking silver instruments, and knives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EDDIE'S STUDY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thug #2 has found, behind a bureau, a SAFE. He calls excitedly, in Russian, to the other room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EDDIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gennady calls back in Russian. Then picks up a particularly delicate, yet sharp-looking KNIFE.
</DIRECTION>
<GENNADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a waste of my time, you know that? I am getting out of this part of the business... starting import-export company. Very exciting stuff. A lot on my plate. I need to learn to delegate...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENNADY>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie is backed up against a table, which is covered with stuff he's scattered, which includes a BUTCHER BLOCK with A KNIFE in it... Gennady starts arranging his instruments.
</DIRECTION>
<GENNADY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First, I will cut skin from you, flay you... you stay alive nice long time... then maybe we cut meat from you, steaks... or maybe softer parts... I get inspiration...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENNADY>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up, smiles, to see the effect his words have on Eddie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON EDDIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Staring back at Gennady, hard, a fuck-you stare. We can't see behind Eddie's back, but we can see the butcher block, and the knife is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GENNADY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
senses something is not right. Looks at Eddie quizzically.
</DIRECTION>
<GENNADY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHAT--
	</DIALOGUE>
</GENNADY>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie brings the knife up as hard as he can, right into Gennady's stomach. Gennady gasps in surprise, chokes, writhes. Eddie drives the knife home, harder, grabbing Gennady's other hand, which lashes at Eddie with the fillet knife...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men fall to the floor in a death-struggle. Eddie exhausted, off MDT, but determined not to let go. Gennady writhes, flails, but doesn't cry out... he's already choking on blood. Eyes shocked, surprised. Eddie turns the fillet knife back on Gennady, slashes at his other arm; blood spurts. But it's not necessary. Gennady's eyes are glazing. His gurgling gets quieter. He's quite dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie lies alongside him, panting, arm grazed and welling blood from where Gennady's filleting knife slashed him, suddenly weak and exhausted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the other room comes the BRRRRRRR! sound of the drill -- the boys, oblivious, are hard at work on the safe. Eddie tries to get up, then falls back.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not much of a triumph, was it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
He's got the shakes... no, more of a convulsion... he sinks back to the floor...
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.0.) (CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I would die here, too.

There is a break in the convulsion. Then another one starts.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only MDT could help me, and the last of it was in this fuck's bloodstream...
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Gennady's BLOOD wells around Gennady's body in a crimson puddle. A puddle that's creeping closer and closer to Eddie's face, which is lying, convulsing, on the floor...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON EDDIE'S EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
between convulsions, suddenly looking. Looking at the blood. It creeps closer to Eddie's face. Eddie is trying to move, trying to push his face closer to the blood... he's there...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now he turns his face down into the blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And begins to lap it up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EDDIE'S STUDY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Thug finally gets the safe open. Inside is only one item - -the TATTOOED SECURITY MAN's SEVERED HAND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And its middle finger has been arranged in a vehement fuck- you. The thugs are not amused.
</DIRECTION>

The thugs are coming down the hall, muttering angrily...

Mouth smeared with blood, Eddie is dragging himself by the elbows, across the room. Footsteps coming. Fast.

They burst into the room, see Gennady dead on the floor. The camera WHIP-PANS around. No Eddie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND THE COUCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie lies, panting. And then it hits. We PUSH IN on Eddie's eyes. He feels it. His old friend. MDT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE THUGS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
look up at a NOISE. Just in time to see Eddie bolting out the front door of the apartment.

They come thundering out -- see a flash of Eddie disappearing INTO--

INT. THE OPEN DOOR OF THE APARTMENT NEXT DOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are in jittery, handheld THUG'S POV shot as they burst back in, barreling by rooms, looking in them, pressing on to more rooms...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN'S SHADOWY SHAPE AHEAD, IN THE KITCHEN -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thug #2 BLASTS his GUN... the MAN crumples, the glass doors behind him EXPLODE...... the MAN goes down...revealing Eddie standing behind him --(he's been holding up his neighbor's body) and, just as this registers -- WHACK! -- Eddie gives THUG #1 a savage shot with a fireplace poker. Thug #1 goes down, unconscious... the gun skitters across the floor...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUG #2 dives, reaches for it. Eddie grabs a piece of the shattered glass and, in a vicious swipe, brings it down on the Thug's hand. But this guy is not a tough Russian motherfucker for nothing. Bleeding profusely, he doesn't let go of the gun... his bloody hand comes up, tries to aim...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie DIVES BACKWARDS, through the broken glass door to the patio. The thug stumbles after him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EDDIE'S NEIGHBOR'S TERRACE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EDDIE'S HAND, still holding glass, CUTS the awning-rope holding up the awning... The awning comes down on the thug, a huge canvas curtain DROPPING between the Thug and Eddie. BLAM! BLAM! Several holes appear in the canvas as the thug tries to shoot Eddie anyway, but Eddie has leapt out of the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUG'S POV - UNDER THE CURTAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he wrestles it off... he sees Eddie, on the ground, prone, just watching him calmly. He starts to smirk. Eddie touches a MATCH to the ground. The FLAME shoots across the floor to the thug, who now realizes he's standing in a puddle, the overturned can of BBQ fluid next to him. In an instant, his LEGS AND PANTS are on fire. Now the man screams. Shoots blindly. But - click! -- is out of bullets. He rushes at Eddie, screaming, on fire, in animal rage. Eddie brings up a wrought-iron patio chair to meet him, catching him squarely in the ribs. He gasps, bends over... looks up at Eddie, beaten...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The face that looks back is without pity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE CELESTIAL - 20 STORIES BELOW, A WIDER TERRACE - DAY

We are looking up at the penthouse. A SHAPE is dropping, fast, towards us -- the shape of a man.

It's here! The man's head EXPLODES against the railing like a pumpkin as the rest of him disappears down, out of sight.

Tan Coat is sitting, stoic and red-eyed in a chair. He senses something. Slowly turns his head and looks.

EDDIE is sitting in the chair next to him. The two men look at each other for a moment. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure you're curious about what's happened to your boss. I certainly am. If my attorney was really working for Mr. Atwood, to save his life, then why is he dead? At what point was the Pony Express supposed to ride in with the life- saving medication?

We see Eddie striding down the corridor, wearing a sharp suit, looking more dignified than we've ever seen him, more adult. The snap and crackle of something new -- power -- is in his step. TWO MALE AIDES flank him. Reuben approaches, falls into step with them.

He shakes Steadman's hand, but Steadman doesn't get up. Odd. In fact Steadman looks uncommonly relaxed, almost slouched in his chair, looking up at Eddie with a subtle gleam in his eye that Eddie doesn't recognize.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, let's get some lunch. I'm starving...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEADMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He heads for the door. Eddie remains still.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Steadman stops, looks back at him.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did I kill that woman?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Steadman looks puzzled that Eddie would ask.
</DIRECTION>
<STEADMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you really want to know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEADMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie thinks. No, he doesn't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS BUILDING - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie and Steadman exit, come down the steps, Eddie looking thrown. He drifts along, half-a-step behind Steadman, deep in thought.
</DIRECTION>
<STEADMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not so bad, is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEADMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie doesn't answer.
</DIRECTION>
<STEADMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't every man on the path to greatness have to tolerate the wind- drag of compromise?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEADMAN>
<DIRECTION>
A black LIMO waits at the curb.
</DIRECTION>
<STEADMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Overall, we'll all be better off... foreign policy, the courts, even the Constitution could stand a little tweaking...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEADMAN>
<DIRECTION>
They descend the last few steps. Steadman opens the limo door for Eddie...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Eddie hesitates. Doesn't get in.
</DIRECTION>
<STEADMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eddie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEADMAN>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<STEADMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CORDIAL)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, "Senator". You first.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEADMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Eddie gestures for him to get in.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<STEADMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right then...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEADMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He gets in. And Eddie CLOSES THE DOOR AFTER HIM. Stands outside the limo, looking back at Steadman through the rolled- down window, his face a cold mask.
</DIRECTION>
<STEADMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, now. Don't underestimate us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEADMAN>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't underestimate your own creation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Steadman looks at him quizically.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, you invented it. What does it do? It puts me 50 steps ahead of you fucks. You think I didn't spend my days on MDT devising a personal defense structure that would scare the shit out of the Israelis--? You think there's not people with a bead on you right now, right in this building? You think this conversation is private?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<STEADMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know the caliber of enemies you'll be making.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEADMAN>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want to push that button? I'll show you my silos if you show me yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<STEADMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll run out. You'll die.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEADMAN>
<EDDIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or I'll think of something. Isn't that what MDT does? Makes you think of something? Might even tell me how to get off it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
A flicker in Steadman's eyes. Anger.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if I just ask the drug... how to tell the drug... how to fuck itself? I mean, isn't it like the 8-ball?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
Steadman raises his hand to the driver and the limo pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It always answers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDDIE>
<DIRECTION>
As the limo recedes into the distance, Eddie finally exhales.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And only then do we see it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's scared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
