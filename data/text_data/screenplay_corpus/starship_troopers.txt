is beautiful, just 18, and quite pleased with herself because Johnny Rico is clearly infatuated with her.
</DIRECTION>
<RASCZAK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The end of another school year, and for me no doubt another failure... Rico, pay attention !
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASCZAK>
<DIRECTION>
The teacher JEAN RASCZAK, 38, a rugged veteran who proudly displays his missing hand, scowls at Johnny, bemused.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, Mr. Rasczak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
But as soon as Rasczak turns back to the class, Johnny begins to sketch a cartoon on his desk's touch screen.
</DIRECTION>
<RASCZAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here in History and Moral Philosophy we've explored the decline of Democracy when social scientists brought the world to the brink of chaos, and how the veterans took control and imposed a stability that has lasted for generations since... You know these facts but have I taught you anything of value ? You. Why are only citizens allowed to vote ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASCZAK>
<DIRECTION>
Rasczak points at LANNY, 17, with his stump .
</DIRECTION>
<LANNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a reward... what the Federation gives you for doing Federal Service.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Rasczak is crestfallen, makes a big show of patience.
</DIRECTION>
<RASCZAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Something given has no value ! Haven't I taught you dimwits anything ? I guess they ought to revoke my teaching credential...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASCZAK>
<DIRECTION>
Laughter. Johnny's cartoon, meanwhile, is taking shape: Johnny and Carmen flying round planet Venus in a space ship.
</DIRECTION>
<RASCZAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you vote, you're exercising political authority. You're using force. And force, my friends, is violence, the supreme authority from which all other authority derives.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASCZAK>
<DIRECTION>
CARL JENKINS, 18, a superintelligent geek, jumps in.
</DIRECTION>
<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gee, we always thought you were the supreme authority, Mr. Rasczak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARL>
<DIRECTION>
Laughter. Rasczak grins.
</DIRECTION>
<RASCZAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In my classroom, you bet. Whether it's exerted by ten or ten billion, political authority is violence by degree. The people we call citizens have earned the right to wield it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASCZAK>
<DIRECTION>
DIZZY FLORES, 18, athletic, pretty, no nonsense, chimes in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIZZY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My mother always says that violence never solves anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DIZZY>
<RASCZAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really ? I wonder what the city fathers of Hiroshima would have to say about that. You.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASCZAK>
<DIRECTION>
Rasczak points at Carmen.
</DIRECTION>
<CARMEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They probably wouldn't say anything. Hiroshima was destroyed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARMEN>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny presses ï¿½"SEND" on his desk, and the cartoon appears across the way on Carmen's screen.
</DIRECTION>
<RASCZAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Correct. Naked force has settled more issues in history than any other factor. The contrary opinion 'violence never solves anything' is wishful thinking at its worst.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASCZAK>
<DIRECTION>
While Rasczak looks away, Carmen throws Johnny her wonderful smile, and Johnny's gone, checked out, flying round Venus.
</DIRECTION>
<RASCZAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People who forget that always pay... They pay with their lives and their freedom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASCZAK>
<DIRECTION>
Dizzy notices the dreamy look on Johnny's face. So does Rasczak. He points at him with his stump, snaps Johnny to.
</DIRECTION>
<RASCZAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You. Tell me the moral difference, if any, between the citizen and the civilian ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASCZAK>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The difference lies in the field of civic virtue. A citizen accepts personal responsibility for the safety of the body politic, of which he is a member, defending it, if need be, with his life. The civilian does not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<RASCZAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The exact words of the text. But do you understand it ? Do you believe it ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASCZAK>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<RASCZAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course you don't. I doubt if any of you here would recognize 'civic virtue' if it bit you in the ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RASCZAK>
<DIRECTION>
A bell rings. Rasczak shrugs, indifferent.
</DIRECTION>
<RASCZAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's it. Have a nice life.

</CARMEN>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw, c'mon, it's just a bug.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>
<BIOLOGY_TEACHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a bug, eh ? We humans like to think we are Nature's finest achievement. I'm afraid it isn't true. This Arkellian Sand Beetle is superior in many ways. It has fewer moving parts, can reproduce itself in vast numbers, and unboud by concerns of ego and mortality, makes the perfect selfless member of society.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIOLOGY_TEACHER>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better put your goggles on.

</JOHNNY>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny slices the abdomen open with asurgical laser. Green fluid sprays from the slit. Carmen turns away looking ill.

<BIOLOGY_TEACHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Our galaxy is teaming with insect life. We have identified over two billion species so far. Human, life, it would seem, is the anomaly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIOLOGY_TEACHER>
<CARMEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But we 're intelligent. Human minds have invented art, mathematics and interstellar travel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARMEN>
<BIOLOGY_TEACHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	True, we know of no insect society that has produced a Shakespeare, an Einstein or a Cherynkov, but before you let that go to your head, take the example of the Arachnids, a highly organized, highly evolved insect society.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIOLOGY_TEACHER>
<DIRECTION>
She points to an insect evolution chart that starts with a common ant and ends with a two meter tall ARACHNID WARRIOR.
</DIRECTION>
<BIOLOGY_TEACHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They are relatively stupid by human standards. Workers have an IQ of 12, warriors around 35 , and yet the Arachnids have colonized planets. Over a million years of evolution, Nature has provided the Arachnids with the biological means to hurl their spore into space.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BIOLOGY_TEACHER>

Johnny applies a spreader and jacks the insects abdominal cavity open with aresounding crack. Bug guts gush out.

	Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.

	It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.

</CARMEN>
<DIRECTION>
Now the brain bug comes for her. She sees the palp unfold, the thorn-like spike coming toward her. Carmen is no longer looking for escape. All she wants to do is die.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, every bug in the chamber stops as though to listen. Carmen hears it. A HIGH-PITCHED SQUEAL, getting louder. Johnny enters the chamber alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The warriors move toward him. He holds up a NUKE, source of the high-pitched tone. The ready light flashes. The Brain Bug emits a series of harsh clicks. The warriors freeze.

</DIRECTION>
<JOHNNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Weapon !
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNNY>

<CARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you're right, Carmen. We've got one of their brains now. Pretty soon we'll know how they think, and then we'll know how to beat them. One day it'll be over, and everyone will forget that this was the moment. This is when it turned. And it wasn't the mighty Fleet, it wasn't any fancy new weapon, it was a cap trooper named Zim who captured a brain...
