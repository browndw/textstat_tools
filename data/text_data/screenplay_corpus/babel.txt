<DIRECTION>
He aims at the rock and pulls the trigger without holding the rifle properly. It is clear that he doesn't know how to fire a weapon, and the shot cracks loudly. The rifle kicks and hits him roughly in the shoulder. The bullet flies far wide of the rock. The women laugh nervously.

Susan holds out her hand and takes Richard's, as a sign of reconciliation. He holds hers and caresses it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Susan gets comfortable to try to sleep. She closes her eyes when suddenly something smashes the window and Susan collapses forward.

Richard turns to look at the punctured glass and then Susan.

In an indoor volleyball court with bleachers, several Japanese girls play volleyball. They all compete intensely for the point. There is excitement, but everything occurs quietly.

A player jumps and spikes the ball. Chieko (16), tall, beautiful, with strands of hair painted purple, volleys the ball back up. It reaches one of her teammates who sets up another to spike it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chieko's team wins the point. The referee, instead of whistling, lifts up a red flag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The players congratulate each other silently, in sign language. The only sound we can here is the parents' clapping as they watch the game from the stands.

The coach walks onto the court. He holds her to calm her down and then takes her away. Despite Chieko's violent reaction, everything is still silent.

</TEAMMATE_1>

INT. EVE'S -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chieko sits on one of the restaurant's benches. Before her is a new group of young men. Mitsu and Chieko exchange a look. Provocatively, Chieko crosses her legs slowly revealing her pussy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the young men seems to notice, and is stunned. Chieko smiles and does it again. He watches Chieko again and discretely turns to one of his friends to tell him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chieko turns her back to him and faces the bar. She looks over at Mitsu, who shakes her head, amused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beeper rings on Chieko's skirt. She picks it up and reads: "Don't forget your appointment with the dentist. Papa."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She puts the beeper away and turns toward Mitsu.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see you later at my place.

She mischievously turns toward the table where the young man was, and as she gets off the bench she spreads her legs wide open, flashing him shamelessly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She struts out.

<DIRECTION>
EXT. DESERT -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ahmed and Yussef run full speed, herding their goats as they go. Some of them get left behind and Yussef hurries back to them. As they climb a hill, he slips and falls, rolls downhill and drops the rifle, which slides a few meters away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ahmed runs to help him. Yussef gets up, covered in dust and with a scratch on his forehead. Ahmed picks up the rifle.

Abdullah and his children sit at the small table while the women prepare the food. A column of smoke rises from the fire where they are roasting goat meat and toasting bread.

Yamil, the youngest of the daughters, sets some bread on the table. Abdullah takes it, tears some off and starts to eat. He turns to Yussef.

Yussef, nervous, looks up.

Night. An oil lamp in a Nescafe jar lights the house. The family sleeps in the only two rooms in the house. One of them is the parents room, the other the children's.
</DIRECTION>

We hear a goat bleating in the darkness. Abdullah's snoring. Yasira's breathing. The crunching of wood in the night cold.

Neither Yussef, nor Ahmed can sleep. They both look at each other, anxious.

They arrive at a dusty hamlet in the middle of the desert; a few houses, no more than twenty, some adorned with multicolored paper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several crates of soda are stacked up against a makeshift shed built out of yucca fronds. A group of musicians who play Norteña music are setting up their instruments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are various pickup trucks and smuggled cars parked around the hamlet. The guests are wearing their best: fresh shirts, big buckles, almost new boots.

INT. DENTIST'S OFFICE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chieko is sitting in the reception area, waiting her turn. There is a woman with a twelve year-old son listening to a walkman and an old couple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The receptionist (50) will not stop talking to the old lady.
</DIRECTION>
<RECEPTIONIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My niece sells these creams. And just look at my skin now. I'm going to turn fifty-two and look, almost no wrinkles...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RECEPTIONIST>
<DIRECTION>
The woman continues her banal chatter. Chieko observes her grotesque mouth. She then looks at the old man's bored face, the old woman's feigned interest, the mother's annoyed expression, and the boy, who rocks his head to the music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A man walks out and the receptionist gestures at Chieko and points toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DENTIST'S OFFICE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dentist (47) - tall and, unlike the receptionist, with impeccable skin covering his hardened, attractive face - examines Chieko's mouth. His face comes very close to hers as he looks at her, making her nervous. The fat receptionist walks in without knocking.
</DIRECTION>
<RECEPTIONIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here are the sterilized drill bits.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RECEPTIONIST>
<DIRECTION>
The dentist looks up at her. She leaves the drill bits on a table and leaves. The dentist turns back to Chieko and speaks face to face with her so she can read his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DENTIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I-think-you-have-two-cavities-in- your-molars.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENTIST>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles. The dentist moves closer to Chieko's mouth again; she cannot stop looking at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Chieko licks his cheek. He is surprised, but continues his checkup. She licks him again, this time on the lips. He pulls away, flustered.
</DIRECTION>
<DENTIST>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENTIST>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs his hand, puts it on her inner thigh and rubs it against her pubis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He, confused, tries to pull his hand away, but she prevents him from doing so. The scene starts to turn slightly grotesque. After a slight struggle, he pulls his hand back.
</DIRECTION>
<DENTIST>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENTIST>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs his hand again and, again, pulls it toward her pubis. He gets angry and moves back. The fat woman enters again without knocking, sees they are agitated and, without a word, walks out and closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dentist turns toward Chieko.
</DIRECTION>
<DENTIST>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENTIST>
<DIRECTION>
She shakes her head. She is excited, anxious, scared, fragile. He pulls her by her wrist out of the chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DENTIST>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DENTIST>
<DIRECTION>
He walks to the door and opens it. Just before she walks out, Chieko draws out a slight smile, which is almost a grin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOKYO STREETS -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chieko walks down crowded Tokyo streets. She walks with a lost gaze, unsettled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING, TOKYO -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chieko arrives at an upper class apartment complex. The architecture is cutting edge, but impersonal and cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOBBY, TOKYO APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chieko enters the lobby. Beside the doorman are two men dressed in suits: Kenji (31) and Hamano (50). The janitor gestures at Chieko with his chin. The men walk over toward her and cut her off.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you Yasujiro Wataya's daughter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMANO>
<DIRECTION>
Chieko doesn't manage to read his lips. She is silent. The doorman notices the situation, walks out from behind his small desk and shouts at the men.
</DIRECTION>
<DOORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's deaf mute. Face her when you speak so she can read your lips.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Kenji and Hamano are disconcerted. Hamano stands squarely in front of her and speaks slowly, emphasizing every word.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are-you-Yasujiro-Wataya's-daughter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMANO>

She nods.

	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMANO>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls out a pen and a piece of paper from her bag. She scrawls a few lines and hands them over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hamano reads it and turns his face toward hers.
</DIRECTION>
<HAMANO>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, he didn't do anything wrong. We just want to talk to him. Do you know where he is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMANO>
<DIRECTION>
She shrugs her shoulders. Kenji gives her his card. Upon receiving it, Chieko turns to look at him. Their eyes meet and she looks down. She then looks up again, blushing.
</DIRECTION>
<KENJI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell him to call us. And don't be scared, we're not going to do anything bad to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENJI>
<HAMANO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAMANO>
<DIRECTION>
Chieko can't stop staring at Kenji. The two cops leave. As soon as they do, Chieko heads toward the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chieko walks into the apartment. It is a large apartment, elegantly furnished. Although decoration is scant, some hunting trophies stand out: a scimitar-horned Oryx, sheep, and others. There are also photographs of Yasujiro hunting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wall is dedicated to family photos. Among them is a picture of Chieko as a little girl with her father and her mother.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chieko sees a note on the table at the entrance. She puts the policeman's card down and picks up a note from her father that says: "I waited until five and you didn't make it. I've got a meeting and I'll be back late. I left you some soup and some chicken for dinner. Kisses. Papa."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHIEKO'S ROOM -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chieko sits in front of a mute T.V., channel surfing. She stops at a fashion show, then some cartoons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, on a news program, we see the photographs of Ahmed and Yussef. Chieko looks at them for a moment and then changes the channel. She is watching T.V. when a red bulb, set between a yellow bulb and a blue one, starts to light up insistently as the doorbell rings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chieko notices and shuts off the T.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM, CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chieko opens the door and Mitsu walks in. They greet each other with a handshake where they end up touching their index fingers to each other's hearts.
</DIRECTION>
<MITSU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITSU>
<CHIEKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I'm just going to get my bag.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEKO>
<DIRECTION>
Chieko goes to get her bag. Mitsu sees the policeman's card on the entrance table and looks at it. Chieko comes back and Mitsu asks her about it in sign language.
</DIRECTION>
<MITSU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The cops came again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITSU>
<CHIEKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. They hadn't come in nine months. But these were different cops.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEKO>
<MITSU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did they come to ask about your mothers' death?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITSU>
<CHIEKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, but they're probably going to ask my dad about the same things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEKO>
<MITSU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're just not convinced, are they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITSU>
<DIRECTION>
Chieko shakes her head, remains pensive and then smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<CHIEKO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Believe it or not, I liked one of the cops.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHIEKO>
<DIRECTION>
Chieko puts Kenji's card in her purse.
</DIRECTION>
<MITSU>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you put on some panties?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITSU>
<DIRECTION>
Chieko smiles, lifts up her skirt and exposes her naked pubis. Mitsu lifts hers up as well and is also without panties. They laugh and leave the apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. YUSSEF AND AHMED'S HOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dawn. The desert is a rose plain softly lit by the sun's first rays. Yussef and Ahmed are digging a hole with their bare hands. Once they're finished, they clean up around the hole and mark it with three stones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGHWAY, DESERT -- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alarid (40), a federal cop, tall, in an impeccable uniform with numerous rank badges, stands on the highway examining the site of the shot with the old man who was driving.

</DIRECTION>
<ALARID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop right there...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALARID>
<DIRECTION>
The man remains motionless. Alarid follows the prints that lead away from the cartridges. He reaches the mess of goat hoof-prints. He picks up a ball of shit and feels it.
</DIRECTION>
<ALARID>

Chieko turns to look at them, curious. Haruki, the guy with tattoos, exchanges a look with her. Chieko suddenly feels intimidated and looks down.

</KUMIKO>
<DIRECTION>
Haruki seems to understand what they're saying and leans in to whisper something to Takeshi, his brother. They both laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Haruki approaches Chieko and talks to her face to face so she can read his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<HARUKI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your name?

Haruki takes out some ecstasy and gives it to them. Mitsu and Chieko look at each other and down the pills with a gulp of whisky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARK, TOKYO -- LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Half-drunk and rushing from the pills, Chieko, her friends, and Haruki and Takeshi, play on the swings and see-saw. They laugh at almost anything. Haruki and Chieko are on the see-saw and every time Chieko rises, Haruki looks at her bush. Chieko knows this sometimes opens her legs even more so he can look to his heart's content. Hormones float in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mitsu also takes advantage of the occasion. She flirts with Haruki whenever she can. Haruki looks happy to be the object of their attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Takeshi, who has started to make out with one of Chieko's friends, turns to the group and speaks slowly.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY, NIGHTCLUB -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They enter. The music, the light, the crowd, it is almost hallucinatory. For Chieko, it is a silent concert of movement and chaos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She and her friends push their way through the place. Haruki grabs Chieko by the hand, pulls her toward the floor and starts dancing. Chieko looks at the other dancers' rhythm and follows. She slowly manages to follow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other deaf-mutes also dance. Some do better than others, lost in the sea of lights and people.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For Chieko, the dance turns into something hypnotic. She dances with her eyes closed, concentrated on her own rhythm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When she opens her eyes, she sees that Mitsu, a little drunk, is grinding against Haruki, feeling him up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chieko seems annoyed by this and goes to defend her territory. She starts dancing next to Haruki, but she is constantly interrupted by the surrounding crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The struggle between Chieko and Mitsu is a little bit ridiculous. It is finally resolved when Mitsu takes Haruki by the face and starts to kiss him. Chieko doesn't know what to do. Mitsu and Haruki start to make out intensely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Chieko is left standing in the middle of the club, motionless, while her friends dance awkwardly and Mitsu and Haruki are having the time of their lives. Chieko, defeated by her friend, decides to leave. Mitsu spots her out of the corner of her eye and waves goodbye. Chieko smiles back and walks away from her friends as they dance.

Kenji stands and looks at the photographs of Yasujiro hunting all over the world: with a kudu in Africa, a black bear in Kamchatka, Hassan and the Oryx in Morocco.

Chieko comes back with a cup of steaming tea.

The news weighs on Chieko; she looks away. The sounds of Tokyo come in through the living room: its car horns, its voices.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a rush of wind comes in. Chieko sees the balcony doors are open and goes to close them. She then comes back to the living room and sits down, dejected.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenji sits down beside her and leaves the tea on the table. He doesn't know what to do and looks uncomfortable.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenji stands in the middle of the room, waiting. Chieko comes back completely naked. Her skin bristles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks toward him, breathing through her mouth. Kenji is disconcerted when he sees the quiet teenager approach. She walks all the way up to Kenji and when she is about to take another step, he holds her back with both hands.

She doesn't pay attention, breaks free and stands a few inches away from him. She is almost panting. She holds out her hand and caresses Kenji's ear. He stands there, immobile, without taking his eyes off Chieko's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes his hand and puts it on one of her breasts. Kenji strokes her breast and then pulls his hand away. She grabs it again and puts it back on.

He grabs her by her arms and moves her away. She grabs the sleeve of his jacket and pulls him back. She hugs him and suddenly Chieko starts crying, disconsolate.
</DIRECTION>

Kenji, bewildered, first does nothing, but upon seeing Chieko's despair, holds her. She buries her face in his shoulder. Her nakedness becomes increasingly fragile.

When he's finished breaking it he opens his arms and walks toward the police. One of them policemen looks at him through a pair of binoculars. Alarid interrogates him.

INT. ROOM, ANWAR'S HOUSE -- AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Night begins to fall. From the window we can hear the noises of the town: voices, goats bleating, camels moaning, music from a radio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Susan wakes from her slumber and turns to Richard, who is leaning on a wall, tired, sweaty, with his eyes closed.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>

</SUSAN>
<RICHARD>

</RICHARD>
<SUSAN>

</SUSAN>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm not going to leave them and don't you even think about leaving me, because I'll kill you like nobody's killed you before.

She smiles. He caresses her.

<RICHARD>

</SUSAN>

Richard touches between her legs and feels the moisture.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to tell Mike on you, so you never scold him again.

He lifts up her dress, pulls down her underpants and sets the basin under her. She puts her arm around him to pull herself up, but can't move her right arm.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't.
	</DIALOGUE>

While she pees, they kiss painfully. She starts to cry.

Richard hugs her and starts to laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You missed; you got my leg.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
They both laugh, and as they do, the blanket covering Susan's wound slips off. Richard sees her swollen, bruised arm. He touches it.
</DIRECTION>
<RICHARD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does it hurt?

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>

Richard and the vet carry Susan out on a wheelbarrow. It is very difficult to move her. She is clearly in pain and groans quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside the house is the policeman with his Peugeot. Anwar is talking to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richard and the vet carry Susan all the way to the car. Richard stands before the policeman he humiliated earlier.

The policeman nods kindly.
</DIRECTION>

Dozens of girls and boys and a few adults stare at the scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gingerly, Richard, Anwar and the vet lift her into the car and softly lay her on the back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Even so, she screams in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<SUSAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahhh... Ahhh...

INT. CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chieko, naked, sits in an armchair, again submerged in the remote world of her silence. Before her, Kenji observes her nakedness, her sadness, her pained beauty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For a while they remain motionless. She seems to return from the long journey to herself and turns to look at him. Their eyes meet. There are still tears in Chieko's eyes. They hold each other's gaze until Chieko gets up, gets her notebook, scribbles down some words and gives them to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenji reads them and looks at her.
</DIRECTION>
<KENJI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to apologize for anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENJI>
<DIRECTION>
She sits down beside him. They look at each other again for a few, long seconds. Chieko takes his hand, strokes it for a moment, kisses it, sucks one of his fingers and then puts it back in its place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs her notebook and starts writing a long note. It takes her almost a minute to do so. Kenji, nervous because of her proximity, watches her write feverishly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chieko finishes writing, folds the note and hands it to Kenji. Kenji starts unfolding it, but Chieko stops him. She takes it away from him, folds it again and puts it in his breast pocket. She signals for him to read it later.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenji gets up to go. She stands next to him. Her nakedness contrasts with Kenji's toughness. He bows his head to say goodbye and she moves aside for him to pass. Kenji walks past her as she watches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenji reaches the door. He opens it and turns to look at Chieko again, who has been left in the middle of the hall. He bows his head again and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chieko watches him leave and closes her eyes painfully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR, CHIEKO'S BUILDING -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenji rides the elevator down, touched, barely able to contain his emotion. The elevator doors open and he walks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOBBY, TOKYO APARTMENT BUILDING -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenji walks past the doorman.
</DIRECTION>
<KENJI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENJI>
<DIRECTION>
He keeps walking. On the other end of the lobby, at the parking lot entrance, Yasujiro walks in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doorman calls Kenji as he is about to leave.
</DIRECTION>
<DOORMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Officer... officer...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Kenji stops. Beside him is Yasujiro.

<DOORMAN>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the man you were looking for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOORMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Kenji approaches him while the doorman discretely moves away to leave them alone in the lobby.
</DIRECTION>
<KENJI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening, I'm lieutenant Mamiya.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENJI>
<YASUJIRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening, how can I help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YASUJIRO>
<KENJI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, there was an incident and...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENJI>
<DIRECTION>
Yasujiro looks at him attentively. Kenji, still moved by Chieko, looks distracted, confused.
</DIRECTION>
<KENJI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't mean to bother you, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
rifle with the registration
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Kenji looks through his pockets, takes out a small notebook and looks up the missing number.
</DIRECTION>
<KENJI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	UK-9023?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENJI>
<YASUJIRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't remember the license, but I did have a rifle like the one you described.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YASUJIRO>
<KENJI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it true that you gave it to a Mr. Hassan Ibrahim, who lives in southern Morocco?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENJI>
<YASUJIRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hassan Ibrahim?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YASUJIRO>
<KENJI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says he was your guide in a hunt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENJI>
<YASUJIRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hassan? Of course. He was a very good guide and I gave him the rifle. Hassan is a very kind man. Did anything happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YASUJIRO>
<KENJI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There was an attempted murder with that rifle, and the Moroccan police want to confirm it's not off the black market.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENJI>
<YASUJIRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I gave it to him.

</YASUJIRO>
<KENJI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENJI>
<DIRECTION>
Yasujiro remains silent for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<YASUJIRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I legally involved?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YASUJIRO>
<KENJI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not for the moment. You may have to go testify for your friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENJI>
<YASUJIRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I leave now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YASUJIRO>
<KENJI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENJI>
<DIRECTION>
They both bow to say goodbye. Yasujiro walks toward the elevator. Kenji calls out to him.
</DIRECTION>
<KENJI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENJI>
<DIRECTION>
Kenji approaches and Yasujiro awaits, expectant.
</DIRECTION>
<KENJI>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your daughter told me about your wife on the balcony. I'm very sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENJI>
<YASUJIRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What balcony?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YASUJIRO>
<KENJI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About how your wife killed herself by jumping off the balcony.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENJI>
<YASUJIRO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My wife never jumped off a balcony. She shot herself in the head. My daughter was the first to find her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YASUJIRO>
<DIRECTION>
Kenji is left speechless.
</DIRECTION>
<YASUJIRO>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've explained it to the police several times. Don't bother us with that anymore, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</YASUJIRO>
<KENJI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm very sorry sir, we won't bother you anymore. Good night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENJI>
<DIRECTION>
He turns around and leaves the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOKYO STREETS -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenji walks down the streets immersed in his thoughts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BAR -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenji sits in a half-empty bar. He turns to the bartender.
</DIRECTION>
<KENJI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Another whisky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENJI>
<DIRECTION>
The T.V. has been turned on to a Japanese newscast. Kenji takes out Chieko's note, reads it and, as soon as he is done, closes his eyes. He looks around. Everybody seems to be immersed in a world far from his own.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A reporter appears on T.V.
</DIRECTION>
<REPORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Susan Jones, the American woman wounded in an attack in Morocco ten days ago, left the hospital today, heading to the United States...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REPORTER>
<DIRECTION>
Susan appears on screen in a wheelchair pushed by a male nurse and followed by Richard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bartender leans over to Kenji.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want something to eat? I could make you a sandwich.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<KENJI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENJI>
<DIRECTION>
When he looks back at the news, the story has changed. Kenji drinks his whisky parsimoniously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEVATOR, CHIEKO'S BUILDING -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yasujiro rides the elevator up, lost in thought.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BALCONY, CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the balcony, naked, Chieko observes the city stretching before her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yasujiro walks in and encounters his daughter completely naked. There are still traces of Chieko's tears in her eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yasujiro is affected when he sees his daughter like this, but says nothing. He slowly walks toward her. Chieko looks hurt, but whole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Yasujiro stands beside her. They look at each other. Chieko holds out her hand and takes his. Chieko squeezes. She looks at the city and then looks at her father's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He strokes her hair and they both stand on the balcony, with the massive city sprawling under them.
</DIRECTION>
