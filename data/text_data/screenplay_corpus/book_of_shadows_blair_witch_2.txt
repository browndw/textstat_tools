</NICK>
<COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
We see the view from the Camcorder as it's scooped up from the Van floor and brought back up to eye-level again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON NICK'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he waves two fingers at the lens.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bye-bye--
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
--and the Video zaps to black.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH BACK TO - FILM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where Nick can be seen tossing the camcorder into the backseat. Anna catches it, puts it in a back pack and zips it.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>

	What're you doing?

</COTTER>
<NICK>

CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
EXT/INT. THE VAN - TWO HOURS LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doing a relaxed 35 down the narrow ribbon of Route 17. Rural farm country. The weather's turned grey--making all the 19th Century- vintage houses and barns they pass look dismal, if not a little foreboding.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cheery little place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's like traveling back in time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The good old days: toasting marsh- mallows over a burning witch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They never burned witches in this country, they hanged them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever--all I know is the persecution's going to start all over again, they keep pumping out inflammatory bullshit like this fucking movie--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--hey: check that out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead of them, at a crossroads, is a sign:
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome to Burkittsville
	</DIALOGUE>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Thought those all got stolen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess they thought it was safe to put some up again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to slow the Van alongside the sign.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somebody wanna hand me that claw hammer in back--
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
--Nick pushes Cotter's leg back down on the accelerator. The Van jerks past the sign and down the road.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get busted on your own time. We've got a schedule to keep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Cotter just glares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was it every day or just semi- weekly you got your ass kicked as a kid?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<NICK>

(ignoring him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now you can bring the vehicle to a stop: there on the left.

EXT. BURKITTSVILLE UNION CEMETERY - JUST AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The four of them stand there by the sign to the graveyard. Anna searching the gray horizon.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are we here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She e-mailed me yesterday this is where we should meet her.

</ANNA>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's she look like?

</COTTER>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No idea, just talked to her on the 'Net--she's very good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So says her website.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She is--she's helped solve a bunch of murders: Arizona, New Mexico--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--how old?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dunno, probably right up there, based on her resume.

</ANNA>
<COTTER>

	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
Cotter points to
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WOODS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
near the far edge of the cemetery. Standing there is an old, gaunt and particularly Unattractive Woman, staring at them.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terrific--and I was afraid I wasn't going to get laid on this trip.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
The four of them start tromping towards her.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>

</COTTER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, for chrissake, she was an actor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<ANNA>

	No, the kids were actors, the townspeople were real. Her, the Sheriff, the Convenience Store guy--

<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK - B&W
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To the interview with Mary Brown from "Blair Witch Project." The years have apparently not been kind: she looks a good two decades younger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO - THE PRESENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're less than 20 feet now from MARY BROWN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She speaks without expression:
</DIRECTION>
<MARY_BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARY_BROWN>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just came over to say hello.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<MARY_BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's five bucks for signin' something; ten for signin' a Bible; twenty, you want to take a picture with me. Any kind've conversation, that's subject to negotiation.

Heather double-takes.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me?

</HEATHER>
<MARY_BROWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heather. I saw her. Elly Kedward's hands were on her throat, and she was sucking out the girl's insides with her mouth.

<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Been a pleasure meeting you; we need to go now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
He hustles the other three back towards the cemetery.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I take it back--she wasn't an actor. She's a nutjob.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what Josh and Mike said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut-up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
TIME CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cemetery. Everyone spread out looking for:
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Domino? Domini Von Teer...??
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. And then, out of nowhere, seemingly just plunging right out of the earth
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AN ARM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
extends into the air not far from them. Paper-pale and stick-thin, almost skeletal.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Present.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<DIRECTION>
They walk over. See, lying atop a cracked granite marker, a Young Woman who can't be more than 18. Heroin-chic skinny. All in black, including her make-up--uber Goth: DOMINI VON TEER.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Domini?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you doing there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trying to find the energy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Inside the grave?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To stand up--I'm exhausted. Been on the road since yesterday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want a hand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want amphetamines.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<DIRECTION>
Cotter helps her up.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beer and weed is what I've got.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Both. Now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<DIRECTION>
Anna and Heather look at the faded marker Domini's been lying on. It says:
</DIRECTION>
<BOY_KURTH May_28_00>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweet place to take a nap.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Strange girl.

</ANNA>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think so?

</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
As they walk away, Heather sees Mary Brown across the cemetery, staring at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT/INT. THE VAN - LATER - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Snaking its way down the road that wends through the Black Forest Hills.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Domini and her second beer have commandeered the shotgun seat, Nick relegated to a tight squeeze in the back seat. Dead silence. She's slightly unnerving. Finally:
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, I hear you're from New Mexico!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes.

</DOMINI>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her father's Sheriff of Taos County.

</ANNA>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sometimes. Where are we going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ruins of the Rustin Parr house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DOMINI>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"The Voiiiiices made him do it."

<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Witch's voice.

</ANNA>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She wasn't a witch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hear voices all the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<DIRECTION>
That pretty much kills the rest of the conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE VAN - LATER - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Parked at the edge of the woods. Back-packs being hauled out of the rear, camping gear, video equipment.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is all this shit?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're doing dusk-till-dawn taping of all the places where there've been alleged Blair Witch "sightings" --the Parr House, Coffin Rock, Tappy Creek.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See what turns up--which I guarantee will be nothing. Some of the rest of the party are more hopeful--
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--or incredibly fucking naive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, folklore--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--myth--
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--doesn't just pop out of thin air. It spins off of real events. At some point there was a Blair Witch--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--or one huge attack of group hysteria.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
(snide)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Either way, maybe there's a book in it, and they both make a ton of money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(snapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a serious sociological study.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The four of you really have too much spare fucking time on your hands, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what's your excuse for being here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She got paid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DOMINI>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought the movie was bitchin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE WOODS - SOON AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mammoth backpacks strapped on, the five begin walks into the forest.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a sec!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
He spins and runs back towards the Van.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Through the trees, they see Cotter place a pint of bottled water on the roof of the Van. Starts video-ing it as he walks away.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He really is a fucking idiot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DEEPER IN THE WOODS - LATER - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slogging up a 45-degree angled hill. This is not exactly Sir Edmund Hillary and Co.--the five of them already look exhausted.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Didn't we already do this hill?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Nick is staring at three different maps at once as he walks.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</NICK>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Terrific: an hour, we're already lost--
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
--and then a look of trepidation crosses Cotter's face--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Footage from "Blair Witch Project"--panic, as Heather, Josh and Mike realize they've spent all day walking in a circle.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cotter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO - PRESENT
</DIRECTION>

Nick's glaring at him.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look over there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Cotter looks up: less than 500 yards ahead can be seen the ruins of an Old House.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, but--
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--now there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
--Nick is pointing behind him. Cotter looks. From the atop the hill he can see down to the road--and his Van with the water bottle on the roof.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Cool.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE PARR RUINS - SHORTLY AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the backpacks and miscellaneous tonnage is already dumped on the ground. The five of them stretch their legs, massage sore shoulders and lower backs, while sightseeing the remnants of the old house and its environs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cotter, not surprisingly, is taping everything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV CAMCORDER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
a huge bite taken out of one of the walls of the foundation, stone, brick and soil strewn everywhere around it.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the camcorder image starts shaking wildly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO - FILM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cotter seen running full-tilt towards Heather, who's facing one of the interior foundation walls. He's jiggling the camera like he's got St. Vitus dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO - VIDEO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear Cotter doing a passable Heather Donahue impression-- screeching as the shaking video image PUSHES IN right towards Heather Arendt's face.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mike! Miiiiiiike! Noooooo!

Heather pushing the camcorder out of her face.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Check this out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO - CAMCORDER POV:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On one of the foundation's interior walls: a gobbledygook of tiny handprints and strange, angular glyphs.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINI>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look at those marks--just like in the movie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ancient runes--
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--what the fuck's a "rune"?--
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO - FILM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick erasing half the marks with one sweep of his palm.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--chalked just hours ago by ancient adolescents. It's called vandalism.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
All turn. She's pointing to the large, leafy tree with branches stretching everywhere above them.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oak?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. What's it doing here in the middle of the foundation?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Growing. This place burnt down 50 years ago. Trees happen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Nick flips through a voluminous loose-leaf notebook--points out a page to Anna.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look it's right here--from the Blair Witch "Dossier"--the sketch the anthropology students made of their dig when they found the backpack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
The sketch shows a spindly growth in the middle of the foundation, no more than six feet high.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a sapling--this mother's got to be three hundred years old, minimum.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a sketch, Anna--it's not to- scale cartography; the tree was not the kids' focus--
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--do you agree it's that old, Nick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, fine, whatever, yes--it's an old tree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why don't you just cut it down and count the goddamn rings--who cares?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because it means the tree is older than the house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, so?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So whoever built this--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
--Nick rustles through the loose-leaf--
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--brother of Rustin Parr's maternal grandfather, somewhere after 1858--
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--whoever--they built an entire house around a tree. Sticking up right through the living room. Somebody like to explain that to me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The rest of the family was crazy as Rusty Parr.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, c'mon--even you have to admit this is weird.

He reaches down and picks one of the now infamous wooden "stick men" off the ground.

<DIRECTION>
POV - COTTER'S CAMCORDER - CLOSE UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sudden, stunned silence as the camera examines it fore and aft.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then Nick's hands are seen removing the material that secures the Stick Man's "arms" to his "torso." Torso and legs fall to the ground, leaving Nick holding a piece of--

EXT. THE PARR RUINS - DUSK

<DIRECTION>
By flashlight, Cotter's fiddling with five vid-cams on tripods that have already been set up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Domini lies within the foundation walls staring up at the sky. Finishes the last of Cotter's beer and discards the empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not far from there, Heather's already got her simple one-person tent erected.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adjacent, Nick and Anna are wrestling with the nightmare of trying to put up some Barnum & Bailey-size number.

<NICK>

	No offense, sweetheart: fuck you.

	Pardon me, I've had a few things on my mind--like putting this safari together.

</NICK>
<ANNA>

	Like how weirded-out you are with this pregnancy thing.

</ANNA>

	Nice tent.

INT. HEATHER'S TENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather and Cotter jammed in there like Spam, sharing a joint, and watching "Curse of the Blair Witch" on DVD:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Interview Sequence with folklorist CHARLES MOOREHOUSE, explaining the "origins" of the Blair Witch story--Elly Kedward's banishment, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I never could figure about the movie?

</HEATHER>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?

</COTTER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three people: two guys, a girl-- sleeping in the same motel room, the same tent night after night.

	Yeah?

</COTTER>
<HEATHER>

</HEATHER>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Made no sense. Scared out of their minds, and the greatest stress reliever in creation right at their fingertips. Nada.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No sense at all.

INT. NICK AND ANNA'S TENT - SIMULTANEOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It ain't the Ritz, but they did come prepared: air mattresses, big Coleman lanterns, a kerosene heater--and heaps of books and brimming file folders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're sitting up in their respective mummy-style sleeping bags, studying documents, making notes--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--when this high-pitched MOANING can be heard outside the tent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick and Anna looks at each other. Nick grabs one of the lanterns and dashes for the tent door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THE TENT - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shines the light slowly out into the foundation ruins--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--and there's Domini, still lying on her back, staring up, cooing:
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oooh. Oooh.

<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, Domini?

<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DOMINI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You planning on sleeping out there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not planning on sleeping at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<DIRECTION>
She points up into the big oak in the middle of the foundation.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oooh. Oooh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<DIRECTION>
The call comes back to her from the tree: "oooh-oooh."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick sees perched high up on one of the branches: A GREAT HORNED OWL. It's staring down at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I figure I lie here long enough, maybe he'll swoop down and carry me off in his talons.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<DIRECTION>
Nick rolls his eyes and goes back into his tent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COTTER AND HEATHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
are also watching this from their tent.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We should be so lucky.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Butt-ugly owl.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
They duck back into the tent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Owl keeps watching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several beats. And then in the darkness, a rustling sound is heard. A whisper that sounds like:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...see if it's alive--
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK! Then Anna's hand seen--she's just turned on one of the lanterns. Sits up in her sleeping bag. Listens. The sounds have stopped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. She gets out of her bag, grabs the lantern, and goes to the tent flap--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TENT - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--and just as she steps outside--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--something strikes her hand--
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--shit--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
--the lantern goes flying into the dirt--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--and suddenly out of the darkness come flying--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LITTLE HANDS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
wielding small sharpened sticks--or are they tent pegs?--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--and they stab into Anna's belly again and again, accompanied by shrieks of delight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna screams--
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's James?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
ANNA TURNS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and finds she's inside the tent, wrapped tight in her sleeping bag. Staring at Nick, who's propped up on his air mattress with a book and a lantern, staring quizzically back at her.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
(disoriented)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said the name "James."
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls her sleeping bag down, looks at her belly--unmarked, unharmed, bloodless.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baby names?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Nightmare.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

EXT. THE RUINS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Domini is still supine, staring upwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This place is like a regular K-mart of bad vibes, ain't it, pal?

</DOMINI>
<DIRECTION>
The Owl doesn't respond.

a static shot of dark, dark woods. The Voice continues to be heard from somewhere deep in there:

Heather Arendt is up like a shot.

<MAN_S_VOICE>

<DIRECTION>
Mild snort of amusement when she sees the movie's still playing on the DVD. She buttons it off. Starts to lay back down--

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heather????

Heather literally punches Cotter awake.

She clamps her hand over his mouth. Beat. They listen--

<COTTER>

He lunges out of the tent, camera already whirring--

EXT. TENT - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>

--and right into a blinding, light-up-the-night battery of halogen lamps.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>

</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
Halo-ed in the glare of those lights stand
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOUR LARGE TEENAGERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in various states of grunge. They all but scream of STONERS. One of them's got a huge running Beta-Cam on shoulder, another's hefting a DAT recorder and shotgun mic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Cotter from the POV of these guys camera:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV BETA-CAM - VIDEO

<DIRECTION>
Cotter shooting back at them with his puny-by-comparison camcorder, his thermal long-johns halfway down his legs.

She looks up. The Owl's gone.

FADE TO BLACK.

Birds heard in the darkness. And snoring.

Cuddled together, fast asleep.

Domini conked out on the grass, curled in a fetal position.

Ditto Heather, sprawled half-in/half-out of her sleeping bag.

</COTTER>
<NICK>

	Yeah. Got to Coffin Rock, found zip, and came back, ripped off the cameras.

Domini looks at one of the mangled tripods.

<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>

<ANNA>

	Not the only things missing, Nick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Nick turns. Anna's at the tent door holding a pile of empty file folders and two looseleaf notebooks that have somehow been torn clean in half. Now Nick's incensed:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's almost a year's worth of work!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(into the woods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scumbags! Oh, Jesus, Jesus....
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At least you still have the tapes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One set. Everything from midnight on--

</COTTER>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--no, I think they're all in there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<DIRECTION>
She's pointing to the collapsed section of the basement foundation where the original "Blair Witch Project" Tapes were found.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other four stop and stare at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then Cotter goes diving in the hole. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sonovabitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
And emerges with two grimy handfuls of VHS, Beta, and 8mm video tapes.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those ours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Cotter brushes dirt from them; holds them up for inspection.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My handwriting on the face labels.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
And then his excitement switches to confusion. Turns to Domini:
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How'd you know they were--
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DOMINI>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--hunch. Just sort've saw 'em there.

</DOMINI>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My ass--you saw those four fucking baboons put 'em there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cotter, I think she's right. Why would those guys go to all the trouble of stealing the camera and all this other stuff and leave the tapes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They were making a movie--if they were going to steal anything it'd be just the tapes, to see if we had anything they didn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think it was them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, who did then? Blair Witch? Snatching equipment to make her own sequel?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, please keep me fucking informed!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those four guys--it's the only thing that makes sense.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
She looks over at Domini, who says nothing--just stares into the woods.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a goddamn disaster. Let's just pack it up and go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to see the tapes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what do you possibly think you're going to fucking see there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No idea. But if that's all we've got left--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--nothing left to play 'em on, honey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, sorry, right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can be goddamn sure, though, I'm going to be looking at every second of 'em when I get back to Baltimore--I get proof who stole my shit and I call the cops!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're ticketed to fly back from Baltimore, anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me, too.

INT. COTTER'S BUILDING - JUST AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Four of the five of them ride nervously in a huge, ancient elevator that ascends in a series of jerks. Cotter's oblivious.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Used to be a meat-packing plant. Slaughter on the ground floor-- carcasses schlepped up on this thing for dissection and grinding and--

	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DOOR TO COTTER'S LOFT - JUST AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cotter opens the elevator grates, revealing a metal door with a single lock. He fits a key into it
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just one lock in this neighbor- hood?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All I need--
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
--throws the door wide--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--the LOUD BARKING of what sounds like a pack of pit-bulls greets them.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get inside quick, they'll stop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>

<COTTER>

	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COTTER'S LOFT - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shuts the door; the BARKING stops. Everyone's eyes zapping all 360 degrees around them: no dogs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cotter taps a small speaker above the door;
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baltimore's cheapest burglar alarm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
He re-opens the door a crack--the BARKING starts anew. Closes it. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Had the door jimmied a few times. Nobody's yet made it inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
He ushers them into a huge
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOUBLE-STORIED SPACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
easily 30 feet high. Exposed brick walls--massive iron roof beams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And crammed to bursting with bizarre esoterica everywhere:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--carousel horses, huge airplane propellers, a bowsp'rit from an old clipper ship, lawn jockeys, a set of bunkbeds made entirely of wagon wheel parts, bowling balls, cannonballs, pinball machines.

INT. COTTER'S LOFT WORK SPACE - A WHILE LATER - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cotter's running tape through his new video iMac. The rest of them are gathered around the screen in various degrees of discomfort.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look like they've been there for some time. A lot of yawns. Nick's rubbing his temples like somebody's pounding a marimba inside his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SCREEN: they're all watching minute after minute of nothing. Darkness. The outlines of the Parr Foundation. Trees in the back- ground. Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several beats as they continue to watch this stasis. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we get the gist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've looked at half of one tape.

</NICK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For once could you just sit down, shut up, and give something a chance?

</ANNA>
<NICK>

Domini, Heather and Cotter standing grimly in the Waiting Area. Finally, they see Nick exiting a Trauma Room, looking even grimmer.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINI>

	She lost it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<DIRECTION>
Nick nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAUMA ROOM - JUST AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's lying on a OB/Gyn table in a johnnie, clearly sedated, but with a face and eyes still soaked with tears. An E.R. INTERN (Female) is cleaning her up.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<INTERN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any number of reasons--pick one, it's as good as the other.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INTERN>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was out hiking, camping the past two days--that's what did it--I killed it--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<INTERN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--doubtful, Mrs. Leavitt. The main thing to remember is, whatever the reason, it was for the best-- it meant something was wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INTERN>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something was wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<INTERN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, this is not my field of expertise. You seem stabilized, but why take any chances? Let's keep you overnight and have the Staff obstetrician do a follow-up tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INTERN>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
--and then Anna sees what the Intern is writing on her chart:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To see: Boyd Kurth, 5/26/00.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna's eyes go wide.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE HER HEAD
</DIRECTION>

she flashes on the grave marker that Domini laid on in the Burkittsville Cemetery: same name, same date.

Anna yells:

<ANNA>

	Where are my clothes??

</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
EXT/INT. COTTER'S VAN - LATER - NIGHT

They all sit silently as Cotter drives. The now-fully clothed Anna just sits in back like a zombie.

</NICK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--no.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Anna tosses a crumpled ball of paper into Domini's lap. She opens it. It's the top page of Anna's chart. Domini looks at the Intern's jotting "see Boyd Kurth--"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--her head snaps up. Beat.

INT. COTTER'S WORK SPACE LOFT - SIMULTANEOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Domini, Heather and Cotter gathered around his iMac, drinking beer.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something happened to Anna in Burkittsville, in the woods, I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>

</DOMINI>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to it. Without even looking, Domini pulls the shoulder of her shirt down, rubs something on her upper arm. Heather sees it: a good-sized burgundy-colored mark, oblong, vaguely spidery in shape.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm? I dunno. Chafing from the backpack, something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That'd be up on your shoulder, maybe your lower back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I have no idea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<DIRECTION>
And now Cotter's staring at it.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does it hurt?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like hell. Play the goddamn tape.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<DIRECTION>
The first image that pops up is Domini sprawled out on the grass of the Parr Foundation. Deep in REM sleep, her leg jerking like a dog's. Domini sees it--a snort of embarrassed laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NICK AND ANNA'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick bolts awake to the sound of laughter. Looks next to him, Anna's fast asleep. He looks relieved--then clucks to himself when he sees that he's fallen asleep next to her on the big old four- poster with his clothes on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Starts to take off his shirt--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--and then hears the laughter again. Louder. It seems to piss him off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets out of bed, opens the door. Hisses:
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, knock it off, willya?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
But there's nobody there. He walks down the hallway towards the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COTTER'S WORK SPACE - JUST AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick appears on the stairs leading into the work-loft. Sees the three of them huddled over the iMac.

<NICK>

Nick just shakes his head, snorts with disgust. Goes back down the stairs--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - JUST AFTER

</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ almighty--

</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
--he starts to storm back up the stairs to the loft--

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--further down the hallway. Louder. He walks faster towards it.
</DIRECTION>

It's coming from the open door of his and Anna's bedroom. Starts to trot. Louder. Takes the corner into--

INT. THE BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

Anna looks down at herself and lets loose a giggle of astonishment.

	Nothing. I dunno--

</ANNA>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--you should get back into bed.

</NICK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess, yeah.

</ANNA>

She does so. Nick once again tucks her in.

<NICK>

</NICK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>

</HEATHER>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Motion. Stop there. Play it again.

</DOMINI>
<DIRECTION>
Cotter hits PLAY. They're watching tape from a camera that was placed almost to the ground, aimed upwards--
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--there! In the tree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<DIRECTION>
Cotter freezes the image. The tree is so dark and so far in the distance of the shot, he and Heather have to put their eyes right up to the screen to even see it.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatta you got, telescopic vision?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<HEATHER>

She puts her finger right on the screen. Cotter quickly removes it --squints.

	Okay, a blur.

Cotter wearily unlocks the door to his Van.

There's an Owl staring down at him from a tree in Druid Hill Park across the street.

INT. COTTER'S WORK LOFT - LATER - NIGHT

Heather is bringing a cup of hot tea and 40 ounce bottle of Malt Liquor up the stairs. Sees Domini still in front of the iMac, trying to figure out how to work the thing.

</HEATHER>
<DOMINI>

Domini gets up and slumps down on the broken-backed couch in the work-loft.

INT. COTTER'S WORK-LOFT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather has apparently gained a tad enough mastery to run tape through the iMac.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She's playing and replaying a short section of Cotter's camcorder tape where the bunch of them were interacting with the Stoner Film Crew.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She keeps seeing a FLASH on the tape. Between two trees far in the background. But she can't seem to freeze the image inside the flash. It looks vaguely like a MIDDLE-AGED MAN.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does this look like a person stand there to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(no response)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Domini...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
She turns. Sitting on the couch where Domini was is now the very clear presence of
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MIDDLE-AGED MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in a topcoat. He says nothing, just stares straight ahead. There's a horrible wound in his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather is mindboggled--and petrified. She manages to stammer out the word:
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DOMINI>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'd you say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<DIRECTION>
Heather's neck snaps to her right. She's sitting on that same couch with Domini.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes scan the entire loft. There's no one there but the two women.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you alright?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	....I don't know.

</HEATHER>

FADE TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>

Beat. And then in the darkness, a pack of dogs heard BARKING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE UP ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COTTER'S ELEVATOR - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's having trouble getting the key out of the lock. The door is wide open. The recorded pit-bulls bark and bark and bark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COTTER'S WORK - LOFT - SIMULTANEOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The barking bolts Heather and Domini up like a shot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NICK AND ANNA'S BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Likewise Nick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anna doesn't seem to hear it--fast asleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As soon as Nick makes it to the door, the barking stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COTTER'S WORK LOFT - JUST AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick, Domini and Heather are gathered around him like kids on Christmas.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So lemme see it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just let me get my coat off--I had eight cups of coffee, I'm wired for sound here.

</COTTER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got the tape enhanced--and I managed to sleaze a photo blow-up. Jesus, he's gonna kill me when he finds out about the camera.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gimme it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Cotter throws her the 8"x10" blow-up of the frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather looks at it, her face falls.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still looks like a blur, only bigger.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Domini grabs it. Stares at it, puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My friend Sid said it looked like a rope.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
And now Domini's eyes go wide.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus.

<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>

</HEATHER>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It touched me, don't you see it now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<DIRECTION>
She yanks down the shoulder of her shirt: the burgundy-colored mark on her arm has grown larger and more distinct. It seems to have finger-like tendrils spreading out from it.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Its fingers! Here. And here--
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<DIRECTION>
--she yanks down the front of her shirt: there's another burgundy mark there--
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--and here and here and here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls back her hair: there are two more growing on the back of her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DOMINI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know how to stop it! I don't know how to kill it! But it's here right now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOMINI>
<DIRECTION>
Domini's head is in her hands. She's hyperventilating. Heather puts her arms around her.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Slow it down, slow it down, whatever it is, we'll figure it out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DOMINI>

They all look up. Anna's standing in the doorway looking at Domini.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They put their palms in the blood. And then they press them on your skin.

</ANNA>

And Anna walks out of the room.

Domini's lying down, Heather beside her. She's drinking a beer, seems much calmer--though she's got an afghan cinched around her entire body, toes to chin.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>

	You gonna be alright?

Heather gets up, starts for the door. Stops.

<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you afraid's going to happen?

Heather sticks two six packs inside a car. Double thinks. Goes back and grabs two more.

Heather waits in line. She sees that across the street is Druid Hill Park. Stares aimlessly into the woods, chewing on a thumb nail. She looks seriously worried.

	Could I tell him what it's regarding?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	His daughter, for God's sake-- I need to know if he's heard from her this morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Beat on the other line.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...the Sheriff is a widower. They never had any children.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Heather is struck dumb.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	....Ma'am?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm talking to Taos, New Mexico--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<WOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--yes--
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--the Sheriff's Office--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<WOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--yes, Ma'am, can I help you with anything else?--
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--his name's Von Teer! His daughter's named Domini!--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<WOMAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--thank you for calling--
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The line goes dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three of them just stand there, staring at each other, petrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then Anna walks in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad she's dead. She brought the thing that killed my child.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - LATER - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather sits at the table alone, staring at the 8x10 that Cotter made for Domini.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you see here that I can't see, damnit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
She runs a finger down the length of the blur in the branches.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it that scared you so much?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Nick enters, heads for the blotched, '60s vintage Mr. Coffee maker.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Finally got her back to sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nick, what you should do is get her back up and get her to a goddamn doctor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, you don't think I know that? You don't think I've tried? She won't fucking go-- she won't leave this place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's off her fucking rocker--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--I know!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I know. It's...alright. We're all a little--
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--a lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heather.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Hypothetically.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shoot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think....there could've been something up in those woods that Anna--
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--it's not a could've--there was, Nick. And it fucked up Anna, and did something to Domini, and it caused my father to die, and it's here with us in this place now. And I don't have one single idea in hell what's going to happen next, just that it's going to happen to one of us. And then the other. And then the other. It's going to get into our brains.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
And Heather finally loses it and starts weeping--great wracking sobs. Nick's a little awkward at first how to comfort her. Finally just starts lightly massaging her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's explanations. Rational explanations for everything that's happened. We'll drive ourselves crazy if we keep obsessing on supernatural what-ifs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That feels good. Lower--down into my neck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Nick moves his hands down--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--and somehow the two of them are then guiding his hands down into her blouse, onto her breasts--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--and she's moaning, and grabbing hard onto his hair--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--and pulling his whole head down to hers. And their lips and tongues meet, and they're biting each other like animals--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--and his hands are yanking and twisting hard on her breasts, between her legs--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--and she's literally clawing him with her fingernails, drawing blood down the length of his chest--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--until she reaches a burgundy-colored mark right at his belt line with tendrils like fingers--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--SNAP!--it's like someone woke them from a dream. They both look at each other, baffled--what the hell just happened? But it wasn't a dream. Nick's chest is streaming blood; there's blood on Heather's lips--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--matching the color of the mark on Nick's waist, and the one Heather now sees inside her elbow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They both move away from each other, uncomprehending--and scared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NICK AND ANNA'S BEDROOM - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick pacing the floor as Anna lies in bed.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what it is, but there is something happening here, and it's starting to scare the living shit out me, and look, I'm just not going to argue the point anymore--you want to stay here, stay, but I've got to get the fuck out of here, and I'm begging you to come with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I'm going--
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--no, you're not. You love me too much. You don't want to see them kill me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COTTER'S WORK LOFT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cotter's behind the iMac, screening tape millimeter by millimeter, downing one Coke after another. He's so caffed-out, both his body and his voice is shaking.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This could be something right here, do you think it's some- thing, Heather--?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
Heather doesn't even look up. She's just sitting on the broken- backed couch staring at Domini's 8"x10".
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--but that could be just a shadow, I think it's a shadow, it's nothing, Heather, do you think it's nothing--
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
--and he just keeps prattling on oblivious, eyes fixed on the tape moving at a snail's pace in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's about the tree, it's something about the tree.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
She puts it down on a cushion and snatches up the dog-eared copy of the "Blair Witch Dossier." Easily flips to the page Domini showed her: Elly Kedward trussed in the wagon in the woods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flips backwards in the book, looking for something--
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--the goddamn tree, Domini, for chrissake, what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
--and then she stops on the page that shows the anthropology students' sketch of the Parr foundation; the skinny little sapling in the middle--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--then back to the woodcut of Elly Kedward in the woods--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--then back to Domini's photo of the foundation--the huge tree--
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Same trees. They took Elly Kedward out to the same kind of trees.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
(still oblivious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--I look and look in the tree, all I ever see, he's always there watching, that stupid owl, over and over--
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--Cotter, where can I get on-line?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--anywhere, anywhere, all up and live, all the time--fucking owl--
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
Heather slips in front of one of Cotter's PC's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIME CUT TO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather on-line, in the middle of Blair Witch Chat Room, typing:
</DIRECTION>
<WICCA_GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	anybody know where tree is they tied Elly Kedward?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WICCA_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. And then a response.
</DIRECTION>
<COFFIN_ROX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Black Hills

</COFFIN_ROX>
<DIRECTION>
Heather responds, types:
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</WICCA_GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Response:

	<DIALOGUE>
	My two cts? By Rusty Parr's house hadda be that close how else could she whisper into his ear?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREACLE_TREACLE_LITTLE_EILEEN>
<DIRECTION>
Heather stops typing; absorbs this.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cotter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fucking owl!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think it's possible the tree in the Parr foundation is the same one they tied Elly Kedward to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No idea--goddamitt!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
And then suddenly another response appears in the Chat Room:
</DIRECTION>
<COFFIN_ROX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Check BW Cult book, 1809--they have full account
	</DIALOGUE>
</COFFIN_ROX>
<DIRECTION>
Heather grunts. Types back:
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</COFFIN_ROX>
<DIRECTION>
Heather stops typing. To herself:
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy Kurth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heather, does that look like Domini there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
Heather doesn't look up from her screen. Impatient, trying to put pieces that don't fit together.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Down there in the Park.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
Heather looks up. Cotter is looking down through the big room's huge windows; he's waving to someone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather gets up. Slowly peers over the loft railing. Squints.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEATHER'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A stark-naked Domini is standing in Druid Hill Park. Looking up at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DRUID HILL PARK - JUST AFTER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather and Cotter's pace slows drastically as they try and navigate the overgrown pathways inside the Park. The flora is dense below and above--moonlight barely penetrates where they're walking.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Domini...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Cotter puts a finger to her lip. Whispers:
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not the place you want to announce your arrival.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's she going to know where to--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--things got a way of finding you here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
They walk.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's freezing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next time try putting on shoes--
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
--the two of them stop dead in their tracks. Through the thicket ahead of them they can see a clearing. Illuminated by the moon is what appears to be an old
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WOODEN OX CART
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
with SNOW drifted up nearly to the hubs of its wheels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEATHER AND COTTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
are suddenly so cold they can see their breath in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck--??
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs her hand and pulls her through the thicket. They enter
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE CLEARING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the snow is now gone. Where the cart was is now just a stack of rotting cut brush. A clean-up effort someone must have started, then abandoned. Heather and Cotter stare at each other, baffled-- and not a little afraid.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The moon trying to shoot down through all these trees--can make things funky--
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--I saw what I saw.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Me too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The cart they brought Elly Kedward into the woods with--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--into the Black Hills with--200- something miles from here--
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--Domini!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
They both see it at the same time:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A NAKED WHITE BODY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
face down at the base of a tree. Heather races over, kneels down next to it.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Jesus, what happened, are you--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
--and Heather lets out a screech. The face of the body reveals an ELDERLY MALE. Filthy, tongue lolling black out of its mouth. He's been dead for some time.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be it still alive, James?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Heather turns--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PACK OF LITTLE BOYS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
wild-eyed and wielding sticks, RUSH AT HEATHER--
</DIRECTION>
<BOY_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--then finish the job, lads!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY_1>
<DIRECTION>
--Heather screeches again, throws up her arms to protect herself--
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
Heather looks up: Cotter's lying on the ground, holding his bleeding forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck you do that for??
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
Heather looks at her hand. She's clenching a sharp stick in it. The Little Boys are gone. The body of the Dead Man is not.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs his hand, pulls him up. They start running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COTTER'S KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather and Cotter at the table, still out of breath and shaking, as they tell Nick what happened.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--and one of the little boys, his name was James. As in the boy James Kurth--the first child to disappear from the town of Blair after they banished Elly Kedward.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
A look of alarm comes to Nick's face. But he says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I dunno it's anything. It's a name Anna's mentioned--from her dreams.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't handle this anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
He produces a large, thick spliff and torches it up. Big hit, and passes it to Heather, who takes an even bigger one.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much of that stuff you guys been smoking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough to keep sane.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough to make shapes and shadows in the dark into something else.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spare me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, chemicals, fear, sleep- deprivation--and a round-the-clock obsession with the occult--hell've a recipe for a mind-fuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Except we seem about 18 times more together than you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
Heather spit-takes a lung-full of smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd strongly advise you to join us--
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--before you lose your emotional lunch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NICK>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugging)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, what the hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the joint, sucks in mightily--
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Atta boy--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
--and then the whole kitchen seems to explode--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--GLASS and MULLIONS from the big window in the room come hurtling in shards at them--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--and then when the noise finally stops, and the flying debris has all hit the floor, they all look down and see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE PEELING LINOLEUM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HORNED OWL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
broken and bleeding from its header through the window. Spasming, and then dying. Eyes wide, staring up at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No one says a word. They just look at it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COTTER'S WORK-LOFT - LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lot of chairs, but nobody's sitting down. Cotter, Heather and Nick all look like their nerves are fraying down to bare wire.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are being fucked with here, someone or something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Domini.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why in the world would she--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--why in the world would she just fly the coop in the first place?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chrissake: why any of this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think it's time to get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody's going anywhere--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--hell, I don't think I'm ever leaving this place again--
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--one of us, all of us--I have no idea--brought whatever this thing is back here. We're not going to go out there and spread it around like Typhoid Mary. We're gonna figure it out, we're gonna bring a goddamn end to it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Domini's the only logical explanation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not dealing with fucking logic here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Domini, it's not Domini, I don't care--all I know is I'm not dealing with something--anything-- snuffing me in my sleep. I want to do what we did in the woods-- surveillance of this whole place 24/7, with somebody monitoring those cameras every second. There's something, somebody here, I want to see 'em coming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought all your equipment got stolen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All the shit that was worth anything, yes. You'd be amazed, though, what you can get free on the 'net.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
He opens a desk drawer--there must be a dozen little palm corders in there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LOFT - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
What Cotter lacks in other equipment, he makes up for with cable: huge SPOOLS of it--and he's running it from the various tiny vid- cams to a motley bank of monitors he's set up on the kitchen table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HEATHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
duct-tapes one of the little units on the top of a closet door- frame in the hallway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COTTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sees he has an excellent angle on the front door/elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANNA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watches half asleep and befuddled in their bedroom as Nick aims a camera on a jerry-rigged broom-handle tripod.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COTTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
connects the cables in the kitchen--sees Anna and a clear view of the bedroom door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NICK & HEATHER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
collaborate on installing a camera from Cotter's work-loft that provides a view of the dark area under the work-loft. Nick lowers the camera on a rope, while Heather guides and supports the cables attached.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COTTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watches the camera descend on one of the monitors. Satisfied by the view it's giving him, he yells:
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good! Tie it off!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
BACK IN THE WORK-LOFT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick does so. Ties the rope securely around the loft railing. Ties a slip knot in the loose end and lassoes it over one of the iron beams above to keep it from being a hazard. He has to jump to catch the rope as it comes down again from the beam--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--stumbles backwards slightly as he catches it--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--hitting the spindly loft railing--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--which suddenly SNAPS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Nick goes tumbling out into mid-air, the slip-knot in the rope in his hand the only thing keeping him from plummeting 20 feet to the floor below--
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>

COTTER

<DIRECTION>
sees it happen on the monitor.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--Christ!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
He dashes out of the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK IN THE WORK-LOFT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather is trying to lift Nick back up by the rope by sheer physical strength she doesn't have--
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't do it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't! You're making me lose my grip.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm coming! I'm coming!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
And Cotter comes dashing in with a tall metal step ladder.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just hold on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Cotter splays the ladder open, starts clambering up it.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just let it go, I've got you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you nuts--
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--it's less than four feet, just--
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--shit!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Nick loses his grip--starts falling--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--Cotter snatches hold of him as he falls, pinning Nick between the ladder and his torso.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ladder wobbles precariously--
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--don't move, don't even breathe--
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
--and then the ladder finally comes to a stable rest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick is savagely shaken as he slowly climbs down.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesusjesusjesus....
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Ditto Cotter:
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah--please don't do that again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
A giggle is heard from the doorway to the big room. They all look:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANNA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is standing there, laughing with her hand against her mouth like a little child. She sing-songs:
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could see up your dress.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cotter, Heather and Nick watch the monitors on the table in silence. Drinking coffee. They all look majorly exhausted--but none of them look in any immediate danger of falling asleep. Their eyes dart from monitor to monitor, relievedly seeing nothing--except Anna tossing restlessly in bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather sees that Nick is massaging something on his forearm that's making him wince. Without a word, she rolls his sleeve up:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wine-colored mark that looks vaguely like a jagged J.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gothic rune--the letter "S."
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or a blood blister--or a bruise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must be that blue collar life we all lead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
Cotter pulls up his pant leg: two blurry burgundy marks--crescent shapes overlapping each other.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a "j."
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For "James?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goes right along with these two.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls back her hair--where jaw meets neck: two smudgey marks that together look like badly-drawn lowercase "n"s.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put 'em together that's a "k." James Kurth--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--or Lyme Disease or poison sumac, or God knows what-else we could have picked up in the woods.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what we picked up in the woods--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
--and then there's a sharp knock at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All three sets of eyes zoom towards the sound, but no one moves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The knocking grows louder, more insistent. Still, they remain frozen. Frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look at the monitor giving an angle of the door/elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing can be seen--just a dark blur in the door's peephole indicating someone's standing in the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one ever comes here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have to open the door to find out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
The knocking increases, along with muffled shouts of:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE_BEHIND_THE_DOOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cotter...? Cotter...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE_BEHIND_THE_DOOR>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	....I'll....go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
Cotter gets up and slowly walks to the door. The rapping and shouting increasing in volume with each step.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, a deep breath. And then Cotter looks through the peep hole. He sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SID
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
his Techie friend from the Film Lab glowering back at him.
</DIRECTION>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you're in there, you piece of shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not until I get that Beta Cam back! We're both in a world of shit here!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my fucking job, man!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't let you in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
Sid starts knocking again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cotter walks back to the kitchen. Sits down in front of the monitors. Watches as the knocking continues. Finally stops. The expression on Cotter's face never changes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIME CUT TO - THE SAME - SEVERAL HOURS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
So quiet, so tense, they can hear the clocks ticking all over the loft: 4:10a.m.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should check on Anna.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Check the monitor, she's fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's far from "fine."
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're needed here--keep watching--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--f'chrissake, Heather, it's not like the two of us are gonna doze off he leaves for two seconds--
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--I don't trust anybody, not even me, anymore--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--shhhh! #5, there's something up there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
Their eyes all go to the Monitor with the view of Cotter's work loft. Beat. They freeze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A slight WHIRRING--then slow WHOOSHING heard. Movement seen in the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	One of the printers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
Cotter gets up.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. We all go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anna--

</NICK>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--fuck Anna!

<COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, you--
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE WORK LOFT - JUST AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cotter handing a sheaf of print-outs to Heather.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--it's for you. Came through email. How it started printing without a command, though--
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
Heather looks up at them in astonishment; dithered:
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--it's the "Blair Witch Cult"--a copy-- some pages from--one of them on the site must've gotten my message--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't say--it's just these pages.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to make out the ancient, smeared scrawls of this nearly 200 year old book.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(reading)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"taken by the witch as they were marked by her--first Jamie Kurth when the stain appeared on his brow that next summer--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
--the next page is illegible, Heather flips forward:
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"for t'was said he and Jon Edmunds and other boys who found Elly Kedward still on her tree in the snow. Poking her with sticks finding her still living. Taking her bonds and noosing them to her neck, hanging her from her tree until she perished."
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Heather looks up at the others in wide-eyed.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the little boys. Elly Kedward didn't die from "exposure" out there: she was executed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(resumes reading)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Killing Elly Kedward, but not the witch herself, who floated from the mortal husk--"
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Heather looks up; she echoes Domini's words:
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"It's why the witch kills children."
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought all witches were benign and good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not this one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NICK AND ANNA'S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather tries to rouse Anna in bed.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need you to talk to me, talk to me about the dreams--about James, the other boys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't...I don't understand them myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try, please, Anna--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--bad boys, mean boys, cowardly boys--just like Domini.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A coward too. That's why she had to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened to her, where did she go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't know--just that she was afraid--
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--Anna--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Anna winces.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, are you alright?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My eye, is there something in my eye?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Heather looks.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not that I can see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Closer. Lift the lid and look-- it hurts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Heather lifts Anna's eyelid, gets close to her face and looks.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Closer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
And Anna gently guides Heather's face down. Begins stroking it. And the next thing Heather knows, her body is gravitating towards Anna's. She's kissing her, stroking and fondling her as Anna guides her fingers. Pulling down the covers, guiding Heather down the length of her body to--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--a spot on the mattress between Anna's legs that's soaked solid with fresh, gleaming blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather yanks herself away, now seeing that the entire mattress is blood-covered. Runs from the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather stares at her face in the mirrored surface of a toaster. Blood blots on her cheek--vaguely in the shape of little palm prints. She's hyperventilating as she tells Cotter.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember....what Mary Brown said-- she could see the witch's hands on my face, her mouth sucking on mine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anna's the witch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
Nick enters.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck's going on here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does she have marks, Nick--like the ones we have, that Domini had?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does she, goddamnit??
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not that I've seen--but that has no meaning--that means nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why was she exempted, Nick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe whatever they are, they just haven't appeared yet on her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really believe that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's possible for chrissake--
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--the marks appear, then you disappear. Like the little Kurth boy, like Domini, as soon as they come to full bloom--and mine are!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls down her blouse--the marks on her neck have grown--they are the size of--and very clear image of--the palm-prints of a child, ringing around Heather's neck as if strangling her.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mine, too. And so are yours, pal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
He points to Nick's exposed midriff--the stains have spread up from his waist into his abdomen--
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like a blueprint for disembowelment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are other explanations! She is not the goddamn witch, that's insane!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then just give me one of your explanations that all three of us'll buy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't....
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
--and then Nick hears giggling. His eyes and everyone's eyes go to one of the video monitors:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BIG ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
of the loft. Where they see Anna twirling round and round on her tip-toes, laughing, as though she were simultaneously being hanged and looking up the dress and giggling at the person being hanged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now even Nick looks petrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE LOFT - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - JUST AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Big Room. Nick enters on the run.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>

</NICK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever you want.

</ANNA>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The clothes--take 'em off-- I want to see every square inch--

<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--no, what's wrong with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
HEATHER & NICK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Watch on the monitor: Nick showing the huge mark on his torso.
</DIRECTION>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you marked like this??
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<NICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see for proof positive you're the goddamn witch--
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
Anna dashes from the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE ELEVATOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Heather grabs her, as Anna's trying to open the door to escape. The recorded dogs start barking madly.
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You killed Domini, didn't you, witch??
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not a witch, you're all crazy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
Anna runs panicked into the kitchen--and right into Cotter. He grabs her by the arms.
</DIRECTION>
<COTTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just say you are--we won't hurt you--
	</DIALOGUE>
</COTTER>
<DIRECTION>
--Heather runs in behind her--
</DIRECTION>
<HEATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	--we'll just make you go away, so you can't hurt anyone else--
	</DIALOGUE>
</HEATHER>
<DIRECTION>

<NICK>

</COTTER>
<ANNA>

</ANNA>
<NICK>

	Just say the words, Anna.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NICK>
<DIRECTION>
She tries to dodge Nick and get back to the elevator, he cuts her off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ditto, the other direction and Heather--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--Anna sprints up the stairs--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COTTER'S WORK-LOFT - JUST AFTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--and finds she's got nowhere to go but down--20 feet worth of down. And Nick, Heather and Cotter are closing in on her from the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please! Please...? I haven't done anything.

Cotter barges past them all, grabs the tope that Nick dangled from the loft space with--
</DIRECTION>
<ANNA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What're you doing??
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNA>
<DIRECTION>
--Cotter throws the slip-knot loop around her neck.

	Alright! Fuck you, fuck all of you! I'm her.

<DIRECTION>
INT/EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS - DAYS FOLLOWING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dizzying montage of video "real" footage much like the opening of the film.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TV Reporters telling us that "once again, like Columbine and "Basketball Diaries," life has imitated violent art. In this case, the Blair Witch Project," where, yesterday obsessed fans of the film performed ritualistic murder--"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nick, Heather and Cotter seen: in cuffs, being led into the Baltimore Police Station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seen: grainy static-cam of them being interrogated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seen: news-film of the inside of the Loft--where Anna was found "murdered." And then a closet where an unidentified nude woman was found similarly "executed." The News camera zooms in on the nude body of Domini crumpled in that closet, visible rope burns on her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seen: Nick's confession. That Anna admitted to being The Evil.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seen: the footage Heather shot of Anna "confessing."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But all the police and we see is Anna with a rope around her neck, pleading to Nick, Heather and Cotter not to kill her: "I haven't done anything!!! Why are you doing this??? Please, God--"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END
