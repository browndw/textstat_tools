It is filled with tomatoes. He takes a bite out of one.

Nods. Everything seems to be order. The Captain looks relieved. The inspector closes the cardboard box but...

Coming closer... becoming clearer... It's Charlie and John Bridger, in scuba gear, riding torpedo-shaped Dive Propulsion Vehicles (DPVs) that pull them through the deep blue sea at a good 5 m.p.h. Both DPVs drag equipment bags.

A Global Satellite Positioning Device is mounted on the handlebar of Charlie's DPV, being fed information via Lyle's laptop. A circle pulsates on the monitor, a beacon to the crate in the ship.

Parked in the sand at the top of the bay. Steve looks out to the bay through infrared binoculars.

The ship is going down. The crew on the dingy head back to the port, which is in the opposite direction of this beach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA - NIGHT

The DPVs are now attached by a tether to an underwater lifting bag that is used to move heavy loads through water.

<DIRECTION>
The crate is surrounded by our three diver-bandits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Using crowbars they pull apart the plywood. The cardboard boxes of tomatoes dump out, tomatoes spilling everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And now we see what was hidden between the boxes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large safe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They move like clock-work. Half-Ear aims an underwater light at the dial. Charlie drills a small hole near the dial.
</DIRECTION>

John peers inside a horoscope and lines up the three wheels of the combination lock... until the door pops open.

They holler and high-five and it's just a great moment to be alive. Steve takes another peek through his infrared binoculars and sees --

The last vestiges of the ship hang above the waterline, then disappear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. UNDERWATER - A LITTLE LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gold is now stacked and secured on the lifting bag.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They attach an underwater parachute to the bag and hook a hose from an air tank into press of a pressure release valves which cause the parachute to INFLATE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking like a hot-air balloon underwater, the whole thing floats up about fifteen feet. Half-Ear holds onto its side, going along for the ride.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Charlie and John Bridger speed off on the DPVs which are tethered to the inflatable bag. As they glide through the water towards the secluded beach, we...

Water cascades in through the open windows. They're thrown around as the Humvee rides the rapids. WHAM. The passenger door caves in as the Humvee rams into a large rock then is swept further downstream. Through the foam and spray, Charlie looks over to Bridger. He's dead. The torrent ROARS.

:SC: INT. OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOMEONE'S POV. A top of the line safe. The only light in the office is the beam of a penlight on the dial.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GLOVED HANDS spin the dial, feeling for "contact points", areas on the dial where a slight resistance can be felt -- if you have the touch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEW ANGLE. A woman holds the penlight in her teeth while trying to crack the safe. It's Stella Bridger, now 30.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUPERIMPOSE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three Years Later Philadelphia.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She manipulates the dial. Click. She grabs the safe's lever and swings the heavy steel door open, her face a mixture of pride and relief. But before we see what's inside -- LIGHTS TURN ON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO COPS lurk at the doorway.

<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A car RISES INTO FRAME on a bustling street: a 1960 Mini Cooper S., a worldwide motoring icon. Its shape crouches low to the ground and its tiny 10-inch wheel-at-each-corner gives it the legendary Mini look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
If when you see its headlights and classic grille it doesn't bring a smile to your face, then you've got no automobile soul.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MINI (CRUISING) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stella takes on the road like someone who loves to be behind the wheel of a car that claimed victory in the Monte Carlo Rally three times. She passes a minivan, a breeze with the Mini's quick, go-kart-like handling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She searches for a parking space on a street lined with SUVs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sees a spot, it's not really a space, just a gap between two gas guzzlers, there's no way any car could squeeze in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brake. Shift. Hard turn. She parallel parks the Mini with ease. She's right in front of --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER SHOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Antique keys and locks dominate the storefront window with the name of the shop stenciled across the glass: BRIDGER LOCK AND SAFE COMPANY. Stella hops out of the Mini. With a poised walk she heads inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SHOP - DAY

It is filled with old cast-iron safes she has rebuilt along with some new models. Stella's RECEPTIONIST greets her.

<RECEPTIONIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	2:00. Home safe in Fairmount Park. Owner died and the wife never knew the combination. And Todd Milliken called. He has a prototype combination lock he wants you to test out tomorrow morning. Says he added two false contact points on the tumbler.

Without a response, Stella heads over to --

<STELLA>

She doesn't answer.

<CHARLIE>

She doesn't respond. Doesn't ask him to go on, doesn't ask him not to. So he goes on...
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The gold bricks he stole from us were minted in Singapore and decorated with the face of a Balinese girl. I've had my tentacles out and got a call from a friend of mine and your father's, Philly Steak.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<DIRECTION>
Stella remembers him.
</DIRECTION>
<STELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I was little he would play poker at the house and drop quarters under the table for me to find.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STELLA>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He got word from an L.A. connection named Skinny Pete that a gold dealer has been buying bricks with the Balinese girl on them, three or four at a time.

<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tracked Steve down to an address in the Hollywood Hills. He's changed his last name to Frezelli. And get this: he had a Worthington 1000 installed in the house before he even moved in. We both know that you don't install a Worthington 1000 unless you have something precious to guard.

<STELLA>

	Precious or not, I don't deal with ill-gotten goods.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STELLA>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We boosted that gold from a terrorist group that was about to trade it for bio-weapons. Now that doesn't exactly make us Robin Hood, but maybe in our own little way we were doing a good deed. Problem is, no one in my crew can handle that safe. And I need someone I can trust.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHARLIE>
<STELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you think that's me? Haven't you heard that I work for the other side?

</STELLA>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I heard is that you have your father's touch. And he was the only safecracker I knew who could open a Worthington 1000.

<STELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not a safecracker. I'm a professional safe and vault technician.

<DIRECTION>
A second elevator opens, the motorcycle zooms inside, people screaming at the sight of the guns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ROOFTOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The doors open, PING, and the Mini reverses out, spins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOOKING DOWN onto the building's rooftop, we see that it is shaped like a capitol E, three towers connected by a narrow strip. Each tower has its own elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CHARLIE'S MINI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He wants to drive across the rooftop strip but there's a big problem: the giant sign that exclaims HOTEL FIGUEROA in red and white neon lights blocks so much of the strip that even the Mini couldn't squeeze through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In his rearview, he sees the second elevator door open and out comes the motorcycle. He's trapped up here. But he's not about to abandon ship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. ROOFTOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
So he floors it, slaps the gears, hurtles to the edge of the first tower and in --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EYE-POPPING CGI SLOW MOTION SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His car hurls into the wide blue empty space... The ground deliriously distant... Spiraling through the air like a football...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEXT TOWER - ROOFTOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mini lands right-side-up with a THUD. Charlie, rattled, looks over his shoulder and sees the LAPD helicopter rising over the rooftop, turbines SCREAMING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And here comes the motorcycle. Flying from one section of the rooftop to the next. It lands and the driver REVS it forward --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
I/E CHARLIE'S MINI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He speeds toward the edge of the roof and launches off towards the third tower some twenty feet away. Lands. Keeps going to the last elevator, skids to a stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches out, punches the call button. Then looks over his shoulder to witness --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MOTORCYCLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
going full throttle to make the final rooftop to rooftop jump.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But its front wheel hits the edge slightly off-kilter...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It soars but with a slight downward trajectory...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Towards a large window on the top floor...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then lower...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the look on the driver's face says it all as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The front wheel of the motorcycle SMACKS into the side of the building, just below the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guards are flung off the bike and their bodies CRASH through the window as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hunk of exploding metal imbeds itself in the side of the LAPD chopper and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HOTEL FIGUEROA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guards land in the Tangier Suite in a hailstorm of glass shards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
I/E. LAPD HELICOPTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smoke billows out where the hunk of metal hit. The pilot keeps it under control but it's time to go. With a WHINING THROB, the injured chopper banks away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HOTEL FIGUEROA LOBBY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PING. The elevator door opens. Charlie's Mini shoots out then skids out the lobby's exit. He made it.

:SC: INT. STELLA'S MINI (SPEEDING) - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She checks the rearview mirror. No sign of the Ferrari.

Just a Jeep Wrangler back there.

Stella looks relieved. Feels like she's home free.

:SC: EXT. UNION STATION - SUNSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stella's Mini pulls up to the ramp of the enclosed car carrier at the end of Amtrak Train 59, bound for New Orleans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She can see the other two Minis are already inside. She gets out and hands the cargo loader a ticket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. UNION STATION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The "All Aboard" announcement goes out over the PA system.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the Superliner train pulls out of the station, quickly picking up speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FIRST CLASS CAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The outside streaks by through the window. It's a happy crew. Champagne is poured. Charlie holds up his glass and gets their attention.
</DIRECTION>
<CHARLIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to make a toast. Cause there's somebody missing here today, and we all know who it is.

:SC: INT. CAR CARRIER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUR CAMERA MOVES past the three Minis parked inside...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And STOPS at the last car in the carrier -- the Jeep Wrangler. Its rear hatch rises and Steve creeps out. Looks around. It's safe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks over to Stella's Mini. Pops open the trunk REVEALING a silver Haliburton suitcase. He unzips the case.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's filled with stacks and stacks of gold bricks, the exotic face of a Balinese girl on each one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steve pulls out a brick, embraces it. He knows his gold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
These bricks are real.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But as he has a moment with his gold, BEHIND HIM, the trunks of the other two Minis RISE in unison.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Mashkov RISES out of the trunk of the white Mini.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another Ukrainian RISES out of the trunk of the blue Mini.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Four more Ukrainians slide out from underneath the Minis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They cock their M-lls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steve hears the sound from behind him. He turns around to see the weapons pointed at him.
</DIRECTION>
<MASHKOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take out your gun and drop it on the floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASHKOV>
<DIRECTION>
Steve has no choice.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?

</STEVE>
<MASHKOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You knew my cousin. Yevhen.

</MASHKOV>
<STEVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never knew anyone named Yevhen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVE>
<MASHKOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get in the trunk. Not that trunk, this one. That gold is for us. A gift from some old friends of yours. They said to tell you that they didn't mind sharing the box of Cracker Jack, as long as you didn't get any. Not even the toy surprise.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASHKOV>
<DIRECTION>
The Ukrainians force Steve into the trunk of the white Mini.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And for the first time, he's scared. Looking up at Mashkov, he begs.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. Don't shoot me. Please...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVE>
<MASHKOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry. That wasn't the deal. I'm not going to shoot you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASHKOV>
<STEVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. Thank God.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVE>
<MASHKOV>
<DIRECTION>
(to the others)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He really thought I was going to shoot him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASHKOV>
<DIRECTION>
The Ukrainians laugh. Steve tries to laugh.
</DIRECTION>
<MASHKOV>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No. I'm not going to shoot you. I'm going to hack off your limbs and bury you while you're still alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MASHKOV>
<DIRECTION>
And with that, he closes the trunk. THUD. Like the lid of a coffin. And for Steve, the world falls into BLACKNESS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. FIRST CLASS CAR - SAME TIME

<DIRECTION>
Underneath the crew's seats, we see the other two silver Haliburton suitcases filled with the rest of the gold. We BOOM UP to our five thieves...

The coupler between the car carrier and the rest of the train is electronically disengaged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This causes the train to separate from the car carrier. The train speeds on without it at 100 miles per hour.

The car carrier slowly comes to a stop in the middle of nowhere.
