Technicians cluster around VIDEO SCREENS showing feeds from LVIN'S MULTIPLE CAMERAS. One shot from the housing faces forward. Another is of Al at the controls. Exotic equipment surrounds him. A CLOCK is prominent. It reads: ELAPSED MISSION TIME - 1 hour, 14 minutes. A third camera fixed to a long extension arm, articulates 360% and shoots back to show the POD.

Slowly, almost imperceptibly, the hubbub and chatter die off. People stand and sit as before, but slowly slow down...Cigarettes slow halfway to the mouth...Coffee cups stop in mid-sip. In the lab, procedures just...slow. A man at a control board looks down as if, suddenly, it's all Greek...the lights and buttons suddenly foreign to him. Others seem bemused, daydreaming...They smile at each other and try to think of something to say. Some of them giggle.

THE INTRUDERS - walk to the access door. They are armed, disciplined, well drilled. Movement is unhurried but efficient. They carry submachine guns. A GUARD eyes them placidly.

THE SHRIEK of an ALARM SIREN. Suddenly a door swings open. The LEADER'S gun swings on the figure in the doorway...Joe Doakes. Joe stands in shock, looks at the gun, swings the door shut behind him. The ALARM CUTS OUT. Everyone in the room stares at him. he stands there rumpled and bemused, blinking at them; Dustin Hoffman on drugs. Finally, the LEADER sees he's no threat, relaxes his grip on the gun. The LEADER snaps out:

	Go get a drink.

This has the force of suggestion...Joe turns and walks through and out of the room...looking for a drink. The LEADER motions to INTRUDER 2 to continue.

<LEADER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It tickles.

They turn and exit the room. As they do, the LEADER notices Joe aimlessly examining the wall of equipment nearby. Joe is really stoned...He's fooling with a control panel, flicking switches on and off. He notices the INTRUDERS. Caught, he tries to make the best of it. He smooths his hair, spins and comes to a half-assed kind of attention. As he turns, he knocks some wildly expensive piece of equipment to the floor. Joe grimaces and straightens his tie, making it much worse. The LEADER comes close to him, stares at him, thoughtfully. Joe blinks back, trying to clear his head in case speaking is required...The leader looks at the smashed equipment. Joe looks at it guiltily. The Radio SQUAWKS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Leader decides. Abruptly, he kicks the equipment out of his way. It smashes against the back wall. Joe winces...the Leader turns and stalks out of the room. Joe holds his attention position for a moment, like a good scout, then seems to find himself lost and alone in a room full of strange equipment.

Some of them do. The INTRUDERS step back through the door. The TECHS look at each other blankly. Then they look at the ceiling ...the walls...their shoes, anything.

They almost catch up with GRUNER when an obstruction in their lane forces them off the road...Only great skill and luck enables them to swerve back on. They round a blind corner. The PORSCHE, dead in their track. Both cars SLAM TOGETHER, careen off the road, hit a bank, separate. The PORSCHE rolls, destroying itself, PRANGS into a tree. The M2 goes through a bush, comes to rest upright.

GRUNER crawls from his car, homocide on his mind. Joe slams his shoulder into his door. It swings open dumping him in the mud, tangled in his seat belt.

JOE'S POV
</DIRECTION>

GRUNER stands over him with a gun. Joe struggles to his feet. Rene joins him. GRUNER holds the small package in one hand and the gun in the other. He holds the gun lazily...not really aimed: arrogance and a challenge.

GRUNER'S POV

	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
<AL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sending what we know back to U.S.T. via satellite.

<DIRECTION>
INT. DIETER'S POD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dieter sets his own transmitter to the same frequency and blasts forth...jamming Al's transmission.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a trick. Al adds to the radio chaos, transmitting on other frequencies...a battle of the wavelengths. Then someone hits it, a frequency that:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
sets off the automatic shotguns. Everyone dives for the dirt. The air above them EXPLODES - shredding the trees. Joe looks up, sees a lane of guns clicking empty...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dieter gets in a lucky shot and Al's POD is damaged.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe hears it.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Al...you there, Al? Now's the time. Help us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. Maybe Al's dead. Now Joe knows: If they're to be saved, it's his body and his brain that has to save them... The awful truth...It's up to him.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He can't help us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<RENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do something!
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do what? I don't know. I'm no good at this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<RENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are, I've seen you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It wasn't me. It was him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<RENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He told me what to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<RENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you did it. It was you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe tries to deny it.
</DIRECTION>
<RENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know one thing. If it wasn't you...we're in big trouble...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She sees them bringing up submachineguns. She turns to Joe. His face takes on a look of resolve.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was me. He just told me how...I wish he could tell me now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<RENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If he was able, what would he say.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He gathers himself, takes her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'd say..."Don't stop now.."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He's up and running for it, with RENE close behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH THE MINEFIELD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rips open barbed wire, they come to it:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LIVE WIRE - He's got to think quickly. He takes off his belt, loops the buckle on a conductor and pulls it across until two wires make contact. A BLAST OF SPARKS, the wire grounds out, shorts, overloads and goes dead. ALARMS GO OFF. From the other side, Border Police rush up, but can do nothing to help them.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
<RENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's twenty feet high.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like Al says..."Under stress, the human body is capable of impossible feats.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM WHAM WHAM WHAM WHAM...Submachinegun fire rattles off the fence above them.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This...is stress.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Rene agrees. She puts her foot in his hands, he vaults her to the top of the fence. She swings over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He backs off...a BURST OF FIRE spurs him. He runs, leaps for the fence, barely catches the top, tries to pull himself up. He can't. Caught, he hangs there, watching the bad guys move up.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Al, this is your last chance..
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The bad guys take aim.
</DIRECTION>
<BURR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three seconds to decide. Then we will shoot.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Caught, under their guns...Joe looks at them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE - EXT. AL'S POD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is hit, mortally damaged...losing pressure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DIETER'S POD -
</DIRECTION>
<DIETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give up! Tell Joe to give up!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AL'S POD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Desperation...to get enough power, to aim the laser. As Al swings it around,Dieter fires again. At the same moment, Al fires at Dieter. It misses...but hits a NERVE BUNDLE!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe breaks into laughter...The Tickle-Response.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The paroxysm of laughter spoils Dieter's aim...His POD is drawn into the throat by the convulsions, where it is battered. Desperate, Al brings HIS dying POD alongside, pops the hatch, swims to Dieter's pod, just as Dieter's pod is swept away, out of control. A vortex tries to tear his grip away. He hangs tough against the violent wrenches of the current, as the pod swoops out from under him and spins away. Hand over hand, he reaches a hatch and enters. Dieter, panicked, at the controls, turns on him. They fight. The pod tumbles. They tumble. Dieter grabs a wrench, raises it to slug Al, when the pod hits something solid. Dieter is slammed against the bulkhead, knocked out. Al gains control of the pod, wedges it into a crevice and waits for the paroxyms to die away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOE'S ON THE WIRE, laughing at something terribly funny. RENE thinks he's finally gone mad. He may have. The pursuers think so. They are so amazed by his attitude...his courage...HIS HEART in the face of death, that when he tumbles off the fence into the FREE ZONE, they don't even fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FENCE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The border police come up and cover them. They are safe and free. Incredibly, Burr shouts through the fence:
</DIRECTION>
<BURR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They have stolen state property.
	</DIALOGUE>
<RENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a nerve!
	</DIALOGUE>
<BORDER_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of property?
	</DIALOGUE>
<RENE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Joe)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just ignore them. Walk away.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BURR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I insist. Return the POD.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe starts to walk away, then turns to BURR.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, if you really want it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He hawks and spits through the wire onto the man's shoe. The guards lock their weapons expecting a firefight at this insult.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BURR's assistant leans down, scrapes the lunger off BURR's foot. BURR, realizing, scrapes the slime from the other's hand and cups it in his...He turns away, looking for a vessel. The border guards are flabbergasted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look at Joe, Joe shrugs at them as he and RENE walk away. Toward a familiar Oriental man who waits for them, in front of an idling helicopter.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Riuji?
	</DIALOGUE>
<RENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you, I work for him.

<DIRECTION>
INSIDE - INT. THE POD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Al is anxious to get home.
</DIRECTION>
<AL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hurry up...before this guy wakes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rene turns to him..He is mumbling.
</DIRECTION>
<RENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not moving fast enough for him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL
</DIRECTION>
<AL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll punch up your adrenaline...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe walks unsteadily off with RENE...past the guards. He seems insane...arguing with himself.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You leave my adrenaline alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
RENE just looks ahead; a crazy-amused smile on her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It ends as it began, with Al and Joe bitching at each other, but all anyone hears is Joe's side:
</DIRECTION>
<Joe>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's slow? ...I figured it out...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INSIDE - INT. THE POD - AL
</DIRECTION>
<AL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, you should have said it in Cantonese...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
OUTSIDE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe, outraged, babbles away. The Border guards look worried, like they may have to throw a net over him. Rene starts to giggle at the whole thing.
</DIRECTION>
<RENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wants to apologise.
	</DIALOGUE>
<RENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He should do it in person ...I mean ex person.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah...I have to get away.
	</DIALOGUE>
<RENE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know a nice island.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Al)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? I told you she was allright. Who knew it right away?...and I found the chip. Who figured out it was Dieter?..Alright then. I ran through the minefield, where were you then? AW...will you get out of my face...etc. etc.
	</DIALOGUE>
