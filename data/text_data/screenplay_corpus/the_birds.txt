<DIRECTION>
It is mid-afternoon, and there is a tempo and pace to the people walking, the doorman HOOTING for taxicabs, the policemen directing traffic.

<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT - MELANIE DANIELS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in the crowd of pedestrians, approaching Davidson's Pet Shop. She is a young woman in her mid-twenties, sleekly groomed, exquisitely dressed, though hatless. She walks with the quick sureness of the city dweller, a purposefulness in her stride, a mischievous grin on her face. She continues toward the front door of a pet shop and enters.

INT. BIRD SHOP - MED. SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Melanie opens the door and comes through, still looking back toward the street and skywards. The proprietor, a MRS. MacGRUDER, comes toward her.
</DIRECTION>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls?

</MELANIE>
<MRS_MACGRUDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Miss Daniels.

MED. SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. MacGruder takes a look out at the sky. A puppy is BARKING, o.s.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MACGRUDER>
<DIRECTION>
(shaking her head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There must be a storm at sea. That can drive them inland, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MACGRUDER>
<DIRECTION>
They are climbing the short flight of steps into the bird department now. The BARKING of the dog SEGUES into the clamor of innumerable birds, TWEETING, TWITTERING, CAWING as Melanie and Mrs. MacGruder go to the counter at the far end. There is a circular cage in the center of the room, and the walls are lined with wire-mesh cages and smaller wooden cages so that the effect is one of being surrounded by birds, contained birds to be sure. The birds are quite beautiful, mostly exotic birds, small splashes of color behind the wire-mesh cages, larger bursts of brilliant hue on the parrots and parakeets in the bigger cages. As they walk:
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MACGRUDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
(she is more distressed now)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MACGRUDER>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<MRS_MACGRUDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MACGRUDER>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he'll talk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<MRS_MACGRUDER>

	Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.

</MRS_MACGRUDER>
<MELANIE>

	Yes.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address.

<MRS_MACGRUDER>
<DIRECTION>
(producing pencil and pad)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Oh, well, all right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MACGRUDER>
<DIRECTION>
As Melanie starts writing:
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MACGRUDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MACGRUDER>
<MELANIE>
<DIRECTION>
(with a resigned sigh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, all right, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<DIRECTION>
She scurries out behind the counter and out of sight. Melanie finishes writing her address and stands impatiently by the counter. She taps her teeth with the pencil.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_MACGRUDER>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, this is Betty MacGruder at Davidson's.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause; accusingly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's past three, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, how long do you think...? All right, would you check it please? Yes, I'll wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_MACGRUDER>
<DIRECTION>
Melanie sighs. Leaving her gloves and purse on the counter, she begins wandering around the shop, still tapping her lips with the pencil. There is no menace in the birds surrounding her. They are active and beautiful as they dart behind the bars and mesh of their cages. Off screen, the puppy begins BARKING again as the front door opens. Melanie looks up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT - MITCH BRENNER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he closes the entrance door behind him and starts up the steps to the bird department. He is a handsome man, about twenty-nine or thirty, well-dressed, and carrying a felt hat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
seeing him, and then turning away to bend before the cage of strawberry finches. She pokes the pencil through the mesh. The birds are startled into scarlet flight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as they pass each other in the aisle. He gives a polite little nod, and she gives a polite little smile. But as he passes her, and unknown to her, he turns for a second look -- and then vanishes behind the circular cage as he turns he corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
looking at her watch as she wanders around the other side of the cage and then comes face to face with Mitch again.
</DIRECTION>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wonder if you could help me.

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE

a trifle annoyed by his manner at first. She is about to inform him, if you please, that she is not a shopgirl. But then something rebellious flashes in her eyes and an idea comes to her.

<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lovebirds, sir?

</MELANIE>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCH>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well... yes, sir, there are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCH>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I understand completely, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCH>
<MELANIE>

(leading him around shop)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, of course not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have a pair that are just friendly?

</MITCH>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think so, sir.

</MELANIE>
<MITCH>

(at the finches)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't these lovebirds?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCH>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sir, those are... redbirds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The sign says strawberry finches.

	Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds...
	</DIALOGUE>

(and stops before a cage of canaries)
</DIRECTION>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Those are canaries, Miss.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't this make you feel awful?

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doesn't what make me...?

<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?

</MITCH>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCH>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCH>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<MITCH>

</MITCH>
<MELANIE>

<MITCH>

	<DIALOGUE>

CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she realizes she is expected to take one of the canaries out of the cage. She smiles feebly, glances toward the counter where she expects Mrs. MacGruder to reappear momentarily, and then takes a deep breath. She opens the door to the canary cage, and cautiously puts her hand into it.
</DIRECTION>
<MELANIE>

(feebly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here, birdie. Here, birdie, birdie.

The birds are CHIRPING wildly in their cage. The man and Melanie stand silently side by side. The man's eyes wander down to the bird-cage. Melanie's eyes move toward him. Self- consciously, she stands with the cage of CHATTERING birds. The man is dead-panned, unsmiling. The elevator stops. The doors begin to open.

He walks a little distance as Melanie watches him, then stops, turns and looks at her surprised, as if he'd expected her to be right behind him. He stands stock still, looking at her, saying nothing. She understands then that he wants her to follow him, and she catches up, neither speaking. They go to the front door. He opens it, looks at her, then looks out across the town and the bay.

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is an awkwardness here. Annie wants to know more. She puffs on the cigarette, smiles, tries a friendly approach.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a lovely garden.

</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.

<ANNIE>

</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, it's none of my business.

LONG SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE - MELANIE'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is not a sign of activity as the boat drifts just a little closer. As Melanie watches, the front door opens and a woman comes out, walks to a red pickup truck, starts the engine. A little girl comes out of the house, goes to the truck, gets in. The woman shouts something to a man -- Mitch Brenner, probably, though it is difficult to tell from this distance -- and he comes over to the truck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The truck grinds into gear, goes around the turnabout, and heads down the road away from the farm, a huge cloud of dust behind it. The farm is still again. Mitch stands looking after the truck for a moment, and then begins walking up toward the barn in the distance.

</MITCH>
<MELANIE>

MED. SHOT - LYDIA BRENNER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
closing the door behind her, coming toward the bar. She is a woman in her late forties, attractive, wearing shirt, blouse, cardigan sweater, low heels. There is nothing agrarian-looking about her. She speaks with the quick tempo of the city dweller, and there is lively inquiry in her eyes.

	It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.

</ANNIE>
<MELANIE>

	I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.

</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I know. Did something unexpected crop up?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
There is a moment where both women look at each other... When Melanie answers, it is abrupt and a trifle cold -- she is again telling Annie to mind her own business.

	They're always hungry, Fred. I opened one of the sacks when I got home, and I poured it out for them, and they wouldn't touch it. Now you know chickens as well as I do, and when they won't eat, there's just something wrong with what they're being fed, that's all.

Melanie laughs.

<CATHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see, they've got this whole complicated thing figured out where I'm going over to Michele's for the afternoon, and Michele's mother is going to say she has a headache and would I mind very much if she took me home. Then, when we get back here, all of the kids'll jump out!

INT. KITCHEN - TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mitch is helping her as she loads the dishwasher.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, very.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCH>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And certainly pretty.

</LYDIA>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</MITCH>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long have you known her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you. We met yesterday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCH>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a bird shop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</MITCH>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She was selling birds.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCH>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...

	Mother, where did you go to law school?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCH>
<LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's very rich, isn't she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCH>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, Mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCH>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Mother.

</MITCH>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.

	I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.

</LYDIA>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, Mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCH>
<LYDIA>

	It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...

	Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.

	How does Mother know what I like to do?

<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Without any clothes on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With all my clothes on! The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper. Anything they said...

</MELANIE>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCH>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCH>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<MITCH>

	Yes.

	...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?

</MITCH>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?

	At least, I didn't until I came up here.

	So you didn't go to school together.

</MITCH>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

<MITCH>

</MITCH>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

</MELANIE>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were lying.

</MITCH>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I was lying.

</MELANIE>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?

</MITCH>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wrote the letter.

</MELANIE>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did it say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCH>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you tore it up.

</MITCH>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</MELANIE>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

</MITCH>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because it seemed stupid and foolish.

<MITCH>

	Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!

<MELANIE>

The car turns the bend and disappears. Empty road. Only the long line of telephone poles and wires and... something strange on the wires.

His attention caught by the poles and wires.

<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.

<DIRECTION>

	Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?

	No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.

	If you have some, I'd...

MED. SHOT - MELANIE sitting, tucking her legs up under her. She is disturbed by her conversation with Mitch and, in fact, by the way this entire trip has worked out. Annie brings her the glass of brandy, and she takes it gratefully.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.

	Well, how'd your evening go?

<DIRECTION>
Melanie shrugs.

	Did you meet Lydia?

	Or would you rather I changed the subject?

	<DIALOGUE>
	I think so.

</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.

	Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
There is an awkward pause. Annie shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I see no reason for being coy about this. It was Mitch Brenner.

<DIRECTION>
Melanie nods.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess you knew that, anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suspected as much.

</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.

</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Isn't there?

<DIRECTION>
(she shrugs)

	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?

</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>

	I think I'll have some of that, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she pours brandy, drinks, sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she smiles weakly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When was this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died. Things may be different now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Different?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With Lydia.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did she seem a trifle distant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<MELANIE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A trifle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what had you done?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she shakes her head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then what was it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then why did she object to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because she was afraid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Afraid you'd take Mitch?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Afraid I'd give Mitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't understand.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see. She's only afraid of being abandoned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She already has a daughter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(apologetically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You get straight to the point, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry. Forgive me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the first reason.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the second?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(simply)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanted to be near Mitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)

	It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
There is a moment of silence. Into the silence, the TELEPHONE shrills. Annie hesitates a moment, and then goes to answer it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - ANNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
at the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Oh, hello. No, no, I wasn't asleep. What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, just a little while ago. Sure, hold on.

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as they stare at each other across the room, Melanie hesitating.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's waiting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Melanie rises and goes to the phone. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Annie to the wing chair in the foreground and stays on her throughout following, recording her reactions as Melanie talks to Mitch in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Annie is not devastated by this call, and yet there is a wistfulness to her expression as she realizes she may finally and irrevocably be losing Mitch to another girl.
</DIRECTION>
<MELANIE>
<DIRECTION>
(at phone; coolly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Yes, this is Melanie. Fine, thank you. No, no trouble at all. I simply followed the road. It's a very bright night.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Oh. Well, there's no need to apologize. I can understand...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well...

<DIRECTION>
(she listens again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's very kind of you. No, I'm not angry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she listens)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't. I'm afraid I have to get back to San Francisco.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I wouldn't want to disappoint Cathy, but...

</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. Yes, I'll be there.

<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night, Mitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>

She hangs up and looks at Annie in embarrassment.
</DIRECTION>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said I would.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It seems so pointless.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'll go to sleep. This has been a busy day.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(picking up her paper bag)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My luggage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles, takes out a flowered muumuu, holds it up to Annie.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty. Did you get that at Brinkmeyer's?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Melanie nods and drapes the muumuu over her arm. She is silent for a moment, pensive. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think I should go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's up to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?

</ANNIE>
<MELANIE>
<DIRECTION>
(firmly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
The room is silent. Melanie nods, slowly, and then smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Annie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, into the silence, comes a THUMP at the door, startling them both.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(rising)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who can that be at this hour?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she walks to door)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(no answer)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is someone there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Melanie goes to stand beside Annie. Puzzled, Annie unlocks the door, and then opens it. She looks out into the night. There is nothing but the SOUND of the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the emptiness outside)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is anyone there?
	</DIALOGUE>

	But... it isn't dark, Annie. There's a full moon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE

FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIGH SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE The place is decorated with balloons strung from the house to various points on the lawn. The children, in party clothes, with their parents, are clustered around a long folding table upon which are sandwiches, ice cream and soft drinks. The parents are either helping the children to more or telling them they are having too much. There is a general SOUND of kid's CHATTER and LAUGHTER. Coming up the sloping path, away from the party, are Melanie and Mitch. The CAMERA PANS them UP the slope and away from the party in background. As they turn the hairpin bend of the slope, and come up toward the CAMERA, we see the entrance of the harbor and the Pacific in the background. The CAMERA PANS them as they come near to us and, once more, the party is in the background. Mitch and Melanie pass the CAMERA out to the left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER SHOT - THE TOP OF THE DUNES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Melanie and Mitch come INTO the picture from the right and stand against the sky. Mitch takes a martini shaker from one of his pockets, and two glasses from the other. He hands one of the glasses to Melanie, and then pours.

	I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.

</MELANIE>
<MITCH>

	Helping travelers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCH>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<DIRECTION>
She hesitates for a moment, thinking. She has never really considered before what she does with her time, and now that she is accounting for it, it sounds a little meaningless and unimportant.
</DIRECTION>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley. That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Thursdays and Fridays?

	She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll think me very bold, sir.

</MELANIE>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCH>
<DIRECTION>
She leans over and whispers in his ear. They both burst out LAUGHTER. But then suddenly, a very serious look comes into Melanie's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
serious, introspective.
</DIRECTION>
<MELANIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's silly, isn't it? Teaching a bird to shock my aunt. That's just silly and childish.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(slight pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I ought to go join the other children.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MELANIE>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she moves abruptly away from him, and starts toward where the children have begun playing Blind Man's Bluff. Mitch stares after her for a moment, moved by this sudden glimpse of character, and then follows her down the dune. The children are all in a circle. Annie is busy changing the blindfold from Michele to Cathy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PANS - MELANIE AND MITCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA is now on the lawn POINTING UP toward dunes. We see Mitch and Melanie descending. They are coming down by way of a short cut and are not on the zig-zag path. As they reach the lawn they move along the side of it at the foot of the dunes. They are absorbed in each other. The CAMERA PANS OFF them and BRING INTO the picture Annie, surrounded by the children. She is in the act of changing the blindfold from Michele to Cathy. She hands Michele her glasses back. During this, and while she is putting the blindfold round the eyes of Cathy, she is looking to her right and obviously is watching Mitch and Melanie.
</DIRECTION>

MITCH AND MELANIE - ANNIE'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT - ANNIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA MOVES A LITTLE to her left (CAMERA RIGHT). At this moment, in the background, Lydia is emerging with the birthday cake. The candles on it are unlit. Lydia immediately also catches sight of Mitch and Melanie and she slows up somewhat as she walks to the long table, her eyes still on the couple. During this we see Annie in the foreground sending Cathy off.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right then, here we go.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three! Go get 'em, Cathy!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNIE>
<DIRECTION>
She says all this while still looking toward the couple. She turns her head away from the couple with a new expression on her face. She twists completely around to look at Lydia as though she were wondering if Lydia sees what she sees. Suddenly we HEAR a little boy's voice crying:
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_BOY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look! Look!

<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - THE LAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the children begin drifting back toward the table and the cake. There is the curious feeling of lighting having struck very close by without having injured anyone. All that adrenaline has boiled up, and now it has no place to go.

<MITCH>

	Yeah.

(thinking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were the kids bothering them or something? 'Cause sometimes they'll do that, you know. If you make any kind of disturbance near them, they'll just come after you. I seen that plenty of times myself.

</LYDIA>
<MALONE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, Lydia, 'attack' is a pretty strong word, don't you think? I mean, birds just don't go around attacking people without no reason, you know what I mean? The kids just probably scared them, that's all.

	Maybe you oughta put some screening on top of your chimney

INT. BEDROOM IN BRENNER HOUSE - MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Melanie has just gotten out of bed. She is wearing the rather unsophisticated nightdress she brought at the store. Her hair is loose. She wears no makeup. She is bent over a lavatory which has been installed in the bedroom. She is busily brushing her teeth. Her head half turns as she HEARS VOICES.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA_S_VOICE>

<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - THE YARD BELOW - MELANIE'S P.O.V.

She smiles and pokes her finger into the cage. The birds TWEET at her.

Mitch on the shore, working with a rake in his hands. A thin column of smoke is climbing the sky.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT - MELANIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns her attention away from Mitch, and walks to the end of the garden toward the shore. A wind is blowing off the water, moving white puffs of cloud swiftly across the sky, whipping the full short shirt of muumuu about her legs as she walks. She stands there silhouetted against the sky for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLOW PAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Melanie scans the horizon. There isn't a bird anywhere in sight. The day is still and clear, but somehow ominous in its silence. Her gaze comes to rest on Mitch and the thin column of smoke again. In the distance, Mitch sees her and raises his arm in greeting. She waves back at him. He puts the rake down and begins walking toward the house.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
as she turns away from the house and begins walking in the garden, sipping idly at her coffee. A screen DOOR CLATTERS again. She turns.

	Well, they'll go along with anything.

</MELANIE>
<MITCH>

	They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.

She laughs, and Mitch joins her, but it is hollow this time. Like children who have told themselves a too realistic horror story, they are becoming a little frightened.

SLOW PAN OF THE ROOM - LYDIA'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
starting to the right of the doorway as she enters and continuing a little below eye level, the CAMERA PICKS OUT: A standing floor lamp, the shade dangling, but the light still burning; a picture hanging askew on the wall, its glass shattered; the window to the left of the picture, every pane of glass shattered; a dresser with two stuffed birds on its top; both birds have been badly damaged, the stuffing ripped out of them, the head of one hanging at a crooked near decapitated angle; the window to the left of the dresser, all the panes shattered. The level of the CAMERA DESCENDS, and begins a SLOW PAN of the floor. It PICKS OUT broken glass, continues its PAN to SHOW scattered feathers, continues its PAN to SHOW a broom, feathers caught in the straw, a single bedroom slipper, continues to SHOW a pair of legs in pajamas, one foot bare, the other slippered, and then immediately

turning and running for the door. The CAMERA FOLLOWS her in an unbroken headlong flight, the scream continuing as if she is incapable of stopping it, as she stumbles, runs, trips her way down the corridor and bursts out of the house, still screaming, into the pickup truck. The engine starts, she backs the truck out at breakneck speed and hits the highway,

TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH

She walks him to the door. At the door, they kiss -- a long, full kiss.

FULL SHOT -- THE KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as Mitch goes out. Melanie looks after him for a moment, and then picks up the tray. Outside, we HEAR the SOUND of his car starting. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Melanie out of the kitchen, through the dining room, and to one of the bedroom doors on the other side of the house. Gently, she KNOCKS.

FULL SHOT - THE BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is Lydia's room, and cluttered with the mementos of a life no longer valid. There are photographs of her dead husband, souvenirs of trips taken together, bric-a-brac of Mitch's childhood. Under it all, there is a distinct femininity. She sits up in bed as Melanie enters, bearing the tray.

A nearer view of the gas station. A second gull hits the man on the back -- he falls -- hits his head on the pump and then collapses over the gasoline hose pipe, pulling it out and causing it to spill. The third and fourth gulls sweep by. The gas begins to flow away.

Deke Carter comes running from behind the bar to join Mitch. They both EXIT. Melanie dashes back to her original place at the window. The CAMERA RETREATING with her, we come to the window and over Melanie's shoulder we see the men arrive to rescue the attacked gas station attendant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Three or four gulls are still attacking and they flutter away as the men appear to beat them off. Suddenly Melanie in the foreground turns in full profile to her right and looks down.

FROM MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the flow of gasoline trickling toward the car parked below her. At this particular moment, a car has pulled up, has come to a stop and a man emerges. He is in the act of lighting his dead cigar, but his attention is drawn to the happenings around the gas station. With this half-drawn attention, he strikes the match and holds it to the cigar.

She quickly slides the window open and yells down to the man.

EXT. TIDES TOWN AND CAR PARK - MATTE SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A very high shot shows the beginning of the people of the town rushing around the car park and the streets across the highway, endeavoring to put out the two fires. We see automobiles coming to a stop on Highway One, and the oil smoke beginning to rise from the burning gas station and the parked cars. Some men have managed to start a fire hose and have trained it on the burning cars. Suddenly but slowly the foreground in the sky just below the CAMERA begins to fill with wheeling gulls. The whole picture below becomes obliterated by the foreground birds who now begin to swoop down on the town.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TIDES TOWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A raking shot outside the Tides Restaurant showing the phone booth and motel off in the background. People are rushing out from the restaurant and look up in the sky. Gulls begin to descend into the scene, driving the people back into the restaurant. Melanie is seen in the distance calling for Mitch:
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
We see a car zig zag down from the town in a drunken manner coming toward her in the phone booth. We can see birds flying in and out of the windows of the car. We can see the arm and hand of the driver trying to beat them away. In the background of this scene we see the fire truck arrive.

She sees a man with a gun shooting up at birds but to no avail. One or two descend upon him. He throws the gun down and rushes back into the Tides Office. Melanie, with a slight turn, now sees:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TIDES TOWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fire volunteers with birds descending around them drop their hose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSER SHOT

shows the hose snaking wildly and jumping. At one moment the water turns and comes in a powerful stream hitting the windows of the phone booth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP - MELANIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
recoils from this water attack. Through the streaming window she sees the fire volunteers rushing away for cover. To the left we see a horse with its head covered with gulls; its palomino-colored body covered with crows. It is bucking and leaping and kicking its van to pieces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At this moment the scene is obliterated by the appearance of a man groping his way closely past the phone booth windows. His face is poring with blood: his head and shoulders are covered with attacking birds. He disappears from sight. Melanie, now almost in a faint, opens her eyes to see Tides Town. Through the booth window she sees Mitch and Deke Carter, the owner of the Tides, coming down toward the CAMERA and waving the birds away from them with flailing arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

INT. THE TIDES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There must be at least twenty people all looking toward the windows. It is as though they are hiding from a storm. The CAMERA is high enough to see Melanie and Mitch COME IN, very hurriedly close the door. We see the gulls wheeling outside. There is a kind of stunned silence among the people. We can hear the sound of the screaming gulls outside. Suddenly a woman's voice SCREAMS out:
</DIRECTION>

It is the woman who had the two children screaming at Mrs. Bundy who is seated in a booth table staring numb and helpless. Mrs. Bundy turns and looks at her and mutters some words.

Mrs. Bundy offers a weak explanation of why the birds could have gone berserk like this. This information should be obtained from Dr. Stager.

MED. SHOT - FROM MITCH'S AND MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And past the heads of the other people who have also turned, we see one of the back windows of the Tides Restaurant has gone and gulls are coming in. Two or three of the men who are on the edge of the crowd turn and go back toward the window, beating them out. They succeed in doing this.

CLOSE SHOT - A LONE GULL flying low over the water, the CAMERA TRACKING it. The bay is silent. The gull spreads its wings to brake, and then sits on the water. The CAMERA continues low over the water, going through thousands of gulls sitting there patiently, as if it is threading itself through a crowd, not a sound, over the gulls, and then lifting to show the Brenner house in the distance.

Behind the panes of glass, we can see the boards Mitch nailed across the windows. He is on the roof now, testing the two attic dormer windows. He turns to look out over the bay.

as she drops the wood outside the door and he joins her. She is looking out over the bay when he comes to her. This is not the Melanie we saw at the beginning of the picture. Her hair is disarrayed, and her face and clothing are streaked with soot. But beyond a surface physical appearance, there is a weary wisdom in her eyes, and a strength to her as she stands looking toward the distant smoldering town.

We will not reach that goal today or tomorrow. We may not reach it in our lifetime. But the quest is the great adventure of our century. We sometimes chafe at the burdens of our obligations, the complexity of our decisions, the agony of our choices, but there is no comfort or security for us in evasion, no solution in abdication, no relief in irresponsibility.

Lydia is pouring coffee into cups. In the dining room, we can HEAR the CHATTER of the lovebirds. As Lydia pours the sound distracts her. Cathy is sorting candles at the couch.

Silence. Into the silence, another pane of glass, SHATTERING, the THUD of a bird against the boards. Silence. More panes of glass SHATTERING. The SOUND of birds striking the boards and the outside of the house begins building, almost like muffled drumbeats. THUD, THUD, with an irregularity of rhythm. Interspersed, like the counterpoint in an alien orchestration, is the FLUTTER of wings. And then, like another section entering, we begin to hear the SCRATCHING and CLAWING at the roof.

FULL SHOT - THE ROOM

Mitch rises and puts more wood on the fire. The SOUND of the birds is still everywhere around the house. He looks at his watch. He rises, walks into the kitchen to check the back door. It seems all right. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him into the dining room. He stops at the cage with the lovebirds.

FULL SHOT - MITCH

<DIRECTION>
turning quickly, the CAMERA FOLLOWING him into the dining room. He pulls the cloth off the table, begins moving it toward the door. In the entry, he lifts the table on end and piles it against the door. He goes into the kitchen again, CAMERA FOLLOWING. He upends the enamel-topped table, drags it to the back door. He is piling chairs against the table when Melanie COMES IN. She looks at what he is doing with alarm. Mitch looks in the direction of where his mother is and then back to Melanie, with an expression almost of desperation. Both turn back to the barricaded door. The CLAWING and the PECKING fills the void. The noise is a din now, insidious and increasingly more frightening.

CLOSE SHOT - THE CAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as his hand approaches the door. The birds are watching him. His hand hesitates. Then his thumb and forefinger lift the small catch on the cage door. His fingers open the door. Cautiously, in TIGHT CLOSEUP, his hand goes into the cage. The birds sit and watch. One of them tweets. He removes the small feeding tray, puts the bird seed into it, replaces it in the cage. The birds hesitate another moment. Then, tweeting, they begin to eat.

<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - THE DINING ROOM
</DIRECTION>

as Mitch closes the door to the cage. Melanie is slumped against the wall. He goes to her and takes her in his arms. Wearily, she raises her head. The SOUND of the shuffling, pecking, clawing birds is everywhere around them.

There is something pathetically comic about her voice, like a small child's, confused but defiant. Holding her close, Mitch laughs, and she laughs with him. Exhausted, they stand in each other's arms, laughing in that weary, silly, dead of night sort of way. And suddenly... The lights go out.

A kerosene lamp is burning. Melanie is awake, watching the fire. Lydia has fallen into a semi-recumbent position asleep on the couch. Cathy is curled up in one of the easy chairs. Mitch is asleep by the fire. The fire is burning brightly and steadily. The house is almost still. There is no longer the sound of the clawing and pecking, but there is another SOUND now: the sound of SOMETHING FALLING, or dropping in a steady dribbling, difficult to place.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - MELANIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she goes through the house, checking. She stops in the entry hall, plays the flashlight over the furniture piled against the door. Everything seems all right. She goes into the kitchen, again, checks the door, and then plays the beam on the boarded windows. Satisfied, she goes down the corridor outside the bedroom. She opens the first bedroom door, enters, goes to the windows, plays the beam on them. Everything's all right. She comes into the corridor again, opens the second bedroom door, again checks windows, and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - MELANIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
climbing the steps to the attic. She stops outside the first door upstairs, opens it, goes into the room, plays the light on the windows. Nothing. She comes out into the corridor, goes to the second bedroom, opens the door, enters, walks to the windows. They are boarded securely. She is starting back toward the door when she stops.

grotesque and silent as she struggles with them. The room is a crossing cacophony of mixed light beams and fluttering wings.
</DIRECTION>
<MITCH>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Melanie, open the door!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCH>
<DIRECTION>
He hurls himself against it. Inside the room, where Melanie struggles, we HEAR his hammering on it. Melanie is overwhelmed by the birds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She falls to the floor, the flashlight beside her. In the spreading rays of the light, we see the frantic fluttering of wings as the birds cover her. There is a stronger assault on the door by Mitch outside.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>

(O.S.) (screaming)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mitch, get her out of there!

MED. SHOT - THE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Melanie, collapsed at the base of the door, is no longer in view. Neither are the birds, whose fluttering shadows we see on the door as Mitch again hits it from outside.
</DIRECTION>
<MITCH>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>

</MITCH>
<DIRECTION>
The door begins to open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - MITCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the door bursts inward and he stumbles into the room. He begins swinging at the birds immediately, reaching down for Melanie, fighting off the attack at the same time. He begins dragging her out of the room. Her clothes have almost been shredded from her body, and her face is torn and bleeding. We catch only quick glimpses of her near-nudity, as Mitch pulls her into the corridor and then, holding the door shut behind him with one hand, delivers swinging furious blows at the few birds that have escaped into the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<MITCH>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCH>
<DIRECTION>
She rushes off. He struggles grotesquely with the birds. There is a wild fury in him, and a methodical dedication. He will not allow them to defeat him. A large bird strikes his hand, knocking the club from it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT - MITCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the bird strikes at his face. He reaches out with his hands, grasping the bird, letting go of the door knob. Another bird flutters into the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - MITCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in anger and desperation as he throttles the bird with his hands. He reaches behind him to grab the doorknob again, and is immediately attacked by the other bird.

</MITCH>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she runs up the steps and into the corridor, carrying a heavy piece of rope. Mitch grabs the bird and hurls it angrily to the floor. Lydia is staring down at Melanie in terror and compassion. He takes the rope from her, loops it over the doorknob, pulls it taut across the hallway, and ties it to the bannister, sealing the door. He turns immediately to Melanie, picks her up and carries her to the steps, Lydia following. As they go downstairs:

</DIRECTION>
<MITCH>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MITCH>
<DIRECTION>
Cathy rushes to them with a roll of bandages and a blanket. By the light of the lantern, Mitch drapes the blanket over Melanie and then begins unrolling the bandage. But his hands are trembling, and he drops it.
</DIRECTION>
<LYDIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me do that, Mitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYDIA>
<DIRECTION>
She picks up the bandage.

He nods. Silently, she begins working on Melanie.

But she begins cleaning the wounds, taping bandages over the cuts. The house is still. She works silently and quickly.

through the crack. Daylight is almost here. There are no birds visible.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - THE DOOR

<DIRECTION>
FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER YARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is covered with the eerie half-light that comes just before dawn, a light that persists throughout all of the following until the penultimate shot in the picture. The silence is deafening. There is not a bird in sight. The door to Melanie's convertible are open as she and Mitch come out of the house together and he helps her to the car. He puts her in the back seat, tucks the blanket around her. In the background is the pickup truck, too small to hold all of them. Lydia comes to the door and quickly crosses the yard, not looking down at the dead birds. Cathy appears in the doorway to the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - CATHY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is carrying the cage of lovebirds. She hesitates just outside the doorway. She looks at Mitch.

He takes the birds from her and goes to the back of the car. The CAMERA STAYS on Cathy who gets into the car on the front seat. Mitch comes around the other side of the car, stops, and looks toward the trees.

FULL SHOT - THE CAR

from the outside, as it creeps out of the yard. The bay is still, the road is still, the car makes barely a sound as it passes the gate and starts down the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MED. SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD

as they begin driving slowly. The wires are down. A small fire is burning in the brush, where the wires made contact. The car continues to move. It turns the first bend in the road.

MED. SHOT - A ROADSIDE HOUSE

There is a long silence. It is Melanie who has the strongest reason for fearing the birds. It is Melanie, her fear growing, who makes the decision.

through the windshield. The roof and sills are covered with birds. The window is smashed in, canned goods are strewn all over the sidewalk, bolts of cloth run in a riot from the open door and across the road, dead people are lying in the gutter. But in the hotel, we see some faces behind broken windows.
