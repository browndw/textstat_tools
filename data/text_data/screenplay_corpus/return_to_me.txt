A WHITE SCREEN We sense this is someone's P.O.V. The WHITE slowly disperses as hints of BLUE SKY peek through. We are DESCENDING through the CLOUDS as the evening sunset weaves a blanket of orange and red hues over a LARGE CITY which slowly comes INTO FOCUS.

Floating HIGH ABOVE the peaks and valleys of CHICAGO'S SKYLINE, as if being mysteriously moved to a letter on a Ouija Board, WE ARE DRAWN to an unfinished STEEL-FRAMED SKYSCRAPER. The hum of the construction work below fills our ears. Gradually, WE CLOSE IN on a small yellow dot that dances on one of the exposed beams... CLOSER STILL... Just as the detailed creases of a yellow hard hat become evident, it tilts OUT OF FRAME as the face of the MAN wearing it looks up into the sky.

Marty drops the plates of capellini; the pomodoro sauce splashes up on to his apron. He attempts to run to the phone, but the sauce has made the floor slippery. Angelo grabs Marty's arm and they both "skate" to the phone.

Sydney's bio reads: "SYDNEY, FIFTEEN YEARS OLD. TAUGHT SIGN LANGUAGE IN 1990 BY DR. KATHERINE RUELAND. YOU CAN SAY HELLO TO SYDNEY BY DOING THE FOLLOWING..." A DIAGRAM OF TWO HANDS illustrates the sign language symbols for "H" and "I".

Everyone's getting settled. Charlie and his date, SHARI, can't seem to talk without touching. Bob, meanwhile, sites beside MARSHA, an attractive woman--great body. As she takes off her suit jacket, we see her shirt is one size too small for her breasts. She's smart, pretty, but ohmigod, shut-up...
</DIRECTION>
<MARSHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said it's Squeaker, my kitty. Well, as you can imagine, everyone laughed... That's when I met Charlie, he was the only Vet open... Are they bringing menus? Anyway, Squeaker won't let another Vet touch him.

Just as Grace's about to walk away, Bob reaches out to stop her; gently touching her arm... There's a feeling between them. Neither one quite understands it... It's just a hint of warmth.

BOB'S P.O.V.

Grace is emptying a bottle of Evian water into a sink and refilling it from the tap. As she goes to replace the cap, her eyes meet Bob's...

The rain has stopped. Bob, lost in thought, leans on the stone railing that lines the gleaming wet path on the bridge, eating his ravioli out of the styrofoam container with a plastic fork. He taps his breast pocket for the letter, still there. He slowly takes it half way out, then puts it back. He finishes eating... Stops, breathes in the night air. Leaning on the rail, he looks out over the river and up at the Chicago sky line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He feels the letter in his chest pocket, reaches into the jacket and pulls out the worn pale pink envelope...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He carefully opens it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UP BOB.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he reads, his face reflects the emotional content of the letter...

DISSOLVE INTO:

CLOSE-UP OF GRACE'S HAND,

<DIRECTION>
as she writes...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"I hope this letter will bring some comfort..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK, revealing Grace in her hospital bed, just weeks after the transplant. She is sitting up, thoughtfully composing the letter on her bedside table as little Bridgette lies beside her coloring. Megan is busy adding water to the flowers on the nightstand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and a NURSE enters the room. Grace immediately pulls the blanket over to hide Bridgette who continues to color beneath the blanket as the nurse takes Grace's blood pressure. The nurse finishes and exits, Bridgette pops out from under the blanket. Grace continues writing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UP OF GRACE'S HAND,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as she writes the following...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"...your thoughtfulness in a moment of such deep sorrow..."

<DIRECTION>
BACK ON BOB,

"...I awake each day feeling the gentle rhythm of the heart that beats inside me..."

Mel's spot at the door is empty, except for his tennis ball, abandoned on the floor.

CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LIVING ROOM,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grace is sitting on the sofa in the living room, sipping from a glass of wine, petting Mel, who is curled up next to her. We hear way too many "beeps" coming from the kitchen...
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure you don't need any help?

	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
Grace sweetly touches Bob's hair, as he rests his head back on the sofa, staring up at the ceiling...
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was worth it... Katherine's dream coming true... At least I was able to give her that... In a way I'm dreading the dedication because I can't imagine it without her... I've been angry for so long...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<DIRECTION>
Bob closes his eyes as Grace continues stroking his hair... A gentle moment passes...
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
<DIRECTION>
(turning to look in her eyes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Grace...
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanted to tell me something...

</BOB>
<GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
(breathy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
Grace closes her eyes as Bob kisses the nape of her neck and slowly unbuttons her blouse...dangerously close to revealing her scar.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Now's a good time...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
Bob slides his left hand up her "clean shaven" leg...

	Oh dear...Bob...

<DIRECTION>
BEEEEP...

Bob keeps kissing her... The BEEEEP continues...it's loud...too loud.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Save my place...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<DIRECTION>
As Bob runs to the kitchen, Grace glances down at her partially unbuttoned blouse, then quickly downs her wine.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
<DIRECTION>
(leaning his head out the kitchen)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<DIRECTION>
Grace goes into the
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She closes the door, to retrieve the CD from Bob's jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling, yells back to Bob)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dean Martin. Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
Just as Grace turns to leave, she notices the newspaper on Bob's desk, folded open to the article about the zoo. She picks it up...
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
<DIRECTION>
(O.C.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
(reading article, yells back to Bob)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said, thanks for the...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
Beneath a PHOTO of SYDNEY and KATHERINE, Grace reads...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"DR. KATHERINE RUELAND, DIED IN CAR ACCIDENT ON NOVEMBER 12, 1995."...November 12th...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then something else catches her eye...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She slowly moves her hand towards a PALE PINK LETTER, tucked in the blotter on the desk. She picks it up, studies it a moment... a faint feeling rushes through her. She covers her hand with her mouth as she carefully sits down, unable to comprehend the reality...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bob, carrying a bowl of popcorn, walks toward the den.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Grace?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<DIRECTION>
DEN,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bob opens the door. Grace quickly puts the letter in her pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>

Grace speaks slowly, carefully...

<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</GRACE>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes... I completely forgot. I... I promised Megan I'd... baby sit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
Grace slowly-rushes past Bob out of the den.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HALLWAY,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She walks quickly, trying to maintain her composure. Bob is right behind her...
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
<DIRECTION>
(somewhat confused)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll go with you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOB>

<GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
(putting on her sweater)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes... You stay here. I'll call you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
She walks out to the front hall. Her bike is just inside the door -- she keeps moving -- kicking the kickstand up, it breaks off.
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This damn bike.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
She spins it around and briskly walks it out the door...

Grace finally stops for a second and looks into Bob's eyes...
</DIRECTION>
<GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
(sweetly, with a hidden sadness)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GRACE>
<DIRECTION>
Before Bob can say anything, she peddles away--Mel follows.
</DIRECTION>
<BOB>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mel. Stay.

Mel stops. Bob stands on the porch, watching Grace ride away...something's wrong.

Bob's legs weaken as he looks in Grace's eyes. She grabs his arms and together they fall to their knees. Grace comforts him without words...cradling him in her arms...slowly she presses his cheek to her chest... Bob closes his tearful eyes and listens.
