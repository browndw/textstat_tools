	Look, I'm not like all the other kids in high school. I don't care about book reports and extra-credit. Teachers are idiots anyway. The only challenge out there for me is women. You see a girl you like. You pursue them. You conquer. You move on. It's exciting.

Sebastian places his hand over Kathryn's as she continues to rub herself. He thinks for a moment, then:
</DIRECTION>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Kathryn throws his hand off of hers.

	Why not?

</KATHRYN>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?

	B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KATHRYN>
<SEBASTIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.

	Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEBASTIAN>
<ANNETTE>

	I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.

ON KATHRYN: who watches from the door. A grin crosses her face.

</KATHRYN>
<CECILE>
	<DIALOGUE>

	I don't love him. I love Ronald.

I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.

	I haven't had a chance to read it, but I'm sure it goes something like "yahdah yahdah yahdah you mean a lot to me. Yahdah yahdah yahdah I hope we can be friends. Etcetera, etcetera, etcetera." You see, I expected your sort of bullshit so I took the liberty of phoning Ronald and Cecile. Right now they're having a little get together in my love shack at the Grand Central Hyatt. I'm so sorry he chose Cecile over you, but I promised him I would see you through your crisis.

</SEBASTIAN>
<KATHRYN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her. But it amused me to make you ashamed of it. You gave up on the first person you ever loved because I called you names. Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand, I never loved you, Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little toy I play with. And now you've completely blown it with her. I think that's the saddest thing I've ever heard.
