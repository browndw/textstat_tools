Friday night traffic as usual. Things appear to be backed up all the way to the valley. A cacophony of car horns rise up on the soundtrack as we slowly DISSOLVE INTO:

INT. FORD EXPLORER - NIGHT

A new 99' Explorer sits in the midst of the gridlock. Behind the wheel is hot teen heartthrob and Hollywood everybody BEN DAMON. Ben is handsome, studly, in his early 20s. However, aside from being just another pretty face in the city of angels he's also a cocky, arrogant prick. Ben's in the middle of a heated argument on his cell with his Agent, Cathy.

	God dammit Cathy I have no time for this crap! I'm supposed to be at the premiere of STAB 2 right Now, arm and arm with my girlfriend cause she's got a bit part in that over advertised piece of shit and I'm just going to humor her. You mena to tell me that in all your squandering the best you can do for me is A bit role in STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO?! Come on! It's just another cheap slasher flick! How dare you offer me such a role! I've done Shakespeare! I've worked with directors like DePalma and Scorcesse and you offer me this crap?! It's insulting. I should fire you and go to ICM.

Ben hangs up. He reclines back in his seat. Camera slowly pans out the windshield revealing the huge traffic pile up awaiting him. He's not going anywhere.

Ben opens the glove compartment. Papers scatter out. Ben reaches for a card.

At this point we know who the caller is. It's the nightmarish deep voice we've all come to know and hate from the first two films. It's never sounded so evil. So sexy.

The voice seems to have changed tones. It now sounds a lot harsher, angrier if you will.

	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</BEN>

	Maybe so, but right now, we play the game. First question, Your girlfriend's counting on you, Name your girlfriend's character in STAB 2?

Ben groans. He bangs his head against the steering wheel, if only he'd have paid attention to Christine he might have known this.

	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE B.G. we hear CHRISTINE's horrific screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The killer hangs up. Ben looks ahead, traffic is picking up. He puts the SUV into gear, peels out the nearest opening, narrowly avoiding collision. His car screeches down the off ramp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:

EXT. HOLLYWOOD SIGN - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
The SUV comes to a screeching halt alongside the hilly, narrow road. Ben jumps out of his car, cell phone in hand. He looks up at the towering sign standing ahead of him, contemplates. Does he really wanna go up there? He looks into his SUV, gets an idea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BACK --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
--is opened. Ben reaches in looking for a weapon. AN OLD BEACH CHAIR. Not gonna do the trick. A pair of old shoes. Nope. Then he finds it, a LOUISVILLE SLUGGER with "ACTORS AT BAT FOR BRAIN CANCER" written across it.

<BEN>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God I decided to do some community service.

Ben takes the bat, closes up the back of the SUV. He begins to walk towards the sign when suddenly --

HIS CELL RINGS.

Ben answers the call.

	Very good. You follow directions well. Now for the final part of the game. Put down the bat and approach the sign, slowly.

Ben makes a disgusted face, tosses the bat into the bushes. He approaches the sign, keeping his eyes trained in all directions.

</VOICE>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Reaction to what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Ben passes under the huge, pallid "H" in the sign. What seems at first like a gentle raindrop, beads down Ben's forehead. He rolls back his head, his legs turning to jelly, his eyes widening in horror.
</DIRECTION>
<BEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	OHMYGOD! NO! CHRISTINE --
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEN>
<DIRECTION>
Has been gutted from neck to groin. She has been fastened to the cross-bar in the "H" with heavy rope. Her lifeless body sways ever so gently in the Southern California wind. Utterly horrified, Ben staggers into the shadows, not seeing --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE GHOST as he rises from the void, knife in hand. In one quick, brutal stab, the knife is driven into Ben's spine. Ben screams as he's turned around, face to face with his attacker.

GALE WEATHERS, the flashy thirty-something news anchor and author of the WOODSBORO MURDERS. She sits behind a desk on the really ditzy, loud set for TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT, an ET style program with a live studio audience.
</DIRECTION>
<GALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning Hollywood. And today officially starts the Summer movie season. Opening the box office this week is Jeff Bridges and Tim Robins in Arlington Street, Eugene Levy and Jason Biggs in American Pastry, and Tori Spelling and David Schwimmer in STAB 2, based off my best selling book the WINDSOR MURDERS.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALE>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA pans across the audience. Many of them are dressed as the GHOST. A sea of white screaming faces. Very eerie and unsettling.
</DIRECTION>
<GALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I see a lot of the audience has dressed to the occasion. Today we have director of the upcoming STAB 3: RETURN TO WOODSBORO, Roman Bridger. Why don't we give Mr. Bridger a nice welcome to the set of Total Entertainment.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALE>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd goes wild with applause and faux-knife slashes as ROMAN BRIDGER, ravishingly handsome, 29, tall and stocky, enters stage dressed in a flashy white suit. He sits down on a chair beside Gale's desk, places a STAB 3 coffee mug beside Gale's hand.

	Well it's a honor to be here amongst so many fans of the genre. And I must say that any of you worried that Jerry Rapp, or Tori or David not returning to complete the STAB trilogy, have no fear, Roman is here. Aided with my excellent cast of newcomers I believe we're going to pull off one of the best Stabs yet.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Honestly, my life.

A eclectic hush falls over the crowd. Roman appears somewhat sinister in this light. Gale gazes deeply into Roman's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<GALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALE>
<ROMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well if you were in my shoes, dealing with those big Time Sunrise Studio producers like I do on a daily basis, you'd watch how quick your life goes from a Walt Disney picture to a Tobe Hooper flick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Roman smiles. The true costumed horror film buffs in the audience break into applause. Gale, somewhat distracted, other what not caring what this second rate director has to say, gazes at a costumed individual at the far corner of the set, watching from a half-open exit door. Now it could be just her imagination running away with her and her atmosphere but it almost appears as if the figure is pantomiming slitting his throat with a gleaming blade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LOUD BUZZING O.S. Gale is startled out of her skin. She looks up at a sign hanging over the stage. THE WORD "COMMERCIAL BREAK" is illuminated in flashing red light. Gale sighs, looks back to the exit. The GHOST is gone. She turns to Roman.

	</DIALOGUE>
</GALE>
<DETECTIVE_KINCAID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Both of them were found brutally murdered this morning under the Hollywood sign. Autopsy reports having come back to me yet but the bodies looked like something out one of the Stab films.

ANGELINA TYLER: 20. Extremely nadve looking. She won her part in STAB 3 playing Sidney through a phone in radio contest. She's timid, with short dark hair. Out of the entire cast, she is the closet to Sidney, they got.

<GALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Déjr vu-do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALE>
<DIRECTION>
The pair come to a halt on the driveway of what is supposed to be the Macher Residence. Everything from the smashed beer bottles in the garage, to the boat on the driveway is mimicked to a perfect t. Even a foam dummy Of TATUM RIELLY dangles from the doggy door, head squashed a bloody mess.

GALE stares at the swaying dummy, haunted.

VOICE(O.S.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Rielly? My name is Mark Kincaid. I'm with the L.A.P.D. Are you aware of last night's Events?

</DETECTIVE_KINCAID>
<DEWEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. A real tragedy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEWEY>
<DIRECTION>
Dewey stares daggers through Gale. There is a real bitter coldness between the two.
</DIRECTION>
<GALE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dewey, personal lives and pasts aside, this is about Sidney. We need to know where she is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALE>
<DEWEY>

Kincaid hands Dewey the ziplocked clipping. Dewey examines it, his fear slowly growing.
</DIRECTION>
<DEWEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I promised Sid I'd keep her in seclusion. I promised her nobody would ever find her. If you don't mind Detective, I'd like to approach her with this on my own and see what she'd like to do about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEWEY>
<DIRECTION>
Kincaid nods.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_KINCAID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's fine Mr. Rielly, but if anyone else should die, I'm going to have to get a warrant.

Dewey walks off camera. Kincaid puts his hand on Gale's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE_KINCAID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to have a little chat with the producers. Don't wander off. I may need you.
	</DIALOGUE>

Gale nods as Kincaid disappears into the backdrop of the set. A Shrill voice O.S.

<DIRECTION>
WOMAN(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GALE WEATHERS! Oh my God!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jennifer Jolie, an ambitious young starlet, playing GALE in the latest Stab, rushes towards her, with arms wide open. She's decked out in the flashy neon green ensemble Gale wore in the first film and even sports a fake shiner on her right eye. Gale is obviously pissed. She knows this actress and doesn't really want to be in her company very long.
</DIRECTION>
<Gale>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Gale>
<Jennifer>
	<DIALOGUE>

</Gale>
<Jennifer>

	You know I'm sorry that things didn't work out on '60 Minutes II', but 'Total Entertainment' that's a pretty good fall back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Jennifer>
<Gale>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. I'm sorry that things didn't work out with Brad Pitt, but being single, that's a pretty good fall back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Gale>
<Jennifer>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gives me more time for my work. After all, Gale Weathers, you're such a complex character.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Jennifer>
<Gale>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And to be played by an actress with such depth and range.

	</DIALOGUE>
</Jennifer>
<Gale>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</Gale>
<Jennifer>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The ruthless ambition, your private self-loathing, and that lost and lonely little girl inside.

	Lost and lonely what?

	I thought you were supposed to be in Woodsboro!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Gale>
<Dewey>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'm surprised you thought about me at all. Listen I gotta get back to trying to get hold of Sid. Besides, she's more important than you ever were.
	</DIALOGUE>
</Dewey>
<Gale>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait! Dewey we can work on this together! As a team! Like in the past!
	</DIALOGUE>
</Gale>
<Dewey>

	No really Gale, that's a sweet offer, but this time I'd like to catch the killer before the body count gets any higher.

Dewey walks away leaving Gale alone. Kincaid enters frame, talking to two producers. The elder, sixty-five year old BUDDY SHAYNE, a towering, hefty man with gray hair. The second, bigwig horror producer JOHN MILTON, a creepy fifty-something with penetrating eyes and a menacing demeanor. The two talk, ignoring Gale the entire time. She's almost eavesdropping on their conversation.
</DIRECTION>
<MILTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can assure you that security on the set will be at an all time high. Again, the deaths are sheer tragedy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILTON>
<DETECTIVE_KINCAID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'd hate to see the production shut down.

	Have you ever thought about acting? You've got just the right face.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUDDY>
<DETECTIVE_KINCAID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am kind of dedicated to my job. Although I do enjoy taking acting classes on my weekends. I grew up around these studios anyway. I know my way around. My Uncle was a screenwriter for PARAMOUNT.

Before Kincaid can finish, Gale buts in.

</GALE>
<MILTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen Lois Lane, I love your show and all but last month I happened to catch your little segment on me and how my wife left me because I'm a sex addict who enjoys screwing fifteen year old girls. It was a real eye opener my lawyers are still thinking about bringing to your superior's attentions.

MAUREEN PRESCOTT'S GHOSTLY WRAITH is pressed up against the window. She's wearing a tattered, blood soaked night shift.

<RANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if you're watching this tape, it means as I feared, I did not survive these killings here at Windsor College. Anyway, the reason I am here is to help you, so that my death will not be in vain. That my life's work, will help save some other poor soul from getting mutilated. If this killer does come back, and he's for real, there are a few things that you gotta remember. Is this simply another sequel? Well, if it is, same rules apply. But, here's the critical thing. If you find yourself dealing with an unexpected backstory, and a preponderance of exposition, then the sequel rules do not apply. Because you are not dealing with a sequel, you are dealing with the concluding chapter of a trilogy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RANDY>
<DEWEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A trilogy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEWEY>
<RANDY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. It's a rarity in the horror field, but it does exist, and it's a force to be reckoned with, because true trilogies are all about going back to the beginning and discovering something that wasn't true from the get go. 'Godfather', 'Jedi', all revealed something that we thought was true, that wasn't true. So if it is a trilogy you are dealing with, here are some super trilogy rules. One, you got a killer who's gonna be super human. Stabbing him won't work, shooting him won't work, basically in the third one, you gotta cryogenically freeze his head, decapitate him, or blow him up. Number two; anyone including the main character can die. This means you, Sid. I'm sorry, it's the final chapter. It can be fuckin 'Reservoir Dogs' by the time this thing is through. Number three; the past will come back to bite you in the ass! Whatever you think you know about the past, forget it. The past is not at rest, any sins you think were committed in the past are about to break out and destroy you. NUMBER FOUR,Never, ever under any circumstances go running off by yourself, cause if Friday the 13th has taught us anything, it's that the next time we're gonna see you, you're gonna have a fence post jutting out from your back. So in closing, let me say good luck, God Speed, and for some of you, I'll see you soon, cause the rules say, some of you ain't gonna make it. I didn't, not if you're watching this tape.

	It was in the 70's, everything was different. I was well known for my parties, Rina knew what they were.

Click the killer hangs up. Sid pockets her phone. She looks up, and is startled out of fright. Posted alongside the sound stageis a huge production poster for STAB 3 with a life-size GHOST wielding a big knife. Sid knows she's in the right place. The door leading inside is half-open.

Didn't like it at all. And once I supplied the motive, all the kid needed was a few pointers.
