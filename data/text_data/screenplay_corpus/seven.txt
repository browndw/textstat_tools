:SC: EXT. COUNTRY CHURCH -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The white cross on the church steeple stands against blue sky. The church bell rings, resonating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mass has let out. Small church, small congregation. The dirt road in front is lined with pick-up trucks and parishioners on foot heading to outlying farms and homes. An old two-story house sits across the road. Lone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. OLD HOUSE -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sunlight comes through the soot on the windows, more brown than bright. SOMERSET, 45, in a suit and tie, stands in this empty second-story room. He looks around, at the ceiling, at the worn wooden floor, at the peeling wallpaper on the walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset walks to one wall where the current wallpaper is peeled away to reveal flowery wallpaper underneath. He runs his finger across one of the pale red roses that decorates the older paper. He pushes the grime away, brings the rose out more clearly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls at the edge of the paper, carefully ripping off a roughly squared section with the rose at its center.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He studies it in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. OLD HOUSE -- DAY

<DIRECTION>
Birds sing. Somerset stands, pondering the forested landscape.

<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is something wrong?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>

Somerset does not respond. The MAN, in an ill-fitting real estate jacket, is seated on the hood of a dirty Ford Thunderbird. He holds a check and a booklet of receipts.

<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I'd say this place is about as normal as places get.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The man walks over to hand over a receipt. Somerset accepts the receipt, folds it. Somerset smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<SOMERSET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That is exactly what I mean. Strange.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOMERSET>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset looks back at the house. The man does not understand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. AMTRACK TRAIN -- DAY -- (CREDIT SEQUENCE BEGINS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset is in a window seat, smoking a cigarette, looking out the speeding train. He is near the back of the car, away from the few other passengers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside, farms, small homes and lawns pass. The entire panorama is dappled by the rays of the soon setting sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light flickers across Somerset's placid face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. AMTRACK TRAIN -- LATER DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train is nearly full. Somerset has his suitcase on the aisle seat beside him. He has a hardcover book unopened on his lap. He still stares out the window, but his disposition has soured. The train is passing an ugly, swampy field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A car's burnt-out skeleton sits rusting in the bracken. A little further on, two dogs are fighting, circling, attacking, their coats matted with blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset turns his head to watch the dogs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Away in the field, another dog sprints to join the fight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. AMTRACK TRAIN -- EARLY EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Passing urban streets below. Slums. Smashed cars. People stand on the corners, under the bleak glow of street lamps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset's suitcase is by the window. Somerset is now in the aisle seat, reading his book.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SOMERSET'S APARTMENT -- LATER NIGHT -- (END CREDITS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Curtains closed. The SOUNDS of the CITY are here as they will be everywhere in this story. A CAR ALARM SHRIEKS. Somerset's life is packed in many moving boxes, except for clothing in a closet and hundreds of books on shelves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset, dressed only in his underwear, lays back on the bed. He reaches to the nightstand, to a wooden, pyramidical metronome.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He frees the metronome's weighted swingarm so it moves back and forth. Swings to the left... TICK, swings to the right... TICK. Tick, tick, tick, measured and steady.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset situates on the bed, closes his eyes. The metronome's ticking competes with the sound of the car alarm. Somerset's face tightens as he concentrates on the metronome.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes close tighter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tick, tick, tick... the swingarm moves evenly. Somerset's breathing deepens. The car ALARM seems QUIETER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tick, tick, tick. Somerset continues his concentration.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The METRONOME is the ONLY SOUND. Somerset's face relaxes slightly as he begins to fall asleep. Tick, tick, tick...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. CHINESE BODEGA/CITY STREETS -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAVID MILLS, 31, exits with a bagged 40oz bottle of beer. He is a lean, attractive man, constantly coiled, eyes always smoldering. FOLLOW as he walks quickly past iron-gated storefronts. He crosses the street under elevated subway tracks. A train roars overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mills watches it as he walks on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blue sparks spit off the third rail and illuminate Mills, throwing his shadow long down the deserted street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. URBAN STREET OF ROW HOMES -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This rotting neighborhood lives in the shadow of a single fat skyscraper. Mills walks, looks at the broken refrigerators and pieces of junk in the gutter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead in the street, TWO YOUNG THUGS struggle with a crowbar to break into the trunk of a parked car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mills draws near. One thug looks up, doesn't think Mills will be a problem, continues prying. Mills stops, calm.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that your car, man?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLS>
<FIRST_THUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck do you care?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRST_THUG>

Mills pauses, switches his beer bottle to his other hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does that car belong to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLS>
<DIRECTION>
The thugs look at each other, gauging. They face Mills.
</DIRECTION>
<FIRST_THUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, it's my car, alright? Fuck off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRST_THUG>
<MILLS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're telling me that's your car?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLS>
<DIRECTION>
The second thug starts the long way round the car.
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_THUG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, for some strange reason, I don't believe you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_THUG>
<DIRECTION>
Mills gives a "isn't that silly" laugh, shifts his gaze --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sees the first thug slide the crowbar so it's held as a weapon.
</DIRECTION>
<FIRST_THUG>
<DIRECTION>
(steps forward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can fucking suck my...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRST_THUG>
<DIRECTION>
Mills swiftly finishes that sentence by smashing his bottle against the first thug's head. The thug falls, swings blindly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second thug moves from the side, brings out a knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mills averts, swings, pounds the side of his fist into the second thug's face -- CRACK. Broken nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second thug stumbles back, drops the knife, his nose squirting blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mills turns, enraged, breathing hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first thug is screaming, trying to stand. Mills takes one step, punts the first thug's head. The crowbar clatters away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mills is in the process of kicking a man when he's down, when the second thug grabs him from behind, pulls him backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mills clutches at the thug's arm, trying to avoid a choke-hold. They both struggle spastically. The thug's winning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gurgling, gasping for air, Mills shifts his weight, drops to one knee and spins the thug, slamming him against the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mills breaks loose, grabs a handful of the second thug's hair and holds the man's head against the car's side window. Mills' free hand pounds the thug's face: once, twice -- third time's the charm as the window shatters. The thug goes out cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mills backs off, still incensed. He rubs his throat, looking at the two prone men. Slowly, he regains some composure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a keychain from his pocket. He unlocks the door of the car, loads one of the thugs into the back seat. He walks to collect the other thug off the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset picks items off a moving box: keys, wallet, homicide badge. Finally, he opens the hardcover book from the train.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the pages, he takes the pale, wallpaper rose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. TENEMENT APARTMENT -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A wall is stained by a starburst of blood. Somerset stands, melancholy, looking at a body on the floor under a sheet near a sawed-off shotgun. The apartment is gloomy. DETECTIVE TAYLOR, 52, looks through a notepad.
</DIRECTION>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neighbors heard them screaming at each other. It was nothing new or unusual. But, then they heard the gun go off. Boom, boom... both barrels.

Taylor shifts his weight, impatient, annoyed.
</DIRECTION>
<TAYLOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is a done deal. All but the paperwork.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAYLOR>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset looks at a coloring-book open on the coffee table. There are crayons beside it. Somerset picks the book up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He flips through: crudely colored pictures.
</DIRECTION>
<SOMERSET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did their son see it happen?

A body-bag is carried through the crowd around the tenement doors. Somerset follows. Mills follows Somerset. They walk towards the end of the filthy block.

:SC: INT. SOMERSET'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- EARLY MORNING

<DIRECTION>
Somerset lies asleep on the bed. It is still dark outside. Relatively quiet. The PHONE beside the inactive metronome RINGS HARSHLY. Somerset awakens suddenly, rankled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is barely becoming light outside. Mills can't sleep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alone in a double bed. He sits up, frustrated. Sits on the edge of the bed and looks around. The room is a shambles, filled with moving boxes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light coming through the window glows upon a football trophy on one box. Large and noble, a golden player stands in frozen motion at the trophy's pinnacle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mills looks at the trophy and a fond smile forms on his face. The CLINKING of DISHES and SILVERWARE is HEARD from another room. Mills looks at the closed bedroom door, troubled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across a living room full of boxes, TRACY MILLS, 30, a beautiful woman, stands in her bathrobe. She's upset about something, takes dishes out of boxes, puts them on the kitchenette counter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls a mug from a clump of newspaper and pours some tea from a pot on the stove. Blowing on the steaming tea, she leans back on the counter, looks over at the closed bedroom door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tea is too hot to sip, and as Tracy is placing the mug on the counter behind her the PHONE RINGS. Startled, she releases the mug too close to the edge. It falls --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crashes to the floor, shatters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, HALLWAY -- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A dark hall. Somerset and Mills stand with OFFICER DAVIS, 28, a beefy, uniformed cop. Light from a camera's flash spills in from the nearby kitchen. Davis hands Somerset two flashlights.
</DIRECTION>
<SOMERSET>

	At what time did you confirm the death?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOMERSET>
<DAVIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like I said, we didn't touch anything, but we were on scene at like o-five- hundred, so he's had his face in a plate of spaghetti for about half an hour.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, wait, wait. You didn't check him? You didn't check vital signs?

	Believe me, he's gone. Unless he's breathing spaghetti sauce now.

Davis leaves, eyeing Mills. Mills watches him. Somerset hands Mills a flashlight, takes out surgical gloves.
</DIRECTION>
<SOMERSET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wonder what exactly was the point of the conversation you were about to get into?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOMERSET>
<MILLS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And, I wonder how many times Officer Davis there has found a supposedly dead man who didn't really die until Davis was back in the patrol car calling the morgue and eating a powdered donut.

Somerset snaps one glove over his hand and checks the fit.

:SC: INT. APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER packs up, hoists his camera and equipment bag. Somerset and Mills enter. Mills puts on his own pair of rubber gloves. The grubby kitchen is small; barely room for four people to move around in. The photographer exits:
</DIRECTION>
<PHOTOGRAPHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bon appetit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PHOTOGRAPHER>
<DIRECTION>
The only light is a murky green illumination from the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light bathes an OBESE MAN who is slumped forward in a kitchen chair, face-down-dead in a plate of spaghetti.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sizable kitchen table's green tablecloth is covered with soiled paper plates. The plates hold bits of half-eaten sandwiches, potatoes, donuts and other junk-food remnants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mills and Somerset turn on their flashlights. Mills points his at the green bulb above. Aluminum foil has been wrapped around the bulb to focus the light on the corpse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset sweeps the room with his flashlight. He goes to the body and kneels beside it. There's a rope tied around the man's wide gut. Mills comes to stand beside Somerset.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess that makes it homicide.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLS>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset crouches lower, uses a pen to lift one of the dead man's pants cuffs. Rope is tied around the purplish ankle.

Mills examines the knots behind the chair's back. Shines his flashlight on the man's belly.

	Still, he could have tied himself in. To make it look like murder.

Somerset stands, points his flashlight: the obese man's stiff hands are clutching utensils. A knife in the left hand, a fork sticking straight up in the right with a hunk of meat hanging skewered. Cockroaches swarm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mills turns to the sink and stove. Each burner of the stove has a used pot or pan on it. There's food slopped everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw a guy once... committed suicide, but he wanted to make sure his family could collect insurance money, right?

Somerset walks to the room's only window. The window has been painted over with black paint. he touches the window with his pinkie finger. The paint is still wet.

The walls are covered in mirrors. Other cops watch Mills as they pass, checking out the new kid. Mills keeps punching, skillfully.

The train clatters through a tunnel, packed full, WHEELS SCREECHING. The lights go on and off. Passengers read tabloids, stare at their feet, study advertisements on the walls; anything to avoid making eye-contact with others.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All races, creeds and colors; all ugly, forlorn human beings. Tracy stands fatigued, holding a handrail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bag-lady, crusted with dirt, reeking, pushes her way through the crowd. A man presses against Tracy in an attempt to let the bag-lady pass. Tracy switches hands on the rail, turns sideways to make room. She looks down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On one seat, a man, quite normal looking, sits holding a porno magazine, THREE-WAY FUCK, in one hand. His other hand is in his pocket. He's obviously masturbating himself in his pants. No one else notices or seems to care.

<DIRECTION>
The refrigerator had hidden a space on the wall where the dust has been cleared. In that space: a circle, smeared in grease, and a note taped in the center of the circle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset's BEEPER starts BEEPING. Mills leans to read:

Somerset takes out his beeper, looks at the LED window. He looks up at Mills, like they've received very bad news.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. LUXURY APARTMENTS, HALLWAY -- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A marble hallway. A DETECTIVE, 50, nervously chewing his nails, quickly leads Mills and Somerset past cops and forensics.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said to myself, I'm not going to screw around with this. Nope. Fuck that. It's still pretty fresh meat. I called the medical examiner... he's coming.

The detective opens the door. FOLLOW Somerset and Mills --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, LIVING ROOM -- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gross, deep yellow light comes through the only window with its blinds up. The light anoints a NUDE MAN displayed, dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DETECTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...this is your guy who did this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DETECTIVE>
<DIRECTION>
The nude dead man's legs are folded under him as if he were kneeling, and he's bent forward, chin on the floor. His eyes are open, his arms outstretched before him. Mills and Somerset walk to either side of the man.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The detective closes the door, bites his thumbnail. The apartment is on a high floor, so it's quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset sees the window has been covered with a sheet of yellow gel, stapled in place to produce the colored light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mills examines the corpse. There's a chair one foot behind the nude man. It's an elegant leather chair, drenched in blood. There's a carving knife on the carpet in the middle of a huge stain of blood under the chair. Mills looks at pieces of cut rope on the floor behind the chair. The rope is knotted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset crouches beside the body. There's a big piece of flesh missing from the man's left side, as if the love-handle had been lopped off. Hundreds of pennies lie scattered under and around the man. The man's hands are palms up, fingers wrapped around more pennies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mills walks over to examine a scale on the floor between the corpse and the doorway. It's an old-fashioned counter-balance scale with two suspended dishes on a see-saw arm. In the high dish: the hunk of flesh missing from the man's side. In the low dish: a one pound counterweight.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLS>
<DIRECTION>
(to Somerset)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A pound of flesh.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLS>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset stands and walks backwards to view the entire scene from near the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks worried, vaguely frightened. He turns his head, looks to a far wall. Beside a big, abstract, constructivist painting, there's a note pinned up inside a triangular smear of blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, CAPTAIN'S OFFICE -- EARLY EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An office full of pictures, books and mugsheets, yet it is meticulously well kept. The CAPTAIN, 50, sits at his tidy desk. He's dressed conservatively. Mills and Somerset sit before him. Somerset reads from a photocopy of the note they just found.
</DIRECTION>
<SOMERSET>

	"One pound of flesh, no more no less. No cartilage, no bone, but only flesh. This task done, and he would go free."

WEDNESDAY

<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. CITY STREET -- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A vendor lays out a pile of tabloid newspapers at his busy newsstand. The headline: SECOND BIZARRE MURDER!, in huge print.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vendor lays out another tabloid pile. Headline: "GIVE ME MY POUND OF FLESH," SAYS BLOODTHRISTY KILLER, in big, red letters. The vendor places a third pile beside the others: SICKENING MURDERS - EXCLUSIVE DETAILS INSIDE!!!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. PRECINCT HOUSE, SOMERSET'S OFFICE -- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Old office. Moving boxes on the floor. The single window faces a billboard. Somerset works on a manual typewriter. He types hunt-and-peck, slowly. His paperwork is on the desk in two sloppy piles. A jarring SOUND is HEARD OFFSCREEN, like fingers on a blackboard. Somerset looks up, irritated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WORKMAN is working at the open door, holding the source of the sound, a razor blade he's using to scrape the words DETECTIVE SOMERSET off the door's window.
</DIRECTION>
<WORKMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WORKMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset turns back to typing. The captain steps in, looks at the workman, then drops more papers on Somerset's desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As always, the neatly groomed captain clenches his jaw. He looks around. Two of boxes on the floor have DETECTIVE MILLS written across them. The captain picks one up, puts it on top of the other. He sits, watching Somerset, starts straightening the forms on the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you going to do with yourself out there, Somerset?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<SOMERSET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get a job. Maybe on a farm. I'll fix up my house.

	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset reclines, looks at the captain.
</DIRECTION>
<SOMERSET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you read in the paper today, about the man who took his dog for a walk? And how he was mugged? And, his wallet was taken, and his watch. Then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes. It happened last night. Not far from here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOMERSET>
<CAPTAIN>

</DIRECTION>
<SOMERSET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. You're absolutely right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOMERSET>
<DIRECTION>
The captain lays the paperwork down in two neat stacks.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were made for this work, Somerset. I can't believe you're going to trade it all in for a tool belt and a fishing rod. But, I guess I'm wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>
<DIRECTION>
The captain leaves. Somerset looks up now that the captain's gone. He grabs the paper piles and ruffles them back to their disheveled state. He looks at the workman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The workman is looking at Somerset, has a rag in his hand to remove the last remnants of Somerset's name.
</DIRECTION>
<SOMERSET>
<DIRECTION>
(angrily)
</DIRECTION>

	Put a little elbow grease into it!

:SC: INT. LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, LIVING ROOM -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The grandly furnished apartment where the second murder took place has been dusted for prints and searched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two female forensics are at work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. LUXURY APARTMENT/CRIME SCENE, MASTER BEDROOM -- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mills is seated in front of a long writing desk with many drawers. All the drawers are open. Mills looks through letters and stationary. Nothing of use. He tosses the pile back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He sits back, frustrated, yanks off one rubber glove, looks around the room. Books have been taken off their shelves, the bed has been stripped. The room has been given the once over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The victim's family photographs hang in expensive frames on one wall. There are at least thirty photos of various sizes: ancestors, sons and daughters, grandchildren and friends. An over-weight forensic, CHRIS, 35, leans in through the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mills looks up and Chris shakes his head glumly.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He must have left us another puzzle to solve... somewhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLS>
<CHRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll keep looking, but we're running out of possibilities.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Chris leaves and Mills stands to stretch. Something catches Mills' eye. He walks over to the door, curious. At the base of the open door, there's a ball of paper wedged under to act as a doorjamb. Mills puts his glove back on, pulls the ball out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He uncrumples the paper as the door slowly swings shut. The page has a drawing on it, of the sun with waves of heat at its edges. There is a single eye in the center of the sun.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An arrow is drawn in dried blood on the back of the closing door. Mills notices this and pushes the door closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blood arrow points to the side and up, seems to be pointing to the photo gallery wall. Mills goes to examine the photos.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His eyes search each photo... one by one... till he sees it:
</DIRECTION>
<MILLS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILLS>
<DIRECTION>
A framed photo of a falsely pretty, middle-aged woman smiling and wearing pearls. Under the glass, on the photo itself, circles have been drawn in blood around the woman's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. CITY STREETS, DOWNTOWN -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An assault on the senses. Crowded streets and sidewalks. On every corner, in every doorway, on every stairwell -- freaks, junkies, punks, leather boys and motorcycle girls. A few tourists wander in the mix, heedful of the dangers around them. Buildings border narrowly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset walks against the stream. He carries a file.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAR HORNS HOWL. MUSIC BLASTS from the entrances of clubs. REGGAE from one club is soon OVERTAKEN by RAP from a second story window. TECHNO-POP blasts from the tattoo parlor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset does not like this place, views it with disdain. He walks to avoid two men fighting on the ground. The men are pulling hair and pounding each other idiotically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset takes a cigarette from a full pack, lights it as he crosses through the traffic jam in the street. A VAGRANT steps up with his hand out.
</DIRECTION>
<VAGRANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Spare me a cigarette, money-grip? Spare me a cigarette?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VAGRANT>
<SOMERSET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. Last one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOMERSET>
<DIRECTION>
He walks on. We BEGIN to HEAR JAZZ MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. JAZZ CLUB -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A club at capacity. The JAZZ MUSIC CONTINUES like a slow, cool breeze from a JAZZ TRIO on a platform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The air is thick with smoke. Yuppies sit elbow to elbow with the last members of the beat generation. Everyone's drinking beer, smoking pot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset crosses the club, looking for someone. He takes a tissue from his pocket, rips pieces off and jams the pieces in his ears. At the back of the club, a major-league bouncer stands in front of a closed door. Somerset shows his badge and the bouncer steps aside with reservation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. NARROW STAIRWELL -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The walls are black. Somerset opens the door, enters, walks down the long flight of stairs. As Somerset descends, the JAZZ MUSIC FADES and is ENGULFED by the sound of SPEED METAL. DEAFENING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the bottom, Somerset opens another door. He enters --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. UNDERGROUND ART GALLERY -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A narrow room. SPEED METAL is even LOUDER. This is a private art party. The people are lizard-like, pale. Men and women priding themselves on their gauntness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset passes canvases on the walls. Pointlessly abstract paintings. Splatters, smears and blobs of color.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Party-people stand in front of these "works," engrossed. Somerset slides past, not interested in the art, jamming the tissue further in his ears. He spots his objective.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WILLIAM McCRACKEN, 42, stands inside a circle of admirers. He is dressed like a pauper, his baggy clothing stained with many colors of paint. He wears dark sunglasses, bored by the bleached-blonde girl whispering in his ear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset worms his way to stand in front of William. The party- goers turn their attention to this intrusion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William looks up, pushes the girl away. He takes off his sunglasses. His eyes are badly bloodshot and listless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks Somerset over... and then grins, glad to see him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MILL'S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mills stands brooding over a photocopy of the picture of the woman with her eyes circled in blood. He looks overworked, drinks coffee. His desk is swamped with files.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Mills looks to a t.v. on a table, picks up a remote, increases the volume. On the screen, MARTIN TALBOT, 47, source of the voice, stands before reporters. He's a powerful presence, with a gold tooth in the front of his mouth.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Mills points the remote, turns the t.v. off as reporters crowd Talbot. Mills stares at the blank screen, dispirited.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the room, Tracy stands in the doorway. Mills does not see her. He looks at the photocopy and sits at his desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tracy watches him, great concern in her sad eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. WILLIAM'S STUDIO/APARTMENT -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset walks through this vast artist's studio, a converted warehouse space filled with canvases. It's clear the works at the underground art gallery were William's. William climbs a ladder to a loft storage space. He moves cautiously, like he's not quite up to the task.
</DIRECTION>
<WILLIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I always figured that's the only reason you and I used to be friends. Because I was a friend of hers.

William hands the painting to Somerset, walks to a director's chair facing a paint-splashed canvas on an easel. He is a used- up man, bound in an apathy-induced haze. He sits, picks up a squeeze bottle of orange paint from a table of supplies.

	</DIALOGUE>
</WILLIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset starts unwrapping the painting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
William "paints," using the squeeze bottles and by flicking saturated brushes so that the paint flies against the canvas. Most times, he's not even looking at the canvas or colors he's using. He looks over his shoulder at Somerset.

William lays a book down, finds a page. He opens it to Somerset. There is a circle to the side of the text. It says GLUTTONY under the circle.

:SC: EXT. CITY STREET, PORNO DISTRICT -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bright, tawdry intersection. Neon swirls and circuit-bulbs on porno theatres provide the flash. Cars, taxies, and barkers urging sexual indulgence from doorways provide the noise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The streets and sidewalks are crowded with lonely humans, mostly men, looking around, sizing up promises made on porno placards: FUN WITH NUDES, BIG BOOBS, NAKED DESIRE, etc. The usual contingent of abnormal cretins wanders in the crowd, looking for someone to hurt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE through the crowds. Meet JOHN, a balding, middle-aged man, wearing thick glasses. There is not a single thing strange or unusual about his appearance. FOLLOW him as he walks. He's nervous, looking at the porno palaces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His sweaty hand clutches a Bible tight against his chest. He doesn't feel comfortable being here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John walks to a corner, waits for the light so he may cross. A grotesque STREET PREACHER approaches waving his own Bible. People walk away from him, so he confronts John.

Finally the light changes. John turns and spits in the preacher's face. The preacher recoils as John crosses quickly.

John hurries between cars in the crosswalk. The preacher curses from the corner, his voice drowned out in traffic.

People pass on the sidewalk. John is amongst them, but he stops, looking up at something offscreen.

He's looking at a bright red storefront adorned with red neon: THE HOT HOUSE. Massage parlor. The Hot House's BARKER notices John's interest.
</DIRECTION>
<BARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Interesting isn't it, friend? You like that, you like girls, then come on in.

Mills gets in, puts his coffee on the dash and tosses the art books in a box. He closes the door. Alone with the sound of the rain. He wipes water off his face, looks at his tired eyes in the rearview mirror.
</DIRECTION>

He reaches in the box of books, takes out copies of The Canterbury Tales and Dante's Purgatory. He makes a face, opens Dante's Purgatory:

Mills turns to a bookmark, rests the book on the steering wheel. He reads. He bites his lip, leaning close to the words. He concentrates, mouths some of the words to himself.

A windowless classroom. The captain stands in front with a white screen at his side. The face of a black man, 25, ZERO, is projected on the screen from a slide projector.

	His street name is Zero, as some of you know. His prints were found at the scene by Detectives Mills and Somerset.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CAPTAIN>

FIVE hardened POLICE OFFICERS, four men, one woman, sit in chairs facing the captain. They all wear bullet-proof vests with "POLICE" stencil-painted across them. Somerset and Mills sit in back, drinking coffee, still trying to wake up.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>

(CONT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, Zero has a long, long history of mental illness. Serious illness. He was all over your television sets two years ago after he raped and killed a seventy-three year old woman. He got off, as the saying goes, on a technicality. So we watched him on the streets, and he went out of circulation about a year ago.

Near the balcony railing, overlooking the main floor, Mills sits before a computer card catalog. He reads the computer screen, unsure. He sets down his pad and pencil, cracks his knuckles, begins typing on the keyboard. The computer gives off a quiet BEEP. Pleased, Mills reads the screen. Types.

From a mahogany hallway lined with book-carts, we look THROUGH a big WINDOW into the head librarian's office. The elderly head librarian is at a computer, chain-smoking, working the keyboard. Mills alternates talking on the telephone and reading things off his pad to the librarian.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We cannot hear them, but it's clear Mills is excited as he walks back and forth, hovering over the librarian, looking at her computer screen, making suggestions, then walking to monitor a dot-matrix printer which spews a waterfall of computer paper onto the floor. Back and forth goes Mills, carrying the phone. He closes the pad, puts it in his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The librarian finishes typing, sits back, done. Mills hangs up the phone, goes to put it on the librarian's desk, but the cord drags, knocks a pile of books off a table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The librarian is irritated, goes to pick up the books. Mills is apologizing. He goes to watch the printer. He tears the last sheet's perforated edge, gathers the huge pile of printed paper off the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Prize in hand, Mills is so grateful he bends to give the old woman a kiss on the cheek, but she pushes him away, now even more annoyed. Mills goes to leave, knocks over another pile of books. Before he can assist, the angry librarian points to the door. Mills obeys like a scolded child, exits.

Somerset walks down the center aisle between deteriorated pews. rats run. Pigeons flap about, dirt drifting off their wings.

Somerset shines his flashlight forward to the rather barren altar. To the right, at the top of the altar stairs, there is a stone statue of a saint with his arms outstretched, welcoming.

Somerset notices two ends of a thick rope suspended from the ceiling above the center of the altar. He looks up, following the rope with the flashlight, when he notices something else. His mouth drops. Bleeker looks, and is equally horrified.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above them, in the beam of light: seven large paintings on panels tilted forward at the curve of the ceiling above the altar. Seven ancient paintings; seven deadly sins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beam of light moves to the panel to the immediate right: a painting of a man kneeling, grasping at gold coins all around him. The man is naked, as was the victim of the greed murder. The chief color in this panel is a vulgar yellow.
</DIRECTION>

The third in the series is sloth. The painting, in indigo, shows a man at rest in a pliant bed. The skeletal man's eyes are rolled up in their sockets. He is covered in slimy worms.

Mills jumps up. He moves towards the railing. Somerset sits up and takes out his own gun. The stairwell is silent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mills peers over the railing into the stairwell's center, gun pointed. A HEAVY METALLIC CLICK is HEARD. Echoes. Mills leaps backwards as bullets begin raining up from below, accompanied by the SOUND of an UZI SUB-MACHINE GUN FIRING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset lays flat as he and Mills crawl away from the railing, which is being shredded along with the floor around it. Bullets soar unceasingly. Mills and Somerset hold their hands over their ears. Pieces of wood and plaster fly everywhere. The uzi stops and the man can be HEARD RUNNING again.

Mills gets up, covered in debris. He runs down into the smoky stairwell. Somerset rolls over, gets up more slowly.

Mills rushes out into this weedy, overgrown courtyard. He sees a thin vagrant sleeping on the building's junk-pile, then looks all directions. His eyes are wild. His gun hand is shaking.

The courtyard is surrounded by alleyways. The shooter could have gone anywhere and is nowhere in sight. Somerset comes out, face wet with sweat. Mills holsters his gun.

Sarah and Billy wait in the hall. Somerset hits a switch on the wall and a lamp illuminates on a desk. The desk is in the center of the room, facing them. The walls, floor to ceiling, are covered with visual stimuli; pictures, paintings, newspaper articles, sketches, writings on napkins and notebook sheets, etc. Mostly religious images.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The far wall is made of shelves full of books. Mills goes to the desk while Somerset goes to the books. Books: An Overview of Theology, Handbook of Firearms, A History of the World, Summa Theologica, U.S. Criminal Law Review, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mills looks at the desktop. The surface is marked by dried oil colors. There are tubes of paint laying out, boxes of water colors and pastels. Mills looks at one corner of the desk. An orange candle has been allowed to burn down. The wax trail goes all the way down the edge of the desk to a puddle on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset walks, studying one wall of pin-ups. There are articles about the seven deadly sins, pages from art books, pencil drawings of Satan and Christ, and drawings of the seven paneled tableau paintings which inspired the murders. Somerset lifts several sheets to note the paper scraps are spaced so tightly and completely that they cover the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the desk, Mills opens the top middle drawer. It's empty except for The Holy Bible. he opens another drawer, which is filled with at least forty empty aspirin bottles.

Somerset takes one notebook down. It is a thick composition book with a marbled black and white cover. Inside, the pages are covered in small handwritten sentences and drawings.

Somerset takes down another notebook and opens it. Same as the first; scribbled sentences and sketches.

Mills opens a final drawer to find a rosary and a revolver.

Mills enters the bathroom. It has been converted into a darkroom, lit by red bulbs, with strips of film hanging from the ceiling. WATER is HEARD DRIPPING.

Mills opens the shower curtain. Prints hang drying, clipped to wires over the tub.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. JOHN DOE'S APARTMENT, THE PAINTROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset enters from the room of notebooks. This is John Doe's art studio. Windowless, with several easels holding paintings in various states of completion. The walls are covered with photos and finished canvases, except for one wall which is blank white. Somerset turns the lights off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a 16mm film projector on a table, facing the blank wall. Somerset turns the projector on. It clatters to life, running a piece of film.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The film is spliced into a non-stop loop. Somerset watches the wall, light strobing across him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The projector shows an image of clouds drifting, with strange, superimposed angels in flowing robes floating jerkily. It's like an old, Hollywood version of heaven.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The image switches abruptly to fire and tormented souls laboring around a pit of molten goo. Like Heaven, it's a scratched piece of film from Hollywood's early days.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset turns to examine one of the paintings on an easel. The painting has been skillfully rendered, in small, controlled brush strokes. It shows a modern city street, stylized, dark. The city is peopled by mutated humans and freakish beasts. Sinners in the streets, killing, raping, pillaging. Buildings are burning, blood is being spilled. It's dense with detail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset walks to another painting which is covered by a drop cloth. He removes the cloth, uncovers a huge canvas. We do not see the painting, but when Somerset does his features turn grim.

Somerset motions to the huge canvas. Mills looks:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The painting is frightening collage, thick with paint. The photo of Mills and Somerset has been incorporated in bits and pieces. Duplicate images: enlarged eyes, hands, faces. The faces have been ripped, scratched, mutilated. Grainy eyes with holes jabbed in them are mounted in paint beside chopped broken arms. Mills' head is on Somerset's body, and vice versa. It's like a sick, fragmented vision of a slaughter house floor.

Somerset moves from the sink, looks in the bathtub. The tub and shower walls are splattered with blood. The tub has a few inches of water in it. The water is cloudy red and bits of gauze float in it. Somerset jiggles the drain's knob.

Mills is in a dark mood. He and Dr. O'Neill stand by a WOMAN who hangs by a noose from the ceiling. The woman's head has been bandaged sloppily with white gauze and tape. Her eyes have been left uncovered. The gauze is stained red in small spots.

The woman hangs low, so her feet are inches from the floor where piles of dried flowers and a cordless telephone lay. There's a chair knocked over behind her.

O'Neill's going through his black bag. A violet, velvet curtain has been draped on the wall in the corner, behind a full length mirror. The mirror reflects the corpse. A seven-pointed star is smeared in lipstick on the mirror's surface, with the words I DID NOT KILL HER, SHE WAS GIVEN A CHOICE below.

John Doe watches Somerset's car leave. Doe turns his attention to Tracy, who hurries along the other side of the street. Tracy looks back, enters her apartment building, digs out her keys. She gets through the door and climbs stairs, disappearing.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mills and Tracy are asleep in their bed. Mills' eyes shift under their lids. Rapid eye movement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SOUND is HEARD from the other room. Mills awakens. He lays still a moment, then gets up, slowly, reaches to take his gun off the bedside table. He grabs his pants from a chair, slides into them.
</DIRECTION>

:SC: INT. MILLS' APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM/KITCHENETTE -- NIGHT

Mills opens the bedroom door and enters quietly, gun held up. He moves, crouching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the dark, objects in the room and shadows from windows form complex, confusing patterns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mills walks between moving boxes, attempting to remain silent. He aims the gun from point to point as he advances.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gets to a closet. Staying on one side, he opens the door and points his gun. He carefully separates the clothing hanging there. Nothing. No one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns to look over the room. It's the first time we see it in Mills' eyes -- real fear.

The door to the apartment is wide open.

Mills shoves the rooftop door open. It creaks as it swings.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. MILLS' APARTMENT, BEDROOM -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mills returns to the bedroom, still holding his gun up. He looks at Tracy asleep in the bed. The room begins to RATTLE a little as a subway train is again passing underground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks to the window and checks the lock. He halts. He opens the window and reaches out. The rattling is a bit LOUDER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the fire escape, he picks up a bundle of thorny thistles wrapped with a rubber band. Mills realizes, Doe was here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SAFE HOUSE -- NIGHT

The room is plain, like the room Mrs. Gold was kept in. The door opens and Tracy and Mills enter. They look sleepy, carrying suitcases. A uniformed cop closes the door for them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mills goes to lay a suitcase on a table while Tracy looks around, depressed, distant. The lighting is bad. There are no decorations, no windows. A wide crack runs down one wall.

Tracy sits down on the bed. Mills notices her discontent.

A polaroid is on a white table. It is the photo Wild Bill gave to Mills and Somerset. It is a picture of a belt, made with extra leather straps so it can be worn securely around the groin. It is a strap-on phallus, but there is no plastic protuberance. Instead, there is a metal knife. It is a strap- on butcher's knife.

Somerset and Mills are shell-shocked, seated at their desks. Somerset is looking out the window. Mills stares at the wall.

Somerset looks to his temporary desk. He picks up a small pile of mail, sorts through it. An 8" by 10" manila envelope interests him. It reads DETECTIVE SOMERSET on the outside, handwritten in red marker. He opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes out a grainy photograph of he and Tracy kissing in his car. It's obviously been taken with a special night-lens.

Somerset goes pale, suppressing a gasp. He holds the photo to hide it from Mills, looks to see Mills has not noticed. He feels panicky, crumples the photo and envelope in his hand.

He puts the shoe on the floor and goes to get on the bed. He kisses Tracy's forehead, looks at her sleeping innocently. He is touched, saddened. He kisses her cheek, then wraps his arms under and around her. He holds tight, kisses her again. Tracy stirs.

:SC: EXT. CITY STREETS, INDUSTRIAL AREA -- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John Doe walks in this section of huge industrial complexes. Factories and foundries are lined side by side, seemingly for miles. We can HEAR TUGBOAT HORNS sounding low and deep. We're near the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doe seems to know where he's going. He passes stacks of industrial piping and steel drums piled to the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks through an industrial junk-yard filled with trashed bulldozers, trucks and discarded factory equipment. It's like a stroll through a bone-yard of dead dinosaurs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the end of this field of metal, there is a tall, narrow alleyway formed by two warehouses. Doe enters, looking up at the single lit bulb on the wall above.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at the ground, picks up a rock and a beaten hubcap, walks under the bulb. He throws the hubcap with all his might. It soars, but misses the bulb, falls to the ground behind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doe takes aim with the rock. He throws, grunting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rock smashes the bulb, bringing darkness to the alley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Doe walks back to the mouth of the alley. He stops and turns to start from there. He walks, deliberately, looking down at his feet. FOLLOW as he walks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops, looks back to the way he came, then looks down at the ground in front of him again. He takes off his thick glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He holds the glasses in his hand.

<DIRECTION>
Somerset is in bed. The metronome is sounding: tick, tick, tick... The SOUNDS of the CITY are LOUD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Somerset closes his eyes, concentrating on the metronome. Tick, tick, tick... A MAN and a WOMAN are HEARD SCREAMING at each other incoherently from outside. Somerset rolls over, restless. Tick, tick, tick...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A THIRD VOICE is HEARD from outside. This man is screaming at the other two people to shut up. Somerset opens his eyes, sits up. He reaches over, grabs the metronome and throws it against the wall.

	I... I had a relationship once, very much like a marriage. And, there was a baby. A long time ago. Things were good. And I got up one morning, and I went on a case... a murder, like any other. Except it was my first since hearing about the baby. And, I felt this fear and anxiety coming over me. I looked around and I thought, how can I raise a child here? So, that night, I told her I didn't want us to have children, And, over the next few weeks... I convinced her...

John Doe stands inside the precinct house doors. He holds out his arms as if to say "presto, here I am."

<DIRECTION>
Near silence comes to the room as all eyes go to the figure of John Doe.

Mills is riveted, finding this impossible to comprehend.

Mills, Somerset and the captain stand in darkness.

<DIRECTION>
On the other side of a two-way mirror, John Doe is seated in a restraining chair in an interrogation room. His hands and legs are bound with leather straps to the chair's arm and legs. A strap hold tight around Doe's throat. This is not some superman/serial killer. He looks more like an eccentric college professor. His lawyer MARK SWARR, 43, sits at a table, taking notes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mills holds a fingerprint card. The black ink prints are just useless blobs with traces of blood in them.
</DIRECTION>
<CAPTAIN>

	He cuts off the skin of his fingertips. That's why we can't find a single usable print in his apartment. For a long time, he's been cutting before the papillary lines can grow back.

	The orphanage is all we have. His bank account is only five years old and it started as cash. There's no credit history, no employment history. We even tried to trace his furniture. All we know for sure is he's wealthy, well educated and totally insane. We may never know how he got that way.

On the altar, Doe is sweating hard, standing over Mills. Mills is slumped forward on the floor, unconscious. His bullet-proof vest has been removed.

Mills' hands are tied tight together in front of him, tied to one end of the thick rope suspended from the ceiling. Doe holds the other end of the rope, has his gun tucked under his belt.

	You're an intelligent man, Somerset. You understand what you're a part of, don't you? When this is finished, it will seem surreal, but it will be a whole, crystalline reality. And, no one will be able to deny it, no matter how hard they try.

Doe's voice is thick with passion. Somerset is about halfway down the aisle, still moving.

Mills tries to rub the gas out of his eyes with his bound hands.

The entire church with its candles frames the torture:

Somerset walks to where Doe flops horribly, bleeding. Somerset aims, shoots Doe in the leg. Doe screams, rolling, trying to crawl away, knocking over candle racks. Somerset follows. He shoots Doe's other leg. He shoots Doe in the other arm. Flames begin to rise and spread quickly amongst the pews. Doe continues to spasm, wrenching, hand slapping the bloody floor. BLAM, BLAM, BLAM. Somerset steps back from Doe, overturns a rack of candles on top of him. He steps away. Watching. Flames begin rising on Doe's clothing.

Somerset is here, in his dress blue uniform. He stares forward, still numb, beaten. Rifles are raised by a corps of riflemen. Blanks explode from the barrels. They reload in unison.

Somerset looks towards the grace where Mills' casket lies under an American flag. Tracy is there.

Somerset looks up again, mortified, fighting to keep control of his emotions. He looks around:

At the miserable people, walking past him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At a man at the top of the subway station stairs, sitting in a cardboard box, holding out a cup, rattling the change inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A father passes by, holding his young son's hand. Somerset turns to watch them as they pass. The gather reaches to pick the boy up and carry him. The boy holds tight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For some reason, this makes Somerset ache with sorrow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The father hugs his son to him, kisses him on the cheek. The boy returns the kiss, with great affection.

Somerset watches them disappear in the mass of humanity. He looks back at the note in his hand.

He tears the note up, into little pieces.

She's looking at the keys when she notices something about the envelope. She reopens it, takes out a small folded piece of paper. She unfolds it:
