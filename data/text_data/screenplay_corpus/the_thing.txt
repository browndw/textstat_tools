THE MAIN COMPOUND OF U.S. OUTPOST #31
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The interior is a cramped and never ending maze of hallways, passageways and doors which connect the many rooms and compartments within the compound. Sturdy, but prefabricated materials have been used in its construction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a laboratory. An infirmary. A kitchen and mess hall. A communications room and sleeping quarters. Other cubicles are for storage and supplies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The most spacious area of the building, and the main center of activity, is the Rec Room. Of the many entrance ways to this room can be seen the small work chambers with their sophisticated computers and other scientific equipment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The below quarter houses the generator and still other compartments for storage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long underground tunnel connects the main compound to the dog kennel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A STARRY BLACKNESS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From out of the billions, the smallest of specks drives slowly forward. It closes; getting larger; its features becoming more identifiable: a vessel. Flip-flopping; out of control. Its stern roaring with flame. It passes; its blue fire surging into the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"THE THING"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A thundering...

FADE TO:

...Glacial desert... gusts of snow... superimpose:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANTARCTICA, 1982, WINTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SOUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Loud and strident. A helicopter streaks across frame. It travels precariously close to the ground; its chassis battered and swayed by the wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COPTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Red dials beam on the faces of two men. One carries a rifle and searches the horizon with binoculars. The other pilots. Their unkempt faces, their blazing eyes notate a wildness. They bark at each other in some Scandinavian tongue. Two men arguing like mad and desperate children.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man with the binoculars sights something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HORIZON - BINOCULARS' POV - A DOG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It turns and snarls at the craft some fifteen hundred yards to its rear. Then whirls and gallops off. A gun blast kicks up snow at its heels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COPTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another blast of rifle fire as the man takes issue with his prey. The pilot slams a fist into his gunman friend and implores for better aim. The craft swoops lower and the engine is put into full throttle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HILL - THE DOG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
running feverishly up and over a hill of ice. A weather- beaten, wooden sign sticks up on the other side:

A rifle blast kicks up more snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COMPOUND OF U.S. OUTPOST #31
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large, almost snow-covered building. Not far from that a tall, meteorological balloon tower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A scattering of several small shacks at varying distances from the main compound. The smaller hovels are connected by wooden planked walkways and steadying ropes. Multicolored pennants stick put of the snow marking pathways and directions to outdoor experiments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tractor and two helicopters sit idle, covered with mounds of continuously mounting snow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO MEN, NORRIS AND BENNINGS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
standing some thirty yards from the main building are in the process of letting up a large red balloon. Childs, a hefty black man, is twenty yards away tinkering with a snowmobile. Their beards are caked with ice. It is winter and it is harsh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The faint sound of the copter turns their attention.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE COPTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
flying ever lower now. The man with the gun leans dangerously outside and fires away at the dog as it nears the outpost.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
outside the compound look to one another, incredulous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE COPTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
much too low now, and chastised by the wind, attempts a high- speed landing, directly on the heels of the sprinting dog. It bounces violently on the hard-packed surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once. Twice. Passing the dog.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A third bounce sends it skidding. It flips; its blades snapping off like toothpicks. It lands belly-up, soundless except for the whine of its engine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man with the gun rolls out before the explosion.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIN COMPOUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The half a dozen men, playing cards, monitoring equipment, listening to music -- spring to their feet, startled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COMPOUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dog reaches Norris and Bennings, as they awkwardly wade through the snow, toward the downed copter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SURVIVOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
of the crash, his eyes crazed with determination, struggles to his feet. Heedless of his companion, he double-times his way to the men and the dog. He reloads his gun and bellows in his Scandinavian tongue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Norris and Bennings have no idea what he is saying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The survivor waves his arms as if shooting them off, screaming as he does so; his face now caked with blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two men are bewildered. The dog jumps up, licking and pawing them, imploring for safety.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blam!! The visitor fires. The men jump back in disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<NORRIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fu...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORRIS>
<DIRECTION>
Blam! Blam! The crazed visitor screams and fires as he stalks after them. His countenance ablaze, mad. Ice and snow kick up about the terrified Americans. A bullet smacks into the dog's hip, sending it skidding and howling in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Childs, the black man by the snowmobile, takes cover, diving behind his machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bennings is hit. Norris pulls, drags him back toward the compound. The dog crawls along beside them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The intruder is relentless in his assail. He runs, screaming, firing, screaming, reloading and firing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COMPOUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Total confusion. Some watch helplessly through the small, fogged-up and translucent windows. Others try to mobilize grabbing for their heavy jackets.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NORRIS AND BENNINGS

<DIRECTION>
stare blankly, but relievedly at the fallen man. The dog whimpers in pain.

Nauls, the cook, glides along on his roller stakes down one of the many narrow hallways that connect the various compartments of the main compound. He is black, a little mischievous, about twenty-two.

He comes to a flashy skidding stop at one of the entrances to the rec room area, where the men are gathered with the dead Norwegian.

Norris, bundled in his sixty-five pounds of clothing, exits the main compound. He walks the prefab wooden planks up the precipice; his destination is someone a hundred yards up the slope -- to a shack. He grabs onto the steadying ropes and pulls himself against the wind and blowing sleet.

MacReady takes a sip of his drink; makes his way over to his electronic chess game. A large Mexican sombrero hangs on his back. He is tall; about thirty-five. His shack is sparse but unkempt. A few centerfolds on the wall are interspersed by an occasional poster of some Mediterranean or South American paradise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chess game is of larger than normal size. The pieces move automatically with the press of a button. He sits down and chuckles over his opponent's bad move.

<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poor little son of a bitch. You're starting to lose it, aren't you?

</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rook to knight six. Check.
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
More impatient pounding. MacReady glares at his opponent for a beat. He bends forward, opens up a flap containing the chess game's circuitry and pours in his drink. There ensues a snapping, popping sound as smoke and sparks rise from the machine; followed by a flush of chess gibberish.
</DIRECTION>

MacReady gets up from his seat, mumbling on his way to the door.

Further down, they hear a faint hissing sound. As they get closer it more resembles static. The flashlight finds a door at the end of the corridor. The sputtering static comes from within.

The face of the door has been shredded. An ax sticks out from its middle. MacReady wrenches out the ax. There is blood on it. The men acknowledge this for a beat.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
They push, shove, grunt. The door gives a bit. Finally more. It widens enough for MacReady to see that a large computer- like machine is blocking their path. MacReady wedges in and shines the flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is the communications room. Holes in its roof have allowed in the freezing cold. The flashlight exposes the back of the radio chair. One more nudge allows them into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat as they catch their breath. MacReady spots a Coleman lantern. He lights it with a match. Holds it up. The brighter light exposes the top of a man's head sitting in the radio chair.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Sweden...! You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
The chair rocks slightly with the gentle breeze. They inch closer. A yard from the chair, MacReady stops the Doctor. He pokes his gun at the chair's back.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweden?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Copper spots something. From the man's wrist on the armrest, he follows a long, yarn-thick, red line, ending in a pool of frozen blood on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two men step around the chair. The Norwegian stares up in blanched death. A gaping black hole for a mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His throat and wrists slit. An old-fashioned straight razor in his lap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady turns off the hissing radio, and marches to the other door. It is locked and barricaded.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_COPPER>

</DR_COPPER>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Copper.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
The two men free a machine-like obstacle from the other exit. MacReady opens a lock and pushes the door open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
More blackness. Stronger wind. Copper holds the lantern high as they make their way down a row of wooden steps and into a cavernous, underground causeway.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Sweden!!!

	They're not Swedish, goddamn it, they're Norwegian, MacRe --
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_COPPER>
<DIRECTION>
Whap!! Something slaps into the Doctor's face from the darkness. The lantern crashes to the ground. The Doctor stumbles, falls. MacReady grabs the flashlight and whirls in different directions. A panting beat. Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Copper holds up what hit him. A thick centerfold, buffeted by the wind. MacReady takes it.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Norwegian of the Month, Doc. Harmless.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady pockets it for further viewing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE NARROWEST OF CORRIDORS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The supporting beams have long since buckled and cracked from the constantly moving ice underneath. The evidence of fire has further weakened the foundations. The wood creaks overhead. Bits of ice and silt trickle down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two men walk hunched, cautious. MacReady gingerly tries to make his way around a broken and smoldering beam. He brushes it gently sending a shower of debris from the yawning roof.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The two men wait until it subsides and then moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Further down. MacReady's knee bumps into something along the wall, causing him to stumble slightly. He shines his light on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An arm is sticking out of a steel door about three feet off the ground. The door has been slammed shut. The arm pinned, its fist still gripping a small welding torch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flame long since gone out.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
(wincing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy shit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
He tries the door. Unlocked. It opens. The arm drops to the ground. It has been severed by the force of the slam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Its owner is nowhere to be seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady, sickened, coughs. Dr. Copper mumbles.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_COPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_COPPER>
<DIRECTION>
They step over the arm and into another slim passageway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving along they come to rest in front of a door with Norwegian lettering on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady pushes it open with his foot. Dozens of papers fly about, flailed by the holes in the Quonset hut-style roof. The place is a wreck. They enter. MacReady surveying the small room with his flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_COPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Laboratory.

Broken beakers, test tubes, a microscope are illuminated.

<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Portable video unit.

Copper makes his way over to the main work table. He shuffles through papers, glancing at the writing.

</MACREADY>
<DR_COPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>

Dr. Copper bends down and begins gathering the papers, strewn about the room.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DR_COPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could be important work. Might as well bring it back.

<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's getting late. Hurry it. I'm going to check the last few rooms.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
He exits. Amongst the rubble, Dr. Copper finds a pocket tape recorder and several cassettes. He selects a tape and is about to pop it in when he senses something to his rear. He turns. Looks. A beat. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady shoves himself into another room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Debris and wood flush down on him. The receding ceiling had been blocking the door from above. He brushes his coat and shines the light upwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ceiling is a shambles. He then shines the light deeper into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NORWEGIAN LAB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Copper is playing the small tape recorder. A casual Norwegian voice drones on as if making notes. He fast forwards. The same casual drone.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Copper enters, squeezing in, through the door. The wood cracks overhead. More debris comes falling down.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Careful. It's about to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
Copper dusts himself. MacReady stands before a huge block of ice. Fifteen feet long. Six feet wide. Four feet tall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It has partially melted, but its thawing process has been stopped by the now freezing temperatures within the outpost.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Its one curious feature: the middle has been thawed and scooped out. Giving it the appearance of a large bathtub. The two men study it uncomprehendingly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady's gaze turns to a large metal cabinet at his left. He moves for a closer look. Several photographs are pasted to its door. Small snapshots of the Norwegians at work and play.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He tries to open it. Stuck. The partially caved-in ceiling is slightly blocking the top of the door. He tries again, careful not to dislodge the wood and plaster above. Bits of dust float down.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_COPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_COPPER>
<DIRECTION>
His grip is too strong. It gives suddenly, unexpectedly. The large metal door flies open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Large chunks splash from the ceiling. They come thumping to the floor, behind and in front of the open cabinet door. MacReady coughs and waves away the dust. He peers inside. Nothing much. Some empty shelves. Some small scientific gear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His flashlight then locates a large photograph taped to the inside of the cabinet door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is a picture of five Norwegians, arm in arm, all smiles, toasting each other. They are on either side of the frozen block of ice, pridefully displaying it for the camera. The block looks much thicker. Its interior opaque.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady looks to the block of ice and then back to the photograph. He untapes it, pockets it and shuts the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An armless corpse swings into his face from behind the closing door. Dislodged from the ceiling, the body and MacReady go crashing to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
INT. U.S. OUTPOST - RECREATION ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The loud beat of Warren Zevon's song, "The Werewolves of London," can be heard throughout the compound. The room is empty. Close on a video pong game, its ball of light lazily traveling back and forth. The dog, its tail wagging, its bandage on, walks by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Zevon's record is blasting from Nauls' stereo. He skates from the big walk-in freezer and plunks down a large side of beef on the wood-cutting table to thaw. He skates from pot to pan keeping time with his sounds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He smells. Tastes. Adds a little something here, a touch there. He clearly enjoys his work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Station Manager Garry stops past the open door.

He skates over and turns it down, but not much.

INT. COMPOUND CORRIDOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An empty hallway. Larger than most. Doors to several sleeping quarters on either side. The dog slowly walks through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the doors is open up ahead of his left. The dog stops in front of it and looks in. Someone is inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the small cubicle, a slight portion of a man's back can be seen as he sits bent over a chair; his large shadow displayed on the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back in the corridor. The dog looks up the hall once and casually to the other end. No one. He enters the room. The sound of a man's voice, too indistinct to tell whose, mumbles:
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
A beat.

EXT. COMPOUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fuchs, the young biologist, is finishing up his daily jog around the compound. He stops at the end of a long Quonset hut almost completely buried in the snow. The hut is fifty yards long and connects to the main compound. He enters a tunnel from a latch door up top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He jogs down the steps, passing the underground dog kennel and trots toward the compound through the long narrow tunnel. He passes and waves to Clark, who rolls along a wheelbarrow of dog food.

CLARK

Childs waltzes through, humming, a big smile on his face.

He stops at a door with six locks on it. Different kinds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Combination locks, key locks, etc. He opens each one separately.
</DIRECTION>

Inside are several marijuana plants. Sun lamps beam down on them. Childs inspects them with a wide grin.

<CHILDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What say to some nice Al Green for my babies, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILDS>
<DIRECTION>
He waters them carefully, as Al Green sings softly. He hears a panting and turns around to see the dog. His bandage is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What you...? You get the hell on out of here.

INT. GENERATOR ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Palmer works on the generator. He hears the sound of approaching propeller blades from outside. And then the sound of his tool box crashing to the floor. He turns to see what caused the ruckus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dog, who has entered the shed, has jumped on the work table and upended the tool box on its eagerness to look out of the above window. Palmer curses under his breath and calls out.

INT. STATION MANAGER GARRY'S QUARTERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Garry, MacReady, Dr. Copper, Norris, Bennings, Blair and his assistant, Fuchs, are present. The small Norwegian video unit has been set up and its contents are being viewed on a TV screen. Grainy, home movie-ish, no sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The proceedings are grim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shots of the Norwegian's at work. Others of them playing soccer on ice. Generally the footage is a prosaic record of their day-to-day life.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Norris shuffles the bundle of notes Dr. Copper brought back with him.
</DIRECTION>

Dr. Copper fast forwards. The calm voice continues. And then a loud blast, followed by pounding. The sounds of confusion. Voices. Loud. Frenetic. Men's feet running up and down wooden floorboards. A gurgling. A hissing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Screams. And then a screeching. More blasts mixed with the din of wild, carnage-wrought cries. And then more screeching. A screeching unlike anything these men have ever heard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men look from one another in silence as they listen.
</DIRECTION>

Dr. Copper turns it off.

Dr. Copper and MacReady begin dumping the heavy contents of a large plastic trash bag onto the slab.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_COPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We found this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_COPPER>
<DIRECTION>
Displayed on the slab is what appears to be the corpse of a man. Badly charred. What is left of the trousers and shoes of the bottom torso are ripped and split, as if his legs and feet had burst from the inside. His upper body is an almost undecipherable gnarled mass of protoplasmic mush.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The head is strangely disfigured and looks larger than normal. It is situated not on its shoulders but near the abdomen. Tendon-like appendages are wrapped around the carcass and sticking up and out in odd postures. One is wrapped around the body's left leg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shirt has been ripped and lies shredded in the tar-like mess.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men grimace.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_COPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>

Childs lies in his cot watching a small television. The show is a tape of an American TV game show. He has seen this one too many times, extracts the cassette and injects another game show.

Palmer is stretched out in the other cot, reading a comic book and smoking a joint. Childs beckons for it and takes a hit.

INT. PUB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bleary-eyed, MacReady is in the process of blowing up some strange inflatable object. As he puffs away, he still keeps an eye on the Norwegian video tapes. His balloon begins to take shape. It blossoms into a life-size replica of a full- breasted woman. Something on the tape catches his eye. He rewinds, then starts it forward again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The screen shows the Norwegians on the surface of what appears to be an enormous, flat glacier. They are spread out on the ice around a large odd oval shape; their arms outstretched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It fades to black and then a Norwegian comes on mugging childishly in front of the camera, apparently quite pleased with something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tape fades to black again and the picture reappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This time they have marked off the large oval area with flag sticks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Closer shots show three of the men digging a deep hole into the ice. There is a small patch of something dark and metallic at the bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady leans forward, intrigued.

<DIRECTION>
The men are now sinking something deep into the ice at various points around the markings. MacReady squints and mumbles to himself.

The tape jump cuts again showing a long shot of the markings. No Norwegian in sight. An explosion kicks up the ice. A beat as the ice sprays to the ground. Then the camera appears to shake as the ground beneath it quivers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another immense explosion follows. An earthquake-like force throws the camera to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>

The tape continues, distorted, unviewable. A distinct crack in the lens. MacReady lets go of his companion and quickly rewinds. The deflating mannequin is sent sputtering around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KENNEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Most of the dogs are sleeping or lounging. The new dog watches them calmly, silently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes several steps towards a group of about five dogs and sits upright. Completely still. He stares at them. A beat. The dogs are aware of something. They begin to seem a bit confused, uncomfortable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The new dog continues to stare. Sitting rigidly, unnaturally still. His eyes dead, lusterless black spheres.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bewildered, a few dogs start to pace. As if sensing something: a portent. A danger. But so odd. They begin a soft, purring growl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The new dog remains a statue. The growling builds. More dogs begin to pace. Nervously. Faster, encircling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Emitting hisses, snarls. The lack of response driving them into a frenzy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barks. Growls. More frenetic pacing. The din escalating. Three dogs start to close in on the stranger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They attack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHADOW OF THE NEW DOG

against the kennel wall. The shadow suddenly lurches upward, seeming larger.

The kennel roars.

MacReady is still going over bits of the same footage, fascinated. He hears the far-off clamor of the dogs.

Clark snores. MacReady has entered.

<DIRECTION>
No response. MacReady nudges him. Clark rolls away, annoyed.

MacReady pinches his snoring nose, cutting off the air.

Clark sits up, groggy.

Clark, sleepy, irritated, makes his way down the freezing corridor. The wind soughing loudly overhead.

CLARK

</DIRECTION>
<CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's got into...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
Smack! Just as he opens the door, two dogs, as if jettisoned from a cannon, knock him off his feet. Growls, barks, snarls. And a screeching from within.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady is fetching himself a beer. The sound of the far- off screeching. He freezes. A beat. He turns and sprints.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS BEER CAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as it smashes the glass of the fire alarm. He pulls the lever.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The alarm is blaring throughout the camp. MacReady, Garry, Norris run through the narrow tunnel led by Clark.

MacReady carries a shotgun. Garry, half-dressed, has his .44. Clark, a fire ax.

INT. TUNNEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as the men approach the locked kennel door. The two dogs, thrown into Clark, back ferociously and scratch at the door trying to get back in. One is badly bloodied.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fight inside rages on. MacReady and Clark brace themselves by the narrow door. Norris and Garry hold back the two hysterical dogs. Clark undoes the latch and he and MacReady enter the kennel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light has been broken and it is pitch black. MacReady snaps on his flashlight. Norris and Garry can't contain their animals and the dogs burst into the room. They smash into MacReady and send him sprawling. Total confusion: the dogs; the men; the screeching; the blackness.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mac, where are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARK>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady gropes for his flashlight and rights himself. He finds Clark. Then shines it around the cramped room trying to get his bearings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light finds a mass of dogs in a wild melee in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Barking mixed with hissing, a gurgling, a screeching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dogs being hurled about and then charging back into the fray with a vengeance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flashlight illuminates parts of some "thing." A dog.
</DIRECTION>

But not quite. Impossible to tell. It struggles powerfully. Garry pokes his head into the blackness.

Clark wades into the pack, grabs at dogs' hides and throws them back. He then wields his ax into the fray, chopping and hacking away at the gurgling, hissing silhouette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From out of nowhere, a large, bristly, arachnid-like leg springs up and wraps around Clark's ax. It sends Clark smashing violently into the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
More men running, nearing the kennel. Several squeezing in with Garry, trying to get a look.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady fires several rounds. A dog is flung at him, knocking him and his flashlight once more to the ground.

Garry squeezes in and begins blasting away in the direction of the hissing and screeching. A dog is hit. MacReady crawls for his flashlight.

The screeching lessens. The hissing and gurgling fade. Childs turns off his torch.

INT. REC ROOM - NEXT MORNING

Those of the men that have gathered exhibit a pale and quiet uneasiness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blair, in silent awe, stands over the badly burned corpses of two interlocking dogs, that lie before him on a table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are connected as if they were one animal. Though, the one wearing the remnants of Clark's bandage is much larger and appears less dog-like. Its entire torso is cracked and peeled, as if its innards were trying to burst out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Odd appendages, recoiled and withered by the flame, are wrapped grotesquely about both bodies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clark, his eyes set in glassy stare, sits in shock. Nauls comforts him. Childs stands nearby smoking a joint and staring at the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blair, transfixed, continues hovering over the united cadavers. Weighing. Thinking. A very worried look on his face.

Pull back to reveal -- the massive black hole about fifteen feet beneath the ice. Charred, gnarled and mangled metal are all that is left of what was once an enormous sphere.

MacReady's and Norris' eyes meet each other in silence.

Norris digs for ice samples at the perimeter of the wreckage, while MacReady browses through the center.

MacReady moves to the snowmobile and grabs a two-gallon can of gasoline. He turns to Bennings.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<BENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nowhere... Just straight to the ocean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BENNINGS>
<DIRECTION>
A beat as MacReady takes this in. He pours the gas over the remains and sets it aflame.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's move.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>

Childs and Bennings are not that anxious to continue.

Childs and Bennings return shrugs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SUN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
making its last pass, rolling off the horizon. Only a slight orange hue left.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SNOWMOBILES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
move slower, positioned on either side of the tracks. The tracks abruptly change direction. The men come to a stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is much colder now. Their beards, a mask of white powder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady surveys the new direction. They are headed toward a far-off ridge of bluffs. Large, windswept mounds of ice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SNOWMOBILES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as they move through a valley of newly-formed dunes and tall ice cliffs. The last of the sun obscured, the headlamps are turned on and pointed at the tracks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men look behind, in front, and from side to side, as they proceed cautiously through the maze. Up ahead MacReady spots:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DOG
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It sits, its back to them, unconcerned, heedless of their arrival. It is munching on the other half of the dog carcass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men stop their machines some twenty yards from it. They are hemmed in at the valley's narrowest point.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Childs, carrying the torch, and MacReady, armed with a thermite bomb, wade awkwardly but carefully toward the animal in their snowshoes. Bennings stands back by the snowmobiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Childs and MacReady spread out some dozen feet from the dog. It continues to pay them no mind, content to chew its food.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's the other one?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILDS>
<DIRECTION>
Bennings surveys the tops of the snow bluffs that encircle them with his flashlight.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
(to dog)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's your buddy, boy? Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
No response. MacReady searches the near vicinity with his light. All three are growing uneasy.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let that thing fly, Childs. Don't let up until he's ash.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
Childs turns on the gas and lights the tip.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bennings is still watching the bluffs. Something from beneath the snow reaches up and grabs his feet. He is ripped back down through the hard snow in one incredibly powerful motion. He screams, his head the only thing sticking out of the ice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Childs and MacReady turn, confused, unable to see anything be Bennings' screaming head. They rush toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady stumbles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of a snapping, a crackling to MacReady's rear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He freezes; turns back to the dog. Its back is still to him; its coat of hair sticking up like that of a porcupine. It snarls; its face turns slowly toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Its skin splitting; its mouth ripping open wildly.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Childs!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
Childs stops, confused as to who to help first. He notices the dog hunched and ready to spring. He steps back toward MacReady. The dog/Thing leaps for MacReady; an incredible jump of some twenty feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Childs lets loose a blast, hitting the dog in midair; the force of the spray knocking it back and tumbling to the ice in flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady throws his thermite canister. It discharges and engulfs the screeching animal in fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BENNINGS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
howling in pain. The ice underneath him thrashes violently. Childs and MacReady stand by helplessly, unable to see what has him or what action to take. Childs moves closer to help.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
(pulls him back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay back!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
Bennings' head disappears with a sudden jerk through the ice. The ice continues to rumble like boiling water, moving in different directions. Part of Bennings' body pops up in a different area and is just as quickly pulled back down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady and Childs watch on in frustration and anger.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What we going to do?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILDS>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How the fuck do I know?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
Bennings' head and shoulders then surface near one of the snowmobiles. Something has him. Unclear as to what. The jowls of a dog. But huge. Bennings' heavy clothing begins to rip, tear, as if his skin underneath was bulging out. The jowls seem to be absorbing his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady runs for the snowmobile.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Torch them!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<CHILDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But...

</CHILDS>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's gone already! Do it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
Childs blasts away. The ice begins to melt as Bennings and whatever has him catch fire. A screeching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady grabs cans of gas from the snowmobiles. Suddenly a steel-like, arachnid-shaped arm shoots out in pain and with incredible force pierces the fiberglass chassis of the snowmobile. MacReady is knocked back. He recovers and dumps cans of gasoline on the writhing mess.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He dives and rolls away from the lunging appendage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He and Childs watch on as Bennings and The Thing roar in flame. Behind them, the other dog/Thing continues to burn. The screeching, mewing and gurgling wails on, all about them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They look to each other in disbelief, their faces illuminated by the flickering flames. The strident sounds beginning to subside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SUN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Its slim, orange arc sets, signaling the start of the Vernal Equinox. And the beginning of six months of darkness.

He drops the bundle he had been holding on the table between the men. It is the shredded pair of long johns.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nauls found this yesterday. It's ripped just like the clothing on the Norwegian we brought back. The same thing was happening to Bennings' clothes when it got to him. Seems these Things don't imitate clothes. Just flesh and bone.

<DR_COPPER>

	It's a simple blood typing test. This Thing's blood chemistry is different than ours. Basically we mix someone's blood with uncontaminated human blood. If we don't get the proper serum reaction -- then that person isn't human.

He hears the clamor of feet and voices as the others are nearing. He breaks the glass and grabs a shotgun. Then a box of shells. He frantically tries to load, but is too nervous.

Underground, rickety corridor. Palmer stands by as Childs undoes the many locks to the room that houses his plants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One by one. Palmer twists his head in every which direction. Nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Childs pulls open the heavy door. A flush of snow and wind push them back. They wedge their bodies at the entrance to the lightless room.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILDS>

They enter. The light from the hall exposes the completely smashed-in window high above the plants. The plants look frozen.

<CHILDS>

Saddened, angry, Childs goes to check the damage to his plants. Palmer, his face set in horror, yanks him back.

	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILDS>
<DIRECTION>
Palmer, his mouth agape with terror, screams and points to the closing door to their rear. Childs whirls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FUCHS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One arm outstretched, swings into view. An ax, embedded deep into his chest, pins his frozen body to the inside of the door.

Norris startled by the scream, turns on the siren.

Sanchez has joined Childs and Palmer. The body of Fuchs is still pinned to the door. Sanchez tries to wrench the ax loose. It is too deeply embedded and won't budge.
</DIRECTION>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoever put this through him...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
Sanchez observes Childs' hulking frame and adds pointedly:

	Why didn't it imitate Fuchs? Isn't that its number -- to get more recruits.

THE MEN

<DIRECTION>
weapons in hand, huddle at the main doorway. They unbolt it. Sleet and hail send Nauls rolling in from the outside. The men force the door back and lock it.

The weary Nauls kneels on the floor and gasps for air.

The others surround him.

Nauls weighs each of them ominously, while digging down underneath his heavy jacket.

He pulls out a thick bundle of heavy clothing. It is mutilated and partially burned. He holds out the jacket to show the inside collar.

Close on name tag -- it reads: R.J. MACREADY The men, as they examine in a hush.

<DIRECTION>
Crunch. The door gives. The men move in. Their blow torches ready. They freeze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady stands before them holding a lighted flare. His hair and clothing are covered with snow; his cheeks and nose blackened by frostbite. Tucked under his arm is an entire box of dynamite. He holds the flare dangerously close to the open box.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyone messes with me -- the whole camp goes.

He appears to mean it. They don't seem anxious to test him.

They do. He follows them out into the hall.

The men step backwards carefully.

<MACREADY>

They heed, retreating further down the hall. MacReady glances behind him.

<MACREADY>

	...Where's the rest...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
Nauls and Norris, who have silently crept in through the supply window, come flying through the hacked-up door and barrel into MacReady. Both going straight for the flare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady spins Nauls off and rips into Norris, sending him crashing violently into the wall. Nauls tackles MacReady's legs, pulling him to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The others rush him. MacReady, still in control of the dynamite and flare, bellow:
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So help me I mean it!!

They skid to a halt. Nauls crawls away, quickly.

Norris, lying on the floor, coughs as if gasping for breath. He quivers for a moment and then is still. Nauls crawls over to him and shakes him. A beat.

Norris' body is plopped on the examination table. Copper stumbles and is steadied by some of the men. MacReady continues to keep his distance.

Copper places an oxygen mask over Norris' face. He then rips open his shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you sweethearts had yourselves a little trial. I just may have to kill you on general principle, Nauls.

Copper begins swathing Norris' chest with a gelatin substance.

Unnoticed, Clark paws the contents of the instrument tray behind his back.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Palmer, turn on that oxygen and hold the mask over his face... Childs, grab his shoulders.

<DR_COPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Enough, MacReady!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_COPPER>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Copper presses the prongs onto Norris' chest and shoots a bolt of current. Norris' body heaves upward. A slight crackling sound and an odd chirp through the oxygen mask.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_COPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Again... More current this time, Sanchez...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_COPPER>
<DIRECTION>
Buzzz. Several more jolts from the prongs. Clark's hand has found a scalpel. He gently lifts it out, bringing it to his side.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>

	And if anyone tries to wake me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DR_COPPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn you, MacReady!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_COPPER>
<DIRECTION>
Norris' body begins bounding up. More crackling and popping. His chest begins to break up and spread. The mask pops off -- a hideous mewing escaping from Norris' distorted mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men jump back, incredulous. Dr. Copper scrambles off his chest and flops to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<SANCHEZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God... what...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SANCHEZ>
<DIRECTION>
They watch on in stunned horror as The Thing that was Norris begins to change, to spread awkwardly on the slab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Its clothes tearing. A shoe splits in half and falls to the floor, exposing the beginnings of a talon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady charges toward it, shooing the men off.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out of the way!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
He unloads with a stream of flame. The body writhes in pain, belching and hissing. The slab catches fire. It struggles, lunges for the floor, straightens up, and moves a few feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A black and yellow substance rips through its trousers and squirts to the floor. Norris' body collapses on the fibrillating machine in flames. Extinguishers are ripped from the walls and put to work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady watches the smoking particles of ooze in fascination, as they twitch and mew on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Within seconds the fire is out. The men stand around in awe as they look upon The Thing that was once Norris.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady continues to observe the small particles. Their tiny squeals abating into silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REC ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady, still carrying the industrial torch, has maneuvered all the men into the room. He holds Garry's .44. He has untaped the explosives from his chest and laid them on the nearby table next to two more boxes of dynamite.

MacReady points the .44 at Childs' head.

MacReady cocks his gun. Childs holds his ground.

	I guess you do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILDS>
<DIRECTION>
A beat. Clark springs for MacReady. Scalpel raised.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady spins and fires three shots, point-blank, the forces of the charges sending Clark flying backwards. The others, themselves about to pounce, stop -- as MacReady whirls the torch and gun back toward them.

	Watching Norris in there... gave me the idea that maybe every part of you bastards is a whole. Every piece of you is self-sufficient, an animal unto itself. When a man bleeds it's just tissue. But blood from one of you Things won't obey. It's a newly formed individual with a built-in desire to protect its own life. When attacked, your blood will try and survive -- and crawl away from a hot needle say.

grimacing as Dr. Copper pinches a scalpel to his thumb and collects a small portion of his blood in a dish.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All the men have been tied up. Palmer, Childs and Garry on the small couch. The others, including the lifeless corpse of Clark, in chairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Copper returns the plate to the table and sets it down in line with the other plates of blood that he has collected.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The names of each man have been scribbled onto the plates.

MacReady slides the Doctor a fresh plate.

Copper cuts his thumb, his blood dribbles onto the plate.

</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
Copper steps backward, moisture beginning to collect on his brow. MacReady begins to heat the copper wire over the Bunsen burner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men watch intently. The wire begins to glow. MacReady points the torch directly at the Doctor. Both of them perspiring. MacReady lifts the glowing wire from the flame. The Doctor is dead still. MacReady slowly touches the wire to the Doctor's plate. A soft hiss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady heats it again and tries once more. The same soft hiss. MacReady and the Doctor both let out a sigh.

He heats the wire and puts it to his plate. The same harmless hissing. All eyes continue to watch as he tries again. The same result. Childs mumbles.

<DIRECTION>
Screech!!! The blood howls, trying to crawl off the plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Palmer bolts forward with incredible force, racing for MacReady; his face splitting; his mouth roaring -- dragging the couch, Childs and Garry with him. He smashes into MacReady knocking him over the table.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Copper!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
It's all happened too fast. Copper tries to get off a burst of flame. The ever-changing Palmer breaks his bonds and leaps on the Doctor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The others sit helpless, struggling at their bindings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady dives on Palmer's back and the three go rolling to the floor. Screeching. Crackling. MacReady pounds viciously at Palmer's head. A powerful, shirt-splitting arm sends him skidding across the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Copper momentarily has control of the torch. Just as he positions it, Palmer's mouth splits from his chin to his forehead and engulfs the entirety of the Doctor's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The big torch slaps against the wall. Palmer bounds to his feet, wrapping his arms around the dangling, struggling body of Dr. Copper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The men are screaming hysterically. MacReady tries to fire up the bruised torch. Busted. Won't work.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frustrated, he charges up behind Palmer and begins hammering the thick steel instrument over his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shirt of Palmer's back erupts in MacReady's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Splitting and ripping wildly, exposing the beginnings of yet another orifice. A blackened, iron-strong tongue lunges outward. Stunned, MacReady manages to elude it, diving for the top of the table by the boxes of dynamite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady lights the fuse of a thick roll and bounds from the table. Palmer awkwardly spins in circles, swinging the Doctor's body like a propeller blade, struggling to keep on balance, as he advances on MacReady. The second orifice, spitting and snarling as it continues to take form.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady waits until Palmer's back spins around, facing him. Only two yards away, MacReady flings his lit roll into the ever-evolving second mouth and leaps onto the couch covering Childs and Garry with his body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A muffled boom, as the swallowed explosive ignites from deep within Palmer and sends his flesh splattering all over the room. MacReady rolls away from Childs and Garry as fast as he can.

<DIRECTION>
One of the smaller torches is pointed at Nauls. He closes his eyes. MacReady places the heated wire into his plate. Hiss. MacReady exhales. Nauls opens his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady unties Nauls with one hand, while the torch stays glued to the others.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady heats the wire once again. Both he and Nauls have torches aimed at Sanchez. Sanchez is near tears.

The wire is dipped into the plate... Hisssss.

Sanchez breaks down and sobs.

Childs scrambles off the couch and onto the floor.

The burner. The torches. The wire. The plate. Garry's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hisssss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady tries again. Hiss. The men breathe. Their torches are lowered. Nauls throws his on the floor.

Sanchez and Childs flop down in chairs. MacReady wipes his face.

A long silence. Sanchez weeps quietly with relief.

A beat. Childs starts to giggle. The strain on MacReady's jaw begins to lessen. Garry sits catatonic. Nauls scowls at Childs' uncontrollable laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The infectious rasping causes MacReady a slight smile as he looks up, taking comfort in the sound of the raging Antarctic wind vibrating the roof. Nauls, untying Garry, grumbles, at Childs.

Childs wipes his eyes and grins over toward MacReady. His smile fades, MacReady is now stone-faced. Childs' grin goes stale, in sudden realization.

BLAIR'S SHACK

The door is wide open. They pause by the entrance, trying to balance against the wind. They enter.

<DIRECTION>
Empty. A few of the floorboards are loosened. They pull them up. They stare down into a large hole beneath the planking. Something is down there. They pull up more boards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hole is some fifteen feet deep. Its dimensions are the same as the shack. Its space is almost completely taken up by some strange metallic object.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crudely fashioned, a patchwork job, but streamlined.

<DIRECTION>
Sheets of corrugated steel are visible; but cut apart and welded into the desired shapes. The object appears to be unfinished.

Far off, amidst the howling gale -- the screeching. The men jump. MacReady lights the fuse, as they make it to the exit. He tosses it in.

EXT. COMPOUND ALONG THE ROPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The explosion echoes behind them. The men pull along. Their heads jerk in circles, searching into the blackness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some twenty yards to their rear something swooshes down, severing the line. The wind sends the men tumbling along the ice. Childs loosens the line and is blown away, rolling out of sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady and Nauls have lost their torches. They pull feverishly along the ground trying to make it to the compound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The screeching closes in behind them. MacReady loses his grip on the rope and is blown toward the main building.
</DIRECTION>

He crawls along looking for an opening.

Nauls slides near the outside entrance to the dog kennel.

He climbs down through the open stairwell.

INT. PLANT ROOM

MacReady has found the broken window. He rolls through it, landing on the frozen plants below. Something smashes at the glass above his head, trying to get in. He sprints for the door. Fuchs' frozen body is still pinned to it with the ax. MacReady grapples with the stiff torso which blocks the knob.

He finally gets it open and lets himself out, slamming and locking the door from the hall. Fuchs' body swings eerily, back and forth.

In the opposite direction, behind Sanchez, another arm splits through the door and the refrigerator, extends itself five feet and yanks Sanchez back as if he were a puppet.

Another creaking door is opened. A rustling. Still far off. MacReady and Nauls spread further apart.

The door begins to pound from the outside. Nauls and MacReady light two cocktails each.

The door booms. The room's foundations shake. The ceiling quivers. The gas bombs are cocked.

From the roof The Thing roars down into their midst.

Stunned, the men stumble back. MacReady throws his gas bomb. Nauls the same.

For a moment it stands silhouetted in flame. Enormous.

Grotesque.

Garry bolts for the main door. The Thing's tongue spirals from his mouth and spears him. The good two-thirds of its body follows its tongue and engulfs Garry by the door.

Another leg slaps Nauls to the ground. MacReady dodges still another appendage, dives on the generators and throws the switch.

The current rips through the door. Garry dies instantly.

One of The Thing's talons, still caught in the door, sends it writhing in pain. It literally rips the door from its latchings and pounds it to the ground, trying to shake it loose. Nauls, hobbles, scrambles, out of the opening.

MacReady dives through the window and out into the storm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COMPOUND - HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The distant sound of a motor. Nauls, battered and bloodied, his leg apparently broken, crawls along the ground. Another sound, a bubbling and gurgling is heard well to his rear. But closing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The terror forces him to drag faster, oblivious to the pain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches the bathroom stall. Crawls in. Locks it. The gurgling nears. Leaning on the toilet seat, he looks about himself, frantically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Presence pauses at the door. A scratching. Nauls paws, rips at a cracked and weathered slab of wood, cutting his fingers as he tries to break it off the siding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A strong blow begins to breach the stall door. Nauls finally unhinges the piece of wood, brings the jagged end to one side of his throat and rips...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LAB WALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The motorized rumbling nears. The wall seems to explode. The tractor barrels into the lab. Its enormous shovel scooper tearing half the room to shreds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady drives. His eyes glint like a wild man's; he looks stark raving mad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His frostbite, now in an advanced stage, resembles black war paint. He clenches a stick of dynamite between his teeth, like a buccaneer's cutlass. Two large, compressed air tanks have been tied together at the top and are draped around his neck. They are marked -- HYDROGEN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are used for the weather balloons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls the tractor to a stop, yanks the stick from his mouth, grins and bellows.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, creep! Just you and me now! Be on your toes! We're going to do a little remodeling!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady guns it through the next wall and into the infirmary. Medical equipment goes flying. The machine is powerful; the prefabricated walls buckling under its force.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COMPOUND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A trail of viscous yellow ooze leads around a bend.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Boom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady rams into the mess hall, sweeping away tables, chairs. He sings out loud the lyrics of some Mexican song. All the while he keeps his eyes on everything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the kitchen. The foundation is crumbling. He sings on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NARROW PASSAGEWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gurgling and hissing. A taloned arm slinks around a corner in retreat.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chime in if you know that words, old boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
MACREADY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
plows through several more rooms before ending up in the pub area. He backs it up and retrieves a bottle of liquor from the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You like whiskey? Come on, join me for a drink. Be good for you. Grow fangs on your chest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a drink and rams through another wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. REC ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tractor blazes into the rec room. MacReady parks it directly in front of the hole in the roof, created by The Thing when it surprised them earlier.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn it, ran out of gas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls off the heavy hydrogen tanks and drapes them over the tractor. As he talks his eyes move like a hawk passing from roof, to doorways, to rubble.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wind and ice bristle through the gaping holes, stinging MacReady with the cold. He winces at his mittenless, blackened fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sweetheart, it's going to get mighty cold in here soon... You better make your move... I mean, hell, I'm only one person...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a swig from his bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know you're bugged because we ruined your trip, right? Spiffy little toy you had there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
A slight tremor perks his eyes and ears. He looks up through the hole, then around. He lights a lighter and cups it in his hand near the stick of dynamite in his lap.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But your real hang up is your looks...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
A stronger tremor. The adrenalin pumps.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
(wants him bad)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Atta boy. I know you're around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
The floor shakes. MacReady stands, his head whirling around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, sucker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
The tractor inches up off the ground. MacReady falls forward and looks straight down through the chassis and into the vile and grinning face below. A claw flashes up, splitting the steering wheel but missing his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He depresses the ignition, bolting the tractor ten feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He jumps, hanging onto the edge of the hole in the ceiling. The Thing's face and arms burst through the metal plating of the tractor. The reaching claws just miss him as he pulls himself through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lights his fuse, drops in the stick, turns and runs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Half of The Thing's grotesque and angular torso bolts up through the hole, howling in fury. An appendage springs outward and winds around MacReady's jacket, hissing like acid into the fabric.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An immense explosion. The hydrogen tanks send a white fireball fifty feet into the sky. The Thing's body disintegrating almost immediately.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The force of the blast sweeps MacReady off the roof. He and the severed appendage crash to the hard ice in flames. He rolls over and over trying to smother the fire and tear off the insidious limb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAMP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A ruin. One half of it burnt almost to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady wears a thick blanket which covers him like a shroud, from his shoulders to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He walks bent over and in much pain, trying to blunt patches of fire with an extinguisher. It is futile. He gives up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PUB AREA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mostly untouched by the fire, but like most of the rest of the camp, exposed to the outside. The storm has settled considerably.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON MACREADY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lighting a cigar. His hands are heavily wrapped. He pours himself a drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A puffy white hand, missing two fingers, enters the frame and whirls a startled MacReady around. It is Childs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
White and black blotches cover his frostbitten face.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you kill it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILDS>
<DIRECTION>
He looks as weak as MacReady. A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<CHILDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean "you think so?"
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILDS>
<DIRECTION>
Both men speak guardedly and stare at each other suspiciously.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I got it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(refers to Childs' condition)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pretty mean frostbite.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
Childs steps back, keeping his distance. He indicates his puffy white hand.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It'll turn black again soon enough. Then I guess I'll be losing the whole thing...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(refers to feet)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Think my toes are already gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILDS>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady, carrying the bottle and glass, limps over and sits down behind a gaming table. There is a chess set and several decks of cards. The two men continue to eye each other.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're the only one who made it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILDS>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady begins setting up a non-electronic chessboard.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not the only one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<CHILDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The fire's got the temperature way up all over camp... won't last long though.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILDS>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neither will we.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<CHILDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we should try and fix the radio... try and get some help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILDS>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we shouldn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<CHILDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then we'll never make it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILDS>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady puffs on his cigar. He reveals a small blowtorch from under the table and places it beside him on top.
</DIRECTION>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we shouldn't make it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<CHILDS>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you're worried about anything, let's take that blood test of yours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILDS>
<MACREADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we've got any surprises for each other -- we shouldn't be in any condition to do anything about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You play chess?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MACREADY>
<DIRECTION>
They regard each other for a moment. Childs painfully sits down across from MacReady.
</DIRECTION>
<CHILDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess I'll be learning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHILDS>
<DIRECTION>
MacReady grins and hands the bottle to Childs. Childs smiles back and takes a healthy swig.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COMPOUND - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fires smolder on. Bright embers dance in the blackness -- pushed by the soughing wind.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
