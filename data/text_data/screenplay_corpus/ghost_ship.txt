INT. BARGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crewman EPPS (29), wearing a life vest and tool belt, jumps down into the darkness. She stands in a great hollow cavern, oily, wet, resonant with the sound of creaking, rusty steel and WATER MOVING OVER ITS HULL on the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BARGE - LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Epps comes to a low point in the darkness, shining her light on a lake of salt water sloshing against the bulkhead. She kneels. As the water sloshes back she sees that it is leaking in through the seams in the steel plate of the hull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BARGE - LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Epps pulls herself onto the deck from below. She stands on a rusting 5000 ton tank barge being pulled in the open ocean by a brawny marine tug at the end of a 150 foot tow cable. It is a typical summer day in the southern Bering Sea, which means a healthy chop and a stiff cold breeze out of the north- west. She closes the hatch behind her and makes her way forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BARGE - BOW - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead, the tug pulls steadily, grey-black clouds of diesel smoke rising from its massive turbine vents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Epps cinches and checks her body harness, focused and professional. The product of a rocky childhood in the Pacific Northwest and a few years of hard living, she's found her true calling now. And under some grime, several polypro shirts and a pair of orange men's Insulite pants she might even be considered pretty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She clips her harness into the tow cable where it attaches to a heavy pair of eye cleats at the bow. She climbs onto the cable, hanging out over the water as it breaks on the bow beneath her. She pulls herself forward on a roller bearing that fits over the width of the cable and starts off toward the tug at the other end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DODGE and GREER look on from the stern, where the boat's name "Arctic Warrior" is emblazoned on the transom. Dodge (37), scruffy chief engineer, wearing de rigueur greasy coveralls and nicotine stained fingers, is an expatriate Texan and former merchant marine. GREER (42), is the boat's first mate, African American, originally from some sweltering red-neck hellhole, now a tug pilot intentionally well to the north.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They watch as Epps pulls herself toward them, the cable occasionally dipping a few feet with a spray of water as a passing swell slackens it. Epps pulls herself to the stern where the cable winds into a tow anchor.

	She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872. One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.

<DIRECTION>
Epps steps from a passageway into a large public room. Tables and chairs are scattered haphazardly, light falling in from windows along the wall where tattered curtains hang. She walks on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A pair of empty glasses sit on a table, an empty sherry decanter beside them. An ashtray sits beside that. Epps stops, reaching down. She pulls back a half-smoked cigarette, lipstick smudging the end, yellowing and fragile from time. And, as she stands there, we see a FIGURE, IN MURKY SILHOUETTE, MOVE PAST THE DOORWAY IN THE BACKGROUND. In an instant it is there and gone.

She puts down the cigarette, having sensed a presence. She turns to the doorway across the room, but there is nothing to be seen now.
</DIRECTION>

INT. CHIMERA - PUBLIC ROOM - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A doll's white face, eyes haunting and coldly blue, stares into the middle distance. It lies on a love seat as Epps steps up. She lifts it. Several other toys lie scattered about as she studies it, when the sound of a TICKING CLOCK CAN BE HEARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beat as Epps holds there. She turns, trying to locate the sound. From across the room, Epps stands, listening. As the TICKING CLOCK sounds from here. She turns, putting down the doll, holding a beat. She approaches, crossing the room, coming finally to a stop before us and what we come to see is an ancient grandfather clock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All but it's minute hand has fallen off its corroded face, but from inside it emits a weak though steady TICKING.

Epps stands there as the clock ticks, looking on, when the TICKING CEASES. A beat as she holds there, as the clock faces her, now silent.

She steps up to the wall, where pictures hang. The Chimera can be seen in better days, sailing full speed on a calm sea.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Epps jumps down to a lower deck. She shines her light up to see that she is in an engine compartment, showing a massive diesel burner. She passes through into another compartment where the giant pistons of the ship's power plant rise up to the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - PASSAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Epps moves, passing still more diesel burners, towering over her in the cavernous space. She moves into a narrowing passage, piping and machinery ducts winding their way into the depths of the ship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally the passage opens into yet another compartment, apparently a cargo hold. Crates and boxes are stacked on loading palettes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the corner, a rotting canvas drape covers something. Epps comes to it. She lifts the canvas, which crumbles away to reveal a 1951 Ferrari sportster. For the exception of a coat of dust and a small amount of corrosion, it is perfectly preserved.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mail bags lie in piles along the wall, stacked between more wooden crates and palettes, when something catches Epps' eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A heavy, metal door in the wall is twisted on it's hinges, as though blown back from some terrific explosive force.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Epps approaches, coming to the twisted door. She shines her light inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A clutter of debris, shelving and wood, are visible in the shadows, when her light catches a glint of something. She swings her light back, revealing a yellowish bright object between broken wood slats.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Epps steps in. She kneels, shining the light closer. The yellow glint is metal. Epps pulls back a slat, sliding away some of the debris to reveal that it is cast from a kilogram ingot of gold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches out. She raises it, completely untouched by the years. She pulls back still more debris, revealing a stack of gold ingots, some having tumbled to the side. She slides away a large trunk that has fallen, pushing off more junk to see that the stack is much larger, perhaps four feet high and five feet across.

Murphy stands in the doorway of a spacious cabin panelled in dark wood. A large desk occupies a corner of the room by the windows. Though dirty and worn with time, everything is ordered and in its place.
</DIRECTION>

Murphy comes to the desk. He sits down in the chair behind it. The surface is clear and uncluttered. He pulls out the drawer to reveal pens, writing paper, a ruler, compass and protractor amidst other sundry items.

Murphy enters to find the engine room engulfed in flames and black smoke. He finds Dodge spraying at it with an extinguisher of his own.

The flames belch up from an oil fire in the turbine well, the heat searing paint on the metal covers. Murphy sprays a cloud of halon and the fire dims, but only for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dodge grabs another extinguisher, his leg burned, face and hands singed.

An EXPLOSION ROCKS THE BOAT and molten flames hurl through the air, catching Murphy's pant leg. He's so engrossed in fighting the flames, he doesn't realize he's on fire.

Murphy crosses in the smoke, coming as close as he dares to the most intense part of the flames. He turns the extinguisher into them, holding it there.

<DIRECTION>
The flames dim, as Dodge joins him on the other side, turning his extinguisher on it too. The fire seems to dim yet again as clouds of halon rise up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fire belches from a duct, crawling across the ceiling. Dodge fires his extinguisher at it, pushing it back across to the wall again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Murphy extinguishes the last of the flames in the turbine well as Dodge brings a snaking tendril of fire down to the deck, and finally out.

Epps slowly pushes open the door. She holds a sack with a few items she's managed to scavenge. Light falls from curtained windows onto the room. A divan sits against the wall. A table stands in the middle of the room, a moth-eaten velvet table cloth sitting under a brass lamp on top. Two twin beds stand on either side.

EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DECK - NIGHT

Murphy and Dodge look on as Epps loads the last of several shotgun shells into the pump action short barrel 12-gauge. She expertly shuttles a round into the chamber with one hand. Dodge takes a hit from his cigarette as Greer crosses from the deck house.

INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A flashlight beam cuts through the darkness as Epps approaches. If this place is creepy in the daylight, it is terrifying now. She comes to a ladder and climbs down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Epps shines her light as she passes through, coming to the cargo hold. She crosses in the darkness, her light catching the tarnished glint of the gold. She comes up to it, stopping there, looking on at it, a perfectly symmetrical fortune.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks around for a place to sit. She drags a palette to the bulkhead, settling in to face the rest of the compartment. She puts her shotgun down beside her and takes out her thermos to pour herself a cup of coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Epps has dozed off when a CLATTERING ECHOES DISTANTLY somewhere in the ship. Epps wakes. It is silent, as she holds there, not sure she heard anything, when a DISTANT BOOMING SOUNDS. She reaches out for the shotgun, intently listening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Epps holds there, another deep BOOMING sounds distantly somewhere. Epps turns, her blood running cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Epps moves along in the darkness when the DISTANT BOOMING CAN BE HEARD BRIEFLY AGAIN. She stops, holding there, in the silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHIMERA - SHAFT ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Epps jumps down into the shaft alley where the ship's massive propeller shaft hangs suspended above her. Epps moves along. Finally she comes out into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHIMERA - ENGINE ROOM - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Where the propeller shaft extends into a large turbine. She continues on, past huge rusting diesel burners, disappearing into the darkness above her, when ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns, shinning her light back from where she came. Nothing moves. Not a sound, but for her breathing and maybe her heart pounding in her chest. ANOTHER BOOM SOUNDS, again echoing distantly in the silence. She shines her light through the line of burners. Nothing moves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Epps moves quietly between the burners. She comes to a massive watertight door at the bulkhead. She steps through, finding herself standing between a row of huge oil storage tanks. THE BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, closer, as suddenly stopping.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She moves on, cautiously walking between the tanks, holding her light out before her. She comes to the end of the compartment and another bulkhead. The BOOMING SOUNDS, still closer. She turns the light into the recesses, showing rusting machinery and a stack of oil drums.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She approaches, holding the shotgun up. As she nears, the BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN. She stops. It is coming from here.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She tenses, raising the shotgun, holding the light as steady as she can manage. The BOOMING SOUNDS YET AGAIN. It is metallic and staccato.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She stops in the corner beside an oil drum. Several drums have toppled and lie scattered in a pile when a draft stirs her hair. She shines her light up to see that she stands at the bottom of a giant hatchway shaft rising all the way through the ship to the top deck and an echoey breeze that betrays a throughway to the outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BOOMING SOUNDS AGAIN, this time coming from the pile of oil drums. She steps closer, raising the shotgun, ready to fire. A beat as she summons her courage, then reaches out to push a drum with her foot, when A BLUR EXPLODES OUT AT HER. She fires the shotgun and a spray of buckshot glances off the steel bulkhead in a shower of sparks, a flurry of frenetic flapping whizzing by her head as she looks up to see a large albatross flying back up the hatchway shaft toward the top of the ship and freedom.

</EPPS>
<DIRECTION>
She wipes her brow on her sleeve, holding there a moment, when she smells something really awful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She steps forward, following the smell, pushing aside the toppled oil drums to see an unidentifiable form in the beam of her flashlight. She steps still closer, training her light on the form to see that it is a human torso. A large gash runs up its middle and the clothing has been torn by scavenging birds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She hesitates, then steps still closer when she steps on something. She starts, then shines the light on the deck in front of her where the body's decaying head looks back with wide, unseeing eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It takes everything she has just to hold there. She shines her light back to the headless torso.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She shines her light beyond that, and up, to reveal a bent steam pipe hanging out over the deck, stained with dried blood, a pair of legs dangling from the pipe when, just behind her, a booted foot comes into frame, lightly touching her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She spins around to see another body above her. Except this one hangs in one piece, suspended from another bent steam pipe. It has been impaled length-wise on the pipe from rectum to mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of its arms has rotted off and lies on the deck below it. A few feet away, a third body hangs impaled from another bent pipe.

Greer comes out onto another deck, stopping there. He looks down the passageway a beat, then moves on. He passes through a hatchway in a bulkhead when A MUSIC BOX CAN BE DISTANTLY HEARD. He stops. The song is "DAISY" ("Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do. I'm half crazy, oh for the love of you.").

He turns the page to see only the words "GOD SAVE US" scrawled in faded red ink. A beat as he holds there, when a CHANNEL OPENS WITH A SHORT BURST ON MURPHY'S RADIO.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dodge stumbles toward the bow, slipping on the wet deck. He goes down, sliding into the water that washes over the starboard rail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls himself up, using a cleat to push off. A deck locker opens and the contents tumble around him. He struggles to pull himself up to the base of the pilothouse. He climbs up and edges his way toward the bow.

Epps, Greer and Murphy look on as Dodge climbs up on the skewed deck crane.

Below, the decks of the tug are swept with seawater as it sinks lower and lower.

Greer pulls back a line, tying it into the deck railing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH DODGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Dodge makes his way up, he's forced to climb onto the other side of the crane to keep from dangling over the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Above, Greer casts a line. It falls near, but out of reach as the swell of the water starts to swing the crane to and fro. Dodge reaches out for the line again, his hand coming close but not close enough.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The swell brings the crane toward the boat one last time and Dodge reaches out, his fingers just coming to the line, coaxing it into his grasp. He pulls it back and hangs on, as the crane sways back with the foundering boat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crane falls away from Dodge, leaving him hanging in space by the line from the bow of the Chimera.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH THE OTHERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Murphy, Greer and Epps look on as Dodge hangs over the water and the tug as its stern slowly sinks beneath the waves.

<DIRECTION>
Dodge climbs the line toward the bow railing as the tug rolls still further to port, the pilothouse dipping into the sea, slipping lower and lower.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH DODGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he pulls himself upward, coming to the bottom of the rail well on the Chimera where Murphy reaches out, just short of Dodge's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SCREECHING SOUNDS and they turn to see the twin tow cables coming taught against the hull in the anchor alley's of the Chimera as the sinking tug pulls them tight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a CONCUSSIVE STRIKE, one cable is freed, snapping against the Chimera's hull like a giant steel guitar string. It starts sliding along the hull as the tug drifts, pulling the cable with it, toward Dodge as he dangles in mid air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dodge pulls himself up, reaching for Murphy, but still short.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A LOUD HISSING SOUNDS and Dodge turns to see misty air escaping from ports and deck vents as the encroaching water forces it out of the tug below decks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tow cable LOUDLY SCRAPES THE HULL in a shower of rust, as Dodge struggles to pull himself up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Murphy reaches out as Dodge extends as far as he can, their hands barely reaching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The tow cable is a mere few feet away and closing, ready to scrape Dodge into the water or smear him across the hull like a bug on a windshield, when Dodge pulls himself up with everything he's got and Murphy grabs his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Murphy pulls, lifting Dodge, as Greer grabs Dodge's other hand and they pull him up, the tow cable sweeping by with a SICKENING GRINDING SOUND OF HEAVY STEEL AGAINST STEEL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dodge turns to see the bow of the tug dip below the surface, slowly going under until disappearing with a last exhalation of misty air. The pilothouse is next to go, the last of it slipping into the frothing water, then the crane, finally disappearing altogether into the depths.

Murphy moves through the pantry area with a pillow case, scavenging for food.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CHIMERA - GALLEY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Epps scavenges for food in the semi-darkness of the large, open galley, when a MOVEMENT CAN BE HEARD SOMEWHERE BEYOND THE ENTRY separating the galley from the outer passageway.
</DIRECTION>
<EPPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Murphy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EPPS>
<DIRECTION>
No one answers. She looks off across the stillness of the galley. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Epps steps into the passageway. Directly across is the entry to the swimming pool. She walks on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Epps steps in. Light falls in from the dirty port holes at the ceiling, every movement echoing off the hard tile walls. She holds there a beat, then turns to go when she sees a GIRL of about 16 facing her on the other side of the pool.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Epps holds there, as the girl only looks back. She is porcelain white, flaxen hair drawn behind her head, her clothing hanging loosely from a frail body.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<DIRECTION>
A beat as Epps stands there.
</DIRECTION>
<EPPS>
<DIRECTION>
(finally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EPPS>
<DIRECTION>
From this distance and in the light it is hard to fully discern the girl's features.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's great evil here, more than you can know. Leave now or you may never leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<EPPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But --
	</DIALOGUE>
</EPPS>
<DIRECTION>
A HATCH CLOSES SOMEWHERE IN THE SHIP. Epps turns to look. When she turns back the girl is gone. A quiet "TICK" SOUND ECHOES in the pool. She looks down to see that the pool is now very, very deep, like a mine shaft falling away into the depths. And, as she stands there, dark water is quickly rising up from the bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She steps back as the water gradually fills the pool to the top. It is very dark and the bottom is indiscernible, when the water begins to churn, as from bubbles of air reaching the surface. Epps steps closer, looking on as a faint red glow can be seen deep in the water below the churning bubbles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she watches, the red glow grows in intensity. The glow spreads, illuminating a broad area until it becomes clear that the water is not water at all but blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And, as the light grows still brighter, a figure is illuminated, well below the surface as it seems to rise up. Epps looks on as the figure rises higher into the light. It is a MAN, fighting desperately to reach the surface. The bubbles that rise up are produced from his silent screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Epps starts forward, but another figure rises to the same point, a WOMAN, also struggling. Another MAN floats up, then another, and another, people floating up, fighting desperately to reach the surface, unable to do so, drowning in blood.
</DIRECTION>
<EPPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My God....
	</DIALOGUE>
</EPPS>
<DIRECTION>
Epps reaches out over the edge, plunging her hand into the blood, reaching for the man's hand, but they are too far apart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She struggles desperately as the man fights to get to the surface.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The others are fighting for the surface too, as Epps reaches out, near tears, helpless to do anything.
</DIRECTION>
<EPPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EPPS>
<DIRECTION>
Everything suddenly stops. A beat as Epps only holds there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The blood is gone, as are the people. The pool is back to its normal state as though nothing had happened, Epps looking on in disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<MURPHY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURPHY>
<DIRECTION>
Epps looks up to see Murphy standing at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<EPPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looking back to the pool)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. CHIMERA - 1ST OFFICER'S STATEROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SOUND OF SOMEONE BREATHING HARD CAN BE HEARD in the dark room. As the CAMERA SLOWLY MOVES INTO THE ROOM, we see that it is Greer, lying on the bed. His body is tense and his arms arch rigidly toward his chest. His jaw is clenched and he expels harsh, guttural utterances, experiencing something between a night terror and a seizure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHIMERA - WHEELHOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sheets of rain come down on the deck in the grey light of morning. Murphy stands on the bridge, looking off at it coming down when Greer steps in.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CHIMERA - PURSERS OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A file drawer comes open, revealing ticket receipts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Epps looks on at it. The receipts are labeled "FULL FARE PASSAGES" and are divided by first, second, and third class. She goes through them, coming to a section that says "ACCOMPANIED CHILDREN."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pulls out the folder, laying it on the counter, opening it. The first page is a receipt for a single passage to Halifax for a Tatterly, Stephen age: 14. She pulls it back to reveal another, Wilson, Harold age: 4. Another, Vitti, Angela age: 17.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pages through the stack, looking at the ages: 3, 15, 6, 11, 1, until coming across a 9. She looks to the name, Klein, David, a boy. She continues paging through the receipts coming to another 9. She stops, looking to the name, Nichols, Katherine age: 16. A girl. She looks to the cabin assignment: "400." She notes that it is the same cabin where Greer was found, when a REVERBERANT CONCUSSION SOUNDS THROUGH THE SHIP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHIMERA - TOP DECK - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dodge runs to the side to see a 15 feet wide by 40 feet tall steel and concrete mid-ocean buoy bounce off the transom as the ship drifts into it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH GREER AND MURPHY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They come to the side at the wheelhouse, seeing the bright orange letters "NOAA" emblazoned on the buoy's float pod as the ship drifts by.
</DIRECTION>
<MURPHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a Noaa buoy.

Dodge quickly ties a loop in a coil of docking line as Greer, Epps, and Murphy look on at the approaching buoy.
</DIRECTION>
<MURPHY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go, let's go, let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURPHY>
<DIRECTION>
Dodge finishes as Epps ties the other end off to a cleat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE BUOY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As it drifts along the side of the Chimera. Murphy drops the line down, the buoy bouncing on the swell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Murphy pulls the loop up as the buoy nears, aiming to hook it on its wind gauge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE BUOY

The buoy approaches, rising and falling with the swell.
</DIRECTION>

Murphy corrects.

	</DIALOGUE>
</EPPS>
<DIRECTION>
Murphy holds the loop steady.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE BUOY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The loop is too low. It's going to miss the mark as the buoy drifts toward it, when the swell drops and the buoy goes down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Murphy yanks on the line.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE BUOY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the loop catches on the wind gauge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the line goes taught he pulls his hands away just in time, the line snapping hard against the rail. Below, the buoy heels over as it's pulled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE BUOY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It drops with the swell, the line stretching, then swinging the giant concrete buoy float into the side of the hull with a huge BOOMING CLANG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The line is smoking with the friction, the steel railing bowing a little with the weight as they look on.

<DIRECTION>
ON THE BUOY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the buoy falls again with a swell and slams into the side of the ship. The water returns, lifting it high.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ship is dragging it back and it begins to rise up as its mooring comes taught. The line rises with it and soon the buoy is at a steep angle as it comes out of the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The buoy is held fast between the docking line and its own mooring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE BUOY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The buoy rises fully from the water, all three tons of it, and as it does, the wind gauge's steel mount begins to bend.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they watch the buoy suspended over the water between the creaking docking line and its own underwater mooring cable.
</DIRECTION>
<DODGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No fucking way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DODGE>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE BUOY
</DIRECTION>

The gauge mount snaps and the docking line flails free, sending the buoy hurtling back into the water in a curtain of spray, whipping wildly from side to side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The buoy swings back and forth as it rights itself, rising on a swell, passing beyond the bow of the Chimera.
</DIRECTION>
<MURPHY>

They look on in silence, the buoy slowly receding as the ship drifts away.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think at least some of the crew went a little nuts. The usual stuff that happens when people stumble on a fortune. Equal parts greed and paranoia, usually resulting in homicide. What happened after that is anybody's guess. But, judging by our Greek friends down below, it doesn't look like the last time.

Greer lies asleep on the bed. But his sleep is fitful, increasingly agitated, tormented. It is as if he tries to speak, but cannot. As THE CAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN, his words are forced and garbled, speaking in the same nonsensical language he spoke earlier, when he wakes with a start.

Epps passes under a catwalk. She moves on, passing a row of standpipes. Epps stops, listening. Somewhere, the WHISPERING CAN BE HEARD, then stops.

As Epps starts toward it again. She and Greer come up to it, stopping there. She kneels, the dim glow shining on her. She reaches out toward it, pulling back Dodge's flashlight, still on.

She turns it off, standing. She shines her light into the darkness and starts off, Greer following.

Epps and Greer move along, shining their lights as they go, when something catches in the beam of Epps' flashlight.
</DIRECTION>

It is Dodge's radio. They stop over it. Epps picks it up, inspecting it. She looks to Greer, when a single dark spot appears on Epps' cheek. It begins to run, a crimson tear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She raises her hand to touch it, inspecting her finger to see that it is blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks to Greer. They both look up to see, hanging suspended above them, Dodge's face staring back down at them from the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has been imperfectly impaled, the sharp point of a high pressure steam pipe protruding from his neck, head hanging limp beside it.

<DIRECTION>
Epps enters the dim passageway from the bright daylight. She moves down the passage, coming finally to the stateroom where Greer was found, room 400.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She holds there a beat, then reaches for the door, hesitating. She opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHIMERA - STATEROOM - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door comes open and Epps steps in. It is dark, though spacious. It is divided into two rooms. Beyond the sitting room in the front, is a bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Epps steps in. A dressing table sits against the far wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large bed is unmade. Suitcases lie open on stands at the foot of the bed, still half full as if they were in the process of being unpacked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From one, she pulls back a woman's gown, a blouse. The other contains shirts, trousers, socks, and underwear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the room a smaller suitcase can be seen lying open on an Ottoman in the corner. Epps crosses to it. She finds a few shirts, and a red print dress, some books. She takes one of the books, opening it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inscribed on the inside of the cover is: "This book belongs to:" and then written in by hand: "Katie Nichols."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A page is marked with a purple ribbon. She opens it to see a children's poem "The Rooster and the Crow" and a drawing of a rooster and a crow and a stanza of a poem: "'Cock-a-doodle doo,' said the rooster to the crow. 'Where are you now? I know, but won't say so.'" She puts it down. A tin penny whistle sits on the table. She picks it up, examining it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She opens a small picture book, thumbing through to see photos of a family, a young mother and father at the beach, the mother and a girl of about 9 years, the girl and an older girl of about 16, the girl she saw at the swimming pool, KATIE. Epps holds on this picture, when A MUSIC BOX SOUNDS. She looks up to the dressing table. On it a music box slowly plays "Daisy."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Epps crosses to it, looking on at the music box as it slowly winds down, then finally stops. A beat. She picks it up, looking at it, when she looks up to see Greer standing there. A beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dirty white light falling into the room through the windows falls on him as he looks off at something we cannot see. His expression is empty, hollow.
</DIRECTION>
<EPPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Greer?
	</DIALOGUE>

He does not hear her as he stands there. She approaches, stepping up.
</DIRECTION>
<EPPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EPPS>
<DIRECTION>
Another beat, as he looks off, into the light, when he slowly turns to see her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat as she looks back. He holds there, the same empty look about him, when he grabs her by the throat and squeezes hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is stunned, breathless, but raises her hands to grip his wrists, fighting him.
</DIRECTION>
<EPPS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Greer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EPPS>
<DIRECTION>
His grip tightens. He is much stronger and her efforts make little difference.
</DIRECTION>
<EPPS>

She hangs on, starting to choke. She drops one hand, searching with it.

<DIRECTION>
He speaks nonsense, his face distorted in an ugly grimace, eyes bulging as Epps fumbles over the table, a tray of glass and silver crashing to the floor as he pushes her back, still choking her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He backs her to the wall, pushing in, closing her windpipe the rest of the way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her hand searches behind her, knocking over a small vase, a basket, some books. It comes to a brass desk lamp. It falls, a little out of reach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She is going to black out any second, as Greer strangles her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her hand comes to the desk lamp, grabbing it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She raises the lamp, swinging with all her might, connecting with Greer's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stumbles back, a gash laid into his face, as Epps sucks in air, gagging and coughing, her neck purple with finger marks. She fumbles her radio up.

<DIRECTION>
Blood is running down his face as Greer comes for her again. She throws down the radio.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bed stands between them. She feints right, then left. He's dazed and has blood in his eyes. She manages to slip by, but he dives, taking her down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He drags her back along the floor, spinning her around. He raises a fist to ram into her face when WHAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Epps has shoved the butt of her flashlight into his crotch and he comes up SCREAMING. He grabs her face, striking her with his other hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She swings the flashlight again and cracks him across the head. He swings yet again and connects, knocking her across the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She lies in a heap as Greer climbs to his feet, enraged and bleeding.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He unbuckles his belt as he approaches, pulling it from his waist to do God knows what.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Epps looks around to see him approaching. And we see that she has unhinged her gill knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As his foot steps near, she lets go and drives the knife with all her might into his boot, plunging the blade through his foot and into the floor. He SCREAMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment he stops, looks to her. He is a bloody, wretched, enraged mess. He starts toward her as Murphy appears in the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as Greer is upon her, Murphy blind sides Greer from behind at full speed, knocking him down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Greer and Murphy struggle as Epps climbs unsteadily to her feet. She staggers to them and raises the flashlight over Greer, bringing it down on his head.

Epps steps from room 400 into the passageway. It is lit with sconces running its length and the elegant furnishings and objets d'art stretching to the far end are all in their original condition. DISTANT MUSIC FROM THE BALLROOM CAN BE HEARD as Epps stands there. She moves along.

Epps walks in the passageway. Doors are open and she looks in to see people doing various things, some packing and putting their things in order.

Epps walks down the passage, rounding the corner to see three STEWARDS fighting with a fourth MAN in a tuxedo. They lift him up and carry him off down the stairs as he shouts and protests. She moves on, through a pair of double doors, into

INT. CHIMERA - STORAGE COMPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Epps moves through the now lighted storage area off the galley. A group of CREWMEN stand around at the other end and, as Epps nears, she sees that four figures can be seen among them. They are four men, OFFICERS, swaying gently from the ship's movement as they hang from ropes around their neck, dead. Epps keeps moving, through doors at the other end.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A commotion can be heard at the other end of the passageway as Epps keeps moving. A WOMAN SCREAMS, and is cut off when a door slams shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The DISTANT MUSIC HAS BEEN REPLACED WITH INDISCERNIBLE SHOUTING, as of someone commandeering the microphone somewhere
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she walks, she passes an open door where several CREWMEN fight over a steamer trunk, which breaks open, scattering the contents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Epps walks along, coming to another door where a dead man and woman are laying in the middle of the room as a STEWARD takes money from a wallet. The steward looks up, reaches over and slams the door shut. She continues on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another door stands open as she comes to it, back at room 400. She stops. A REPETITIVE SOUND CAN BE HEARD, coming from inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHIMERA - ROOM 400 - CONTINUOUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Epps steps in as the SOUND CONTINUES. She crosses the sitting room, coming to the doorway of the bedroom to find several MUTINEERS, some in stewards attire, others wearing ships officers caps, obviously taken from their rightful owners.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The repetitive sound comes from here, bed springs. And, from between the men, a woman's bare legs hang over the end of the bed as a pair of man's legs in boots lie between them, the bed rocking, the others looking on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Epps turns to see the father. He is on his knees, hands tied behind his back as he is forced to watch from the foot of the bed.

EPPS LOOKS DOWN TO SEE

EPPS' POV

a geometric pattern of a lotus on the Persian carpet at her feet. When she looks up again she sees what the father sees.

<DIRECTION>
The mutineer finishes, climbing off the woman. Another of the men pulls her up to reveal that she is no woman at all, but Katie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The mother and sister lie in a bloody heap near-by as one of the other mutineers steps up to Epps.
</DIRECTION>

As she approaches she sees that the tank is empty. Greer is nowhere to be seen and the skylight at the top is broken out.

Murphy and Epps run toward the other end of the ship. As they do, something can be seen lying in the middle of the passage some distance down.

AT THE OTHER END

Epps and Murphy slow to see that it is a body, lying face down in the passage.

	You saw it coming as well as I did. Dodge had his plans, starting with scuttling the boat. And Greer too, except he went nuts. Couldn't take it, I guess. Could've happened in the middle of downtown Anchorage. But did it make him any less dangerous? I don't think so.

FOOTSTEPS SOUND at the end of the passage. Epps pulls back into the shadows, holding there.

The footsteps sound as if they are coming down stairs at the other end, when the FOOTSTEPS STOP.

Epps holds there, listening intently in the silence when, at the other end, THE SOUND OF CREAKING METAL, as from a hatch slowly opening, can be heard. It stops. All is silent, WHEN THE HATCH CREAKS AGAIN at the other end. She begins moving toward it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she approaches, she can see that the hatch is half open, swaying slightly with the movement of the ship.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CREAKING SOUNDS behind her. She turns, just as Murphy steps into view. She ducks as he fires and a spray of buckshot ricochets off the metal around her.

She scrambles on her belly as Murphy fires again. She swings down from the catwalk, letting herself fall to the next deck.

Epps stops where she is in the cavernous engine room, looking on at the massive hull rising above her as the RUMBLING GROWS IN INTENSITY. Though it seems to resonate throughout the ship, it seems to originate from here, from directly below, as though the hull were being dragged over a rocky bottom.
</DIRECTION>

She steps back as the sound grows still louder, until it becomes absolutely deafening.

A few rivets pop in the hull. Then a few more, as the RUMBLING GROWS STILL LOUDER.

Epps puts her hands to her ears and begins to back away, when the RUMBLING REACHES A PINNACLE. The rivets are springing out of the hull like machine gun fire when the steel plate of the hull gives way, A MASSIVE CRAG OF ROCK SMASHING THROUGH WITH A TREMENDOUS BOOM AND A TORRENT OF SEAWATER.

Epps is trying to pull back the boiler stays, without luck. She swims down lower, finding a pipe fitting she pries at the stays, without luck, when a form drifts into view in the murky water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Several more forms appear. They are human, suspended in the water. As Epps looks, the several forms have become many. They are the bodies of the dead she saw in the pool before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they look on at her from where they are, one form emerges. It is Katie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches toward Epps, as if beckoning her to take her hand from the other side. Epps raises her hand, taking it.

The girl leads Epps down into the murky darkness where she finds a way out. She takes her back further, coming to the breech, leading her out and into a cool green void of water.

The ship sinks further and Murphy is pulled to the edge of the stack. He frantically grabs for something to hold on to, without success, until he is finally pulled into the smoke stack and sucked into the bowels of the ship by the rushing water.
