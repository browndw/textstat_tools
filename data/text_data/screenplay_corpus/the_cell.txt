FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SPECK OF DUST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Grains of sand dance in the wind. As we glide over a VAST DESERT, the speck of dust becomes a HORSE AND RIDER. CATHERINE YOUNG straddles the beautiful black animal, her mesmerizing eyes scanning the horizon. A curious breeze blows across her exquisite face and she drinks it in, as if the wind itself were telling something to her...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Catherine sees a FLICKERING LIGHT in the sand. She pulls the reins and the horse stops moments before the dune drops into nothingness. She dismounts, affectionately scratches the horse's neck, and follows the LIGHT. When she looks over her shoulder, the Arabian is now a child's WOODEN HOBBY HORSE. Not surprised, Catherine smiles and walks down a dune, sand sliding beneath her feet...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She finds herself in a valley of dead trees whose decayed, gnarled limbs appear to form hands. The light dances across her face. She shades her eyes and pinpoints the source...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SMALL MIRROR reflecting rays of bright sun, housed within a locket and chain. It's held by EDWARD, a haunted-looking boy of seven with a precocious grin and piercing eyes. He sits on a fallen tree trunk, patiently waiting for her arrival.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for the horse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
He's a shy child, yet comfortable with Catherine.
</DIRECTION>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You liked him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's beautiful...

Edward smiles, delighted he made her happy.

The boy frowns.

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You promised.

</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
A devilish glint in his eye, Edward redirects the mirror. Catherine follows the flicker to a TOY BOAT in the sand.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We can't fit into that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Edward shines light in her eyes, momentarily blinding her, then snaps the locket shut. When her vision clears, Catherine sees a GIANT SHIP perched among the dunes. A craft weighing hundreds of tons just sitting there in the desert.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That'll do.

	<DIALOGUE>

</CATHERINE>
<EDWARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mocky-Lock.

</EDWARD>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no... No you don't.

<EDWARD>

	"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman. Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDWARD>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bet we can fix it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
She opens a rusted iron DOOR. It makes an HORRIFIC SCREECHING SOUND. Similar to metal-on-metal, but more piercing, more pained. As if made by a living thing.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (familiar with the noise, a warning to him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ed-ward...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
The boy's FACE CONTORTS, turning into something half-human, half-animal. A monster. Mocky-Lock. He SCREECHES, trying to frighten Catherine, but she cocks her head...
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We agreed. No more Mocky-Lock.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>

The creature sticks its tongue out and DIVES.

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Edward!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
But it's too late! Edward/Mocky Lock slithers into the sand and disappears. Resigning herself to a failure, she opens the palm of her left hand, revealing a SMALL BUMP in the flesh between thumb and forefinger. She presses hard and...

INT. LABORATORY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are looking at a large SCREEN showing an electronically generated three-dimensional view of a human brain featuring color-coded neurological activity. In a specific section of the image, cells flash from yellow to red...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK TO REVEAL HENRY WEST surrounded by computers, monitors, electronics, and keyboards. DR. MIRIAM KENT stands before a peculiar diagnostic machine scrutinizing data and images. Both wear garb favored by surgeons or microchip assemblers. The impressive, weird computer system HUMS as it shifts programs, the unusual brain image changing colors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH A LARGE WINDOW, we see into an ADJOINING ROOM within which a HUMAN FIGURE hangs suspended in mid-air by a series of cables designed to simulate flotation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE CONSOLE, Miriam uses a pen to hit specific areas of the touch-sensitive screen, changing the complex CHEMICAL SYMBOLS displayed there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, a series of pharmaceuticals are injected into an intravenous tube feeding the sleeve/arm of the figure. A featherweight cloth MASK electronically rises, revealing the sleeping face of Catherine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE CONSOLE, Miriam hits a button and speaks into an intercom microphone.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sing a song of sixpence...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, there is no reaction from Catherine.

	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE CONTROL ROOM, Henry hits a switch and Catherine is lowered to the pedestal. Miriam checks Monitors displaying Catherine's vital signs and continuing what must be a routine, presses numbers on a keypad to open the PRESSURIZED AIRTIGHT DOOR separating the two areas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, lights come on and Miriam eases Catherine out of the apparatus. She checks her pupil dilation, pulse, throat, and reflexes. She pokes and prods with a familiarity that would seem rude to an outside observer, but is nothing to them. Getting to her feet, we see that Catherine's BODYSUIT is made of an unusual dark fabric almost liquid in consistency.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE CONSOLE, Henry moves to another section and for the first time, we see there are two elaborate neural monitors. And the "brain" pictured here is smaller. Younger...
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Mister E." is doing fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
REVEAL A SECOND FIGURE suspended from the ceiling in the PROCEDURE ROOM. A SMALL BOY is lowered to the pedestal and as Miriam records data, Catherine removes the child's "mask," displaying the haunted face of Edward. Clearly, the boy is in some kind of catatonic state.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did we go sailing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Almost. Mocky-Lock showed up.

	"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."

</MIRIAM>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.

Henry communicates with them via the intercom.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did that come from again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
Catherine looks annoyed - How could he forget?
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A nursery rhyme.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Catherine detaches the cables and eases Edward's frail body into a waiting wheelchair. Miriam takes a penlight and examines the boy's eyes... An emotionless void, oddly beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRIAM>
<DIRECTION>
(thinking aloud)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nursery rhymes, fairy tales, the bogeyman... All preparation for the horrors of the real world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Making certain the child is comfortable, Catherine covers him with a blanket, rests a teddy bear on his lap, and pushes him into the CONTROL ROOM, accompanied by Miriam. Henry types in a command and moves to join them.
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anybody hungry? I'm hungry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<DIRECTION>
A BUZZER sounds and ANOTHER DOOR HISSES OPEN... A constantly fretting administrator, BARRY COOPERMAN, is waiting for them in the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<COOPERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Edward's parents are here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COOPERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
We can see it in Catherine's face - this isn't good news.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAMPBELL CENTER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Situated in a corporate/industrial area north of San Diego, California, a series of well-secured buildings form a mini compound. A sign near the gate reads CAMPBELL CENTER - A DIVISION OF SUNERSET INDUSTRIES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - EDWARD'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Although this is a hospital room filled with medical equipment, its sterility has been camouflaged with toys, posters, photographs, and drawings to make it more "homey." (Some hint at aspects of Edward's fantasy world). Every comfort has been provided and no expense spared.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Henry, Miriam, and Catherine, now wearing funky/casual clothes under a lab coat, stand opposite Cooperman. Sitting on the bed with Edward is ELLA BAINES, an elegantly dressed woman in her mid-40's. There is a soulfulness to her, but the husband, LUCIEN BAINES, 60's, possesses the icy demeanor of a corporate tycoon. One might write him off as cold, but we sense a genuine love for his wife and child. Ella smiles and caresses Edward's hair.
</DIRECTION>
<ELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He needs a haircut.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLA>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell the nurse.

(sensing something in Edward)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, he loves when you visit.

</CATHERINE>
<ELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My husband wonders if that's true.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(delivering bad news)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He wants to place Edward in a hospital.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELLA>
<DIRECTION>
Seeing an unfunded future, Henry's ready to disassociate himself from Miriam and Catherine...
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are other applications for the scanner, Mr. Baines...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HENRY>
<LUCIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I realize that, Henry...

(to Miriam)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I know your work, Dr. Kent, is invaluable to this company...

	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know about me, though, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<LUCIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Catherine, we've waited eighteen months for signs of progress...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIEN>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's been progress.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<LUCIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but there is no proof the procedure works. All I have is a belief that your interaction with my son is not a hallucination.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIEN>
<DIRECTION>
Catherine is hurt and vulnerable due to exhaustion and the intensity of her experience with Edward, but feels she must defend herself.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Cooperman, Miriam, Henry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You picked me, remember? And I took the job. Gladly. This is the next wave and I want to be part of it...

	No one is doubting your ability.

</COOPERMAN>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then what is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Introspective and solemn-eyed, Lucien takes a moment, then:
</DIRECTION>
<LUCIEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've invested millions of dollars in this study... And I've convinced others to do the same. I suppose I should feel responsible to them, but I don't. I could care less if they see a profit. I'm responsible to my boy, that's all that matters.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks her in the eye)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You tell me... Am I doing the right thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCIEN>
<DIRECTION>
OFF CATHERINE'S FACE...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WHITE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At first, we're not sure where we are or what's happening. It's too bright, the space confining. As our eyes adjust, we seem to be in a bathroom or shower stall. We HEAR a WOMAN CRYING and the camera finds ANNE VICKSEY. Dark circles beneath eyes red and puffy from crying. Hair wet and ratted. Sweater and pants damp and stained. Barefoot, she shivers from cold and fear...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK to show more of her surroundings. The white-tiled 10' x 8' room features a SHOWER HEAD, TOILET, and a push button SPIGOT for drinking water. Two walls are SOLID, the other two MIRRORED, the glass covered by thick clear plastic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The floor is littered with empty food wrappers - candy bars, juice boxes. In the center of the floor is a DRAIN and above her, on the ceiling, a FLUORESCENT LAMP, also encased in clear plastic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is no door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mechanism CLICKS. Then a RUMBLING... Anne seems to know what's coming. She presses against the wall, removes her arms from the sleeves of the sweater, hunches down, and raises the garment over her head, forming a tent.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WATER ERUPTS from the shower head. There is no steam, so this water must be cold. Shaking, Anne whispers a count to herself - "One-one thousand, two-one thousand, three..." and so on. The spray hits everything in the room - mirror, toilet, floor - and a food wrapper drifts toward the drain.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thirty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
She peeks up from the tent, but the water has not stopped, and that isn't what she expected. We hear a soft SUCKING NOISE and a CLICK. The wrapper rises on a puddle of water. Anne POUNDS her fist on the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (angry, scared)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	THIRTY!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
A puddle forms around her feet and she realizes the drain has somehow been sealed shut. Her panic intensifies as we hear another CLICK and the water pressure increases.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the darkened procedure room, Miriam finds Catherine standing between the two suspension devices, alone.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Catherine turns, nods, and tries to smile. Has she been crying? Miriam steps further into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He hates me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MIRIAM>

Catherine nods.

<MIRIAM>

(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't say "hates." Dislikes, distrusts, maybe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Catherine laughs. Exactly what Miriam wanted.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRIAM>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She adores you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<CATHERINE>

	She thinks I can bring Edward back.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someday you can. We all believe that...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Catherine halfheartedly nods, but her mind is elsewhere, focused on the two apparatuses.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to try it. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Miriam knows what this is about.
</DIRECTION>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've been over this a dozen times. No.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not? Just once. A trial run. What harm could it do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want to find out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<DIRECTION>
Ever the doctor, Miriam finds herself surreptitiously examining Catherine's eyes, flesh tone, a slight trembling in her fingertips.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why is it taking so long for us to reach him? Because we've been reactive, that's why. And we need to be active.
	</DIALOGUE>

Miriam reaches for Catherine's wrist and takes her pulse.

As Miriam examines her, Catherine continues:

<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>

	<DIALOGUE>
	It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him. Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I do it all the time!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd be there for him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he might blame you for terrifying him. That one moment could erase all you've accomplished. And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MIRIAM>
<CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
(defeated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, okay...

</CATHERINE>

Miriam takes a penlight and examines Catherine's eyes.

<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Besides, I don't know what it might do to you. You're already exhausted.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

	Good. We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.

	Yes mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<MIRIAM>

Miriam exits, but Catherine remains, still curious what could happen if things were reversed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The corridors are dark and most everyone has gone home. At the NURSES STATION, a staff member observes the child on a closed-circuit monitor. Further down the hall, Miriam and Henry exit. Wearing a (chic) thrift store coat and lugging a worn book bag, Catherine stands outside Edward's room, watching him sleep.

EXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GREEN FORD PICK-UP TRUCK cruises down this deserted stretch of two-lane blacktop, the driver carefully maintaining the speed limit. He signals and exits...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The truck rumbles along a stretch of bumpy, unpaved road. The area is desolate, depressing, and deserted. It feels like no one's been anywhere near here for years. The pick-up stops at a RUSTED GATE and the DRIVER, a tall, lean, sinewy fellow undoes a combination lock-and-chain. We do not yet see his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The truck parks inside a charred barn, now hidden from view, and the driver steps out, followed by his DOG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A magnificent WHITE GERMAN SHEPHERD. We notice a GLINT in its BLUE EYES - the animal's an albino. The driver points and whistles. Well-trained, the Shepard sprints to the gate and waits, keeping a watchful eye on the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CELL - OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the outside, a passerby would never know this sanctuary existed. Within the foundation of a farm building never completed, we find a small room in the center of a much larger space. The cell. We hear the WHIR of ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT and notice VIDEO CAMERAS mounted on tripods pointed at the two-way glass. We follow CABLES to a massive VIDEO RECORDER - the type used in surveillance, able to record for days without maintenance, and an elaborate TIMING DEVICE connected to a series of VALVES and SWITCHES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As if in a beatific trance, the driver moves to the window and gently rests his palm on the glass. ANNE MOVES! Arms flailing, mouth gasping, eyes filled with dread. The last spark of life... The driver JUMPS, startled and frightened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Almost shamefully, he turns and hides, unable to look at her. Suddenly, his body tenses and writhes, as if seized by torturous pain. He opens his mouth in a silent scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then, quickly as it came, the pain subsides. Hidden in shadow, he breathes deeply, regaining self-control. He waits, then moves back to the glass. Anne's dead face floats past him. Almost angelic. He watches her and leans his head against the window, closer. And the driver catches his own reflection in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>

Meet CARL STARGHER.

EXT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Small and isolated, the nearest neighbor a block away.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The place is a mess. Computer print-outs, dirty dishes, unopened mail, videotapes, and notepads cover tables, chairs and floor. On the crammed bookshelves, psychology texts sit next to volumes on mythology, religion, and the occult. Totems, figurines and artifacts (Central and South American in origin) adorn the walls and tables.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Portishead plays on the stereo, we find Catherine suffering from insomnia, wearing goofy-yet-hip eyeglasses, sweatpants and a UCSD T-shirt, sharing a late-night snack with her pet CAT. She shuts the refrigerator door and we linger on an odd POSTCARD taped to the surface. A kitschy postcard of a warrior/goddess.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We MOVE out of shadow, toward a bright focused light, following the albino German Shepherd - VALENTINE - as it enters a VAST SUBTERRANEAN ROOM. Most of the walls have been knocked down, leaving only thick support posts. Valentine finds Stargher in a DUGOUT PIT - about five feet deeper than the rest of the room - polishing a stainless steel table. A bright tungsten work light hangs above, and near it is the chain, cables and hooks of a customized MECHANICAL HOIST.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The dog picks up an unpleasant scent and follows it to a far corner where there are empty jugs of BLEACH sitting next to a long, deep cast iron TUB. Stargher WHISTLES and Valentine obediently retreats to a KENNEL CAGE. Stargher gives him a chew toy and locks the dog inside before moving to the tub.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soaking in the bleach is the nude corpse of Anne Vicksey. The interior of the tub is glazed with gleaming porcelain and the whiteness of her flesh makes it appear as though she is floating in nothingness, but what hypnotizes and appalls are her eyes. Wide open, transformed by the chlorine into something ghostly, they are unforgettable.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the bleach gurgles down the drain, Stargher lifts Anne from the tub and carries her to the table. He places her face up and dries her with a clean white towel. He moves her limbs, lips, hips, and hands into desired positions then retreats into shadow. In the harsh light, against the shiny table, the bleached body has the quality of an apparition and we almost expect her to move...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We HEAR Stargher remove his clothes and he steps into the pool of light. Nude, we see that his lean, muscular frame is laced with some rough tatoos. When he turns his back to us, we find EIGHT METAL RINGS, thick and strong, PIERCED through his flesh. Two columns of four on either side of the spine, running from shoulder blade to just below the waist. What in God's name are they for?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stargher shuts off the work light and moves to an area where he keeps TELEVISION MONITORS and VCRs. He inserts a videocassette taken from the surveillance deck and watches the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In BLACK AND WHITE, we see Anne awaken in the cell. Her first moments inside. Disoriented, terrified, trapped, she examines her surroundings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stargher is mesmerized by her fear. Fast-forwarding to her death, he presses a remote and we get SOUND. Anne screaming, begging for her life. Aroused, stimulated, Stargher drinks it in like a symphony. Valentine cowers in the back of his cage, hating this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lying on her bed (a waterbed), Catherine sleepily stares at the ceiling, rolls onto her side, and feels herself drawn into the comforter. The folds of the fabric become ripples. Ripples become dunes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. EDWARD'S WORLD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And we find ourselves in the DESERT of EDWARD'S WORLD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We fly over dunes and come up behind Catherine as she struggles through waves of sand. The tree trunk is up ahead and we glimpse someone hiding inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Catherine reaches. MOCKEY-LOCK ERUPTS FROM WITHIN THE TREE TRUNK! SNARLING! Catherine retreats, silently screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN HER OWN BED, Catherine's eyes are open. In sharp contrast to a typical reaction to a nightmare, she remains calm. No sweaty face, no gasp, no reaction at all, really. She might as well have been dreaming of puppy dogs. Wide awake, her eyes return their gaze to the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go. To. Sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STARGHER HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHAINS attached to bizarre HOOKS dangle from the ceiling. Admiring Anne's body, Stargher links the hooks to the rings in his back. He presses a remote unit and up in the rafters, a series of GEARS click into motion. The sound is torturous as the mechanical hoist LIFTS Stargher off the ground, pulling at the rings, strips of flesh rising. Stargher grimaces, but clearly he wants the pain, needs it. As the hoist clicks into another gear, it carries Stargher over the table until his body is perfectly positioned above Anne's.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the flickering weird light of the television screen, Stargher resembles something from the twisted imagination of William Blake - a levitating demon ready to debauch an innocent angel. With his free hand, he touches himself, chains clinking and swaying.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RIVER BANK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A railroad bridge and highway span an almost-bone-dry creek bed. Gathered beneath the overpass are the POLICE, CORONER, CRIMINIALISTS, AND A LOCAL FBI. A SEDAN travels down a service road and stops nearby. TWO MEN exit, identify themselves as FBI and move to the crime scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Special Agent GORDON RAMSEY is well-groomed, prides himself on professionalism, and follows the Bureau party line. Special Agent PETER NOVAK is rough around the edges, introspective, and intense. A loner who marches to the tune of a peculiar drummer, he's unconventionally handsome with probing eyes. He moves slowly, observing the scene - the world, for that matter - from a unique perspective.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Ramsey finds the FBI's local liaison - AGENT COLE - Novak oblivious to the people around him, touches dirt, smells the air, and examines road, river, bridge and sky.

</DIRECTION>
<NOVAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks for waiting, Teddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NOVAK>
<DIRECTION>
Teddy gives Novak a friendly, respectful salute - "My pleasure." Novak dons gloves, nods to an FBI PHOTOGRAPHER and assists Teddy Lee in snipping wire and peeling back thick clear plastic. As the photographer reacts to a strong smell, Teddy comments.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Novak looks into the dead white eyes of Anne Vicksey, trying to imagine the horrors she beheld. He moves to the creek and sees only a few inches of water. His eyes move from the drop site to the highway above.
</DIRECTION>
<TEDDY_LEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The poor thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TEDDY_LEE>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH! We're up there now, ON THE OVERPASS, with the photographer and Novak, examining TIRE TRACKS in the soft shoulder. Novak peers over the edge at the crime scene, steps back, and focuses on the highway - imagining the killer's truck as it disappeared into the night.

He opens his eyes and watches John kiss Julia goodbye as she returns to work. Stargher looks down and we see what he's been working on - A TOY DOLL. Female. Stripped of its clothes, a single metal ring stuck through its plastic neck.

His lunch finished, Ramsey is on a cell-phone talking to his wife. Chain-drinking coffee, Novak scrutinizes photos of the tire tracks.

STARGHER'S HANDS COME AT HER FROM BEHIND! One grabs her hair and the other covers her face with a chloroform-soaked towel. He presses so hard, she cannot scream, cannot move. After a brief struggle, he SHOVES her into her car and holds her until she passes out. Stargher pushes Julia into the passenger seat and starts the car. Pulls a dog treat from his pocket and WHISTLES. The Shepherd instantly perks up. Perfectly healthy. And jumps into the car.

EXT. STARGHER HOUSE/NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sparsely populated lower-middle class neighborhood. A half dozen plain houses at the end of a cul-de-sac. Bare trees. Brown lawns. Crows in the air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house furthest from the main road has a white Ford F250 pick-up in the driveway. Green trim.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SUBURBAN, hidden from Stargher's house, four-wheels it through a prairie and stops outside the backyard of a PRESCHOOL, where two more Suburbans and a van already wait.

INT. PRESCHOOL - DAY

Stockwell introduces Ramsey and Novak to BROCK, leader of the FBI Tactical Unit, a calm, confident ex-Marine wearing a black uniform and body armor.

EXT. STARGHER HOUSE - DAY

Quiet. Calm. And then we catch a glimpse of a FIGURE advancing, using any cover he can, until he is right outside the house. The sneaky SWAT team member, ERICSON, whispers into his throat mic.

INT. STARGHER HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Valentine is muzzled and led away as the PARAMEDICS load Stargher onto a stretcher. Agent Stockwell turns to a worried Novak.
</DIRECTION>
<STOCKWELL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They'll take him to County General. Reid's already there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STOCKWELL>
<NOVAK>
	<DIALOGUE>

Stockwell nods and follows the stretcher outside. A stoic Ramsey enters from the living room and Novak can see the disappointment in his eyes.

INT. STARGHER HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ramsey leads Novak into Stargher's "workroom." It's all here, the table, the piercing supplies, the bleach. An odd, grisly collection of DOLLS fills cubby holes in a wooden storage/shelf unit. Novak's eyes are like a camera, documenting and storing as much information as possible, but it's overwhelming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves through the basement. Careful not to touch anything. He stops and focuses on the hoist and eight hooks situated over the stainless steel table. (NOTE: ON THE WINCH'S MOTOR IS A WORN PLAQUE READING "CARVER INDUSTRIAL EQUIPMENT" with a logo).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ramsey switches on the video monitor and the screen fills with images of Anne dying in the cell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Novak is painfully, tragically drawn to this. Although he's seen his share of horrific things, Novak is truly disturbed by the sight of Anne, desperate to escape, drowning, slowly dying, and he knows: This is what will happen to Julia Hickson unless he finds her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CELL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK. WATER SPRAYS FROM THE SHOWER. Caught by surprise, Julia blocks the spray with her hands and searches for a shut off valve. Of course, there is none. Thirty seconds later, the water stops. Like an animal caught in a trap, Julia's eyes dart around her "cage." What kind of hell is this? Shivering, she catches herself in the mirror and looks deeply into it. Something's odd about the glass. Is someone watching her? She bangs on it with her fist.
</DIRECTION>
<JULIA>

INT. KERN COUNTY HOSPITAL - EXAMINATION ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HUMAN EYE. No movement, no deviation of the iris. A fixed stare. The catatonic Stargher lies in a hospital bed, wrists cuffed to the frame. An IV feeds him fluids and monitors report his vital signs. As a nervous NURSE exits, we see TWO POLICEMEN standing guard in the outer hallway. Novak, Ramsey and Teddy Lee stand by as the killer is examined by DR. MILTON REID, a brilliant forensic M.D. currently shining an opthalmoscope into Stargher's eyes. He pulls away and checks the ELECTROENCENPHELOGRAM already on a lightbox.
</DIRECTION>

	Minimal activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. And here, the anterior cingulate cortex.

	...thirty years. Most likely, he's exhibited symptoms for awhile now, but the infraction - the breach - didn't occur 'til today. You never know when it'll happen, at what age, or why. The triggers vary, but the results don't.

Ramsey backs off, knowing his partner is on the verge of really losing it. Reid thinks perhaps he shouldn't, but sensitive to Novak's pain and anger, mentions it anyway - if only to keep his friend from true hopelessness.

A SMALL TV SCREEN shows footage of Anne drowning in the cell. Catherine, Cooperman, Henry, and Miriam watch with curiosity, disgust, pity.

	Each tape is the same. He provides food, drinking water, a toilet. Periodically, a shower starts. It's on some kind of timer - he's clever with machines, building things.

Cooperman guides Novak and Ramsey into the lab. The FBI men are impressed, but neither is quite sure what to make it all. The FBI escort team leader gets Ramsey's signature and Novak undoes the cuffs from Stargher's wrists and ankles. Following Miriam's direction, the escorts guide the gurney carrying Stargher into the procedure room. As Cooperman shows them out, Henry seals shut the door. Miriam assumes responsibility for Stargher's care and checks his pulse, IV, pupil dilation, and vital signs...

Vision fades. Darkness. A faint light. Microscopic veins in the eyelid become wires connected to chips. And we're MOVING, into the circuitry.

ENTRANCE ONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STARGHER'S WORLD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pattern of the electronics grows into something more organic, textured, concrete. Evolving into a world. Black and shadow-filled, it resembles a labyrinthine complex of vertical walls with cubicle like rooms carved deep into its core.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Our journey into this bleak, grim place continues and we occasionally glimpse brief images of a boy's baptism.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT with this journey are sections of cloudy blackness and fragmented visions of CATHERINE connected to the apparatus, face masked, DESCENDING into this world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is an abrupt SHIFT from still images to regular motion and we find ourselves gliding over a tidepool filled with tiny fish and tadpoles. At water's edge, lying on rough, pebble-strewn ground, is a HAND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Catherine's hand. We sense MOVEMENT, but she remains still. From the darkness comes a DOG. Black in color and featureless, it sniffs Catherine, dismisses her, and meanders into a cubicle opposite her, disappearing from view. After a moment of odd quiet, a DROP OF BLOOD hits the mask and we follow Catherine's hand as it moves to the cloth and removes it from her own face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN MACROSCOPIC SUPER SLOW-MOTIONS, another BLOOD DROPLET sails 64 into the air and comes crashing down, hitting a RED ANT, catapulting it onto what looks like a tree, but is just a TWIG. As the insect scurries away, MORE DROPS pound the earth, splatter against "twig trees," and explode into pools of stagnant water...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we begin to realize that this miniature landscape is the world into which Catherine descended.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sits up, shivering, and breathes deeply, acclimating to her surroundings. The "floor" is covered with filth, ash, pebbles, and insects. Water is present in many forms, puddles, moisture, dripping ceilings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eyes focusing, queasy, not fully "awake," Catherine notices the crimson stain on the cloth mask and the blood droplets showering the air. She turns and finds the source.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BLACK DOG stands in the opposite room next to a tub full of BLOOD, shaking himself dry after his "bath." Satisfied, the animal stops and trots away. Still adjusting to this nightmarish realm, Catherine at first doesn't hear it, but then realizes that somewhere, a child is CRYING. She looks around, then through a crack in the "floor," briefly catches sight of a BOY beneath her, on a level lower than hers. As he disappears into corridor ending in "nothing," we PULL BACK to show a MASSIVE LANDSCAPE of blocks, cubicles, crawlspace, walls, stairs, and ladders. Leading everywhere and nowhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Catherine spots the boy as he crawls into a specific "room." Shortly after, a LIGHT comes on within the cubicle and she moves to it. We feel as though we're looking at a series of interlocked tenement rooms, some walls of which have been torn away to expose rooms within, rooms with no windows or doors. Following a path of fragile steps, Catherine makes her way to the LIGHTED ROOM and enters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - LIGHTED ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A mottled HORSE stands with its head down, nose kissing the floor, allowing the BOY to caress its neck. This sweet animal is an incrongruous vision in this hellish world and Catherine approaches with respect.
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
The frightened child retreats into a corner of the claustrophobic room, but the horse does not startle. Surprisingly - to the boy - the horse takes an affectionate step toward Catherine, inviting her to take over. Catherine allows the mare to smell her, then vigorously scratches along the mane and shoulder, much to the horse's delight.

The boy takes a few steps toward her, out of the shadows, but he seems more concerned about something in the ceiling than "connecting" with Catherine. Very anxiously, he looks at the wall behind Catherine and watches an old wind-up kitchen TIMER click down.

Young Stargher RUNS at her and SHOVES her hard! Catherine FALLS BACK just as EIGHT SHEETS OF GLASS drop from the ceiling! Like oversize razor blades, they slice the horse into four clean sections. They separate and compact the quadrants until four glass-contained sections of dissected horse stand within the room. Catherine SCREAMS, but the mare barely acknowledged what happened. Betraying no emotion, the boy runs. The shaken Catherine takes a moment to collect herself, then gives chase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE LABYRINTH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Young Stargher knows his way around the landscape, but Catherine has difficulty simply keeping him in sight. She runs, climbs and crawls. Until she's utterly lost and disoriented. Tired and having difficulty breathing, she drops to her knees and "cools down." She hears a NOISE nearby, gets to her feet, and finds a GEARED MECHANISM connected to some kind of SHUTTERED DOOR composed of an almost metallic-looking glass. Curious yet cautious, she examines the nearby walls, floor, and ceiling for any signs of "traps" akin to the glass blades. Finding none, she pulls the mechanism and quickly steps back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shutter opens and Catherine knows there's something alive in the tiny cubicle beyond. She retreats into shadow, hiding. Released from the chamber is a WOMAN. As she moves out of a darkness, we see VICTIM ONE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ghostly pale and adorned in eerie fetish garb, she appears to "sense" the presence of a stranger, targets Catherine in the shadows, and ATTACKS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Catherine's had enough and moves to press the implant, BUT THE VICTIM IS ALREADY THERE! She brutally grabs Catherine, THROWS her against the wall and SMACKS her head against it. Catherine drops to the floor like a rag doll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Victim One hefts Catherine onto her shoulder and with great purpose, carries her deep into the labyrinth, toward the core. Passing in and out of consciousness, between darkness and light, a dazed Catherine is taken on a "tour" of Stargher's world. Passing mausoleum-like chambers filled with IMAGES of unspeakable horror and/or disturbing intensity. At one of the rooms, we think we see Young Stargher silently observing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sitting of standing in individual cubicles are STARGHER'S OTHER VICTIMS (TWO thru SIX), each woman resembling the grotesque porcelain dolls glimpsed in the cubbyholes in Stargher's basement. Dressed by a fetishistic sadist (Nine Inch Nails meets the Brides of Dracula), they resemble bored housewives, barely acknowledging the new member of the "harem."
</DIRECTION>

VICTIM ONE drops Catherine in the center of the room and, job done, crawls away.

Groggy, feeling sick, Catherine sits up. Unbeknownst to her, she is sitting at the base of a pedestal with her back to the kind of THRONE. And someone is there. In the dim pool of light above the pedestal, we see a MAN rise from the throne. The wall behind him is covered in BLOOD RED CLOTH, and as he descends, we realize it is a CAPE connected to EIGHT METAL RINGS pierced through the flesh of his back. In a fluid motion, waves of red give way to harshly textured concrete as the man reaches the floor. Catherine knows he is there. Unable to stop herself, she turns. And sees the terrifying face of STARGHER. But no the same Stargher.

She appreciates his understanding. And finds herself comforted by his presence. Catherine scrutinizes Novak, his intensity, his honesty, his complexity. And asks:

</CATHERINE>
<NOVAK>

<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>

The question catches Novak off-guard, but he's willing to answer. Anything to get her talking.
</DIRECTION>
<NOVAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely.

(realizing it's too personal)

Catherine laughs. It helps her relax. If only slightly.

<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	During the sessions. When I'm inside. I see those things. What a person hides, what they despite, what they want to control. With Stargher...

This is difficult for her.

</NOVAK>
<CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
(professionally)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A kingdom. His utopia. Life without consequence or restriction. He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. He's this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... Without fear. A horrible primitive ugly thing.

(uncomfortable; re: Edward)

Catherine and Novak sit on a bench in the center of the courtyard. John Tracy is visible in the reception area, unable to sleep, desperately trying to fight frustration.

</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
Novak nods. Guilty.
</DIRECTION>
<NOVAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's an old lawyer trick. Target the emotions. Do it right, you get a reluctant witness to testify, a scared kid to confess.

Catherine looks at him with disbelief. "You?!"
</DIRECTION>
<NOVAK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before I was with the Bureau, I was an attorney, a prosecutor. Mr. Law and Order. And then... I had a murder case in North Carolina. Charles Gish. Butchered seventeen people in three days. And because of one tiny piece of tainted evidence, he walked.

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's when I quit the DA's office and joined the FBI.

Catherine can see the pain and frustration in Novak's eyes. She gives him a moment and asks:
</DIRECTION>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<NOVAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did, yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NOVAK>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were right. There's a part of him that knows the truth. About what he did, about himself.

Novak's curiosity is piqued.
</DIRECTION>
<NOVAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Julia?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NOVAK>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore. Not to him. He never finished her. The others...he was able to make them his.

</CATHERINE>
<NOVAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think you can do this, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NOVAK>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He might tell me about Julia. The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse. Who wants to be redeemed.

(skeptically)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is Stargher we're talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NOVAK>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not Stargher, not really. He's split himself right down the middle. Good/evil, right/wrong, merciful/cruel. A monster. And an innocent child. If I could reach the boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<NOVAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa. Hold on. Aren't they the same guy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NOVAK>
<CATHERINE>

	Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality? Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act. We're all human.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CATHERINE>
<NOVAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's hard for me to see Stargher as human, capable of something like "remorse."
	</DIALOGUE>
</NOVAK>
<CATHERINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then what is he?

</CATHERINE>

INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY - DAY

As the agent brings the frightened animal into the monitoring area, Catherine and Valentine share a moment of "connection." Slowly, confidently, she approaches the Shepherd, kneels, and removes his leash and muzzle. She strokes him and the dog instantly warms up to her.

The dog picks up a scent from the procedure room and moves it, Catherine and Novak following.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Stargher lies face down on a gurney. Now taped to the wall near Stargher are PICTURES from the basement - his dolls, the hoist, etc. Miriam (in surgical mask and gloves) carefully re-inserts the METAL RINGS (taken from an FBI EVIDENCE BAG) into the eight straps of flesh on his back. When he sees this, Valentine whimpers and hides. Catherine comforts him. Miriam finishes her task and removes her mask.

IN THE PROCEDURE ROOM, Catherine readies herself in the "receive" apparatus. As Stargher is lifted off the pedestal, the doors HISS shut and Valentine curls up on the floor beneath his master. As Catherine is lifted, she smiles at the animal, then looks to Stargher.

As she moves toward the panel, everything becomes larger. By the time Catherine reaches the circuit breaker, it is the size of a garage door. Curiouser and curiouser...
</DIRECTION>

She turns around to see the LABORATORY IS EMPTY and DEAD QUIET. And she sees herself - Catherine as small as a mouse trapped in a giant walled space.

AT THE CONSOLE, Novak, Miriam and Henry observe the procedure room. And Catherine. Suspended in the apparatus. Motionless...

ENTRANCE TWO

<DIRECTION>
INT. STARGHER'S WORLD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Catherine turns to see... Catherine lying in the fetal position, locked in a BOX made of thick clean glass. The electronic HUM becomes RHYTHMIC, AMBIENT NOISE.. INSIDE THE BOX, staying calm, she searches for and finds a TRAP DOOR on the floor. She pushes out. The camera executes a complete 180-degree perspective change.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Catherine plummets. She tries to reach out, to stop her descent, but cannot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Catherine falls through a dark CAVERNOUS ROOM resembling a mammoth hollowed-out rib cage. Below her is a DOME-LIKE STRUCTURE "growing" out of the floor, a HOLE in the center of its crest. Dozens of other such domes are visible in the murky hell-hole, but Catherine has no choice. She's dropping into this one.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once she passes through the hole, INSIDE THE DOME, Catherine's body looks as though it's moving through water, but there is no water. Like an aerial artist, she reverses her position so she's "heads up." Standing, stable, on the floor. Sensing something with her. And knows it is...

And as she steps toward him, his face DISSOLVES into a STARK LANDSCAPE. An ear becomes a hill, the nose a stone, mouth a path, and the eye a HOUSE. YOUNG STARGHER retreats towards the bleak structure as CATHERINE ENTERS FRAME. Seeing the invitation, she presses on.

</CATHERINE>
<DIRECTION>
As Catherine enters the claustrophobic house, the boy hesitantly pushes a towel toward her, but doesn't look. She reaches the counter and starts to dry, much to Young Stargher's relief. As he washes, Catherine hands him a MIRROR LOCKET just like Edward's.

She shines reflected light onto the walls. Carl hands Catherine the wet plate and takes the locket. The dish slips from her fingers and SHATTERS on the floor. The boy's eyes fill with dread. The kitchen clock reads 5:30. He PUSHES Catherine toward a broom closet and shoves her inside.

Martin has discovered his son's secret hiding place - a camouflaged corner of the attic. Arranged in deliberate, artistic fashion are scavenged DOLLS. Heads, limbs and torsos held together with twine, tape and wire. Some wrapped in filthy plastic. Faded photographs (including one of his MOTHER), mementos, and most disturbingly, the feathers and bones of dead birds, insect carcasses, and dissected, desiccated mice. There's something peculiarly beautiful here, but Martin doesn't see it. Not at all.

INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The adult Carl Stargher sits at the edge of the tub, his back to us, smoking a cigarette. A white German Shepherd PUPPY clicks across the tile floor and YIPS at Catherine. She again hears the WEIRD NOISE. A STAINLESS STEEL BOWL wobbles as Stargher's bloody rubber-gloved hands fill it with something. Stargher knows she's there and isn't surprised by her presence, but he's not sure what to make of her. What to do with her. He rises and walks past her to the sink. He pulls off the gloves and washes his hands, glancing at her in the mirror.

Catherine makes a break for the door. "Playfully," Stargher makes a half-hearted attempt to block her, but she evades him and reaches for the knob. But the door's not there. SCRITCH SCRITCH-SCRITCH. She can still hear the dog, but there's no damn door. She turns:

<DIRECTION>
No door. No window. The girl's body and bloody remains have vanished. An OVERHEAD LIGHT flickers on, giving the room the look and feel of the cell.

Catherine moves to touch the sensor in her hand. He GRABS, LIFTS and SLAMS her onto the floor, the back of her head HITTING HARD. Her vision blurs. Ears are ringing.

	The first five minutes will be disorienting. Give yourself time. Let the drugs do the work. If you can see, smell, feel, hear, taste things - you're on the right track. Once you've acclimated, try to get a feeling for Catherine. Instinct plays a huge role in this. Trust it.

Novak's eyes fix on the clear liquid contained in the IV-like cylinder. A liquid cloud of his blood grows within. Preparing the mixture for injection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The viscosity of the fluid starts to thicken and the CAMERA MOVES INTO THE MIXTURE. As blood and chemical swirls take shape, we MOVE FAST. Deeper into the fluid at a molecular level. We feel like we're SOARING over some kind of liquid landscape.

NOVAK HYPERVENTILATES. He's having difficulty making the 98 transition.

<DIRECTION>
CLOUDS hover above a dark, gloomy landscape dotted with hills. THREE IDENTICAL WOMEN sit on black earth, their bodies positioned in a uniform pattern. PULL BACK TO REVEAL NOVAK at their feet, in a kneeling fetal position, face down in the gritty soil, a piece of cloth draped over his head. With difficulty, practically inhaling black grit, Novak breathes deeply and rises to his knees. His hand moves to his face and he's briefly astounded by the texture of the gravel, the sharpness of it against his face. Removing the shroud-like cloth, he looks at the soil, smells it, tastes it.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My boy, my little one. His father took him from me. Have you seen him?

	<DIALOGUE>
	My child is an abomination. He is damned. He has no soul.

	Me god me boy. Me god good son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHER_THREE>
<DIRECTION>
Novak takes a moment to absorb his surroundings. The sights, sounds and feel of the place. Like being within a dream. As he backs away from the odd quartet, SHIMMERING LIGHT dances across his face. Shading his eyes. Novak searches for the source.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Opposite him, across the valley, is a SHEER ROCK WALL. A massive cliff face pockmarked with rough "windows." Like a star, the LIGHT sparkles inside one of them, a fragment of MIRROR reflecting a beam away from Novak's face to a PATH cutting across the valley floor to the base of the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The light guiding him, Novak follows the path and starts to CLIMB, finding stairs or ladders, passing deep, seemingly infinite passages. Like tombs, or the "drawers" of a mausoleum. Deep within one of them, THE LIGHT FLICKERS. Fades. And Novak crawls into darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE DEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Novak emerges in a cavernous room dripping with decadence. The place reeks of sex, pain, lust, and cruelty. As he moves deeper into the chamber, Novak sees YOUNG STARGHER perched atop some kind of pedestal, crouching, fingering his mirror LOCKET, bouncing sparkles of light into the dark corners of the room
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FLICKERING LIGHT pinpoints a FIGURE emerging from the darkness. It is Catherine. Altered to an image of Stargher's victims. Her skin, face, clothing, eyes, are just like the Victims'. It's a shocking, strange image, made even more disturbing by the look of pleasure on her face. Novak is staggered by the sight. His vision and hearing become affected by blurred vision, sharp sounds - then focus to clarity as he reminds himself...
</DIRECTION>
<NOVAK>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Catherine LAUGHS. Novak catches only a fleeting glimpse of the monster before Stargher King GRABS him by the throat and SMASHES his head against a pedestal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACKOUT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STARGHER'S WORLD - THE DEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eyelids rise and flutter. Novak becomes conscious. And instantly realizes what's happened.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lies on the pedestal, face up, spread-eagle, his wrists and ankles bound to the cold stone surface with leathery cords. Standing over him, in a pool of light, is Stargher King. Wearing what could be seen as CEREMONIAL GARB, a silent, solemn Stargher King prepares himself for execution of a ritual by polishing and arranging an assortment of shiny, sharp, macabre TOOLS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Novak shuts his eyes and silently tells himself, Not real. He opens them, breathes deeply and focuses on Catherine.

STARGHER KING IS SLAMMED FROM BEHIND! CATHERINE RAMS THE THING THROUGH HIS THROAT! As Stargher King stumbles away gagging, blood pouring form his neck, we see that she has returned to normal. The "bride" persona is gone. As Stargher King emits animalistic growls, Catherine turns and sees an intact Novak standing next to her. As if nothing had happened.

Catherine and Novak RUN out of the den, into the tunnel from which Novak gained access. He stops, ready to press the sensor, when a FLICKER OF LIGHT dances across Catherine's face.

More stylized than the actual cell, it's bigger and ornately decorated, with the atmosphere of a church. Individual IMAGES hang like SHRINES, each showing Julia Hickson from different angles.

Central to the room is a WINDOW INTO THE CELL ITSELF. Where we find a beautiful, mermaid-like JULIA HICKSON floating in water. Peaceful, joyous.

Like a rock climber in a crevasse, Julia shimmies up the walls of the cell by bracing herself in a corner and using her hands and feet to push up. The tile is slippery and each movement precarious.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She uses strength and balance to reach a position just below the Plexiglass, the fluorescent light bathing her in an eerie intense glow. She sees a gap between the glass and the wall and uses her ENGAGEMENT RING to dig into it, SCAPE, SCRAPE, SCRAPING with the diamond.
</DIRECTION>

THE SHOWER SPRAYS WATER! Julia nearly loses her balance, but manages to stay pressed into the corner. She kicks the shower head, sending the spray as far from her as possible, and continues to dig at the caulking around the light fixture.

A bright, deliriously colorful realm visually reflective of things we saw in Catherine's home. Unusual trees, rock formations, totems, statues, and a brilliant POOL OF WATER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pond ripples. Visible through the crystal-clear water is YOUNG STARGHER, rising to the surface like a drowning victim suddenly breaking through to air. Panicked, he scrambles to shore and pulls himself to land. Although the place is comforting and beautiful, he's in strange territory and it frightens him. Shivering, he hunches down, eyes darting this way and that.

The boy turns toward the voice and finds CATHERINE, her hair waving in the wind, skin glowing, eyes bright, cutting a magnificent figure in clothes that make her a warrior goddess.

Young Stargher's eyes open wide with silent terror. Over his shoulder, she sees a SNAKE slither through the pool. CENTIPEDES CRAWL over her legs and hair. She stands and brushes them off. The atmosphere grows darker and ominous.

For a moment, Catherine appears frightened and intimidated. Perhaps near an emotional breakdown. But that is not the case. She quietly lowers little Carl to the ground and whispers something in his ear. As the boy nods, runs and hides, a ferocity grows within her.

Like a vengeful Valkyrie, she emits what can only be called a BATTLE CRY! STARGHER ATTACKS! Arms reaching for her. Catherine BLOCKS, PUNCHES, AND KICKS. Stargher King doubles over. Catherine grabs his ears and pulls his face into her bent KNEE, breaking his nose.

Catherine looks into his soulless eyes. Then SPITS in them and BITES his face! She breaks free as he YOWLS with pain. He steps toward her, but his feet don't move. The earth itself appears to wrap around them and turn hard, like concrete. Stargher King HOWLS with frustration.

INT. HELICOPTER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The chopper roars across the sky. As they head northeast, away from the urban and toward the rural, Novak gazes out the window, trying to stay focused, fighting any after-effects of the drugs. The pilot communicates via headset.

Cole and a handful of other agents pour into waiting Suburbans. (INTERCUT WITH NOVAK IN HELICOPTER).

<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The hoist was manufactured by Carver Industrial Equipment in 1982. Serial number 117-337J. Purchased by a boat shop in Lake Havasu, but sold to Lattimer's industrial Supply in 1992...
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CELL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The water is near the ceiling. Kicking her legs to keep afloat, Julia DIGS with the ring and we see she has created a gap between the light fixture housing and an unused PIPE leading to the surface. She pushes, but can't get anything to move. The opening will get no bigger. Julia sucks the last bit of oxygen and swims to the bottom of the cell. Searching for something, she finds a juice box and pulls out the drinking straw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAMPBELL CENTER - LABORATORY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shaken, but oddly transcendent, Catherine watches as Stargher's body is wheeled out of the lab on a gurney. She comforts a whimpering Valentine and tells him...

	Everything's alright now, Valentine. I promise.

Cole is the passenger, on the radio to Novak, A DRIVER next to him, doing about a hundred down the Interstate, SIREN blaring.
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>

	Lattimer sold the hoist to a guy named Bainbridge who tired to build a machine works out near Delano. Bainbridge ends up in bankruptcy court and the state winds up with the land - it's just sitting there.

INT. THE CELL - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Julia is entirely underwater but alive. She uses the straw to suck oxygen through the gap in the ceiling, but it's difficult to tread water and her lungs are aching.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HELICOPTER

Novak uses binoculars to scan farmland. He searches. And there it is: The abandoned farmhouse!

<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CELL - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Julia tries to hold herself up by pressing her arms and legs against the walls, but as she does, the straw slips from her mouth. She reaches for it, but only succeeds in pushing it away from her. It heads for the drain. And disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The helicopter lands and Novak jumps out. He knows this is the place. He runs into the barn, but there's nothing, no sign of her. The pilot looks at him with a true sense of loss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CELL - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Julia desperately tires to find the straw through the tiny holes of the drain, we see for the first time an expression which tells us she's given up. THUMP-THUMP-THUMP. The cell starts to vibrate. A repetitive noise WHUP-WHUP-WHUP - comes from above. She swims to the top of the cell and POUNDS at the ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fighting exhaustion and the side effects of the drugs, Novak pushes on. Think, Peter, think... His eyes find the WATER TANKS and he SHOUTS at the helicopter.
</DIRECTION>
<NOVAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut the engine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NOVAK>
<DIRECTION>
As the motor dies, Novak listens and listens. There it is. Water pipes beneath his feet. And very faintly, a pounding. He follows the sound, searching the earth. It's clearer now, louder. Novak tosses aside rusted junk and the pilot runs to assist him. Together, they expose the entrance to the underground sanctuary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THE CELL - OBSERVATION ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Novak drops to the floor below. Instantly affected by the similarities and the differences to the idealized cell of Stargher's mind, he feels another wave of dizziness, but pushes on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And is hit hard by the sight of DROWNED JULIA, her motionless body floating past him. HER EYES OPEN and bubbles drift from her nose and mouth. Novak BANGS on the Plexiglas and calls to her.
</DIRECTION>
<NOVAK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	JULIA!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NOVAK>
<DIRECTION>
The thick Plexiglass still remains, but she now can see him. Novak pulls his ID BADGE and smacks it against the glass.

</NOVAK>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls his gun and takes aim. Julia swims to the top of the cell and presses herself against the ceiling. BANG-BANG BANG-BANG-BANG-BANG. Novak fires a circle of shots into the thick plastic. Water slowly leaks, but the damn thing is still solid. He lifts the industrial VCR and RAMS it at the bullet-damaged section. CRACK! CRASH! WATER POURS FROM THE CELL. Julia's body descends on the torrent of water. Novak reaches inside and pulls her to safety. He's just about to give her CPR when she coughs, sputters, and thirstily drinks in oxygen. Holding her tightly, Novak sinks to the floor, the water from the cell spilling everywhere.

Cole's Suburban leads a contingent of FBI vehicles and local police cars onto the property, sirens blaring.

Hearing the sirens, Novak relaxes. For the first time in god knows how long, he relaxes. And holds Julia Hickson as if his life depended on it.

<DIRECTION>
As a television plays THE WIZARD OF OZ, we find Catherine watching the movie from the couch, sitting up, drinking a cup of tea. She looks rested and quite cute in gym shorts and a T-shirt, her CAT sleeping next to her. IN THE KITCHEN, Miriam packs up her stethoscope and blood pressure monitor, moves into the living room as Dorothy falls asleep in a field of poppies...
</DIRECTION>
<MIRIAM>
	<DIALOGUE>

Valentine settles on the floor. Slowly, Abigail's curiosity gets the best of her and she creeps out, sniffing the dog's nose. Patient and sweet, Valentine lies still, allowing the cat to reach an acceptable level of comfort.

He moves into the kitchen. In a moment of quiet introspection, Catherine looks at the television screen, at Dorothy accidentally hitting the wicked Witch with a bucket of water, causing her to melt. And she looks away, unable to watch, disturbed by the image. She turns to the kitchen and sees Novak feeding an appreciative dog and cat. He rises and returns to the living room.
