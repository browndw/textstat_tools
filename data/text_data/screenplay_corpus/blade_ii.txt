PULL BACK from a neon red cross ablaze in the cold December night to REVEAL an inner-city, store-front clinic. Trash and leaves blow over wet, snowy pavement.

<DIRECTION>
Potential DONORS sit in a waiting area, filling out forms, leafing through informational material. A sign in the window reads: "Se habla Espanol". Others read: "YOU ARE MAKING A DIFFERENCE", "GIVE LIFE", and "BECOME A PLATELET DONOR". We overhear a bored-looking EMPLOYEE behind the information desk quizzing someone over the phone:

Nomak looks up. We get a better look at his face now - he has a thin scar running from his lower lip down his chin. A childhood accident, perhaps. A NURSE smiles and motions for him to join her. She's carrying a clipboard.

<DIRECTION>
Nomak follows the Nurse to a steel door were TWO SECURITY GUARDS await them. Both look bored, paying little attention to the monitor which offers a view of the examining room beyond. There is also a small window with safety glass. GUARD #1 opens the door, following Nomak and the Nurse inside. GUARD #2 remains behind, manning the hallway.

INT. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK - EXAMINING ROOM - NIGHT

The Nurse ushers Nomak into the room, indicating he should sit in a kind of reclining dental chair with arm and headrests. Nomak notices a security camera mounted above.

A kind-faced DOCTOR enters, nodding to Guard #1.

<DOCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a good news-bad news scenario, Jared. Good news for us, bad for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DOCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
The Doctor and Nurse smile, BARING FANGS. We realize now that they are both vampires. The Guard, too. He grips Nomak by the throat, forcing him back into the restraint chair. As the vampire Guard does so, his hand brushes against Nomak's jaw. The flesh on Nomak's chin briefly separates along the scar - almost as if it were a seam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guard pauses - and Nomak LAUGHS. Definitely NOT the reaction the vampires were expecting from a potential victim. Nomak starts to shake and twitch, like he's going into some kind of seizure. The whites of his eyes bleed red. He throws his head back, opening his mouth as a PAIR OF RAZOR SHARP CANINES extrude from his gums. These are longer, much more lethal-looking than the fangs of the vampires and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nomak lashes out, knocking the Guard backwards. The Nurse SCREAMS. Nomak clamps his mouth onto her throat, SLAMMING her back against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vampire Doctor rushes to the door, scrambling to unbolt it. Nomak reaches for him, HOWLING with blood-drunk laughter as he lifts the Doctor up. Nomak flings the Doctor about like a toy, using his body to SMASH the lights, then the security camera above.

INT. COMMUNITY BLOOD BANK - HALLWAY - NIGHT

We hear SCREAMS and HORRIBLE NOISES coming from the examining room. Guard #2 draws a gun and looks to the security monitor with alarm. The screen goes black. He looks to the small window, trying to peer into the now-darkened room beyond --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SPLASH! A wave of blood smears across a window. A HAND wipes a patch of blood away, revealing Nomak's baleful, distorted eyes. Guard #2 starts to back away when --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG! Nomak slams against the other side of the steel door. BANG!BANG!BANG! The door begins to bend, hand-shaped impressions bulging outward as Nomak starts to peel the door apart like it was an aluminum can.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guard #2 has seen enough. He turns and runs even as the door CAVES INWARD off its hinges. Forward momentum sends the door sliding across the hallway floor where it trips up the Guard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE DOORWAY

BOOM! A second-story door flies open and FIVE VAMPIRE thug wannabes come spilling out. They race down a flight of stairs, tripping and tumbling over themselves.

<DIRECTION>
BA-BANG! A silver-tipped bullet punches through T-Bag's chest. He turns to ash even as his fellow vamps dash through the disintegrating cloud that used to be his body. The embers melt the snow where they land.
</DIRECTION>

A super-charged foot chase ensues, with hunter and prey moving at speeds in excess of anything a human would ever be capable of. We're talking thirty-five, even forty miles an hour.
</DIRECTION>

Running like a bull, condensed vapor streaming from his mouth and nostrils. Splashing through puddles of icy water storming through barriers of plywood and razor wire, leaping over mountains of garbage bags.

Rush and Segura leap atop their BMWs. Jigsaw rolls into a puddle of water, dousing himself, then jumps onto his chopper. As the vamps peel out --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLADE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bursts from the factory. Segura revs his BMW, trying to run him down. At the last second, Blade pivots aside like a matador. Segura circles around for another try.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade leaps, somersaulting through the air, then lands on the back of the bike behind Segura. SHINGGG! Blade pulls a retractable garrotte wire from the sleeve of his jacket and wraps it around Segura's throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a violent twist, Blade decapitates Segura. As the vampire's headless body turns to ash before him, Blade leans forward and takes the controls of the speeding motorcycle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOSH! Blade speeds after the other vamps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT

Rush and Jigsaw gun their bikes for all they're worth. Up ahead, a line of construction barricades are blocking the way. The vampires power on through the barricades, then abruptly brake --

<DIRECTION>
THE OVERPASS

<DIRECTION>
before them is under construction. There's a twenty-foot gap in the road where a portion is missing, pieces of re-bar poking out from the ends of the prefabricated sections.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rush and Jigsaw consider their options, but then they hear the ROAR of Blade's engine as he comes SCREAMING over the rise in the road!
</DIRECTION>

Fuck it. Rush powers his chopper forward, making the jump, burning rubber as he lands on the far side. Jigsaw torques his handle and follows, rocketing towards the gap.

as he snaps his hand up -- a trio of Japanese throwing stars appearing between his fingers like a magician's cards. He flings the stars at Jigsaw's bike --

The throwing stars hit Jigsaw's back tire and the bike goes down, vomiting SPARKS as it slides forward. Jigsaw is flung forward like a ragdoll, out over the gap in the overpass and

Rush pulls a TEC-9, FIRING back at Blade. It's no good. Blade is nearly upon him, unsheathing his sword from his back scabbard --

Blade JABS his sword forward into Rush's rear-wheel. The bike locks up, flips over, BURSTS INTO FLAMES. The whole screaming wreck slews forward, SHOWERING SPARKS --

<DIRECTION>
RUSH
</DIRECTION>

goes flying onto the road, rolling over and over, one of his legs SNAPPING at a bone-breaking angle. As he lies there MOANING, Blade circles around, sweeping past Rush's decimated bike, retrieving his sward from the burning wreckage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade kills the engine on his own bike and dismounts. Rush is pathetically trying to drag his broken body to safety. Blade approaches, placing his boot heel on the back of Rush's neck, forcing his face against the asphalt. He unholsters his MACH, pointing it at the vampire's bleeding head. Blade's opening line:

As the other two vampires rise - POW! A silver hollow-point hits the first one in the neck. POW! Another hollow-point takes out the second. The vampires drop, turning to ash.

Blade holsters his MACH, striding through vampire ash piles. The place is eerily quiet here, in stark contrast to the mayhem of the last few minutes. Just the steady, low-pitched HUM of machinery.

Blade starts forward. Up ahead, a FAINT GLOW is emitting from behind an area that's been sectioned off with canvas tarps. Blade sweeps one of the tarps aside --

THREE LARGE TANKS

CRASH! Blade kicks through the glass. Blood and fluids flood out around him as Whistler's limp body tumbles partly down, but he's still suspended by the wires and medical leads. Blade unsheathes his sword, severing the wires --

Whistler falls into his arms. Blade cradles him, then -- the gunsmith's eyes abruptly snap open, flooding with rage.

Blade staggers back as the HOWLING horror that used to be his mentor wraps his hands around Blade's throat, forcing him to the ground. Whistler ROARS, revealing a set of jagged fangs.

Blade sinks his fist deep in Whistler's stomach. As Whistler doubles over, Blade twists Whistler's hands behind his back, cuffing his wrists together with a pair of titanium manacles.
</DIRECTION>

Blade pulls a restraint hood from his equipment bag and quickly slips it over Whistler's head, cinching it tight.

A BLACK KID (14) is standing atop a mountain of refuse -- wiry and intense, perched there like a predator. The Wino glances at his wrist again, the blood, then back up at the black kid.

INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - BATHROOM AREA - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whistler stands bare-chested before a corroded mirror, splashing water from a sink over his face, rinsing off shaving cream residue. He inspects his features -- he's cleaned himself up a bit, trimmed his beard, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls on a fresh shirt, then turns to face Blade, who stands behind him.

<WHISTLER>

Blade smiles. That was as close to a thank-you as this old junkyard dog is ever going to give.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - BACKSTORAGE AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whistler has fired up a Lucky Strike. He's moving through the storage area where much of his old equipment has been shelved, pulling tarps off, checking things. Blade follows.
</DIRECTION>
<BLADE>

	Let's just hope you've kicked the Thirst for good. I'll be watching you close. You start to back-slide --

Just then we hear the SOUND of an industrial lathe firing up. Curious, Whistler exits into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The workshop proper. Scud is working at Whistler's old lathe, bopping his head along to MUSIC which is playing on a nearby TV. The them song to SPEED RACER. Now he's wearing a Ron Jeremy T-shirt that says "Daddy".
</DIRECTION>
<TV>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)

	Here he comes, here comes Speed Racer! He's a demon on wheels. He's gaining on you so you better look alive. He's busy revving up the powerful Mach Five --

Whistler cocks an incredulous eyebrow at Blade, who has fallen in beside him. Scud kills the lathe and approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<SCUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whistler. Cool beans. Nice to meet you, man. Heard a lot. I'm Josh Frohmeyer. You can call me Scud, though. That's what most people do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCUD>
<DIRECTION>
Scud offers his hand. Whistler doesn't take it. Scud shoots an uneasy glance at Blade, raising an eyebrow in question. Is Whistler okay, or not? Blade nods. Whistler moves over to the Charger which has its hood up.

Whistler gets in Scud's face. Scud looks to Blade for help, but he just watches, letting the two of them sort things out.
</DIRECTION>
<WHISTLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My problem, shitbird, is that I tried to blow my fucking head off and wound up sucking blood clots for the last year and a half! Now you're standing there choking your chicken like we're all walking around some fucking candy-ass vampire sitcom!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHISTLER>
<DIRECTION>
Scud attempts to show some balls, but stammers all the same.
</DIRECTION>
<SCUD>

Just then, however, an alarm starts BEEPING. Scud checks a display as Blade readies his MACH.

Whistler moves to a rack of weaponry. As he reaches for CAR 15, Scud moves to stop him.
</DIRECTION>
<SCUD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa, whoa, easy cowboy - I'm not trusting you with a weapon just yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCUD>
<DIRECTION>
Whistler SMACKS Scud in the face with the butt of the CAR-15 and pushes past him. We hear a CRASH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO BLACK, LATEX-CLAD, NINJA LIKE INTRUDERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Running on all fours, racing upside down across the ceiling at break-neck speed. Then they drop, somersaulting down fifty feet, landing in a cat-like stance.
</DIRECTION>
<BLADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hit the God-lights.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLADE>
<DIRECTION>
Scud, with his nose now bleeding, activates a series of stadium-style lights secured to the ceiling. The entire place goes white with UV light, the image nearly blowing out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON FIGURES' FACES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are wearing metal goggles with iris shut to mere pin prick openings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whistler trains the CAR-15 on --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FIRST LATEX CLAD FIGURE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Who is now removing something from a satchel. Whistler FIRES. The Intruder drops the object and cartwheels away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the blink of an eye, the Second Intruder has launched himself at Whistler, hand-springing off the floor, then kicking him in the mid-section. As Whistler falls back, the Second Intruder presses forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON BLADE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unsheathing his sword, rushing at the First Intruder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAP! The Intruder traps Blade's forearm, pivoting, planting a boot in Blade's ribcage. Obviously, the Intruder is a serious martial arts student.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAP!WHAP!WHAP! The two of them go at it, unleashing a flurry of kicks, blocks, and punches. The Intruder gets Blade in a back-choke. He twists out of it, throwing the Intruder over his shoulder, who neatly cartwheels, springing back off the wall at Blade again --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade ducks beneath one of the Intruder's kicks, then traps the Intruder's foot, giving it a savage twist. CRACK! Blade backhands the intruder with a blow so strong that it knocks the Intruder to his knees. Then the Intruder reaches for a short sword. In a heartbeat, the sword is out and against Blade's throat. Just as Blade's sword is not against the Intruder's. It's a stalemate.
</DIRECTION>
<SECOND_INTRUDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop!!!!!

Blade and the First Intruder freeze. The Second Intruder steps away from Whistler, whom he clearly had the drop on, and tosses the CAR-15 to the ground.

Blade looks back to the First Intruder. Then slowly withdraws his sword. The Intruder does the same. Blade turns off the God-lights. The UVs fade and normal lighting returns. Scud and Whistler pick themselves up off the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<BLADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take off your masks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLADE>
<DIRECTION>
The Intruders remove their masks. The first is ASAD, a cautious Sufi Muslim possessing a restrained nobility.

<DIRECTION>
The second is a woman, NYSSA. 20-something, with emerald eyes and strong, darkly exotic features. Both are Vampire.
</DIRECTION>
<ASAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Asad. This is Nyssa. We represent the Shadow Cabinet. The ruling body of Vampire nation. They're offering you a truce. They want to meet with you.

Blade holds up his hand, silencing Scud's outburst. He nods for Nyssa and Asad to continue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nyssa slowly crouches and reaches for the object she dropped - a CD. She tosses it to Blade. Still keeping an eye on them, Blade slips the CD into a reader. We SEE a slide-show of video capture shots taken from a surveillance camera. Nomak tearing into the blood bank staff, etc.
</DIRECTION>

The corridor ends at a pair of steel security doors. Nyssa stands before a biometric scanner, allowing a beam of light to play over her face. The scanner acknowledges her identity and the doors HISS open, revealing a series of security doors beyond these which successively open into --

A crescent-shaped room filled with antiquities: quarry columns from Middle Kingdom Egypt, stacks of arcane volumes, Medieval frontispieces. A Borgia-esque Renaissance portrait staring down at us with a severe gaze. Towering over all of these is a massive Greek Cross carved from stone. MUSIC echoes around them -- Boito's Faust. Standing in the midst of this is OVERLORD ELI DAMASKINOS, wearing a robe of black silk.

INT. MINI-MART - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A KOREAN WOMAN (30s) mans the counter. Her TODDLER sits in a circular safety walker nearby. The kind that rolls and is affixed with toys to keep a baby occupied. The woman glances at two surveillance monitors. On the first monitor we see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CAR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
pull up to the pumps outside. A MAN gets out, slides his credit card through the reader, starts pumping gas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE SECOND MONITOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE a FIGURE standing at the back by the Slurpee machine. The figure turns, approaching. It's Nomak. He sets a package of gum on the counter, looks to the baby. He smiles, wriggles his finger. The child COOS and smiles back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unnerved by Nomak, the Korean woman quickly rings the transaction, gives him his change. He removes a stick of gum from the pack, carefully unwraps it, slides it into his mouth, watching the child all the while. Finally, he nods to the woman and leaves. The door CHIMES as he exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. The woman looks to the surveillance monitors again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FIRST MONITOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car is still there, but the man pumping gas is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Puzzled, the woman steps from behind the counter and moves to the glass doors, looking out --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car's driver side door hangs open. Even more disturbing, the hose for the gas pump lies untended on the icy ground, spilling fuel from its nozzle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Korean woman cautiously exits the mini-mart. No one is in sight. She hurries to the abandoned car, disengaging the lock on the pump handle, then setting it back in its cradle. She looks to the open driver's door. A FEW DROPLETS OF BLOOD have stained the snow just outside it. Then she sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GHOSTLY FIGURE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing off in the fog-bound shadows. The woman looks back to the mini-mart, then back again to where the figure was standing. But the figure is gone! Growing increasingly anxious, the woman hurries back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GAS STATION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman shuts the door, locks it. But she's still just a target standing inside a well-lit glass box. She moves to the safety walker, scoops up her child.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After another moment's indecision, she slides the accordion style gate down over the doors and windows. Then she turns off the lights. Feeling somewhat more secure, the woman moves back around the counter and SEES --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An unwrapped stick of gum resting on the tray of the baby walker. It wasn't there before. With a rising sense of dread, the woman backs away, bumping right into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOMAK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He smiles cruelly, the scar/seam in his chin just beginning to part. The woman gasps, turns to run --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and bumps into THREE MORE REAPERS. Gaunt and feral-looking. All three with shaved heads. No eyebrows, and hairline scar/seams running down their chins. As one, the reapers descend on her. We hear the child's TERRIFIED WAIL and we --

INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - BLADE'S SLEEPING AREA - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade is just finishing injecting himself with serum. He sighs, falling back into the chair he's sitting in, waiting for the shakes to subside. He unwraps a piece of rubbing tubing which he'd been using as a tourniquet, flexes his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door to his room opens. Scud stands there in silhouette.

NYSSA AND BLOODPACK
</DIRECTION>

Their leader, DIETER REINHARDT (30s), is a square-jawed, chiseled Austrian. Next to Reinhardt is SNOWMAN, a wire albino, LIGHTHAMMER, a massive Blackfoot Indian, and PRIEST, a bald-headed modern primitive with copious piercings and facial tattoos. Rounding out the bunch is CHUPA, a blunt featured Puerto Rican, and VERLAINE, a familiar-looking curvaceous beauty with bee-stung lips that exudes a predatory sexuality.
</DIRECTION>

(NOTE: Verlaine looks familiar because she is the twin sister of Raquel, the bodacious vamp played by Traci Lords that Blade killed in the opening scene of the first film.)

Reinhardt tenses, thrusting the stake forward -- but Blade has already whirled out of the way, trapping his hand, then violently twisting it backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before Reinhardt even knows what's happening, Blade swings him around into a headlock. In his free hand he's got a tiny, barbed flechette. The barbs spring open like a tick's gripping mandibles as Blade drives the flechette into the base of Reinhardt's skull. Reinhardt HOWLS in pain, but Blade just tightens his grip, choking off Reinhardt's air.

Whistler flicks on the entry light. Then notices that Chupa isn't paying attention. The vampire is looking at Snowman who is saying something in sign-language. Chupa snickers.

MOMENTS LATER

<DIRECTION>
Blade, Whistler, and the Bloodpack are silently suiting up for war -- strapping on body armor, securing stakes and knives, CLICKING ammo cartridges into their various weapons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We SEE them lacing up combat boots, checking rifle sights, entry lights. Blade dons one of his EDTA pneumatic gauntlets. Whistler loads custom rounds into a shotgun. Then he reaches to clip on an ammo vest. But his hands are shaking slightly and he can't seem to clip the locking mechanism together. After a beat, Blade reaches over and does it for Whistler. Like a son helping his father. A beat passes between them, Whistler and Blade looking at one another. Then Whistler nods, satisfied.

Nyssa leads the group into a loading area. The only light is coming from a series of burning trashcans. VAMPIRE SENTRIES crouch on the steps, watching, smelling Nyssa's group as they move past. Adjacent areas are walled off with sheets of vinyl. We hear the pulsing, bass-heavy beat of MUSIC coming from beyond the sheeting, beckoning us onward.

INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - UNDERGROUND HALLWAY - NIGHT

Blade works his way through the crowd. The beat is getting heavier now, the crowd more energized. He briefly makes eye contact with Nyssa, but then she's gone again, disappearing into the sea of flesh, ducking past one of the vinyl sheets into a corridor beyond. Chupa, Asad, Snowman and Priest remain behind, searching the crowd.

A 1930s industrial kitchen filled with corroded equipment. Reinhardt, Verlaine, and Lighthammer work their way inward, searching the area. Lighthammer carries massive war hammer like his namesake.

Nyssa opens a door onto an empty room. A vacant stainless steel examination table gleams in the center, waiting.

Bored to shit, Scud plucks a joint from behind his ear. As he fires up his woman torso lighter we HEAR SOMETHING just outside the van. Scud kills the Barry White, listening. Silence. Then, a FAINT SKITTERING.

Unnerved, Scud returns to the back of the van. He reaches for the handle of the rear door and abruptly jerks the door open, aiming the gun out --

There's nothing outside the van. But then Scud hears the SKITTERING AGAIN. His eyes shift apprehensively to the floor of the van below him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - FIRST CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they near the end of the hall, Blade notices a drop-down attic door in the ceiling above. He unsheathes his sword and uses the tip to unlatch the trapdoor. The counter-weighted door CREAKS and LOWERS, unfolding a sectioned ladder. We see darkness beyond. As Blade cautiously mounts the stairs --

The first skinhead figure spins towards us. It's a Reaper. All three of them are, eyes wide with bloodlust as they leap at Asad and the others.

Nomak is scaling his way straight up the neon hotel sign, jumping from one letter to the next with lightning speed.

INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - KITCHEN - NIGHT

A Reaper EXPLODES out from the walk-in, rather than the door behind them. He leaps atop Reinhardt, SLAMMING him to the floor. Lighthammer swings his hammer, missing the Reaper, taking out a chunk of the wall instead. Lighthammer swings and misses again, taking a chunk out of the floor. Verlaine empties her automatic rifle into the Reaper even as --

The Reaper turns on Lighthammer, catching the war hammer, Reaper's lower jaw disengages and splits open, revealing a freakishly enlarged esophagus lined with serrated, sharklike teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All of this takes a split-second. No time for Lighthammer to react as the Reaper latches its grossly expanded mouth onto his throat and begins draining him before our eyes. The Reaper SHUDDERS and the whites of his eyes bleed red as an ecstatic wave washes over him. His pale flesh, pulsing with engorged veinwork, becomes flushed, turning crimson as --

BLOOD VESSELS

Are popping up beneath the Reaper's briefly translucent skin, becoming engorged and dilated. The veins continue to swell, racing up his neck, then branching out over his face, chest, and arms -- like an instant network of varicose veins.

Scud unloads his handgun into the Reaper atop the van. The Reaper should turn to ash, but it doesn't! Scud flees, DIVING into the front of the van, ducking behind the wheel. He keys the ignition --

<DIRECTION>
WHAM! Now the Reaper is atop the hood, SMASHING his feet through the windshield. Scud SCREAMS as he slams the van into the drive and floors the pedal --

WK-KRUNCH! Scud CRASHES the van against the side of a building, pinning the Reaper between the van's front bumper and the crumbling wall. He keeps his foot on the gas pedal, GRINDING the van's wheels.
</DIRECTION>

This gambit should cut the Reaper in half, or at the very least, fatally wound it -- but it only enrages it further. The Reaper stretches forward across the van's crumpled hood and resumes BATTERING away at the cracked windshield --

Priest fires a Glaser round through the she-Reaper's head. The Reaper twists in mid-leap, falls to the floor, then picks herself up again. Like Scud's Reaper, she seems unaffected by the custom-made ammo.

BACK TO THE PRIEST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alarmed, reaching for a specialized shotgun instead. The Reaper continues forward, moving so fast she almost seems a blur as BA-BOOM! BA-BOOM! Priest pumps his shotgun repeatedly. Two projectiles fire out, chained together by a length of titanium cable. The cable catches the Reaper in the mid-section, cutting it clean in half!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The upper half of the Reaper falls, then rights itself, landing on its clawed hands. Impossibly, the she-Reaper keeps coming! She skitters towards Priest on his hands like the half-man from Todd Browning's "FREAKS".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The half-Reaper launches itself at Priest, hitting him in the chest, knocking him back to the floor. Priest panics as he struggles with the thing, trying to fend off its claws and fangs as it locks its mouth into his arm. He SCREAMS.

As Scud continues to fiddle with the faulty headlight wiring, the windshield finally SHATTERS beneath the Reaper's pounding fists.

Scud is just centimeters away from having his face being bitten off when --

We're back with Blade as he chases Nomak across the roof.

Nomak abruptly stops, having reached the end of the roof. The nearest neighboring rooftop is too far away and the drop from this last ledge looks unsurvivable, even for someone like Nomak.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Blade cautiously advances, Nomak turns around and smiles -- a wolfish grin, unnaturally wide. The Reaper's face is beginning to smoke beneath the rising sun's rays. In response, a polarized nictomembrane slides down over Nomak's irises -- like something you'd see on a crocodile to protect its eyes from harsh light.

The two of them exchange a flurry of blows back and forth until their weapons lock and they are face to face. Nomak's back is to the rising sun, now. His whole body is beginning to lightly smoke.

As if in response, Priest starts convulsing. His flesh tightens, drawing taut around his increasingly skeletal form. His screams become unbearable, twisting into a high-pitched ululation that's making the Bloodpack's skin crawl.

BAM!BAM!BAM! Blade shoots out the window and BLAZING SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT slices down through the darkness, spotlighting Priest like an ant beneath a magnifying glass.

FWASH!!! The headless body is incinerated in mid-step. It collapses to the floor, just inches before Blade. One of its blackened claws feebly grabs Blade's boot, then grows still.

Beat. You could hear the pin drop in the silence that follows, every one of the Bloodpack thinking some variation of "there but for the grace of God go I". Asad lays a hand on Nyssa's shoulder, steadying her.

A REAPER

Cowering by the culvert. One we recognize. The other vampire guard from the bloodbank, now transformed. He's shrunken and emaciated, pale. And although he's obviously dying, he still HISSES, his fanged mouth snapping ineffectually at them. His arm has been trapped -- pinned under one of the sectional culvert coverings.

We SEE inside the abdominal cavity. A complex, pinkish/gray parasitic organism has taken over every organ visible.

Blade sits in the shadows, wrapping a piece of rubber tubing around his arm, injecting himself with pneumatic syringe of serum. He shivers, convulses violently, then throws back his head in relief. When he does so, he SEES --

Whistler standing in the doorway. They eye each other a moment as Blade unwraps the tubing from his arm, puts away his syringe and serum. Whistler lights a cigarette, then nods through a window towards Nyssa and the others.

<DIRECTION>
Chupa walks the night, scanning shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHUPA'S POV (VAMPIRE VISION)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like heat-vision, only tinged with crimson. There are DRUG DEALERS and bottom feeding WHORES trolling for tricks out here, BEATING HEARTS and BRANCHING ARTERIES highlighted on their ghostly silhouettes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Chupa moves to the mouth of an alley, nodding to a DEALER.
</DIRECTION>
<DEALER>

</DEALER>
<CHUPA>

	Horse, Hawaiian ice. Whatever you want.

Chupa sniffs the air, glancing at a pulsating vein on the dealer's neck, and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<CHUPA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever, huh? Well I'm all off the hook on that bitch.

Chupa steps into the alley with the dealer.

Grabs a fistful of Chupa's hair, jerking his head back. It's Blade. He yanks Chupa off the dealer.

	</DIALOGUE>
</BLADE>
<CHUPA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trying to feed, puto baboso!

</CHUPA>
<DIRECTION>
The dealer takes off as Blade swings Chupa around. They exchange a couple of blows, then Blade knees him in the balls, twisting him around by his arm, dislocating it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade releases Chupa, shoving him forward. Chupa's broken arm dangles awkwardly. Furious, Chupa reaches for his .45 with his good hand -- only to hear the CLICK of another gun as it's placed against the back of his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON NYSSA

	Oh I haven't forgotten about Asad. I'm just wondering if you have.

Chupa re-holsters his gun, then jams his dislocated arm up against the wall and resets it. He backs away. Nyssa watches him leave, looks to Blade.

	He's right about one thing. We do have to survive.

INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - PRE-DAWN

Scud stands before the others. He looks bleary-eyed but pleased with the night's work. The fruit of their efforts are laid on a work table before them -- a half-dozen UV laser guns, along with a collection of UV flashbang grenades and a much bigger explosive device secured into a backpack carrier.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade picks up one of the UV lasers. He sights down the length of it. Scud takes a power pack and slaps into the base of Blade's gun.

INT. HOUSE OF PAIN - DRAINAGE AREA - DAWN

Beneath the ballroom gratings. A high-angle shot looking down at the octagonal iron culvert around which Blade, Whistler, and the remainder of the Bloodpack are gathered. The mechanized, sectional portions of the culvert covering are GRINDING UPWARD, flowering open and apart like some blood and rust-encrusted gateway to Hell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SEWER/OUTFLOW AREA - DAWN
</DIRECTION>

One by one, the group of hunters descend into the claustrophobic chamber. Verlaine is lugs the UV bomb on her back. Blade leads them to the clawed-open portion of the brick wall, then on through.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SEWER LINE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade leads the group along a grime-encrusted line which slopes gradually downward, sloshing through ankle-deep run off water collected from the city above them. Tendrils of mist drift about, cutting their field of vision even further. Here and there, thin SHAFTS of SUNLIGHT cut down through cracks in the street above, requiring the vampires to cautiously circumvent them.
</DIRECTION>

They reach a four-way intersection of tunnels. Blade pauses.

	Time for Nyssa's pheromones.

Blade points to Chupa and Whistler, indicating the Eastern tunnel. They head off. Next, Blade directs Nyssa, Asad, Snowman, and Verlaine down the Western tunnel. Blade nods to Reinhardt and starts down the Northern branch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EASTERN TUNNEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>

It's darker here, no shafts of sunlight slicing down from above. Whistler turns on his UV entry light. Chupa reaches out with his hand, partially blocking the beam.

We intercut between the three teams now, back and forth as they progress deeper into the city's bowels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NORTHERN TUNNEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade and Reinhardt trudge along. The tunnel slopes inward, forming a V-shaped channel where a trickle of water flows. Blade notices SOMETHING bobbing in the water. He nudges it with his foot and knocks it free. It's a broken HUMAN TIBIA which twirls around, then flows past their legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A few steps later on, Reinhardt notices SOMETHING ELSE. He stoops into waist-deep water, picking up what he thinks is an isolated HUMAN RIB -- but ends up snagging a tangled mass of hair, mud, and bones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EASTERN TUNNEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whistler and Chupa move side by side. Chupa is anxious, eyes darting about. Occasionally, they come upon a transection with smaller conduits leading off to the right and the left. Then they reach a stooped, narrower tunnel and have to move single file.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a BLAST of LIGHT and THUNDEROUS SOUND explodes above them. They look up --

A subway TRAIN rockets by on a track just above them, pummeling them with soot and dust.

Unseen by them, briefly illuminated by the flashing subway lights we see three Reaper faces, pale and haunting, hanging upside down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NORTHERN TUNNEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade and Reinhardt reach a dead-end where the tunnel has caved in. A BERM OF HUMAN BONES slopes upward from the water -- skulls and ribs, vertebrae, tibias, metatarsi. Blade kneels, inspecting them. There are gnaw marks on them.
</DIRECTION>
<BLADE>

Chupa moves stealthily in darkness, violently KICKING the older man. Whistler tries to crawl away, then reaches for his pheromone atomizer and locks it in the "on-position". As Chupa continues to lay into Whistler we SEE the atomizer roll away, dispensing its contents.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HORDE OF REAPERS skitter away from the lights.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EASTERN TUNNEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON the pheromone atomizer, the spray petering out. Whistler is beat to shit, bleeding from his mouth. Chupa reaches for his handgun, whipping it out just as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whistler's hands brush the damaged night vision goggles. He swings them upward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHISTLER'S POV (THROUGH GOGGLES)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whistler has just enough time to register Chupa, the handgun pointed directly at him/us before noticing SOMETHING ELSE just beyond Chupa.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DOZEN REAPERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clinging to the ceiling above. They drop down on Chupa like a pack of rabid dogs, literally tearing him in half.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NORTHERN TUNNEL - DAY (20 YEARS AGO)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hearing GUNFIRE and SCREAMS, Blade charges back in Whistler's direction as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BERM OF HUMAN BONES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXPLODE apart. Reapers CHARGE towards them, hitting Blade in the chest, driving him backwards. As Blade falls, his entry light swings upward, illuminating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER REAPER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Drops down atop Reinhardt, knocking his UV gun into the water. We SEE even MORE REAPERS converging in on them from the side tunnels in a cacophony of SHADOW and NOISE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WESTERN TUNNEL - DAY (20 YEARS AGO)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Verlaine, Nyssa and Asad are FIRING their UV lasers. The pumping flashes of their guns throw crazy shadows in every direction. Adding to the unbridled chaos of strobing light and NOISE. More and more Reapers are swarming towards them, moving towards us at an unearthly clip! Nyssa and her compatriots retreat, running for their lives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A REAPER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Leaps, landing on Verlaine's back. It grabs her head and deftly SNAPS her spine in half with a sickening CRUNCH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EASTERN TUNNEL - DAY (20 YEARS AGO)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whistler panics, backing away from the SOUNDS of the reapers slaughtering Chupa. He finds his gun, flicks on the UV entry light --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And just like that, the attacking reapers have vanished. Whistler whirls about, sweeping the UV beam around, but all he SEES is darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, a bone-chilling WHISPER cuts through the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<NOMAK>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whistler.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NOMAK>
<DIRECTION>
Whistler spins. NOMAK RIGHT BEHIND HIM. As Whistler whips the UV gun up, Nomak stops it. The beam is mere millimeters from the Reaper's face -- close enough to illuminate his nightmarish features, but not close enough to burn.
</DIRECTION>
<NOMAK>

In an eyeblink, Nomak is gone. Whistler spins, shining the UV this way and that. Alone in the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NORTHERN TUNNEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade FIRES his UV into a Reaper's torso. As the Reaper incinerates, Blade spins, FIRING at a second Reaper --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON REINHARDT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Firing his non-UV weapon. Two Reapers are closing in on him.
</DIRECTION>
<BLADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take mine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLADE>
<DIRECTION>
Blade throws Reinhardt his UV laser and unsheathes his sword. Reinhardt sweeps the lethal beam over the two reapers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade retreats back into the water, calm, letting the creatures comes to him. As they close in on him, he slips the tip of the sword beneath the surface of the water, waiting --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As one, the Reapers converge on Blade. He swings his sword up from the water, hacking away at them, using their own momentum against them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reinhardt considers his options. He decides to run for it --

Reinhardt races away, abandoning Blade. Blade reaches for one of the UV flashbangs clipped to his harness. He pulls the pin with his teeth and shoves it into an on-rushing Reaper's mouth as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reinhardt slips on the wet concrete and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG! Searing LIGHT fills the tunnel, instantly incinerating the Reaper.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reinhardt's unprotected face CATCHES FIRE. He SCREAMS, falling back into the water, trying to douse the flames. ANOTHER REAPER lands atop him, dragging him down as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NORTHERN AND WESTERN TUNNELS - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear GUNFIRE and SCREAMS coming from all directions. Blade retreats. A reaper, fully ON FIRE from the UV explosion, races towards him. As Blade decapitates it:

	Re-group! Re-group!

Asad and Nyssa also retreat. Nyssa pulls a pin on a UV flashbang, throws it behind her. BA-BANG! UV light fills the tunnels and --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SEWER LINE - FOUR-WAY INTERSECTION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade, Nyssa, Whistler and Asad abruptly find themselves back in the four-way juncture, knee-deep in water. They quickly regroup, out of breath, riding adrenaline highs.

The others turn to look in Blade's direction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOZENS OF RED EYES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
are staring out at them from the darkness of the Eastern Tunnel. Then we hear a HISSING SOUND coming from the opposite direction. Blade and the others spin around --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MORE RED-EYED REAPERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
are closing in on them from the West. AND THE NORTH. AND THE SOUTH! There must be forty of them in all.
</DIRECTION>
<WHISTLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perfect. We got the whole fucking Partridge family here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHISTLER>
<DIRECTION>
They retreat until they are back to back, each one of them covering their respective tunnel opening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A REAPER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lunges at them from the North. Asad triggers his UV laser, scorching the creature. It HOWLS and slinks backwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO MORE REAPERS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Attack from the East and the West. Blade and Nyssa respond in kind, burning their assailants in mid-air. But even as they fire, their UV beams weaken, the flashes of light coming from their barrels pulsing less frequently.
</DIRECTION>

Nyssa reaches inside her harness, handing Blade the remaining atomizers. He crushes them in his fist, letting the fluid within spill over his face and chest.

<ASAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ASAD>
<DIRECTION>
The Reapers become even more agitated, HISSING loudly, pressing in on them closer and closer. Blade nods his head back down the Western tunnel.
</DIRECTION>
<BLADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Verlaine's body is back there somewhere with the UV bomb. If you train your guns in that direction, you'll drive an opening in their ranks. I'll run for it. When the Reapers come after me, you make a break for it the other way.

</BLADE>
<DIRECTION>
The foursome spin, FIRING their UV lasers down the Western tunnel. The Reapers SHRIEK, falling to either side, their bodies burning --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade CHARGES FORWARD, firing his dying UV laser. As he makes it past the line of Reapers, they start after him, driven into a frenzy by the pheromones. The Reapers in the Northern and Eastern tunnels flood after Blade too, leaving --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nyssa, Whistler and Asad to contend with the Reapers in the Southern tunnel. They discharge their weapons, shouldering Reapers aside, making a mad dash for freedom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WESTERN TUNNEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade runs, splashing and stumbling through the water, just a hair's breadth ahead of the HOWLING Reaper horde. Suddenly, the tunnel widens out into a larger chamber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SOUTHERN TUNNEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whistler and the others FIRE BACK at the small group of Reapers which have followed them, rather than Blade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON WHISTLER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
cut off from Nyssa and Asad. He spots a maintenance ladder and runs for it, dragging himself up the rungs. A Reaper leaps up the ladder after him --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Whistler reaches the top of the ladder, but his exit is blocked by a manhole cover! It's STUCK! Whistler swings up his shotgun, FIRING into the cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cover is BLOWN UPWARDS, sending a shaft of blinding sunlight down on the Reaper below him. As the Reaper incinerates, Whistler scurries upwards to safety.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WESTERN TUNNEL/CHAMBER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade reaches Verlaine's half-submerged body. He tears the backpack carrier off the dead vampire and hefts it onto his shoulder, charging up an elevated concrete embankment as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SOUTHERN TUNNEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nyssa and Asad find themselves cornered. Their UV lasers are shot. The Reapers are closing in and we're --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WESTERN TUNNEL/CHAMBER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Back with Blade, the Reapers overrunning him. They pile atop one another in a frenzied effort to get to him. Dozens and dozens of them. And still Blade struggles upward, lifting the UV cluster bomb triumphantly above his head, triggering the device.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The world goes white.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No explosions. Just BLINDING, PURIFYING LIGHT leaving us with a retina-burn image of Blade's silhouette surrounded by Reapers. In that brief instant, the Reapers are frozen, revealed as WRAITH-LIKE X-RAY IMAGES of bone and muscle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SOUTHERN TUNNEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BLAST-WAVE of LIGHT fills the tunnel, chasing its way towards Nyssa and Asad, overtaking the Reapers before them. Asad throws himself at Nyssa, knocking her into the knee-deep water, shielding her body with his own.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BENEATH THE WATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Asad still burns, flaring up and disintegrating from the surface on downward like a piece of liquid-drenched magnesium, bubbles streaming from his writing body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WESTERN TUNNEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darkness, then patterns of subtle shadow and light as our vision slowly returns. FWASH! Blade strikes a FLARE. In the sputtering aureole, the aftermath is slowly revealed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade crouches, unscathed, as if he were standing ground zero in the aftermath of Hiroshima. Scores of Reaper ash-outlines radiate out from him, some of them flash-seared into the surrounding brickwork walls like permanent shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SOUTHERN TUNNEL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade slowly makes his way down the tunnel, using the sputtering flare to guide him. As before, he sees nothing but Reaper ash outlines. But then, Blade sees --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NYSSA
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bleeding and horribly burned despite Asad's sacrifice. Blade crouches, scooping her up into his arms.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL - INNER-CITY TRAUMA WARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BANG! Blade kicks open a pair of doors, hurrying Nyssa inside. He's carrying her limp form in his arms, having wrapped her in a blanket. Blade himself looks like hell warmed over -- covered in blood, ash, and grime.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rushes her towards the ER, navigating through a maze of PATIENTS and VISITORS. An ER NURSE approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<ER_NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, you can't just --

Blade sets Nyssa down on an operating table, pulling off the blanket. She's badly burned and she's lost an enormous amount of blood. As we watch, she GROANS, revealing her fangs.

</POLICEMAN>
<DIRECTION>
WHAP! Blade slaps the cop's gun away and KICKS him in the chest. The cop flies backwards, SLAMS into a bank of equipment, falls. A NURSE SCREAMS. In a near blur, Blade has his MACH out and pressed against the Doctor's forehead.

INT. SCUD'S WORKSHOP - BLADE'S SLEEPING AREA - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nyssa now rests on a cot. Peaceful, the color having somewhat returned to her features. After a moment, her eyes flutter open and she takes in her surroundings. She is in Blade's austere bedroom -- there are tatami mats, a basin for water, a well-thumbed volume of Zen koans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
cuts through an icy window pane above, angling down near Nyssa's cot. Dust motes swirl about it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nyssa focuses on it. Longingly. Then she raises her arm and reaches towards it. Closer, closer -- just barely extending her hand into the light. Her fingertips blacken and smoke, yet Nyssa endures the pain for another moment. Finally, she withdraws her hand, inspecting the damage -- then notices Blade watching her from the doorway.

WHAM! Blade clamps a hand around her throat, slamming her head back. A droplet of blood dribbles from her lips as she lets loose a breathless shudder. She's in the ecstatic throes of the Thirst now, all reason gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade reaches his other hand to her shirt, ripping it open as he runs his fingers across her breasts, then over her exposed rib cage. He turns her around, forcing her against the wall, sinking his own fangs into the back of her neck. She groans as we --

<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE TWO OF THEM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Naked on the tatami mats upon which Blade sleeps. Skin beaded with sweat. Breath steaming in the chill air. He's atop her, moving inside her with measured thrusts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nyssa's limbs are wrapped around him. She claws at the expanse of his back with her fingernails. Her mouth is locked on Blade's throat, then his is locked on hers. Together they drink, leeching blood from one another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULLING BACK AGAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nyssa clutching greedily at Blade like she never wants to let go. Her soul is gone -- transported to that place we drift to when the euphoria overtake us and we're somehow able to transcend the horror of our fleeting lives.

Finally, Nyssa GASPS, climaxing as she retracts her fangs from Blade. Her head rolls to the side as her pupil -- focused on nothing short of eternity -- dilate unnaturally large.

Damaskinos reaches to a nearby control panel, pressing a button. A pair of massive doors slide apart, revealing:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE EUGENICS CHAMBER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are in a vast, multitiered, temperature-controlled chamber -- equal parts 21st century medical facility and Hammer House of Horror.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A network of catwalks look down upon the circular chamber, the center of which is dominated by a massive, steel cask, which is in turn ringed by a safety railing. The operation looks not unlike a small-scale water purification plant, or perhaps a futuristic distillery. Only in this instance, the liquid churning within the cask is HUMAN BLOOD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TINY EMBRYOS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Each no bigger than a thumbnail, line the walls of the chamber, preserved in credit card sized cryo-cases. There are thousands of them, resting atop one another in racks with stretch from the floor on upwards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Damaskinos removes an embryo from the rack, we see ANOTHER EMBRYO behind it. That cryo-case now slides forward with a WHIR, taking the place of the one which Damaskinos removed. Like some kind of perverse vending machine. God knows how deep they're stacked. If thousands are visible, there could be tens of thousands in total.
</DIRECTION>

Damaskinos holds the translucent cryo-case up to the light. The Embryo within shudders, its tiny heart beating.

Blade does his level best, pulling his MACH, squeezing off a SHOT even as Reinhardt FIRES. BA-BANG! Blade is hit in the side, spun clear around. His shot goes wild, hitting one of the Guards in the head, turning him to ash as Blade himself falls to the floor.

Blade GASPS in shock. The rail-gun needles have ripped a brutal hole through the side of his chest-plate. He clutches at his flank, trying to staunch the blood that's seeping between his fingers. As he sits forward, we see MORE FLECHETTES have embedded in the wall behind him, having torn completely through him.

Whistler steps forward. One of the vampire sentries LASHES OUT, striking him in the face with the butt of his rifle. Whistler sinks to his knees, stunned. The guard disarms him.

Providing them with samples of your genetic material -- helping them with the Reaper program. They're close, Blade. Right up against it. Any day now, they're all going to be Daywalkers. And when that happens, well, let's just say, I don't want to be on the losing team. You may be strong, you may be fast, but in the end, you're just too human, B.

WHAM! The door gives way and Nomak enters. To the right, he SEES Whistler and Blade exiting. To the left, he SEES the security monitors. Damaskinos and Stevens can be glimpsed in one of these monitors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nomak moves to the left.

INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - THIRD CORRIDOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade clutches his bleeding side, staggering down the corridor towards a door marked "Eugenics" with Whistler's help. By all rights, Blade should be dead. But he continues on, moving towards the door with determination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - 4-WAY INTERSECTION - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON a hand twisting a safety lever on the floor. PULL BACK to reveal Stevens manually activating a series of hydraulic lock-down latches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHINK!CHINK!CHINK! The doors of the Eastern, Northern, and Western corridors are sealing, lock-down latches clamping down for extra security. Even as the Western door seals, we glimpse Nomak rushing towards it with inhuman speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON STEVENS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
panicked, turning towards the open elevator cab where --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DAMASKINOS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is waiting. But even as Stevens starts towards the elevator, Damaskinos dispassionately presses the "CLOSE DOOR" button.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVENS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVENS>
<DIRECTION>
Stevens rushes towards the closing elevator doors, but it's too late. He pounds his fist against them. Behind him, we hear a terrible RENDING OF METAL as the Western door gives. Stevens looks in that direction --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In an eyeblink, Nomak is upon him, SLAMMING his hand over Stevens' face, crushing it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - ELEVATOR CAB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Damaskinos slides a security card through a reader and punches in a code, a thin SPRAY OF BLOOD jets across his pale forearm. He looks to the elevator doors. The spray of blood is coming through the vertical door seal. The metal doors SHUDDER violently and then the cab begins to ascend. Damaskinos retreats to the far corner of the elevator, breathing a sigh of relief.

INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - EUGENICS CHAMBER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHOOSH! A pneumatic door slides open. Blade and Whistler enter. They are on the second level now, up amongst the catwalks. Below them is the churning cask of purified blood. They have almost reached the end of the catwalk when --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REINHARDT AND HIS MEN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
converge on the lab from two directions at once. Some of the vampires spill through the door on the second level with Reinhardt, while others enter on the ground floor.
</DIRECTION>
<REINHARDT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop him!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</REINHARDT>
<DIRECTION>
As Reinhardt takes aim at Blade with the shotgun, the other vampires FIRE. Whistler is HIT in the leg. He goes down, CRYING OUT, then grips Blade's arm, shoving him onward --
</DIRECTION>
<WHISTLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	GO!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WHISTLER>
<DIRECTION>
ON BLADE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
gripping the guard rail for support, dragging himself along. Reinhardt fires. A SHOTGUN BLAST hits Blade, grazing him but otherwise missing him. As Reinhardt curses and prepares to fire again --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade makes it to the end of the catwalk, pitching himself out into open space. Time slows to a crawl as Blade tumbles downward, plummeting into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE BLOOD CASK BELOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade sinks from view, disappearing beneath the churning slurry of crimson. A beat passes as Reinhardt and his men draw closer, apprehensive. Then, an explosion of BLOOD gushes over Reinhardt and the others. They fall backwards, blinded, slipping --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLADE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
surfaces from the cask in morbidly glorious slow-motion. Think of Sheen in the end-sequence of Apocalypse Now, only instead of a river of mud, Blade is covered head-to-toe in crimson. Majestic and glistening. A primordial god. He rears back his head, letting loose a triumphal ROAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reinhardt's men hesitate. One look at Blade's eyes and we can see he's tapped into a well-spring of fury even he never knew he had. The man is super-charged and ready for war.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade tears into the vampires, unleashing a blizzard of martial arts moves. He powers a right hook into the first vampire's face, then pivots, launching a devastating spinning back-fist into the face of a second. At the same time, he rips the second guard's security belt from his waist, twirling it around nanchadku-style to blind a third guard and capture the wrist of a fourth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some vampires FIRE their guns, but Blade is a whirlwind, shifting and dodging. BULLETS go wild, hitting circuitry, EXPLODING APART cannisters of combustible chemicals. In seconds, FLAMES are licking across the laboratory floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade drops, causing a pair of vampires to FIRE their guns at one another.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Blade knocks two more vampires onto their asses with a foot sweep. Then he's up again. Slamming the bridge of a fifth vampire's nose into his brain with a palm heel strike.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A snap kick, an overhand elbow strike, a knee stamp that shatter's the vampire's knee cap. An upward block, a jab, a cross, a shin kick aimed at a vamp's quadriceps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Overhand punches, rising punches, parallel punches, spinning rear elbows, deep kicks, on and on and on and on in an orgy of super-hero violence until --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM! Blade cuts the last of the vampire soldiers down, turning from the creature's disintegrating body to face --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REINHARDT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vampire mercenary clutches Blade's sword in his hand, but the weapon provides him with little sense of security given that he's just seen a dozen of his men slaughtered. The automatic sprinkler system is on now, spraying water down upon Blade and Reinhardt alike. Blade advances.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reinhardt's been cornered. There's nowhere else for him to run. Refusing to be cowed, Reinhardt SCREAMS and brings the sword down at Blade's head when WHOOSH --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Blade swings his hands upward, slapping them on either side of the blade, trapping the sword on its downward arc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reinhardt strains, trying to tear the sword away from Blade's grip. The vampire's eyes widen in fear. And during that split-second in which the two men are frozen, connected by the weapon which vibrates between them, Blade says:
</DIRECTION>
<BLADE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me something, chief. Can you blush?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLADE>
<DIRECTION>
TWHISH! The sword twists free from Reinhardt's grasp, spinning upward into the air. Reinhardt stumbles backwards against the blood cask railing as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade catches the sword on its way down, swinging it around in one fluid motion, slicing Reinhardt's torso in half, along with a diagonal axis! Reinhardt sinks to his knees as the TWO HALVES split apart, turning to ash before they hit floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Blade stands beneath the spray of the overhead sprinklers, rinsing the blood from his body. He turns towards the exit, sword in hand.

INT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - LOBBY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A set of elevator doors open, disgorging Damaskinos. Beyond the lobby windows we can SEE a waiting helicopter, VAMPIRE SOLDIERS readying it for take-off. Damaskinos rushes across the lobby and is almost at the exit when --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHUNK!CHUNK!CHUNK! A series of steel shutters slam down over the doors and windows. Damaskinos tries to tug one of the shutters upwards, then moves to a keypad nearby. He starts hurriedly tapping in a numeric sequence when we hear:

WHAM!WHAM!WHAM! Nomak pounds away. The elevator doors are starting to buckle, then they tear apart completely --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOMAK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
bursts into the lobby, ROARING. If anything, he is even more animalistic now, his features having become grossly distorted.
</DIRECTION>
<NOMAK>
<DIRECTION>
(in vampire dialect)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you frightened, father? The prodigal son has returned.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NOMAK>
<DIRECTION>
Damaskinos scurries backwards, but there's nowhere left to run. Nomak descends on him, lifting the vampire into a rib crushing embrace, chomping his elongated canines into Damaskinos' throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Damaskinos SQUEALS like a child as his life-blood is sucked out of him. His body begins to cave inward, shrinking and twisting until there's nothing left but shriveled husk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nyssa hefts the rail-gun and FIRES at Nomak's back. Nomak HOWLS, releasing Damaskinos' body, then turns, focusing his blood-drunk gaze on Nomak.
</DIRECTION>
<BLADE>
<DIRECTION>
(alarmed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out of here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BLADE>
<DIRECTION>
But Nyssa stands her ground, rachetting back the slide on the rail-gun, readying to unleash another barrage of needles. Nomak CHARGES, moving at unbelievable speed. She FIRES AGAIN, aiming at Nomak's chest --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
but then Nomak is upon her. He slaps the rail-gun from her hands, SMASHING IT TO PIECES. Then he wraps his hand around her throat, pulling her forward, sinking his teeth into her neck. Nyssa SCREAMS.

<DIRECTION>
ON BLADE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he leaps from the mezzanine level, sword extended, like Beowulf diving to slay Grendel. He PLUNGES the sword deep into Nomak's upper torso. Then DRIVES it in even further --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nomak releases Nyssa and back-hands Blade across the face, sending him sailing through the air. He lands, skids across the floor --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON NOMAK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
stumbling backwards into the wall. The sword has sunk so deep that the tip is actually protruding out his back, SCRAPING a gash across the wall as Nomak slides towards the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nomak GRUNTS, then reaches for the pomeel with his ruined hand. He grips the pommel and SNAPS the sword-blade in half. Then he SLAMS against the wall, forcing the half of the broken blade that's still embedded in him out back through the front of his chest. As Nomak rises to his feet --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade is on him again, snap-kicking the Reaper in the chest. Nomak retaliates. Blade somersaults out of the way, then springs back again, KICKING Nomak in the face, BREAKING Nomak's NECK. Nomak's head lolls unnaturally sideways for a heartbeat and then Nomak swings his head around, somehow righting his neck vertebrae with a snap of his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They trade blows, a brutal death-match that seems to defy gravity. Blade moves in for a round-house punch, but Nomak catches his fist, holding it for a split-second, then bending Blade's hand at an unnatural angle, SNAPPING his wrist bones. The pain is enormous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nomak starts beating the living shit out of Blade, pummeling him with his fists, gripped by an uncontrollable rage. He SMASHES Blade against a marble column, cracking it. Then he flings Blade against one of the brushed steel walls - so hard that Blade's body actually leaves an indentation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before Blade can recover, Nomak is in front of him, launching another kick. Blade rolls his head out of the way, barely avoiding Nomak's boot heel which dents the wall. Nomak kicks a second time. Blade avoids Nomak, but third time's the charm and Nomak lands one squarely in Blade's gut. Blade falls beneath a flurry of blows, unable to defend himself any longer. Blood stains his eyes, obscuring his vision. He strikes out blindly, but Nomak has forced him to the ground, pinning him there. As Blade struggles to free himself --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NOMAK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lowers his head towards Blade's face. The scar/seam in Nomak's chin splits open and Nomak's lower jaw flares apart, distending and widening to reveal the awful, glistening hell maw -- the hollow inner fangs and striated cartilage which are closing about Blade's face. Blade twists his head violently to the right, then glimpses the broken tip of his sword resting a few feet away. He reaches for it in desperation, plunging it up into Nomak's chest. Nomak HOWLS. Because the hilt has been broken off, Blade is forced to grip the cutting edge of the weapon with his bare hands. It slices into his fingers --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
but Blade just grips the broken sword tighter, ignoring the pain, driving it deeper and deeper -- until, suddenly, it penetrates the cartilaginous shell around Nomak's heart and --
</DIRECTION>
<NOMAK>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Blood brother.

</NOMAK>
<DIRECTION>
Nomak smiles, covering Blade's hands with his own. He looks blade in the eye, then drives the broken sword home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Nomak's body stiffens, his eyes grow unseeing, an oddly serene look spreading across his tortured face. A patch of BLACKNESS begins radiating outward from his chest, moving over his body, carbonizing him from within. As his blackened flesh begins to crack, BLUE FLAMES flicker out from the fissures. In seconds, Nomak is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Blade stands, exhausted. Then he looks to where Nyssa rests. He moves to her side, kneeling beside her. She smiles up at him, bravely, but frightened all the same. Blade inspects the wound on her neck. It's clearly fatal.

EXT. CALIBAN INDUSTRIES - JUST BEFORE DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shutters over the doors and windows slowly rise. Blade shoulders open the front door, moving across the lawn towards a bluff overlooking the ocean. A moment later, Whistler emerges into the light, watching as Blade sets Nysa down on the grass. Her eyes flutter open and she looks into --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE HORIZON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
where the faintest glimmer of pre-dawn light brightens the cloud-swept sky. It's peaceful. We can hear the SURF crashing on the shore below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Together they wait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GLIMMER OF LIGHT emerges over the earth's curvature, spreading its dazzling radiance out across the skyline. Nyssa's eyes widen in expectation, her breath catching. She looks up at Blade, stroking his face, smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<NYSSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Each day is a little life. Remember?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NYSSA>
<DIRECTION>
Blade nods, he's strong for her. Despite his best efforts, a tear slides down his cheek. They kiss then as the sun rises in full glory, flooding the world with its brilliance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Blade holds Nyssa tightly to his chest, refusing to relinquish his grip as her body catches fire. The end is blessedly quick -- not a slow-burn of blazing agony, but a nearly seamless transition from life --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To ash... Nyssa collapses apart in Blade's arms, billowing out around him in a cloud of glowing embers. One moment she's there, the next she's gone. Blade remains where he is, kneeling on the bluff, the wind carrying the last traces of Nyssa aloft into the sky. He shuts his eyes. Turns his face to the warmth of the sun, surrendering himself to acceptance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE RISE UP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
isolating Blade alone on the windswept bluff. After a moment, Whistler moves to Blade's side. He rests a hand on Blade's shoulder, but doesn't say a word. We keep moving up and up until the two of them are just a pair of tiny figures on the rolling coastline. Then we --

<DIRECTION>
INT. BLADE'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT

Blade works before a forge by moonlight, his body dripping with sweat. He slips his hand in a protective glove and grips the red-hot weapon, dousing it in a quench bucket. As a cloud of steam envelops Blade, he lifts it up for view.
