UNDERWATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dramatically lit by sunlight filtering down from the surface. A dim shape, massive, threatening, swims towards us from the distance. Then it divides -- what was one is two, and the shape becomes reality; two divers in Scuba gear swimming side by side. They are wearing minimal rubber, considering the cool New England waters: "Farmer John" wetsuits with cut-off legs, assorted sport-diving paraphernalia, including an expensive camera with a flash attachment.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One motions "Down there," the other signals "OK, I see it," and they dive deeper, into darker waters, where the shafts of sunlight pour into the depths, broken up by seaweed and floating vegetation into cathedral-like columns of illumination.

SEA BOTTOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wreck of the working fisherman's boat "ORCA," formerly under the command of the late Captain Quint, deceased these four years.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Buried in the sand near it, still connected by rusting strands of cable, the mangled remains of a shark cage, glimmering with stainless steel highlights. A fitful flash of yellow from under a mossy beard -- a battered barrel, similarly tangled.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The divers, Bert and Ernie, appear. They're fascinated by the find, and Bert, with the camera, snaps a few flash shots. The rapid sequence of flashes signals the presence of a motor drive camera.

ANOTHER POINT OF VIEW

Distant flashes, obscured by vegetation in the foreground.

SEA BOTTOM, THE ORCA

Ernie is exploring the abandoned cabin; doors open and shut, moved by invisible currents stirred by his passage.

An occasional "Flash!" lights up the bottom as Bert continues snapping away souvenir shots of this local landmark.

BERT'S POINT OF VIEW - CAMERA VIEWFINDER (PROCESS)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ernie floats up out of a hatch, sees the camera, and strikes a pose, clowning for the photographer's benefit. A big hand, f.g., motions him up into clear water for a formal portrait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He obliges. Now he floats in front of us, gently paddling his flippers to maintain vertical stability. One flash.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another. Then a large, dim movement in the b.g.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something's out there, moving towards us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flash. It's bigger, bearing down like a train in a tunnel.

Flash! It's on us. Flash! Teeth? Blood? Flash! Blackness,

Death.

The jeep slows to a stop, and he takes a flight of stairs leading to a concrete patio two at a time. A classical trumpet solo is playing in the background. Brody charges through a door, then abruptly slows and starts moving warily through a hotel interior: The Holidome, a three-story extravaganza of a motel, where some sort of formal ceremony is already in progress. A banner announces: "Grand Opening Ball -- Amity Scholarship Fund Benefit." Brody crosses under a High School band, arranged dance-band style on a balcony; the trumpet player, Polo, is finishing his solo, the assembled crowd applauds politely. Brody is taking his place with some dignitaries on the dais, as the presiding authority, Amity Mayor Larry Vaughn, begins speaking.

EXT. AMITY BEACH ROAD - DAY (DUSK)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brody is alone in the jeep, headed for the safety of home and family. He drives past the town's billboard: it's covered with an architect's rendering of the Amity Holiday Inn . The sign reads: "WHEN IN AMITY, ENJOY THE HOLIDAY INN."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Plastered across it is an added streamer: "NOW OPEN." Barely visible underneath are older notices: "UNDER CONSTRUCTION," and "OPENING IN JUNE."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Brody passes the sign, he impulsively swings off the main road and heads down towards the beach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brody is on restless patrol, checking the water's edge as he continues on home. As he drives along, he sees: a clambake; some teen-agers in a group, necking and dancing; and a few solitary surfcasters and fishermen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The beach is deserted, the sun is setting, and Brody and his jeep have the sand to themselves. It's then that he sees something:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A big bow section of a ruined, burnt boat is bobbing in the surf just off the beach ahead. It's a piece of the water- skiers' boat; Brody heads towards it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE SURF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Brody slows his jeep just short of the water, and gets out to look at the flotsam. His shoes get wet. He backs up onto dry sand, then tries to edge closer to examine this object. It bobs up and down in the surf; Brody makes "Get in here" motions. The junk resists.
</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, give a guy a break.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
No response. He takes off his shoes and socks, and rolls up his trouser legs. A silly sight. He wades into the water after it.
</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. Here boy. Come to Poppa....

It eludes him, and he flounders after it. A big wave breaks across his crotch.

CLOSE ON BRODY IN THE WATER

As he grabs the ruined wood, and pulls it towards him. Sud- denly, the mass of wreckage breaks apart, and something lunges out of the mess and into Brody.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHOCK CUT CLOSEUP - "THE THING"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brody is suddenly pinned under a soggy charred horror; the gory remains of Diane, burnt beyond recognition,: flesh peeled away, discolored, charred, ruined by days in salt water. He screams, and scrabbles in the wet sand, trying to get out of the dreadful clutches of the half-human thing he's dredged from the water.
</DIRECTION>

ANGLE ON BRODY

Extricating himself, puking, retching, splashing water on his face, washing his hands frantically, just behind him, The Thing lying on the sand, a gruesome joke played by the sea.

Macro close on a pharmaceutical bottle of Sodium Cyanide, from which a syringe is withdrawing a healthy dose. Follow the syringe and reveal Brody, working at his desk in the deserted office. He is injecting the deadly chemical into some jacketed .38 hollow-point ammunition; a dozen cartridges are lined up in neat array, he is filling the last of them, sealing the points with wax from a burning red candle. The radio scanner is monitoring the local police band: routine reports faintly in the b.g. -- a slow night in pre-season Amity.

Mike silently storms into his room, not-so-silently slamming the door as he exits. From inside the room, loud rock music muffled behind the door -- an expression of teen-age rebel- lion.

EXT. AMITY BEACH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The familiar striped cabanas flank the white sands; there's a crowd of midweek seasonal tourists and locals oblivious to the tall steel tower that dominates the beach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A classy van outfitted for passengers pulls into the parking area, followed by Vaughn's Cadillac; the parking attendant waves them into a preferential area, where they disembark: Vaughn, Peterson, Ellen, and some more prospects, including a woman named Bryant and her daughter, Renee.
</DIRECTION>
<PETERSON>

He can't believe it. But looking past him, we can see it with the unaided eye: a seething dark mass, moving through the water towards the unprotected bathers.

The close-up detail of this otherwise blurred and unreadable photo is unmistakably a detail from a very close view of the snapping jaws of a Great White; if you hadn't seen it as a memory, it would make no sense at all. For Brody, the meaning is all too clear; for anyone who's never seen the monster face-to-face, it's nothing.

WIDE ON THE HARBOR

Lots of day-sailing Kids, a few bigger, adult boats, some working fishermen and sport fishers; a typical recreational boating mix. The Kids are finding the same general direction, pointing out of the harbor.

<DIRECTION>
FOLLOWING ANDREWS AND CROSBY

as they go over the edge of a shelf and drop into darker, deeper waters. Crosby checks his depth, his watch, looks around....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POINT OF VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
far above him, the class, going about their business.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below him, murk, depth, and suddenly, a big lunker bass. Andrews sees it, too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE - ON ANDREWS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Assuming Crosby is following, he takes off, following the big lunker. Crosby, hung up in some minor equipment problem, misses seeing him go. The two men are separated. Follow Andrews as he twists and turns after the bass, going deeper, losing him in the rocks, suddenly rounding a boulder, and meeting, almost face-to-face, horror:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BELOW HIM THE SHARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Great White Shark, taking the striper in a single gulp, it's looking up at Andrews with one glassy doll's eye; it turns to face him directly, and we see the scar; ugly, red and black, charred flesh from jaw back on the right side, eyes and teeth gleaming like raw bone in the massive, uncaring face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Andrews' mouth clamps violently on his mouthpiece, then goes wide as he screams in fear into the water. Finning backwards, he ditches his weights, gulps for air, and yanks the cord on his safety vest. It balloons out, and pulls him up, surging towards the surface. The mouthpiece, useless, falls away from his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Eyes closed, hose dangling, Andrews hurtles upward, holding his breath in a final, fatal panic, passing a startled Crosby.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE DIVERS
</DIRECTION>

look over at the rocketing ascent. What's wrong? Sparky signals "up," and they begin to carefully follow him towards the surface. Crosby's already surfacing.

DECK OF THE DIVING BOAT - DAY

	Get us in! For Christ's sake, get us in!

In his arms, Andrews writhes, pain knotting his limbs.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The terrible fin breaks the surface, about 20 yards out, then dips and disappears. Then, impossibly fast, the entire Sandpiper is lifted from underneath by a powerful surge, as the Shark lunges up against it from below, an unseen horror. Ed is knocked over the side, into the water.

ANGLE OVER THE GUNWALE, TOWARDS ED
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He has barely taken two strokes when a powerful force takes him from below the surface, rushing him towards us through the water. Tina screams. Before Ed can react to the pain, he is slammed face first into the boat. His jaw breaks, blood smears his nose and lip.

His hands grab the wooden-cap rail with a death-grip.

On the way to the lighthouse, but away from the harbor, the Kids are sailing in fairly close order: The sloops (Polo, Timmy, Marge) heeled well over in the stiff breeze, the faster cats (Mike, Larry, Donny, etc.) skimming around, tacking more often, faster and more maneuverable.

</ANDY>
<DIRECTION>
His light pokes and sweeps through the gloom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRODY IN THE WATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hears the horrendous sounds of wood and metal breaking, as the raft pounds to pieces on the rocks. He is blinded by the sweeping searchlight, the confusion of terror-stricken teen-agers screaming. It's the middle of The Inferno.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRODY'S POINT OF VIEW - SEAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sean, standing up, reaching out to him, the Shark hitting his fragile perch, Sean tumbling backwards, towards what seems to be certain death.
</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
(o.s.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sean!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON BRODY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
as he hurls his paddle at the Shark, anything to get even, to distract it.
</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You bastard!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around him wildly, searching for a weapon, finding a steel boathook. He screams at the unfeeling Shark....
</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come here, you son-of-a-bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
The huge gray hulk obligingly turns towards this new irrita- tion. Brody bangs on the raft, yelling, creating a commotion. The Shark speeds towards him
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
lunges at the raft, Brody sliding desperately away, smashing at the snout with his steel, the tail fin bashing him as it passes....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE STERN OF THE POLICE BOAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brody is drifting close to the cable, drawn heavy and wet cut of the water. He reaches up to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON BRODY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
dangling his feet in the water, holding onto the cable, seeing it, inspired with a lunatic idea....
</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Over here! You bastard! Over here
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
turns, bleeding from a superficial cut on its snout, its scar glistening wet and terrible. It heads for Brady.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRODY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
possessed, yelling at the top of his lungs.
</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come and get me! Come and get me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
attacking. Missing Brody, who hauls himself up out of the way in life-or-death spasm. The great jaws close, fastening onto the thick cable. Shaking it. The cable resists for a moment, then splits, layers or insulation and armor crack open, the jaws clamp harder -- 20,000 tons of pressure -- then the live copper core is reached. Zap!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SHARK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
dying. Leaping and convulsing as hundreds of thousands of volts surge through its body, grounded in the salt sea. Hot white fire shimmers like a halo, the fish smokes and stinks, sputters, and dies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRODY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
watching, cowering on the rubber raft to which he fell when the shark hit the cable. It's strangely silent. The lights on Cable Junction flicker and die as circuit breakers shut down the mains, protecting the line. Only the boat's work- lights provide light now.
</DIRECTION>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. Water lapping at the rocks, some Kids sobbing quietly. Brody listlessly paddles towards the wreckage of the raft, expecting the worst....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE WRECKAGE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Timmy's Doughdish, where we last saw Sean. There's a scrab- bling from inside, and Sean appears, soaked, from under the seat where he'd fallen.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<DIRECTION>
Brody moves toward him, holds out his arms, taking Sean onto his raft. They paddle back towards the rocks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE ISLAND
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
with the Kids clinging like drowned rats to the rocks; they're wet, scared, exhausted, but safe. Sean hugs his daddy as they step onto land.
</DIRECTION>
<SEAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They made me go with them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SEAN>
<BRODY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure they did....
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRODY>
<DIRECTION>
He kisses the damp forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. AMITY HARBOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A crowd of worried parents and adults, Ellen and Hendricks in the forefront, are staring towards the harbor mouth. It's dawn and the sun is rising. They see something, a cheer goes up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON THE WATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A big Coast Guard cutter is steaming into the harbor, a little group of survivors on the foredeck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE CUTTER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Brody and the surviving Kids wave to their families on land.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROLL END CREDITS.
</DIRECTION>
