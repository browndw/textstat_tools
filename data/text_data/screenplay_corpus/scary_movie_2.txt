Megan lays tied to the bed post of her bed. Her face is cut up and twisted, eyes an eerie red. She's hooked up to an I.V. with a small tube running out of her nose. It's shaped like a CRAZY STRAW with red fluid going through it. The straw leads to a cup. "SLURPIE!" Megan is wheezing, heavily. She wears a tee-shirt that reads, "I went to Hell and all I got was this stupid t-shirt."

<ALEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we never made it official, so I guess we were technically never really boyfriend and girlfriend, but I was seeing him in school. I saw him at the mall about six months ago and I was too nervous to introduce myself so I followed him to his car, and jotted down the license plate number. It was registered to his mother, so I went to her house. She was so nice. I mean, she seemed like she would be nice 'cuz I never really spoke to her. I just waited til she went to work then I climbed in through her window and borrowed her phone book. I say borrowed because I'm going to give it back one day. But anyway, I called everyone in it til I found her son. He wasn't home when I called so I left this message how much in love I was with him. I was, and how I wanted to have his children. Just really opening up, and he never called back. I'd call and call, and anyway, six months and two restraining orders later I just decided I deserved better. What about you? Do you have a boyfriend?

Ray sits on the bed for a moment. He notices a clown doll sitting in a rocking chair across the room. The moonlight gives the clown face an eerie glow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray takes off his shirt and tosses it at the clown, covering its face an causing the chair to rock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray gets down and does a few push-ups.

Ray goes to retrieve his shirt. He notices the clown is gone.

Ray looks around and doesn't see the clown doll anywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a rustling noise comes from under the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ray's breathing, quickens. He knows where he must now look. Ray slowly lowers himself head first to the floor of the bed, in preparation to look under it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He very, very carefully lifts the dust ruffle and lets the top of his head touch the rug. Ray is upside-down as he looks into the darkness under his bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Under the bed. The clown is there, face to face with him, smiling sardonically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the split-second it takes for a child to draw a breath and let it out through the vocal chords, the clown wraps its five foot extension arms around Ray's neck, cutting off half his air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDE ANGLE HIGH.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Struggling now for his life, Ray is dragged helplessly under the bed and out of sight. Under the bed we hear a struggle, followed by the evil laugh of the clown.

The window blows open. Curtains flutter in the wind.

The ghost drags her up the wall and over a portrait of a solemn looking man.

Then Alex's butt slides over his face and the man is now smiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ghost drags her across the ceiling and crashes her head into the light fixture.

The sexual Olympics continue as she spider-walks down the wall and is dragged across the floor, smoke comes up from beneath her.

Cindy tosses the cat off and jumps to her feet.

The cat lands and pounces right back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cindy catches it and throws it down harder, sending it crashing into a table which smashes into pieces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cindy and the cat circle each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cat grabs a bottle from the table, breaks it, holding the jagged side out towards Cindy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cat jumps on Cindy, knocks her to the floor, pinning her down. The cat tries to shove the broken bottle into Cindy's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cindy, desperately, holds back the cat's paw. Her teeth gritting with effort.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cindy slowly turns the bottle towards the cat, who now looks worried.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cindy makes her move, flipping the cat over. Now, she's on top pushing the bottle close to the cat's throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cat gives a huge effort and shoves Cindy off of itself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Fighting dirty, the cat reaches into its litter box and throws some of the sand in Cindy's eyes. The cat then picks up a chair and breaks it over Cindy's head, then jumps on her back and tries to strangle her with piano wire. But Cindy manages to flip the cat forward over her shoulder.

Cindy walks over to a basket of fruit on the counter and picks up a banana.

Provocatively, she peels it and, looking deep in his eyes, she slips the banana into her mouth, sliding it in and out simulating a blow job. Suddenly, the banana breaks off in her throat and she starts to choke on it. She turns red, gagging and coughing.

Alex sits in front of her vanity mirror, wearing a sexy robe and nightgown. She brushes her hair, humming to herself happily, full of anticipation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes her perfume - "Obsession" - and dabs some on her neck, behind her ears, inside her thighs. Then she puts the bottle to her mouth and - glug, glug, glug - drinks the whole thing down like Gatorade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alex applies hot wax to a waxing strip then to her legs, tearing it off. Satisfied her legs are smooth, she does her underarm. She then applies a wax-soaked strip between her legs then tears it off.

She rises and walks over to the old 19th century-style portrait of the supposed ghost, which once hung prominently downstairs. It now sits propped up in a corner of her room with a shrine set up all around it consisting of candles, little "I love you" hearts, and her vibrator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alex walks over to the portrait, regards it lovingly for a moment, and then kisses the figure sweetly on the lips. Then she works her way down the portrait -- hungrily kissing, nibbling, and licking. When she pulls back, seductively, the cobwebs, dust and spiders that were clinging to the portrait are now all over her face. She doesn't care, she simply brushes them aside -- she's in love.

Alex climbs into bed and spreads rose petals all around. Everything's ready. She sits back and waits.

One-two-three-, one-two-three.

Then she gets on all fours and does a few stick -your-ass-high-in-the-air stretches. One-two-three.

Then she does the simulated oral sex gesture, first with the right hand, then with the left, making sure her forearms are nice and loose. One-two-three, one-two-three.

He sees flowers placed around his portrait.

A vase of roses on his desk.

There are a pair of woman's panties on the desk lamp. He picks them up to inspect them. Disgusted, he throws the panties on the floor.

The ghost then catches sight of a three-layered wedding cake set on a table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, he sees that Alex has pasted a photo of her face, over the face of his beloved Carolyn in her portrait. This sends him into a tirade.

Dwight and the ghost zigzag down the hallway bumping and cutting each other off.

Dwight, his hair is flowing.

Matching shot of the ghost.

The chair crashes into the banister. It breaks the back of Dwight's charm which dangerously hangs over the edge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwight gains control. As the ghost chair approaches, Dwight speeds towards the ghost.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just before the chairs pass each other, Dwight leaps out and hangs on the side, firing his gun at the ghost.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ghost ducks and the shot misses him.

Dwight is dragged painfully through the hallway smashing into open doors, statues, cupboards. Finally, Dwight leaps back into the chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Not a moment to soon. The ghost chair whips in front of Dwight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwight thinks fast. He uses a broken table as a ramp. He catches some good air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwight lands, slams on the brakes, sending his chair tipping forward. Dwight shows his skills by spinning his chair as it balances on the front wheels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dwight and the ghost chair now are at opposite ends of the hall.
</DIRECTION>

The scene plays very dramatic and in SLOW-MOTION. Dwight in his wheelchair at one end of the hall and the ghost in his wheelchair at the other end. WHITE DOVES begin to flutter through the hallway ala a "JOHN WOO" movie.

One of the doves flies by in slow motion. It plops right on his face.

The tires of Dwight's wheelchair begin spinning and squealing, burning rubber and causing smoke to come from the tire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ghost's wheelchair tires burn rubber and starts barreling toward Dwight at full (wheelchair) speed. Dwight starts rolling with all his might toward the ghost in his wheelchair. Coming towards each other like the motorcycle scene in "MI:2".

One of his tires blows out. We see that it reads "FIRESTONE."

Quick cuts of her snapping a wire loose.
