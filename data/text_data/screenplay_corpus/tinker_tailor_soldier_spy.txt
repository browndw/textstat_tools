EXT. HUNGARY - BUDAPEST - 1973 - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Budapest skyline, looking towards the Parliament building. From here the world looks serene, peaceful. Then, as we begin to PULL BACK, we hear a faint whine, increasing in volume, until it's the roar of two MiG jet fighters, cutting across the skyline. The PULL BACK reveals a YOUNG BOY watching the jets, exclaiming excitedly in Hungarian.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUDAPEST STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATERALLY TRACKING down a bustling street, as the jets scream by overhead. Pedestrians look up. All except one man who continues walking. This is JIM PRIDEAUX.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ACROSS THE STREET: More pedestrians. We're not sure who we're supposed to be looking at - the short stocky man? The girl in the mini skirt? The man in the checked jacket?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A car driving beside Prideaux accelerates out of the frame. Across the street the girl in the mini-skirt peels off into a shop. The stocky man turns and waves to us. But it isn't Prideaux he's greeting but another passerby, who walks over, shakes hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we're left with Prideaux and the Magyar in the checked shirt, neither paying any attention to each other.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as we are wondering if there is any connection, the two reach a corner and the Magyar, pausing to cross the road, collides with another passerby. He looks over and sees Prideaux has caught the moment of slight clumsiness and gives the smallest of rueful smiles. A tiny moment of contact between the two. Then both men walk on around the corner, just two strangers headed in the same direction...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUBWAY EXIT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shooting up the steps of the exit to the imposing GALERIA building on the corner ahead. Prideaux and the Magyar walk up the steps, still paying no attention to each other, and head towards...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUDAPEST - GALERIA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A formerly grand arcade. Many of the shops are now closed, the one's that are open don't have much to sell. A CAFE occupies the middle space under the high vaulted ceiling. A JAZZ ROCK band rehearses in one of the nearby disused shops, incongruous in the window, music muffled by the glass. Customers sit around tables playing chess, drinking coffee, a mother breast-feeding, the hum of chatter. The ordinary world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We find Prideaux and the Magyar sitting at one of the tables.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGYAR>
<DIRECTION>
(Hungarian, subtitled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And porkolts. You know porkolts?
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I've had it.

<MAGYAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's very good. Better than goulash. But you won't get it in Budapest now.

	Why's that?

</JIM_PRIDEAUX>
<MAGYAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All the pigs have gone to Moscow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGYAR>
<DIRECTION>
He gives a sly laugh. Prideaux smiles, draws on his cigarette, nonchalantly examining the people at the tables around them. A WAITER arrives, belly bulging out of his grubby shirt, hair plastered to his head. He puts two wizened-looking sandwiches in front of them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRIDEAUX'S P.O.V. - A DROP OF SWEAT trickles from the Waiter's face, drips onto the table top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Magyar catches Jim looking at the droplet and gives a wry smile - "nice service." Jim smiles back but a bell has begun to ring inside him.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM_PRIDEAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When do I get to meet your friend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM_PRIDEAUX>
<DIRECTION>
The Magyar chews on his sandwich, notices Prideaux is ignoring his.
</DIRECTION>
<MAGYAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take you to him. Not eating?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAGYAR>
<DIRECTION>
Prideaux pushes his sandwich across the table, his manner still easy, but his eyes flick after the Waiter, who stands at the entrance to the coffee shop, arguing with another man. He looks around the Galeria again, looking low - checking the feet of the other customers? Then raising his gaze, he checks the windows of the apartments above which look down into the arcade.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRIDEAUX'S P.O.V. - An OLD WOMAN stands in the shadows by a window above. She is watching him. Catching his gaze she shrinks back into the darkness and disappears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Prideaux's expression doesn't change but he sets his coffee cup down and casually stands. The Magyar looks up in surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<JIM_PRIDEAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you excuse me a moment?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIM_PRIDEAUX>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to walk towards the exit of the Galeria. Behind him his chair teeters for a moment, then slowly falls back and lands with a CRASH, sending pigeons fluttering up to the domed ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WAITER starts, turns, sees Prideaux leaving. Panic flashes across his face, he draws a GUN from the back of his belt, aims after Prideaux and FIRES - the shot echoing in the cavernous space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shot misses, RICOCHETING off the tiled wall and Prideaux keeps walking, fighting down the impulse to run, as behind him, out of focus - an image from a surreal NIGHTMARE: the other CUSTOMERS stop what they are doing, like actors at the end of a scene, and begin to rise, some drawing guns. We hear a muffled voice shouting distantly in Russian.
</DIRECTION>
<KGB_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No firing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KGB_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Ahead of Prideaux more figures appear, blocking the exit. He looks over his shoulder just as another SHOT rings out - this one catching him above the shoulder blade and sending him flying out of frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From around a corner a tall, over-coated man - KGB - strides towards the scene, still bellowing in Russian.
</DIRECTION>
<KGB_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who told you to fire? Who told you to fucking fire?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KGB_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
THE JAZZ BAND have stopped playing and are staring at the ground, arms at their sides, anxious not to see anything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the TOP WINDOW - the OLD WOMAN slips back into sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HER P.O.V. - Prideaux lies face down in the arcade below. As we watch one of his arms slides out, leaving a slick of blood. Then he's still.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BELOW - The KGB Man has grabbed the Waiter and started to beat him.
</DIRECTION>
<KGB_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fucking Hungarian amateur! We wanted him alive!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KGB_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him we can see the breast-feeding MOTHER. She's dead, a bullet hole in the centre of her forehead from the ricochet. The baby continues to suckle on, undisturbed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the cafe window we can see a MAN, partly obscured by the crowd in front of us, the only man still seated. He lights a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE LIGHTER as he replaces it. We can make out an inscription: "To George, from Ann. All my love."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the Galeria the KGB Man continues to bellow at the Waiter. The baby begins to WAIL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. HQ OF BRITISH INTELLIGENCE - "THE CIRCUS" - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bird's eye view of the Circus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR - - "MOTHERS" OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A woman, CONNIE SACHS, a face that's seen it all, leans against a wall, smoking. A middle-aged woman, one of the secretaries or "MOTHERS" walks past, pushing a trolley of documents. She nods at Connie mournfully. Connie looks stricken. The Mother walks on into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIRCUS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long conference table. We are looking at an ELDERLY MAN at the head of the table. He's sitting on a rather ornate carving chair - a little like a throne - and he looks ill. He is signing documents, his signature a simple "C," scrawled in GREEN INK, aware all eyes are on him. A cigarette burns away in an already loaded ashtray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is the head of the Circus - known as CONTROL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Around him are four lieutenants - the inner circle of the intelligence service - PERCY ALLELINE, TOBY ESTERHASE, ROY BLAND and BILL HAYDON.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beside him, his right-hand man - GEORGE SMILEY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the thick and embarrassed atmosphere we might guess we are at the end of a coup, the final ousting of a King. All we hear is the ticking of a loud clock and the scratch of the pen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley looks up to find Alleline's gaze fixed on him. Alleline quickly looks down at his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON SMILEY - as he examines the others, gauging the SHIFT OF POWER occurring in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- Bill Haydon - handsome, urbane, frowning with tension, pulls on his cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- Roy Bland - heavy set and moustached, flicking a guilty look up at Smiley and away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
- Toby Esterhase - immaculate hair and suit, eyes on Alleline, watching for a cue, like a dog told to `stay'.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No-one will look at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SMILEY - realising there is no hope.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Control finishes, puts the pen back in his pocket. He hands the file to the MOTHER who, red-eyed, walks with it out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<PERCY_ALLELINE>

<DIRECTION>
(Beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, a man should know when to leave the party.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONTROL>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. The clock suddenly gives a discordant chime as it sounds the hour. A hint of bitter amusement on Control's face, as though he's been waiting for this wrong little note to make his move. He grinds his cigarette out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Toby can't wait any longer.
</DIRECTION>
<TOBY_ESTERHASE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What about Smiley?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOBY_ESTERHASE>
<DIRECTION>
Control looks at Smiley. His gaze impersonal...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SMILEY - the faintest flicker in his eyes as he tries to prepare himself for the shock of dismissal.
</DIRECTION>
<CONTROL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smiley is leaving with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONTROL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PUSHING Control and Smiley as they walk down the corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alleline and the Lieutenants are waiting for them. A horribly awkward moment. Toby pulls open the cage lift doors for them, as if to hasten the eviction. Haydon looks at him with contempt.
</DIRECTION>
<BILL_HAYDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You little prick Esterhase.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL_HAYDON>
<DIRECTION>
Control sweeps past them and the lift, determined to walk every step of the way. Smiley follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIRCUS - STAIRCASE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Control and Smiley, begin their descent through the rigid hierarchy of the Circus. As we TRACK with them, we see that each floor is its own WORLD. The two men walk past the fourth floor REGISTRY - the vast archive of intelligence, staffed by RESEARCHERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley and Control pass down another flight and along the third floor - INTELLIGENCE OFFICERS - heads poking out of offices, amongst them JERRY WESTERBY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Down to the second floor - SCALPHUNTERS - the muscle of the Circus. The boredom of an air-port lounge, a sunken sofa and pool-table. The Scalphunters watching them go in respectful silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On down to the first floor TYPING POOL - staffed by pretty young society girls - the DEBS - who watch open-mouthed, as their Chief passes them for the last time. And finally down to...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIRCUS - GROUND-FLOOR LOBBY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ancient doorman - BRYANT - feeling the moment must be marked in some way - leaves his sentry box and opens the main door for Control. Control acknowledges the salute with a flick of his eyes and we push through the doors...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CIRCUS - ROOF OF THE CIRCUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alleline and Bland stand smoking, watching Control and Smiley emerge onto the pavement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CIRCUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CONTROL and SMILEY stand on the street. They stare at each other for a moment. This is goodbye. They shake hands. Perhaps there's a little reserve in Control's manner, a lack of warmth. From the expression on Smiley's face we see that he is pained by this.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Control puts his collar up and walks away. Smiley stands forlornly as Control disappears into the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TITLES OVER A MONTAGE

<DIRECTION>
EXT. HAMPSTEAD POND - AUTUMN DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE WATER OF THE POND - still, glassy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN'S head breaks the surface - Smiley swimming through his retirement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a breath and submerges again. Beyond him we see a straggled diagonal line of elderly heads, bobbing through the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HAMPSTEAD POND - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley dries himself under the trees, pink and raw in the cold fresh air. He smooths his hair down, feeling a little less ridiculous. He looks over to where a VERY ELDERLY SWIMMER is being helped into the water - little more than trembling bones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Is this his world now?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MOTHER unloads a stack of files from a LIFT shaft and places them into her wheeled safe. A piece of CHRISTMAS TINSEL is wound along the trolley. We track with her through the HIVE-LIKE atmosphere of the fifth floor, behind her the conference room - a glimpse of Alleline in Control's chair, surrounded by his lieutenants - smoke and whiskey - engaged in the business of the world.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She pushes on into Alleline's OFFICE - loads the new files into the LARGE SAFE there, locks and spins the combination.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - WINTER DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley stands frying an egg in his small kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley sits eating his solitary lunch, reading a volume of Grimmelshausen. He turns a page, examines the illustration of a knight and a dragon - holds it at arms length, trying to focus on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley lies in the double bed, a conspicuous empty space next to him. He leans over and turns the light out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIRCUS - FIFTH FLOOR - ALLELINE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
A HAND removes files from the LARGE SAFE.

<DIRECTION>
P.O.V. MYSTERY MAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... TRACKING through the near-empty offices. All the drawers of the desks are OPEN. BINS on the tables. A few mothers working late, illuminated by their desk lamps. One of them is applying lipstick, prior to leaving. She doesn't react as we track by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OPTICIANS - SPRING DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are looking at large blurred LETTERS. A lens is slotted into our frame and the letters leap into BOLD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley is in a chair, being fitted for spectacles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OPTICIANS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley is selecting frames from a display. He tries on a pair, watched by a bored shop assistant, used to the pedantic ways of the retired.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIRCUS - GROUND-FLOOR LOBBY - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRACKING with the BRIEFCASE as the mystery man walks towards the main entrance. The ELDERLY PORTER- BRYANT - nods respectfully.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LONDON UNDERGROUND - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A packed train - Businessmen in bowler hats, long-haired seventies youth - the old and the new bumping underneath the city. We track low level until we find our MYSTERY MAN, the BRIEFCASE clutched in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAFE HOUSE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tracking with the BRIEFCASE as it is carried towards the house...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAFE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An elderly lady - MRS McCRAIG - stands at the sink. Through the window she catches a glimpse of the Mystery Man's legs passing, the briefcase in his hand as he walks up the steps towards the front door. Calmly she dries her hands as the doorbell rings and her DOG begins to bark furiously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAFE HOUSE - GROUND FLOOR - NIGHT

Mrs McCraig opens the door and the figure passes her and the barking dog without a word and begins to walk up the stairs...

<DIRECTION>
INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley adds a LETTER to a pile on the mantelpiece. We see the letters are all addressed to ANN SMILEY.

<DIRECTION>
He straightens up, finds himself staring at a PAINTING on the wall - a muddy abstract.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAFE HOUSE - MEETING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is almost bare - two chairs at a small table on which stands two desk lamps and a CAMERA. The Mystery Man has crossed to the wall by the window and opens the GRILL on an AIR DUCT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SAFE HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From across the street a tall good-looking man - POLYAKOV - watches as the opened duct spills a star pattern of light out into the night air. He walks towards the house...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAFE HOUSE - MEETING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Mystery man settles at the table, sorting through the contents of the briefcase as, from down below, we hear the sound of the door bell, the dog barking and footsteps on the stairs. Polyakov walks into the room and joins the Mystery Man at the small table. He picks up the camera with a smile.

EXT. LACON'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lights glowing in the early morning gloom, an ultra-modern cube of a building sits in rather traditional grounds. This is the unlikely home of Oliver Lacon, Permanent under- secretary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. LACON'S HOUSE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we watch a young girl - JACKIE LACON - appears at the living room window in her night-dress, playing with a toy. As we watch her we hear stealthy footsteps approach. Then a MAN steps into frame, his back to us, watching the girl through the window. He taps on the glass with one hand. Jackie looks up, surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we pull back a little we see the man has his other hand behind his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And in it is a long, bone-handled KNIFE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind Jackie we see a string bean of a man, OLIVER LACON, tying his silk dressing gown as he cautiously approaches the window. On the other side, the intruder stands, smoking.

PETER GUILLAM walks down a corridor. Handsome, boyish, bored. He hears a TRING behind him. It's Haydon, one foot up on his pedal, scootering along the corridor. Guillam waits for him. He likes this man.

Guillam sits at his desk over a pile of paper-work, slowly falling asleep.

Guillam enters the kitchen, notes the single place set for dinner. It dawns on him that he really has invaded Smiley's privacy.

<DIRECTION>
INT. LACON'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PULLING OLIVER LACON as he leads Smiley and Guillam down the hall, gesturing for his WIFE to take Jackie away. He attempts some social niceties, but his tone is strained.
</DIRECTION>
<LACON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And how are you George? Missing one's work, one's buddies?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LACON>
<SMILEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I think I manage pretty well, thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMILEY>
<DIRECTION>
They reach a large room, minimalist apart from a grand piano framed by vast glass windows. A tall, well built young man - FAWN - stands on guard. Lacon gestures to him and Fawn opens the french windows and he and Guillam walk out onto the terrace beyond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them, unnoticed, young JACKIE creeps back into the room and slips behind the sofa.
</DIRECTION>
<LACON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your wife, the lovely Ann? She's in the pink, and so on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LACON>
<SMILEY>

<DIRECTION>
(Beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

Fawn closes the french doors behind him and Lacon is suddenly all business.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know this man Tarr?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LACON>
<SMILEY>
<DIRECTION>
(Mildly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I recruited him actually. In Penang. Good with women. Likes to talk. What did he say to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMILEY>
<LACON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said he had some intelligence for Control. Had no idea he was dead. The news obviously hadn't reached Wonga Wonga land. Then he said he would only tell it to someone outside the Circus. If he couldn't have a Minister, he would settle for the Under-secretary. Lucky me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LACON>
<DIRECTION>
Lacon lights a cigarette, smokes a moment, building up to something. Smiley waits him out. The room has become very still.
</DIRECTION>
<LACON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He said there's a mole. Right at the top of the Circus. And that he's been there for years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LACON>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley absorbs this. The moment is suddenly broken by a few stray notes from the piano. The two jump slightly and turn to where Jackie sits at the keyboard, smiling triumphantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LACON'S HOUSE - TERRACE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley and Lacon stand on the terrace alone. Lacon glances anxiously at Smiley, trying to read him.
</DIRECTION>
<LACON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was sad to see you go, George. I thought it was shabby, very shabby. But the Minister agreed with Sir Percy. New broom, clean sweep, wheat from the chaff and all that. And to be fair, Percy has had some marvellous results since you and Control left...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LACON>
<DIRECTION>
Realizing how this sounds, he glances at Smiley to see how much damage he's caused.
</DIRECTION>
<LACON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anyway, it does mean you're rather ideally placed to look into this matter for us now, doesn't it? Outside the family?

<DIRECTION>
Smiley looks blandly back at him.
</DIRECTION>
<SMILEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am retired, Oliver.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMILEY>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Lacon looks uncomfortable, something he hasn't yet said.
</DIRECTION>
<LACON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thing is, some time back, when Control was still alive, he came to me with a similar suggestion.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LACON>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley looks at him, surprised.

</SMILEY>
<LACON>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid I thought his paranoia had got the better of him and he was pulling his own house down. That does happen in your business. And that bloody mess in Budapest...

Smiley stares out over the rolling countryside, inscrutable.

	I'll keep Peter Guillam. And there's a retired special branch man. Mendel. I'd like to have him.

Lacon exhales, his relief palpable.
</DIRECTION>
<LACON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, yes. Do your own housekeeping. Good man.

He glances back at Guillam and Lacon's daughter, picking out a melody on the grand piano.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MENDEL'S GARDEN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON A COLONY OF BEES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GLOVED HANDS loading a COLONY OF BEES into a new HIVE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An APIARIST, in protective hat and gloves, turns to examine the MAN who has appeared in his back yard - GEORGE SMILEY. Smiley raises a hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Apiarist steps away from the hive and removes his hat to reveal a long thin face, keen eyes - INSPECTOR MENDEL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MENDEL'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mendel, now in an overcoat and carrying a battered briefcase, climbs into the back of the car with a nod to Smiley and Guillam in the front. He begins to roll a cigarette as Guillam drives away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A stow-away BEE appears from somewhere and begins to buzz around the car. Guillam and Mendel swat at it clumsily. Smiley stares ahead in silence. He winds down the window and the bee flies to safety.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOTEL ISLAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A shabby rooming house, near Paddington station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large, faded floral monstrosity of a room. TWO single beds, a large leather CHAIR, a WIRELESS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley's new landlady MRS POPE GRAHAM is supervising a gormless teenager - NORMAN - who is struggling into the room with a rickety card table. Mendel and Guillam take it from him and set it into the room. From the next room comes the unmistakable sounds of someone having sex.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_POPE_GRAHAM>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Georgian, I shouldn't lend it to you but since Mister Mendel recommends you...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMILEY'S P.O.V.

<DIRECTION>
... looking out at rooftops opposite and a travel agents sign which reads THE WIDE WORLD.

	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_POPE_GRAHAM>
<DIRECTION>
And they leave. A small silence...
</DIRECTION>
<MENDEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Her real name is plain Graham. Added the Pope for a touch of class.

Guillam gives a grunt of amusement.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Best informant I ever had.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MENDEL>
<DIRECTION>
LATER:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley has turned his attention to the bed. He examines the stained sheets with distaste. As he speaks he strips off the soiled sheet and replaces it with a clean one from his bag.
</DIRECTION>
<SMILEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Control lived with his sister didn't he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMILEY>
<DIRECTION>
He straightens up from the bed, smooths the pristine sheet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mendel flips his notebook back. He's already there.
</DIRECTION>
<MENDEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Basingstoke. Not much of a paper- trail as you can imagine. His pension and she owns a block of bedsits in her own name in West London.

Guillam is lying on the bed. Smiley stands at the window, Mendel slumped in an armchair.

EXT. CONTROL'S FLAT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guillam and Smiley approach outside a red-brick mansion block of flats in West London.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL'S FLAT - HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley and Guillam reach a flat near the shadowy top of the building. Smiley studies the door. He runs his fingers over the door-frame and there it is - a little WEDGE at the top.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL'S FLAT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guillam, followed by Smiley, pushes in against a mound of dead mail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They advance cautiously into the dirty flat, the windows fogged out with Windowlene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR P.O.V. - TRACKING TOWARDS THE DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guillam has reached the DOOR and disappears into the room beyond...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONTROL'S FLAT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A green velvet armchair sits at the centre of a room. Beside it an ashtray over-loaded with stubs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rest of the room is mounded with PILES AND PILES OF PAPERS - files, document boxes, maps and charts, something insane in the sprawl of it all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guillam stands with his back to us staring at a CHESS SET laid out before the chair, as if in mid-game. Four of the chess pieces have had PHOTOGRAPHS of FACES added to them - ROY BLAND. TOBY ESTERHASE. PERCY ALLELINE. BILL HAYDON - all wearing paper PARTY HATS. The effect is ridiculous and a little disturbing, like some Surrealist objet d'art.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guillam hears Smiley and turns, almost guiltily, and as he moves we see there is a FIFTH PHOTOGRAPH on a piece - and it is of Smiley himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley stares at his image.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIRCUS - TOBY ESTERHASE'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Toby Esterhase is on the telephone, speaking softly in Hungarian. A look crosses his face. He suddenly notices Haydon in the doorway, cup of tea in hand. Esterhase asks the caller to hold and places the handset on the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<TOBY_ESTERHASE>
	<DIALOGUE>

Bill leaves, and Toby resumes the call.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ROOF OF THE CIRCUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Alleline stands on the rooftop, staring out over the London skyline, his expression ambiguous - perhaps obscurely troubled to have found himself at the top. He becomes aware of Roy Bland standing behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLELINE>
<DIRECTION>
(Without turning)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLELINE>
<BLAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the Yanks. They want to come in and talk.

</BLAND>
<DIRECTION>
Alleline continues to stare out over the world, but allows himself a small smile of triumph - and relief.
</DIRECTION>
<ALLELINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course they do. We have Witchcraft. And they don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALLELINE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOTEL ISLAY - SMILEY'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mendel and Guillam carry in boxes, each overflowing with files and bundles of yellowing papers.
</DIRECTION>
<SMILEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you. Anywhere will do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMILEY>
<DIRECTION>
They dump the files and Smiley turns to survey his room. In his hand he is toying with a black chess piece labelled "KARLA".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The far wall is now stacked to the ceiling with the contents of Control's room - thousands of files and documents, piled in no logical order. The three survey the mountain of information in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<MENDEL>
<DIRECTION>
(Wryly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That enough for you to be getting on with?
	</DIALOGUE>

</SMILEY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIRCUS - SCALPHUNTERS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The "Scalphunters" floor. Guillam is in his office, painted out panels below the waist, glass above. He sits, hands on the desk, steeling himself for what he has to do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abruptly he stands and walks out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We TRACK with him as he walks through the Scalphunters "quad" area - a worn out sofa, the old pool table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the Scalphunters - KASPAR - stands flirting with a pretty SECRETARY - BELINDA - the "Deb" we saw earlier. Guillam acknowledges them casually as he passes. The girl gives a little wave. She LIKES him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kaspar stares after Guillam. He doesn't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We continue tracking with Guillam as he leaves the Scalphunters area, walks down the corridor, turns left into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIRCUS - MEN'S ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands at the basins, checking the room is clear. Examines his watch, then crosses to the door and opens it a crack, peering out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GUILLAM'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're looking though a glass panelled door at the PERSONNEL OFFICE. A dapper little man in a club tie - FAWLEY - sits behind his desk, idly tapping a desk toy - a Newton's Cradle. He too checks his watch. Lunch time. Gets up and walks out of his office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guillam counts to ten under his breath and then abruptly, walks out of the men's room, across the corridor and into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIRCUS - FAWLEY'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Cradle is still swinging - steel balls clacking softly. Guillam is opening a safe, pulling out documents, photographing them with a SUBMINIATURE CAMERA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close on the documents as Guillam silently photographs them.
</DIRECTION>
<SMILEY>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to see the records of staff recently retired. While you're there get the handbook on staff duties... and the diagram of the Circus's reorganization under Alleline...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMILEY>
<DIRECTION>
Guillam hears a voice outside. He draws a SMALL KNIFE from his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIRCUS - FAWLEY'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kaspar opens the door and walks in, finding... the office empty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then a faint noise. He works his way around the desk, finds Guillam crouched down, his back to him.
</DIRECTION>
<KASPAR>
<DIRECTION>
(Suspicious)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry Peter, didn't know you were doing... whatever you were doing...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KASPAR>
<DIRECTION>
Guillam straightens up to reveal his hand oozing blood from a cut.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER_GUILLAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Trying not to bleed to death. Fawley's got a first aid kit in one of his drawers. Get me a plaster will you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER_GUILLAM>
<DIRECTION>
Kaspar busies himself with the first-aid. Eyes hard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIRCUS - LIFTS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guillam has just stepped into the lift. Roy Bland appears suddenly and steps in beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Silence for a moment as they descend...
</DIRECTION>
<ROY_BLAND>
<DIRECTION>
(without looking at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heard you had an accident.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY_BLAND>
<DIRECTION>
Guillam makes a mental note against Kaspar.

</PETER_GUILLAM>
<ROY_BLAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll have a word with Esterhase, Peter. We'll make it a priority on the top floor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROY_BLAND>

They arrive on the ground floor. Bland walks out ahead. Guillam exhales with relief. Then...

	Smothered by the Mothers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER_GUILLAM>
<ROY_BLAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something like that. Those old birds, all pining for Control. Percy still can't get a decent cup of tea out of them. Still, I imagine it takes time.

<PETER_GUILLAM>
	<DIALOGUE>

He reaches suddenly for Guillam's coat, lying on the seat - his hand heading for the pocket that holds the SUBMINIATURE CAMERA.

He pushes his cigarettes into Bland's hand before he can fish in the coat. Bland smokes for a moment.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER_GUILLAM>
<ROY_BLAND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Datsuns. Just got one. Wife made me. Hatchback. Caught sight of myself in it, driving past a shop window and I thought to myself "Who's that old fucker?"

He stares at Guillam with faint smile, but his eyes are cold and watchful.

INT. GUILLAM'S FLAT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guillam sits alone at the table reading a newspaper. After a moment, a man, his lover - RICHARD - a decade or so older - walks behind him, stroking his hair tenderly, and joins him at the table. Guillam automatically checks the window - the flat opposite, a lit window - could someone see them? He gets up and closes the curtains, settles back at the table, passing Richard a section of the paper. The two sit in domestic contentment, reading.

The music - a CHARLIE RICH track - plays on a TRANSISTOR RADIO. Smiley sits at the window listening to the MUSIC.

	Jerry Westerby, dismissed December 4th. And... Connie Sachs, retired November 28th. That's just two weeks after you and Control were forced out.

Smiley considers this, turns back to the CHESS SET. He writes Connie's name on a slip of paper, pastes it to a chess piece.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a knock at the door. Mendel lets LACON into the room excluding a very excited MRS. POPE GRAHAM. Lacon's wearing a tux, looking extremely uncomfortable, almost offended at the role he finds himself playing.

He writes PRIDEAUX on a slip of paper, pastes it to a chess piece. Lacon picks up another file, Something catches his eye: a letter head of FLAMES. He looks up shocked.

	How did you get this? This is Witchcraft material.

He grabs the piece of paper, stuffing it in his pocket.

INT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A third-rate English preparatory school. The string orchestra practice - rows of twelve-year old boys sawing away at their instruments. A teacher winces as he hacks at the air above their heads with a ruler.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Near the back of the class we find BILL ROACH. He's plump, asthmatic, the last to be chosen for everything. He looks out of the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roach stares out at us as the rain lashes against the window pane. As we watch an old blue Alvis, towing a battered, second hand CARAVAN, appears - reflected in the window - driving past.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roach watches, thrilled to realise he is the sole witness of this MYSTERIOUS NEW ARRIVAL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - PRIDEAUX'S CARAVAN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We're looking down into the dip, at the DRIVER of the blue Alvis, setting up his caravan on bricks, in the gloom and rain. He's wearing a waterproof cape and hood, obscuring his face, giving him something of an air of mystery and menace. There's something odd about the way he moves, something about his back, as if it's been knocked out of true...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Driver rocks the caravan from side to side, loading bricks underneath, trying to get the thing level.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He senses something and turns to find Roach behind him. Roach instinctively takes a step back from the hooded figure. Then, gathering his courage, he holds out his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In his palm, a MARBLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roach stands in the caravan, watching the MARBLE as it rolls backwards and forwards on the windowsill - an improvised spirit level. THE MARBLE comes to rest at the centre of the sill, a temporary equilibrium.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roach turns excitedly to the camera, about to call to the Driver, but sees something that stops him in his tracks...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Driver has stopped, his back to us, breathing hard, perhaps from the exercise or perhaps fighting down some pain. The wind catches at his cape and it flutters to one side, revealing the sweat-soaked shirt beneath. As we watch a DARK STAIN appears at his shoulder blade and begins to spread. It's BLOOD.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. LONDON - OFF LICENSE - DAY

EXT. CONNIE'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large dilapidated Victorian house. We hear the faint sound of voices and pop music coming from the garden.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley pushes open the gate, walks down the path, past over- grown shrubbery until he reaches the door with a bell marked "SACHS."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Glancing sideways he is caught, entranced, by the sight of a young couple kissing in the window. They turn, suddenly aware of his presence and Smiley, embarrassed, continues walking round the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMILEY'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A group of students in togas are rehearsing a musical version of Lysistrata. A young woman, holding her script, is miming to the song `Don't' by Doris.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An older woman wearing rather too much make-up is carrying a prop. This is CONNIE SACHS - former Queen of Intelligence at the Circus. She examines Smiley for a moment, and then breaks into a charming smile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SMILEY'S EXPRESSION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is not a social call. Connie can't keep the disappointment from her face.

INT. CONNIE'S HOUSE - DRAWING ROOM - DAY

Connie slows the images down, concentrating... OFFICIALS in suits are walking into their designated places. We see POLYAKOV amongst them.

One of the old SOVIET VETERANS, in dress uniform, a chest full of medals, possibly a touch senile, LOOKS at him. Just before he is obscured by another official we see what the old veteran does.

He salutes Polyakov.

EXT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - PLAYING FIELDS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Prideaux is running around the track, pounding along with his odd, loping stride. A group of BOYS watch him pass. One - SPIKELEY - mimics the run to the amusement of the others.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fire burns in the little grate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROACH sits near the back of the class. The BOY behind slaps the back of his neck with a ruler. Roach flinches but doesn't say anything. The Boy does it again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Prideaux drops a pile of books onto the desk of a boy - SPIKELY.
</DIRECTION>
<PRIDEAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hand those out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIDEAUX>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses to the board begins to write on it - JE M'APPELLE MONSIEUR ELL...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him Spikely hands out the books, continuing to walk like a HUNCHBACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The class snigger. Prideaux hears but doesn't turn, continues writing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then from the CHIMNEY comes an unnerving SCRABBLING sound. A little soot falls...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sniggering fades out as all eyes turn nervously to the fire... what is that noise?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, with a terrifying SCREECH, an OWL drops down into the grate, thrashes in the flames before flapping out into the class, its wings now ON FIRE, shrieking hideously, headed straight for Spikely who stands frozen in shock as the bird swoops towards his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... somehow, Prideaux is THERE and grabs the burning bird from the air and in a second has it folded in on itself, NECK SNAPPED, and strides out of the room with it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys stare after their new teacher in SHOCKED SILENCE.
</DIRECTION>

EXT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - PRIDEAUX'S CARAVAN - DAY

	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
The boy's eyes start to MIST UP. Prideaux looks down, busies himself with brushing at something on his shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<PRIDEAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a good watcher though eh? Us loners always are. No one else spotted me when I turned up here. Best watcher in the unit, Bill Roach is, I'll bet. Long as he's got his specs on. Right?

Roach sets off up the dip. He looks back and sees Prideaux has walked into the caravan and stands with his back to him, rubbing his aching shoulder.

EXT. ISTANBUL - AIRPORT - DAY - PAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ricki Tarr emerges blinking into the white sunshine. Groomed, smart, that same restless energy. A car pulls up across the road TUFTY THESINGER - a boiled-looking British spy, not over-bright, signals to him. Tarr pulls his shades down and saunters over to his ride.
</DIRECTION>
<RICKI_TARR>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	I met her in Istanbul. They'd found some Russian trade delegate, name of Boris. He was spending high and wide in the nightclubs and some idiot thought we could turn him.

Nineteenth century European grandeur. But the apartment we're in is deserted and in a state of disrepair. Tarr stands at tripod mounted BINOCULARS set back from the window, idly playing with a knife with a distinctive white BONE handle.

EXT. ISTANBUL - IRINA'S HOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

TARR'S P.O.V. - the HOTEL opposite - a Brutalist concrete slab, the rooms have floor to ceiling windows. In the bedroom a heavy set man - BORIS - is having sex with a MAID.

We TRACK to one side, and see the "drawing room" of the hotel suite, where Boris' two MINDERS, SERGEI and IVAN, wait, smirking at the sounds coming from the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>

	He had a wife with him. Common- law.

</RICKI_TARR>
<DIRECTION>
Irina opens the door and walks into the drawing room, where the Minders stare fixedly at the floor, trying not to laugh. She walks on past and into the bedroom. The Maid jumps out of the bed, grabs her clothes and flees. Boris lies, unconcerned, reaches for his cigarettes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irina walks past him and we track with her as she enters a BATHROOM. The glass window here is two-thirds frosted and we lose her as she bends over a basin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something about her has caught Tarr's attention and he leaves the binoculars, walking closer to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly IRINA straightens up, her head above the frosted glass and stares straight at us...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ISTANBUL - TARR'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
HER P.O.V. -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RICKI TARR standing at the window opposite, knowing he should turn away, but somehow snagged by that look.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moment between the two. Then a car sweeps past on the road below and there's a flash of light behind Ricki's head - the headlights reflected in the lenses of the now visible BINOCULARS. Irina absorbs this. Above everything else, anger at her humiliation being observed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ISTANBUL - IRINA'S HOTEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RICKI TARR'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As Irina walks back out of the bathroom, picks up a vase and hurls it at Boris, just missing him. He stubs out his cigarette and calmly climbs out of the bed. As we watch he draws the curtains along the length of the room, obscuring our view. Seconds later the curtains billow as Irina is thrown against them. We watch as her shape is rolled along the window by the force of Boris' blows. Finally the billowing fabric settles. Moments later Boris opens the curtains again and starts to dress. Irina lies on the bed.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
IRINA'S P.O.V. - Her husband and the Minders are heading for a row of gaudy nightclubs. And someway behind him, Ricki Tarr, trailing.

She exhales a breath on the glass.

INT. ISTANBUL - NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A drunk Boris groping a very young hostess on a dance floor, his shirt undone. He starts to strip the girl of her uniform, amused by her efforts to keep her clothes on. The two minders clap in time to the music, encouraging him. Boris grabs the girl by the hair, biting her neck, laughing, eyes glazed with drink, barely able to stand... The inane music blares on...

A tense Tarr sits waiting for a reply. It's dark outside. Thesinger is asleep at his desk. The TICKER MACHINE begins to rattle into life. Tarr jumps to it.

Tarr begins to decode the in-coming message on a one-time pad.

The door is ajar... a radio is playing LOUD POP MUSIC. Tarr pauses on the threshold, senses alert. He takes out his KNIFE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ISTANBUL - IMPORT/EXPORT OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A fan stirs the dusty air. Tarr walks in and stops. Tufty lies on the floor, in a pool of blood. He's been tortured, one eye gouged out. The other manages to convey a rather touching amazement at the violence worked on him. His throat has been slit wide open. Tarr absorbs this, looks at the knife in his own hand, turns and runs.

Irina enters the hotel room. She stops a moment, afraid. Then she looks towards us.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BATHROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Irina is backing out of the room. We catch a glimpse of the BUTCHERED REMAINS of BORIS hanging from the shower rail, a garroting wire around his neck. He's been tortured, the shower curtain used to catch the pooling blood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She BACKS AWAY across the room to the door, leaving a trail of bloody footprints on the pale carpet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to the door, looks out of the SPY HOLE.
</DIRECTION>

Her P.O.V. - two men, TINY DISTORTED FIGURES walking down the corridor towards her.

The phone starts to RING. Irina glances at it, knowing it's too late for her.

TARR'S P.O.V. - behind glass panels - a glimpse of three men wheeling a gurney - a bandaged figure upon it. Just before the figure disappears, a hand moves a little...

Tarr watches Irina's departure, sick with guilt.

Alleline sits in his baronial chair, alone in the room. He looks what he is. A man who knows he's OUT OF HIS DEPTH.

Smiley threads his way through the party, walking amongst his colleagues, enjoying himself... Jerry Westerby and Connie Sachs are arm in arm, singing along to a song - "The Second Worst Spy in the World." They link Smiley to them for a verse, others joining in around them. The song segues into the Russian National Anthem. The crowd sing lustily, many of them Russian-speaking, enjoying the chance to sing with vigour.

<DIRECTION>
Smiley walks on. Behind him the song ends to be replaced by the CHARLIE RICH song we heard earlier.

His P.O.V. -

- One of the larger Mothers doubled up with laughter, pulling a cracker with a flushed TOBY ESTERHASE, hopelessly outweighed, but competitive to the finish.
</DIRECTION>

- ROY BLAND with his plain wife, eyeing one of the pretty debs as she dances by. A mother takes Smiley by the hand and leads him briefly into the dance. Smiley takes a turn with her, and extricates himself. Still smiling...

Polished shoes appear as they reach the floor, then the uniform trousers of a short man. A self-important JANITOR.

INT. CIRCUS - ARCHIVE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The LIFT CAGE we saw earlier is being raised from the floor by a Janitor at the winch. Another janitor is removing files from it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Radiating out from the lift cage are the shelves of files that make up the reading room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We find Guillam moving along the shelves reading the fluorescent number cards. He takes a file out, leaving his green slip in the brackets provided by each file. Guillam looks across at his real objective...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A row of anonymous looking files on the next aisle - the archived DUTY OFFICER'S LOG-BOOKS, spines bearing the year and month they cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And in his way - a GIRL perched on a ladder, a MAN mending a radiator. The Man turns round and stares straight at Guillam. Suddenly he POINTS STRAIGHT AT HIM. For a moment Guillam freezes, unnerved. Then he glances over his shoulder and realises the Man is communicating with another WORKMAN behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Abruptly, Guillam walks over to the file and swaps it, keeping the title close to his chest. He goes back to his desk, a light film of sweat on his forehead.

One of the Mothers is listening routinely in on the call, TAPE SPOOLS revolving, recording the conversation. The POP TUNE plays, insidiously working its way into her head. She idly taps her pen along to the tune.

Alwyn goes back to his post. Guillam, still hugging the phone, takes out a BEIGE file from his bag and switches it with the one against his chest. He takes an address book from the bag and finds a number.

Guillam takes the green slip and hands it to Sal, who signs it and puts it on its spike. Guillam turns.

A moment, while the room digests this. A relaxation of the tension, as if he's passed some kind of test.

INT. CIRCUS - CORRIDOR - DAY

Guillam is walking to the lifts, we note he is now carrying his BAG. Behind him ROY BLAND is walking down the corridor. He peels off, turning left, humming a tune to himself - the same POP SONG that was playing at the garage in the background of Guillam's call. Guillam reacts as he keeps on walking, trying to work out if this MEANS SOMETHING. We track with him as his anger and PARANOIA grow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GARAGE - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Guillam drives down an alleyway full speed, screeches to a halt as he reaches a group of children playing, edges past them and on into the car body repair shop. He gets and strides past the elderly GERMAN MECHANIC we saw earlier.

	Hello, Mister Guillam, sorry I took so long to come back.

Guillam punches him in the face, drags him from the chair, the two struggling.

Behind them Smiley and Fawn appear. Smiley watches coolly for a moment then signals Fawn, who drags Guillam off Tarr, expertly pinning his arm.

	What about the money?

</PETER_GUILLAM>
<SMILEY>

	Thirty thousand isn't so much for Karla to pay if it protects his Mole. I'm afraid someone in the Circus knows all about Mister Tarr and is doing everything they can to discredit him.

Guillam takes the log book from Smiley, runs a thumb down the razored edge of the missing page. He notices some writing on the next page.

He makes a vague "Etcetera" gesture, stares at...

Silence. Smiley sits back, dropping the game.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Never said a word. Not one word. Next morning he got back on his plane, gave the pack of cigarettes back to me, untouched - this was a chain-smoker, mind - and flew off to what he presumed would be his death. He kept my lighter. It was a gift - "To George, from Ann. All my love."

Guillam is still staring at the chair, a little awe-struck.

<DIRECTION>
He notices the way Guillam is staring at him and his smile fades.

RICHARD, bewildered and upset, is packing his belongings. He walks past Guillam, stops.

Guillam doesn't say anything. Richard puts the flat keys on the side table and leaves.

EXT. THURSGOOD SCHOOL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Prideaux's BLUE ALVIS bumps and jolts towards us across the playing fields, an exhilarated ROACH at the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<ROACH>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROACH>

Prideaux and the rest of the class stand at the "finishing line," but Prideaux is staring down to a line of beech- trees, where a MAN is walking. It's MENDEL.

	Don't know sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROACH>
<PRIDEAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is he? Beggarman? Thief? Why doesn't he look this way? Wouldn't you look if you saw a bunch of boys flogging a car around a field? Doesn't he like boys? Anyone sees him again, let me know. Don't hold with odd bods hanging about. Might steal the Alvis, which is...?

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIRCUS - SCALPHUNTERS - POOL TABLE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Belinda, the deb we met earlier, is doing up her blouse. She's teary and also a little excited that men are fighting over her.
</DIRECTION>
<BELINDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop it! Stop it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELINDA>
<DIRECTION>
KASPAR has Guillam pinned against the wall and is punching him. Guillam accepts the blows with a bloody grin. Something of the school yard fight about it, as the other Scalphunters gather around, ostensibly to break it, up but clearly enjoying the distraction. One of them is trying to pull Kaspar off and, caught by a blow, joins in - the fight escalating as others join in the struggle.
</DIRECTION>
<KASPAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep your bloody hands off her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KASPAR>
<DIRECTION>
He kicks at Guillam, who falls. Belinda gives a shriek of alarm.
</DIRECTION>
<SCALPHUNTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ's sake, don't fight over a bit of skirt!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCALPHUNTER>
<DIRECTION>
Guillam lies on the floor taking another kick, but his face, turned to us, registers only relief. Job done.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CASINO - DAY

Bright morning sunshine. Smiley and Guillam walk up concrete steps of a casino building - very modern, imposing.
</DIRECTION>

INT. CASINO - CASINO FLOOR - DAY

Smiley, Guillam and the genial JERRY WESTERBY are sat at a blackjack table. The casino is empty, a cleaner vacuums in the background.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY_WESTERBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But that's the way it is, George, isn't it? When you're out, you're out. Too much of this stuff.

	</DIALOGUE>
</SMILEY>
<DIRECTION>
Westerby looks at them both.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY_WESTERBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Control asked me to man the phones that night. Said someone was doing a special job for the service. He wanted someone from outside he could trust. If anything came in, I was to tell him and only him.

Westerby walks down the corridor. We pass OFFICES - drawers pulled open, waste paper bins standing on desks - the end of day ritual.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIRCUS - DUTY OFFICERS ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Westerby is following a horse race on the radio. A dirty plate in front of him. He drinks from a can of beer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIRCUS - DUTY OFFICERS ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Westerby is asleep. The Circus is deathly quiet, nothing stirring. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PHONE BEGINS TO RING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIRCUS - CONTROL'S OFFICE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Control sits surrounded by files. A dim green lamp on his desk the only illumination. He looks ill, tense with waiting. Cigarette stubs piled in the ashtray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He listens to the solitary PHONE below him in the building. Then it is joined by a SECOND. Then a THIRD...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Control listens, nerves stretched to their limit. From just outside - the sound of someone running up the wooden staircase. A knock.
</DIRECTION>
<JERRY_WESTERBY>
<DIRECTION>
(Entering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Been a bit of a panic, sir.

<DIRECTION>
LATER:

Westerby watches Haydon on the phone from the door. Haydon listens to a voice for a moment, then hangs up. He stands, his back to Westerby.

	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL_HAYDON>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRIDEAUX'S FLAT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Haydon walks around the neat rooms. A bike up on the wall, a pair of muddy climbing boots on a newspaper, waiting to be cleaned. Haydon walks past a shelf - photographs and books. He stops, picks up an unframed black and white snap from the shelf. It's a picture of HIMSELF.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Haydon stands with his back to us, possibly crying. Westerby turns thoughtfully away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LONDON - WIMPY - NIGHT

Smiley and Guillam sit eating side by side at a bar, Smiley examining the hamburger - his first - doubtfully. Guillam is thinking about what he's just been told.

	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
EXT. LONDON STREETS - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A black Cab pulls up at the lights. Another black cab pulls alongside it. The two drivers acknowledge each other, chatting as the lights change to RED, but in no hurry to move.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An impatient woman passenger flicks a look at the passenger in the opposite cab, wanting to share this moment of passenger outrage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see ALLELINE'S profile staring stonily ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We follow his cab as it peels off into a FAMILIAR street, driving towards the house where we met Polyakov.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HAMPSTEAD PONDS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley slips into the water. It's late afternoon. Very still and calm. Very few swimmers. Smiley's head breaks the surface, dips in, breaks the surface...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HAMPSTEAD PONDS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley sits on a platform with his back to us, drying off from his swim, looking out over the water. A MAN'S HEAD appears, swimming up to the platform through the reeds. An old QUEEN, his face almost purple with the cold. He clings to the edge of the platform for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<OLD_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just in case it's of interest, dear. We are observed. Old Filth in the bushes. Not very subtle but there you are...

He swims away. The wind lifts up a little, rustling the trees and bushes around the pond. We stay on Smiley, watched and alone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley walks into his hallway, picks up the MAIL piled on the floor. He crosses to the drawing room, still looking at the mail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door is a little ajar and through the opening we catch a FLASH of movement in the room beyond - a COUPLE in a passionate embrace, glimpsed for a moment before they disappear out of sight. We can hear what may be their love- making. And a RECORD IS PLAYING. The same CHARLIE RICH track Smiley reacted to in the Islay Hotel.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley stares at the mail in his hand as if unwilling to look up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes open the door and moves into...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SMILEY'S HOUSE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... which is EMPTY. He sits in an armchair, starts opening some letters.
</DIRECTION>

A FIGURE walks past Smiley abruptly. Smiley doesn't look up.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good flight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL_HAYDON>

BILL HAYDON sits in the armchair opposite in shirt and trousers, SOCKS, NO SHOES. He sips a cup of tea. No sense of having been caught in an act of adultery.

	Awful daub really but Ann expressed a liking... What's keeping her?

We hold on Smiley but hear Haydon leave the room, a WHISPERED CONFERENCE in the hall between Haydon and Ann.

Roach wipes his eyes and leaves. As soon as the door is closed Prideaux crawls under the little chest of drawers, grimacing with pain, working an arm further in...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a FAINT SOUND - SOMEONE ON THE STEPS OUTSIDE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a final effort Prideaux rips his RIFLE free from its hiding place, still trailing tape, and rolls to face the door, gun in hand. Silence. Then...
</DIRECTION>

A KNOCK AT THE DOOR. Prideaux aims the gun...
</DIRECTION>

The door opens...

INT. CONTROL'S FLAT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The flat Smiley visited. Control leads Prideaux into the same room - the green armchair, surrounded by mounds of files and papers, over-flowing ashtrays, the detritus of an obsession. The FIVE PHOTOGRAPHS of FACES fixed to the CHESS PIECES before him.

Control, a walking corpse, lowers himself into the armchair, motions Prideaux to take another seat.

INT. BUDAPEST - TRAIN STATION - DAY - PAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Prideaux climbs off his train and walks down the platform towards us. He pauses for a moment, drawing a Hungarian newspaper from his pocket. As he does so he glances at the other passengers walking past him. TWO WOMEN and a MAN, all apparently travelling alone, the SHOES they're wearing - BROWN SUEDE BOOTS, FUR LINED BLACK PLASTIC BOOTS and the man - a pair of BLACK GALOSHES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Prideaux walks on, tapping the paper against his leg.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUDAPEST - GALERIA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scene from the opening of the film. The Waiter puts down Prideaux's plate, a drop of sweat from his forehead hitting the table. He looks at the droplet, fakes a smile for the Magyar, looks after the Waiter, scans the floor around him...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS P.O.V. - There it is - one of the women is wearing the BLACK PLASTIC BOOTS. Her coat is different and she's wearing a fur hat now - but the shoes are the one thing the surveillance agents don't have time to change.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Prideaux glances up at the apartment windows above, sees the old woman, starts to rise... as we CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SHOT -
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... punching into his back, Prideaux falling forward... as we CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRIDEAUX'S P.O.V.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Those shoes again, stepping in the water and blood on the floor, passing us at eye-level. Grouping and regrouping as the operation comes to an end. The noise in the background comes to us muted and very faint. Faintly, a baby is crying, an ambulance siren is wailing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hands appear and we are rolled onto a stretcher and lifted up to chest level where we seem to FLOAT past the faces of the MAGYAR and the other Officers, smoking cigarettes by the doors, and out towards the open doors of a waiting ambulance.
</DIRECTION>

INT. BUDAPEST - GALERIA - DAY

We are slid into the back of the ambulance as though into the drawers of a morgue. And snap to BLACK.

INT. LUBYANKA PRISON - CELL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are looking at the back of Prideaux's head, hair damp with sweat, shoulders trembling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We PULL OUT and find Prideaux, a filthy dressing covering the wound on his back. The cell he is in has filthy, heavily padded walls, like a straitjacket. From a speaker in the ceiling comes a maddening jagged drone. Lights blaze down...

</PRIDEAUX>
<SMILEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

</SMILEY>
<PRIDEAUX>

INT. LUBYANKA PRISON - CELL - DAY - PAST
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A concrete bunker of a room. Prideaux is standing in a slab of watery sunshine that falls from a sky-light above. He's smoking, trying to control the tremble in his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRIDEAUX P.O.V. - The patch of sunshine only extends a few yards in front of him. The rest of the room is in granite shadow. The sense of other people watching from the shadows. The sound of a door opening and someone being led in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A woman walks across the dark room and into the slab of light, blinking as she does so.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's IRINA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her hair is loose and dishevelled about her face. A man's voice comes from further back in the darkness...
</DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know this woman?

</DIRECTION>
<PRIDEAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know her.

She looks at Prideaux and gives a small polite smile, as though good manners are going to save her.
</DIRECTION>

	I...

<DIRECTION>
A GUARD steps out of the shadows and SHOOTS her in the head, the shot THUNDEROUS in the room. It's horribly unexpected, and Prideaux jerks backward, bewildered and appalled.

He turns back to the tape-deck, puts the headphones on, presses play:

	She said there was a General, work-name Polyakov who was stationed in London. And that Polyakov's real job was to service the mole. He meets him regularly and takes back information the Mole gives him for Karla.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICKI_TARR>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley presses STOP. He presses RE-WIND, watches the tape spool BACKWARDS. He goes too far, presses FAST-FORWARD, watches the tape REVERSE DIRECTION. And, at this moment, we can tell from his expression, a piece of the jig-saw falls into place.

</SMILEY>
<MINISTER>
<DIRECTION>
(Snapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I wouldn't consider that sound advice, after the bloody mess Control left us with. It's taken Alleline - and, if I may say so, myself - this long to get us back into the race.

<SMILEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad you take some of the credit.

</DIRECTION>
<SMILEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The man Alleline and the others meet is called Polyakov. You believe his role is to bring information from Witchcraft to you. His real role is to receive information from the Mole to take back to Karla.

He has the Minister's full attention now. A long silence.
</DIRECTION>
<MINISTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's... that's not possible.

</MINISTER>
<SMILEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Made possible. By you. When he steals our secrets he does it under the very nose of the Circus, in the house which you persuaded the treasury to pay for. I'm sure you'll be able to take full credit for that.

	Witchcraft's intelligence is genuine! It's been gold!

</MINISTER>
<SMILEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just enough glitter, amongst the chicken-feed. Control didn't believe in miracles and he didn't believe in Witchcraft. But you were lazy and you were greedy and so you hounded him out of the Circus and you let Karla in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMILEY>
<DIRECTION>
His voice is still calm, but it's clear what's different now. There's a quiet fury in him. The Minister is ashen.
</DIRECTION>
<MINISTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God... We can't be made to look like fucking fools again! Forget Europe, if we have the black men getting to hear about this on Walla-Wallah News! What if we find the Mole and we move him sideways, some department where he can't do any harm? Is the Kremlin likely to boast about this?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Not in their interests sir. They need the Enemy to look like a threat...

	You've opened negotiations to exchange intelligence with the Americans. What they tell the Circus, they'll be telling the Kremlin. Witchcraft's information, the "gold" Karla let you have? It wasn't to lure you. It was to lure the Americans. Now, do you want to take credit for that?

And yet, when the time came, when it came to picking sides between him and Alleline, you didn't hesitate? Understandable perhaps, with your war experience. You've survived this long, I suppose, because of your ability to change sides, serve any Master?

	Oh, that was nothing personal, George, I hope you understand that? Karla said you were good, the one we had to worry about. But you do have a blind spot. He reckoned if I was known to be Ann's lover you wouldn't be able to see me straight. And he was right, up to a point.

He stops still inside his doorway. The little figure on the console table is in the wrong position. Smiley puts his hand on it, but doesn't right it, listening to something from somewhere inside the house. A faint movement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the HALF OPEN KITCHEN DOOR we catch a glimpse of a WOMAN beyond. ANN is back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley stands with his back to us, still in his coat, staring through the door at his wife beyond. Something of a Vermeer in the image.

He's absorbing the different atmosphere - home. Deciding whether to go in. Or not.

We PASS PERCY ALLELINE and his DRUNK WIFE. Alleline looking fretful and hoping no-one is noticing the scene she is making...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Haydon grins at all his comrades, feeling fond of everyone, but heads on to his destination...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRIDEAUX sits watching him come with a drink towards him, shakes his head, but can't help but smile fondly at the idiot Haydon is prepared to make of himself...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SARRATT - EVENING - PRESENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music continues as we see two cadets are running on the circuit, their white t-shirts only just visible in the dark.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Haydon sits on his bench, smoking, watching them flit by. He smiles to himself, remembering. He senses something, turns and looks back. Prideaux stands in the shadows behind him, some fifteen foot away. The two men stare at each other, then Haydon turns back to watch the runners.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We HOLD CLOSE on his face as Prideaux approaches, the only sound the soft wind and his hushed footsteps growing loser.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally...
</DIRECTION>
<BILL_HAYDON>

(Of the runners)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Just like us Jim.

<DIRECTION>
(Beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Best days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BILL_HAYDON>
<DIRECTION>
A rifle is placed on the side of his head - the same execution shot that we saw used on Irina - the force blowing him sideways out of the frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the music continues we...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SARRATT - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frost on the grass. We find a CADET staring down at the corpse of Haydon leaning against the back of the bench, outlined in silver frost.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The music ends.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PRIDEAUX'S CARAVAN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Prideaux sits on his bed. From outside - the sound of a football game. Someone taps on the door. Low. Taps again. Prideaux, coiled with grief and anger, suddenly gets up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRIDEAUX'S CARAVAN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roach stands in the doorway, carrying a gift - a boot- scrape made in woodwork.
</DIRECTION>
<ROACH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I made you something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROACH>
<DIRECTION>
Prideaux stares at the boot scrape.
</DIRECTION>
<PRIDEAUX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want you hanging around here. Keep away from me from now on. Go and join the others.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIDEAUX>
<DIRECTION>
Roach stands frozen.
</DIRECTION>
<PRIDEAUX>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just bloody join in. Go and play damn you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIDEAUX>
<DIRECTION>
He watches Roach walk to the edge of the field and stand mutely at the side. A ball rolls towards him. Roach goes to kick it. Misses. He tries again, RUNNING OUT OF SHOT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARIS DEPARTMENT STORE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tarr is walking through a busy street. He stops to light a cigarette. A woman in a YELLOW dress appears, reflected in the glass. She's holding the hands of two children. For a moment it looks like Irina.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tarr spins round, but the woman has disappeared. He stares after her, hoping to catch a glimpse of her again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT./INT. CIRCUS - GROUND-FLOOR LOBBY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Smiley walks back into the lobby, hesitates for a moment, then pushes on through the turnstile.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CIRCUS - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George takes his place at the baronial chair. He examines the CHESS PIECE in his hand. We see it is labelled KARLA. He toys with it for a moment, then places it on the table in front of him, clears his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<SMILEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall we begin?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SMILEY>
<DIRECTION>
Through the open door Smiley's new inner circle begin to enter and take their place at the table around him.
