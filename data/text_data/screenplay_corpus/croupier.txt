INT. CASINO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A roulette table. The PUNTERS place their bets. TWELVE PLAYERS, nine men, three women. The FACES of the men, all ages, intense, hopeful, fearful. Which of them is JACK?
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now he had become the still centre of that spinning wheel of misfortune.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN'S hand spins the wheel. The ball is thrown against the spin. Hands, faces, chips...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The world turned round him... leaving him miraculously untouched The little white ball circles the spinning wheel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The PUNTERS'S faces as the ball starts to bounce. All eyes are on the bouncing ball.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The croupier had reached his goal. He no longer heard the sound of the ball.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The back of the CROUPIER'S hand, his slicked-back short hair, razor cut. The CAMERA moves around to his face...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To begin with he was Jack Manfred...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
whistling sound takes Jack back in time.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PUBLISHER'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK is walking through a maze of open-plan partitioned offices. He ls casually but fashionably dressed, hair dyed blond long, a nervous elegance about him, almost unrecognisable from the croupier's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He searches for the right office. He finds it. The name on the open is GILES CREMORNE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GILES' OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GILES CREMORNE, a public schoolboy in his late twenties comes forward and vigorously shakes JACK'S hand. Jacketless, he wears yellow braces. Next to his tidy desk is a slot machine.
</DIRECTION>
<GILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take a pew, Jack. You look well. What's it been, two years since we broke bread?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILES>
<DIRECTION>
GILES has an upper-class accent, but an acquired street manner.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three years, two months. March '93.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<GILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a memory you've got. Maths always was your strong suit. What happened to the moaning Lisa?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She went back to South Africa.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were pretty thick at one time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We all played the field.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
GILES frowns at a memory, an implication. GILES'S mobile phone buzzes. He picks up.
</DIRECTION>
<GILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi-ya... I'll call you back.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now then...

	<DIALOGUE>
	I want a job, Giles.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<GILES>
<DIRECTION>
(cautiously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. As what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILES>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was thinking perhaps I could be a reader. You employ readers, don't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<GILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We do. For unsolicited manuscripts. We pay twenty pounds a manuscript. You might get two, maybe three in a week. Can you live on sixty pounds?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILES>
<DIRECTION>
JACK opens a pack of Gitanes.
</DIRECTION>
<GILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. This is a no-smoking office, Jack. You've written a book, haven't you? I didn't read it myself, but --
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILES>
<DIRECTION>
A WOMAN SECRETARY puts her head into the office.
</DIRECTION>
<GILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me ten minutes, Fiona.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILES>
<DIRECTION>
FIONA puts a fax on GILES'S desk, smiles at JACK, and goes.
</DIRECTION>
<GILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fiona used to read for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILES>
<DIRECTION>
He winks at JACK.
</DIRECTION>
<GILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me tell you about our operation. We like personality authors. People the public recognises. Celebrity's what sells books. We can always find someone to do the writing. First, we need the face. Then the concept.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he is reading the fax)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right now I'm looking for a soccer novel. Something where a tycoon buys a lousy team and takes it to the top. Seven figure transfer fees. Corruption all down the line. Violence on and off the pitch. Steroids. Got any concepts? It could be a thug story. I tell you what. Why don't you think about it. A couple of pages. The pitch. Steroids. Got any concepts? It could be a thug story. I tell you what. Why don't you think about it. A couple of pages.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With plenty of sex, of course.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILES>
<DIRECTION>
GILES pops a coin into the slot machine, pulls the handle, waits.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Interesting, Giles. I will think about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
The machine spits out several coins. GILES takes them.
</DIRECTION>
<GILES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me give you three words of advice, Jack. Don't give up. Stick with it. Who persists wins. That's my motto. Write, write, write.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GILES>
<DIRECTION>
JACK nods, extends his hand. A firm handshake.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack had three words for, Giles. Go fuck yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Meeting over. GILES smiles goodbye, pockets his slot machine winnings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JACK'S BASEMENT FLAT - SITTING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The untidy evidence. To the accompaniment of the music, a discordant version, three dog-eared copies of 'The Invention Of The Wheel', A Novel by JACK MANFRED. Worn furniture. A pile of literary magazines. Two elegantly arranged vases of flowers. Women's fashion magazines. Books everywhere, including 'Scarne on Gambling', 'The Education of A Poker Player', 'Delta of Venus' and other books by Anais Nin. A woman's dress, back from the cleaners. A framed etching of Cape Town, South Africa, in the eighteenth century. Finally...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beneath the iron barred window, with a view of the iron steps down from the street, JACK sits at the dining table. In front of him is a word processor. He toys with a glass of vodka, smoking a Gitane, and leafing through a soccer fan magazine. He starts to touch-type, looking at the screen, not the keyboard. Words appear, letter by letter... THE BALL... A NOVEL... BY JACK MANFRED. He pauses to drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN, face unseen, steps into a phone booth. CLOSE ON: his hands. It is impossible to tell where he is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He opens his pocket book, addresses, diary etc., and searches through for something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He finds what he's looking for: a small photograph, among others of girls, of a ten year-old boy in school uniform. On the back are three phone numbers, two of them crossed out. The MAN lifts the receiver, inserts coins. He starts to press the numbers. There are CLOSE-UPS of his finger pressing the sequence of digits, each one CLOSER, longer than the one before, until...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JACK'S SITTING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The phone rings. JACK looks to the answering machine, waits for the voice.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jacko, if you're there, pick up. I want to talk to you. It's important.
	</DIALOGUE>

JACK hesitates, then picks up.

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad, I'm here.

<JACK_SR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's it going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_SR>
<DIRECTION>
The subsequent conversation is INTERCUT between SITTING ROOM and PHONE BOOTH.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<JACK_SR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Found a job?

</JACK_SR>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

</JACK>
<JACK_SR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well I've got something for you. In London, I mean. I've been chatting to some friends. Do you know the Golden Lion casino? It's in Bayswater, I believe... They're looking for a dealer, a croupier.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_SR>
<DIRECTION>
JACK SR pulls out a cigarette - a Gitanes.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not what I want to do, dad.

</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
JACK stubs his cigarette out.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_SR>
<DIRECTION>
(lighting his cigarette)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be stubborn. The pay won't be grand, but it's regular. That's what you need, isn't it? I know you don't like taking my advice...

<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(drinks)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<JACK_SR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've set this up for you. Call the Golden Lion and ask for Mr Reynolds, he's the Manager. I don't know him personally, but I've spoken to his boss. Don't say no, Jacko. Give yourself a break.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_SR>
<DIRECTION>
JACK reaches for a cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, I'll think about it. I won't. Goodbye, dad.

</JACK>
<JACK_SR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just do it. You've got the knack, you've got the personality, you got that from me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_SR>
<DIRECTION>
JACK lights up.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_SR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You understand the punters. Think about it, you can write during the day and sleep knowing the bills are paid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_SR>
<DIRECTION>
As he speaks, he watches passing WOMEN.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_SR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For Christ's sake, Jacko, don't look a gift horse in the mouth. Have you written that name down? Reynolds, at the Golden Lion.

<JACK>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, dad. Yes, I'll call him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
JACK is not enthusiastic, but he scribbles the name down on a pad.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how are you doing, dad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<JACK_SR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great. I've just started a new company. Solid financing. It's good.

JACK hangs up.

INT. PHONE BOOTH - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stubbing out his cigarette, JACK SR. leaves the booth. We now see where he is. A beach bar in South Africa. He walks to the bar and....goes behind it, slipping on his barman's jacket. A WOMAN in dark mirror glasses and a bathing suit is waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_SR>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry to keep you. What'll you have?

INT. JACK'S SITTING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK, disturbed by the call, pours himself a vodka. He looks at what he's written: 'THE BALL... A NOVEL BY... JACK MANFRED.'
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack knew something was wrong. He'd forgotten Giles' advice. Giles said three words.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
JACK inserts a word in the title. It now reads: 'ON THE BALL'. JACK drinks. After a moment...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	JACK'S VOICE No. Jack knew it still wasn't quite right...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
He types: 'IN THE BALLS'. Then, on reflection, deletes 'IN THE'. Through the iron bars JACK watches feet pass on the street above. A drunk drops a beer can over. The can falls in SLOW MOTION but the clatter is loud.
</DIRECTION>
<DRUNK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to fuck the whole world over.

INT. CASINO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Reception area. The CAMERA turns around the fake glitz of the interior: brass, drapes, polished wood, mirrors, and moves towards the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Welcome back Jack... to the house of addiction.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens. Against a blaze of street daylight, JACK'S silhouette appears. The CAMERA moves forward to greet him. JACK removes his wristwatch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO - MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK shakes hands with DAVID REYNOLDS, a cold man in his late forties, dead behind the eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	David Reynolds, I'm the Manager here. Sit down, John.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<JACK>

	Jack.

</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
REYNOLDS examines a file in front of him.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been recommended by the management here. They know your father. He has a bit of a reputation, hasn't he?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<JACK>

(frowns)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Has he?

	In any case, I understand you've had some previous experience... in South Africa.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

	You'll find the rules a little different here. Before we start, you haven't got a police record, have you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>

REYNOLDS opens the door. He lets JACK go on ahead.

	I don't think I know that one. Private, I suppose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO - HALL - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The full overhead lights give the casino an exposed, tacky appearance, devoid of mystery or glamour. The place has roulette tables and blackjack counters. It is deserted except for several CLEANING LADIES, vacuuming, emptying ashtrays. REYNOLDS walks with JACK, talking.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are three types of casino in the U.K. High volume. Small faction. And MOTR. That's middle of the road. Us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you have a Salon Prive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We tried. But there wasn't enough business. The punters like company.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<DIRECTION>
REYNOLDS goes to one of the tables with JACK.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's see you handle the chips.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<DIRECTION>
He slides open a box and tips 200 chips of varying denominations onto the table.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to assume the serial numbers on the bowl and cylinder correspond.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We check every four days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why four? And not three or five?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<REYNOLDS>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the procedure here. Now sort the chips.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<DIRECTION>
JACK starts to stack the chips in piles from a hundred pounds to five. REYNOLDS watches. JACK'S fingers work fast. In a matter of moments he has the lot stacked.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stacks of 20. Rows of 5.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any exceptions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	25 pounds or 25 pence in fours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me 365.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<DIRECTION>
He presses a stopwatch in his hand. JACK quickly sets out four neat piles, three of 100, one of 65. All four piles are in denominations of ten and five.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very good. Now take these colours...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<DIRECTION>
He throws a pile of blue and white chips on the table. The blue are 10, the white are 5.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want 780, but I want 500 in denominations of 25.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<DIRECTION>
JACK nods and gets to work. His fingers make Reynolds's ticking watch seem slow.
</DIRECTION>

	Very good.

INT. CASINO - DAY

Now at a roulette table, REYNOLDS has prepared the bets for fifteen punters. It's a set-up to test Jack's style and concentration. REYNOLDS gives JACK the white ball.

	You use two alternating, don't you?

</JACK>
<REYNOLDS>

</JACK>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They've been tested.

<DIRECTION>
JACK spins the wheel, throws the ball against the turn.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No more bets.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
As the ball begins to bounce, but before it stops, REYNOLDS turns to a CLEANING LADY who's emptying some ashtrays nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Could you stop that for a minute?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<DIRECTION>
The WOMAN looks up, surprised. JACK watches, then catches sight of REYNOLDS surreptitiously moving a chip onto the third line.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, sir, I've called no more bets.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
JACK reaches across, takes the chip and puts it on the wood Grounding the wheel. REYNOLDS nods approvingly. The ball stops.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	23 Red. Odd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
He now rakes away the losers' chips and pays out the smallest first, before getting to the major pay-out on 23. It's all very efficient and speedy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REYNOLDS is increasingly impressed.

<REYNOLDS>

	We had the same rule at Sun City, but it was impossible to check.

<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't South Africa. We'd know, because someone would report it. Believe me, someone always does.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does know? Or does report? What would happen if I knew something like that and didn't report it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'd know. There are no secrets in this casino. You'd be punished.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First offence: verbal warning. Second offence: written warning. That one's filed and sometimes copied to the Gaming Board. My discretion. Third offence: you're sacked on the spot. You'd never work in a casino in this country again. There's another rule: you're forbidden to talk to or recognise a punter outside the casino. If you see someone who's gambled here, even if it's just casually on the street, you must ignore him. Or her. You're not married, are you?

JACK shakes his head

<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Girlfriend?

</REYNOLDS>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

INT. CASINO - "CROW'S NEST" - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CCTV Centre over the casino. JACK crosses the room, looking down through a glass floor at the empty casino below. REYNOLDS walks over to a series of twenty or more banked TV monitors with many Video 8 tape decks.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is our Crow's Nest. I'm showing it to you now, but you'll never see it again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very impressive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have tapes in here that go back six months. Let me show you something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<DIRECTION>
REYNOLDS presses a button. Together they look at a TV monitor which shows an overlook of a roulette table where a WOMAN is cheating. REYNOLDS freezes the frame.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See that? That was six weeks ago. The dealer missed it. The guy up here missed it, but I watch these tapes after hours. Nothing gets by me. Now the lady's in jail. It's easier to take ten million pounds from a bank than take one penny from this casino.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>

INT. CASINO - MANAGER'S OFFICE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Again in the office. REYNOLDS extends his hand. JACK shakes it.

<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can start Monday week.

</REYNOLDS>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine.

Pause.

<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you planning to make a career in casino work?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And end up like you?

</JACK_S_VOICE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just want the job.

</JACK>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack, you're not the usual type we get here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr Reynolds was right. It was true. Jack was up above the world. An artist, living in the clouds. Looking down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
A HIGH ANGLED SHOT of the office, JACK and REYNOLDS. The phone rings.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<DIRECTION>
REYNOLDS picks up and listens. The CAMERA descends.
</DIRECTION>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't talk about this now... no, I'm with somebody. They can wait! I'll be home at the usual time... all right, I'll call you back in an hour...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hangs up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't ever get married, Jack. Casino work doesn't mix with house and garden. Any questions?
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<DIRECTION>
The CAMERA reaches a LOW ANGLE on JACK, looking up.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. What's the salary?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CAR - STREETS - TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The street lamps have come on. JACK is at the wheel of a Sixties Austin-Healey.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The casino paid its staff monthly in arrears. He would have to wait six weeks for his first cheque. He needed money now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. USED CAR LOT - TWILIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Under a canopy of coloured lights A CAR DEALER is walking round jack's car, examining it.
</DIRECTION>
<DEALER>
<DIRECTION>
(fake American accent)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of deal you looking to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEALER>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the Blue Book price?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DEALER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not relevant. An old car like this, it depends on the condition.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEALER>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The car was a gift from Jack's father. That's to say, Jack Senior had given it to him before the bailiffs arrived.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The DEALER picks at the cracked leather seats, the protruding stuffing, the chipped dashboard, the rust.
</DIRECTION>
<DEALER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This ain't exactly what you'd call mint.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEALER>
<DIRECTION>
He bends down and looks underneath the car.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about fifteen hundred?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DEALER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about five hundred.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEALER>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DEALER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about we split the diff... Seven-fifty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEALER>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that your idea of arithmetic?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DEALER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not a mathematician. I'm in business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEALER>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eight-fifty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DEALER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Seven-fifty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEALER>
<DIRECTION>
The DEALER looks at JACK. JACK stares back. It's as if one is waiting for the other to blink first. Neither blinks.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He suddenly wanted to be rid of it. 'Hang on tightly, let go lightly'. It was a saying Jack remembered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
JACK leans into the open car and takes out his hat and cigarettes. He has accepted the offer. The music begins...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERGROUND - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... And continues. JACK stands, with an unlit cigarette, in a crowded moving train. He looks at the faces, MEN and WOMEN. He sees PEOPLE reading books. He looks at the TITLES: Romantic fiction, Classics, Business Management, Thrillers, Self-Help, Cooking....
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack imagined people reading his book. One day he would enter their heads, play with their imaginations, test their feelings...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK crosses the road. He turns down a side street where Victorian houses have been converted into flats. There are scores of 'For Sale' and 'To Let' signs down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He would tell them you have to make a choice in life. Be a gambler or a croupier. And then live with your decision come what may.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
He goes down into a basement, closing the iron gate behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JACK'S BASEMENT FLAT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK unlocks the door, goes in, to the accompaniment of street sounds and a dog barking.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marion saw life differently. She was a romantic. And thought he was too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Radio music is playing from another room. An orchestral version of 'Try a Little Tenderness'. JACK comes in, hangs his hat up, looks around. He sees a neatly arranged vase of flowers that wasn't there before. He goes to the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK sees on the bed, an open box and a carrier bag from a designer department store. Among the white tissue paper is a simple black silk dress and lace-decorated black underwear. He smiles and picks up the knickers. He goes to the open bathroom door, from which comes the music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A radio plays beside the bath. The water is draining away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARION NEIL, a red-haired woman in her mid-thirties, wearing a bathrobe with the name MARION on it is examining the lines on her neck in the half-steamed bathroom mirror. She sees JACK, turns with a smile. JACK holds up the black knickers.
</DIRECTION>
<MARION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't resist them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean I won't resist them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
JACK goes to her.
</DIRECTION>
<MARION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me drunk?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MARION>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't be that long.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARION>
<DIRECTION>
She pushes him gently with the flat of her palms towards the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK comes back into the bedroom. MARION pushes the bathroom door, not quite closed. JACK tosses the knickers onto the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK takes the vodka bottle out of the freezer, pours himself a glass. He sees two bottles of wine opened, food neatly prepared, ready to cook, an open cook book. He pours a glass of wine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK sits drinking his vodka. Looking up through the barred window he sees women's legs passing on the street above. On the desk beside the computer is the glass of wine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARION materialises in the door to the bedroom. She is made up, wearing the black dress and high-heeled black shoes, a black scarf around her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK takes the glass of wine and gives it to her.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really are a beautiful woman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MARION>
<DIRECTION>
(pleased)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not just inner beauty, is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
MARION whirls to show off her dress.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're all I desire.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches for an envelope on the desk. He gives it to her. MARION opens it. There are several fifty pound notes inside.
</DIRECTION>
<MARION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did you get it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I. sold the car.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MARION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I owe you for the rent. It's only a car. I can get another.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MARION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it back. Till you sell your book.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, Marion. Let's face the truth. Nobody's going to publish it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MARION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course they will. You just have to be patient. I'm betting on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARION>
<DIRECTION>
She raises the glass of wine, drinks.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not much of a bet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
He drains his glass.
</DIRECTION>
<MARION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes her scarf, puts it round his neck, pulls him seductively towards the bedroom door.
</DIRECTION>
<MARION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come into my world.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARION>
<DIRECTION>
She winds the black scarf across his face, covering his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<MARION>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're my prisoner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got something to tell you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MARION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to hear it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got a job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MARION>
<DIRECTION>
(startled)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What job?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARION>
<DIRECTION>
MARION pulls the scarf from his eyes. She wants to look at him.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a casino. As a croupier. A dealer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MARION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you land that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It came my way. 450 a week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MARION>
<DIRECTION>
(sits up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had training. In the Republic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MARION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I start Monday week.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
From the street comes the whining sound of a car alarm.
</DIRECTION>
<MARION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	450 a week. I've never earned that in my life. You're an enigma, you are. A fucking enigma.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not an enigma, just a contradiction.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
MARION looks deeply into his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<MARION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no third thing. Don't be superstitious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MARION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you Jack, you know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And he half-loved Marion. And she knew that too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Outside, the car alarm stops. JACK takes MARION'S head in his hands. She reaches for one of them, examines it.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you trying to read my palm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MARION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got such beautiful hands.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The hands of a conjuror, a woman had told him once. Or a card sharp.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Their hands interlock. She leads him into the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NAIL STUDIO - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK'S hands are being worked on by a woman MANICURIST.
</DIRECTION>
<MANICURIST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What line of work are you in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANICURIST>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>

</JACK>
<MANICURIST>

The MANICURIST stops for a moment, looks at him with curiosity.

<DIRECTION>
INT. BARBER SHOP - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BARBER is cutting JACK'S hair. He goes up JACK'S neck with electric clippers. Jack's hair is now black.
</DIRECTION>
<BARBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you work round here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARBER>
<JACK>

</BARBER>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm an arms dealer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
The BARBER stops for a moment, nonplussed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO - CHANGING ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In front of the mirror JACK buttons a white shirt and skillfully ties a black bow tie. His short hair is lacquered back. He reaches down for his black jacket... puts it on. The transformation is complete.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he scrubs his nails, JACK sees a WOMAN in the mirror. She is changing her clothes. She pulls off her Indian cotton dress. She's wearing pants but no bra. Quite unselfconsciously, not looking Jack's way, she dresses in her casino clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK dries his hands. He turns. The WOMAN smiles at him.
</DIRECTION>
<BELLA>

She laughs.

INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK appears at the head of the table. The PUNTERS look at him, not recognising him.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The usual bunch. They didn't know Jack, but he knew them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

A fat INDIAN PUNTER addresses JACK.

<INDIAN>

</INDIAN>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He doesn't work here any more.

</JACK>
<INDIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, let's hope you know your job.

</INDIAN>
<DIRECTION>
A MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN trying to look as young as possible throws 100 pounds in cash to JACK.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tens, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to the WOMAN next to her, who looks very similar.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps this man will bring us luck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN_2>
<DIRECTION>
The WOMAN has sensed her friend's interest in JACK. She's jealous.

<WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that aftershave you're wearing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never converse with the punters. It slows things down. Speed is volume, and volume is profit for the casino. Aim at twenty spins an hour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
JACK pretends he hasn't heard the question. In the background REYNOLDS is watching as JACK spins the wheel.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last bets, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Later. A plastic-looking BLONDE WOMAN, heavily made-up, sits at the table. She nods to JACK. PUNTERS are placing their bets. She has 50 casino chips of £100 denominations in front of her. JACK notes the large sum.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BLONDE puts £2,500 on red and £2,500 on black. PUNTERS round the table are astonished at the size of the bet and the strangeness of betting both red and black.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK spins the wheel. Black 10 comes up. JACK takes the red loss and moves it across the table to the black win. The BLONDE picks up the £5,000 without a reaction and leaves the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK notices that she goes straight to the cashier's desk. JACK clears the chips away, starts to pay out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WHITE-HAIRED MAN on JACK's right speaks to him:
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're new here. You'll get used to Madame Claude. She comes in once or twice a week and does that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
JACK nods.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He knew the scam. Come in with five grand cash. No questions asked. Launder it by getting a casino cheque when you cash in. Jack wondered why Mr Reynolds permitted it? After all there's was no profit in it for the casino. Or was there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Later. A different set of PUNTERS. The wheel spins. A GREEK MAN sits at the table. He doesn't attempt to bet. He looks around to see a CROUPIER in his late 20's waiting to replace JACK at the wheel. This is MATT. He gives JACK a curious complicitous smile. JACK collects the chips and pays out.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen. I'm going to hand you over now to my colleague. Goodnight.
	</DIALOGUE>

INT. CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

JACK is now dealing to FIVE PUNTERS. He has a 10 and a 5 exposed for the house. TWO PLAYERS go bust. ONE PLAYER sticks on 19, the next on 20. The LAST PLAYER buys a card for 21. JACK turns over an ace for the house. He twists again. It's a 5 - making 21. The two losing PLAYERS groan. The LAST PLAYER is paid evens for equalling the house. One of the PLAYERS who's gone bust gets up, having lost all his chips, and leaves.

	5...8...11.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANI>
<DIRECTION>
JACK places them for her.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>

The wheel spins, 11 is the number. JACK calls the number and puts the 'dolly' on 11. JANI smiles faintly. JACK pays out across the table.

REYNOLDS steps back, JACK pays out JANI and the MAN. The MAN takes his winnings. He looks at JACK with hatred, then leaves the table.

It is late. There are few PUNTERS left at the tables. JACK tidies up his table, which is next to MATT's. He looks across at MATT and sees the GREEK MAN who was at the table the first night when MATT took over. The GREEK wins on a number. MATT clears the table and counts out the GREEK'S winnings, quickly and efficiently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK stiffens. He sees that something is wrong. MATT moves piles of chips across to the GREEK, who doesn't look up. JACK glances in the direction of the hidden video cameras and the crows' nest. REYNOLDS is in the back-ground, has seen nothing untoward. JACK watches the GREEK pick up his winnings and leave.

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I see you do it again, I'll report it.

	I don't get you. Even if it was true, which it isn't, what the fuck difference would it make to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because if a supervisor knew I'd seen you and I hadn't reported it, I'd lose my job as well. And I can't afford that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So it's Mr Clean. Wise up, Jack, this whole business is bent. The casino is nothing but legal theft. And that's OK. It's the system. Half the punters who come in are using stolen money, drug money, they haven't earned it. We earn our money.

INT. DEPARTMENT STORE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARION is store-walking in the women's underwear department. It is Sale time. Baskets of tights and knickers on display. CUSTOMERS are rummaging. She is on the look-out for thieves. She jumps as JACK places his hand on her hip.
</DIRECTION>
<MARION>

JACK pauses in front of an airline office. There is a large picture of Cape Town, and a special ticket offer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JANI comes out of the office. Her hair, tied back earlier in the casino, is now glamorously fluffed out. She sees JACK. He doesn't see her.
</DIRECTION>
<JANI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thinking of going back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANI>
<DIRECTION>
JACK is startled. He doesn't recognise her for a moment. Then...

	Oh hello.

</JACK>
<JANI>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANI>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's against the rules. Dealers are forbidden to talk to punters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<JANI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANI>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Impossible to calculate.

</JANI>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So why did you come to my casino?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<JANI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANI>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First visit to London?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<JANI>

</JANI>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your father?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<JANI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANI>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The debts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<JANI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.

</JANI>
<JACK>

	<DIALOGUE>
	And superstitious too. It's like witchcraft.

<JANI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANI>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We all came from Africa, supposedly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<JANI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you believe in astrology?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANI>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely not. But then, I'm a Gemini and Geminis don't believe in astrology.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
JANI laughs out loud.
</DIRECTION>
<JANI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, you don't strike me as a typical croupier.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANI>
<DIRECTION>
JANI drinks. JACK notices her wedding ring. JANI catches the look.
</DIRECTION>
<JANI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at her watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I must go. Let me pay for this.

</JANI>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>

JANI nods, stands up, takes out a notepad and pen. She looks round feigning conspiracy.
</DIRECTION>
<JANI>
<DIRECTION>
(low voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know this is verboten, but if you feel like a chat or maybe dinner, give me a call.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JANI>
<DIRECTION>
She scribbles her name and phone number on the pad, tears off the page, gives it to him.
</DIRECTION>
<JANI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll understand if you don't.

<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>

INT. JACK'S FLAT - NIGHT

In front of a mirror JACK trims his hair with nail scissors. He is dressed in his croupier's uniform. He straightens his bow tie.
</DIRECTION>

INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An ARAB at the end of the table kisses all his £50 chips and sets them out on the table. The wheel spins. JACK looks round at the PUNTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ball bounces, falls on zero. Everybody loses. Many groans.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MEDITERRANEAN-LOOKING MAN with a gold bracelet coughs. A gob of phlegm from his mouth lands on a pile of chips that JACK is raking away. A WOMAN in her mid-thirties is appalled.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Animal!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Would you mind being more careful, sir.

He coughs again, but into a handkerchief.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then go back home. To the zoo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
JACK clears the piles of chips to one side. He signals to a SUPERVISOR. The SUPERVISOR hurries over.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This gentleman accidentally coughed onto these chips. I don't think it would be hygienic to stack them...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
The SUPERVISOR signals a WAITRESS over.
</DIRECTION>
<SUPERVISOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Agnes. These chips have to be counted and put into the steamer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUPERVISOR>
<AGNES>

She looks at JACK, grimaces, and takes the chips away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO - NIGHT

The last PUNTERS are leaving. The overhead lights come on. A CROUPIER is wheeling away a trolley with thousands of chips. TWO MEN are covering the tables with shrouds.

REYNOLDS watches as JACK and MATT count the thousands of pounds, putting them in piles. Behind them is a large open safe.

He straightens his hat and walks off. BELLA walks the other way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET. NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN lurks in the shadows ahead of JACK. JACK doesn't see him. But as he comes past, the MAN steps out blocking JACK'S way. He is the Arabic-looking MAN JACK earlier caught cheating at the casino with JANI.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't recognise me? You had me barred. You fucking little worm.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute. You got yourself barred.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was you, you shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The MAN reaches forward and grabs JACK'S tie. He yanks it with farce. JACK gasps. He rams his elbow into the MAN'S chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MAN kicks JACK on the shins. JACK topples. The MAN leaps at him. JACK, knees him in the groin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The fight is untidy and vicious. Both men collapse struggling onto the pavement.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A car appears, a Mini-Cooper. BELLA is driving. She sees the fight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK'S nose is bleeding. The MAN kicks him in the back. JACK yells with pain, gets to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I'm going to kill you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
He boots the MAN in the head. BELLA gets out of her car and runs over to them.
</DIRECTION>
<BELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELLA>
<DIRECTION>
The MAN is screening under JACK'S repeated blows. BELLA pulls JACK away.
</DIRECTION>
<BELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack. Leave him! Come on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELLA>
<DIRECTION>
JACK'S face is masked with blood and fury. BELLA is frightened by JACK'S violence.
</DIRECTION>
<BELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go. We don't want the cops here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELLA>
<DIRECTION>
Before she can get JACK into her car, he goes back to the MAN groaning on the floor. He stamps on the MAN's hand. BELLA is shocked.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(coldly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He won't cheat again.

</JACK>

BELLA pulls him away, bundles JACK into her car, gets in, drives away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BELLA'S FLAT - BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Water is running in the basin. BELLA puts JACK'S jacket on the lavatory seat. She starts to undo his tie. JACK wipes his blood-stained nose with a wet flannel.
</DIRECTION>
<BELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're shaking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELLA>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's the tension.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
She undoes his shirt and takes it off. He winces. She washes his torso, cleans him up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK looks at his shaking hands. BELLA takes him by the hand, leads him into the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

She sits him on the bed. The room is lit with coloured lamps.
</DIRECTION>
<BELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse the mess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELLA>
<DIRECTION>
JACK pulls her suddenly into his arms, pulls her onto the bed. She is startled.
</DIRECTION>
<BELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Careful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELLA>
<DIRECTION>
JACK'S hands open her blouse. He reaches for her breast. BELLA'S surprise becomes excitement. He kisses her hungrily, his hands rummaging in her clothes. She reaches for a side zip in her skirt.
</DIRECTION>
<BELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tear anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BELLA>
<DIRECTION>
BELLA kicks off her shoes. There is a burst of passion between them. For JACK, a continuation of the violence with the MAN on the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For BELLA, it's a sudden release. Her naked foot knocks over the bedside lamp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK spreads BELLA on the bed. She tugs his trousers down. He rips her black underwear away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BELLA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Later. JACK is lying sprawled on the bed with BELLA. She reaches across him and retrieves the fallen lamp.
</DIRECTION>
<BELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's funny, isn't it? If that guy hadn't come up to you, you wouldn't be here now.

JACK strokes her bottom.

BELLA picks up a joint from the bedside and lights it.
</DIRECTION>
<BELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I spent two years on the game. I don't mind telling you that.

</BELLA>

JACK looks at her.

	But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S & M.

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You called the casino a cesspit.

	Ah, we all say that. But if we hate it, why do we do it?

JACK doesn't answer.

	Jack wanted to say we do it for the money. But that wasn't really true.

BELLA leans over JACK and begins gently to massage his flesh.
</DIRECTION>
<BELLA>

She puts the joint in an ashtray.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Not like Matt, you mean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<BELLA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now he's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. I'm sure he's got his hand in the till. You know what he said to me once? "I want to fuck the whole world over. That's my mission." The shit!

BELLA touches a bruise on JACK'S body.

JACK shows 13. He turns over his third card, a King. The bank busts. JACK pays out.

	Jack knew this was no coincidence. Why had she come?

The MEN look at the glamorous woman. MR TCHAI doesn't register her presence. He is as inscrutable as his BODYGUARD who hands him an envelope. JANI takes out money from her purse. JACK counts it.

	One thousand even. In fifties.

JACK slots the money down, counts out 20 £50 chips. JACK deals. Bets are placed. 100 from JANI. The cards turn. MR TCHAI splits two aces. JANI has a 6 and 7. MR TCHAI receives two los and wins big. JANI gets a 10 and busts.

INT. JACK'S BEDROOM/SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK is sitting on the bed fully clothed. He is carefully sewing a button on his croupier's jacket. Through the open bedroom door MARION can be seen sitting on the sofa, legs tucked under her, reading the new typescript.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The phone rings. In the bedroom JACK picks up.

In the sitting room MARION looks towards JACK in the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm getting there.

</JACK>
<JACK_SR>
	<DIALOGUE>

He hangs up. MARION turns the last page of the typescript. She's finished.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SITTING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK comes in from the bedroom. MARION says nothing. She puts the typescript down. JACK waits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARION gets off the sofa.
</DIRECTION>
<MARION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MARION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was a loser. This guy's a croupier. He can't lose. People have shat on him all his life. Now he's in control. He's a winner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MARION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(interrupting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- It's because of the sex, isn't it? You don't like the sex in it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MARION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?

<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marion. It's a book.

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no hope in it.

	It's the truth.

</JACK>
<MARION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Without hope there's no point to anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now wait a minute. What's so hopeful about your job? Spending the day catching poor people stealing. You said yourself the organised gangs get away with it. At least in the casino everybody gets caught. Rich or poor, the odds are the same. It's all relative.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MARION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Crap. It's not relative. It's unfair. Like your casino. It's designed unfair. And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK sees MARION is getting really angry. He crosses the room, Pointedly takes MARION'S handbag, opens it, takes out a National Lottery card and receipt. The doorbell rings.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(coldly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're just like all those other dummies out there. Fourteen and a half million to one! Is that your idea of hope?

The doorbell rings again.

JACK hands her the lottery card and goes to the door, opens it. BELLA stands there.

Without looking at MARION, BELLA suddenly kisses JACK on the lips. BELLA looks hard at JACK, then leaves. JACK pursues her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

BELLA runs up the iron stairs to the gate at the top.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>

Without looking back she flings the gate shut, goes off down the street. JACK turns.
</DIRECTION>
<MARION>

The rush hour. 6 in the evening. JACK watches MEN and WOMEN coming out the store.

	Jack had no idea where Marion was staying, or with whom. He realised he knew little about her life. But then, he had never asked about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
JACK now sees MARION. He is about to go up to her, moving through the flow of the crowd, then he stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A MAN in his 30s, tall with a moustache, greets MARION. He's been waiting for her. JACK watches the two of them, unseen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MAN and MARION exchange a few words. She smiles, takes his arm. He leans forward to kiss her.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For the first time in a long while Jack thought about his mother. She'd left when she couldn't take it any more. His father had said 'Don't worry, Jacko, she'll come back.' She didn't.

JACK turns and walks away.

INT. JACK'S FLAT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Working at his computer, JACK lights one cigarette from another. He pauses from his typing. On the desk beside him is the note with JANI's phone number.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK comes downstairs from the upper floor. He is looking at a book he has selected: 'SCARNE ON CARDS'.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across from the cash desk near the entrance a book signing is in progress. A small crowd surrounds a Middle Eastern author called HABIB dressed in a kaftan. GILES is with him. A PHOTOGRAPHER is there. A few camera flashes.

GILES sees JACK at the cash desk. He is uncertain for a moment, then smiles.

GILES goes back to his group. JACK looks round the bookstore, sees thousands of books in piles.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>

	How did you hurt your hand?

The car turns into a lane.

<JACK>

	Jani, there's something I want to say. Before we get there. I don't know what the sleeping arrangements are. Giles probably expects us to share a room.

<DIRECTION>
JACK prepares to get out. JANI catches his arm. She takes off her dark glasses. Her right eye is bruised.
</DIRECTION>
<JANI>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's no point pretending it was an accident. I had a fight with someone, that's all.

In the distance there is the sound of a tennis ball being struck.

Everybody's wearing sweaters. JANI is playing with one of GILES'S friends, GORDON. On the other side, two girls, FIONA from Giles' office, and CHLOE, Gordon's girlfriend.
</DIRECTION>

JACK follows JANI'S game. She is far and away the best of the four.
</DIRECTION>

GILES is also studying JANI's movements, her knickers when she serves.

On court, Jani delivers a winning overhead smash. The four PLAYERS shake hands across the net. They come off the court. GORDON puts his arm around JANI. His girlfriend CHLOE notices. JACK is irritated. GILES catches the moment.

JACK takes the pack of cards, splits it expertly into two, shuffles by pressing the two halves together open-palmed. There is a rattling noise as the cards fold mechanically into one another, leaving the pack as if it hadn't been shuffled. FIONA and CHLOE are fascinated.
</DIRECTION>
<FIONA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do that again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIONA>
<DIRECTION>
JACK gives the cards to his right, GORDON cuts them. Another immaculate professional shuffle, and out come the cards from JACK'S right hand, flicking across the table.
</DIRECTION>

As the cards land, they fall exactly next to one another in front of each player.

JANI puts her skirt over a chair and goes into the bathroom. She doesn't close the door. JACK continues undressing. From a hold-all he removes a pair of pajamas.

<DIRECTION>
At the roulette table JACK spins the wheel, throws the ball.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In reality there were two clear elements of risk in this exchange. One: the possibility the cash was counterfeit. Two: the possibility Jani or her creditors would want the money back if the plan failed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
A MIDDLE-AGED MAN is sweating. He fingers his last 2 chips. He reaches for a number, hesitates. JACK sees that the MAN's hand is shaking.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To begin with he put the odds at 2 against. 7 for. He checked a random selection of bills at a bank. They were all good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Across the table a well-dressed JEWISH WOMAN in her fifties is sitting next to a YOUNG MAN, a gigolo type, the top three buttons of his shirt undone. She too hesitates with her bet, looks down at her card, marked with the last thirty turns.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So now his odds were decidedly better. He put them at 8 to 1. The fact that the notes were good gave him one less negative. 2 minus 1. At the same time mathematically he had one more positive. 7 plus 1.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The WOMAN looks up at the YOUNG MAN. She hands him the chip.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bring me some luck.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The YOUNG MAN smiles. Takes the chip and puts it on 21.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MIDDLE-AGED MAN puts his chips on 8 and 11. He prays silently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The roulette table. The ball is bouncing in and out of numbers.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No more bets.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
The MIDDLE-AGED MAN closes his eyes. The WOMAN puts her hand on the YOUNG MAN'S arm.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next stage. He had to be secure at 8 to 1 against having to give the money back, so he wouldn't spend it. If after one month no one had approached him, he calculated the odds of keeping it at 20 to 1. After three months he figured 100 to 1 no one would turn up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The ball bounces into 21. The WOMAN gives a cry of joy. She grips the YOUNG MAN's hand. He leans over to her, eyeing her diamond necklace, and whispers something seductive in her ear. She stiffens with apprehensive pleasure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MIDDLE-AGED MAN opens his eyes, there is a look of misery on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK sweeps away the lost chips, pays out five minor winners. He calmly counts a small pile of chips and slides them to the MIDDLE-AGED MAN by sleight of hand. Then he prepares to pay out the WOMAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No one has noticed the pay-out to the MIDDLE-AGED MAN. The MAN looks at JACK incredulously. JACK smiles mechanically. The MAN mouths the words 'Thank you' to JACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WOMAN looks up at the YOUNG MAN. She gives him a pile of chips. He gives them back. He kisses her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about a drink to celebrate?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The MIDDLE-AGED MAN stands up, his face creased in emotion, relief.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(to Jack)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cash me in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAN>
<DIRECTION>
JACK converts the green coloured chips to £35 in house chips. The MAN nods at JACK, who smiles formally.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The MAN leaves the table. PUNTERS place their bets for the next spin. JACK sees the MAN stop by the next roulette table.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jake's experiment with the man would prove the point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The MAN hesitates. He can't resist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In CLOSE-UP: the MAN puts two of the chips down.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	People don't change.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MARION, undressed, pulls the old nightgown from the laundry basket. She lets it fall back, goes to look in the chest of drawers for another. She can't find one among the underwear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She goes on to JACK'S drawer and pulls out a shirt. She unfolds it. Out drop the four packets of £2500.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She bends to pick them up. She looks at them incredulously.

	He had come to believe that in reality, they want to destroy everyone else - their families and loved ones, everyone. Fuck over the whole world...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The white balls lands. The FACES of the LOSERS, resigned, desperate, angry....
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PUNTERS who are cleaned out get off their chairs, tear up their sequence cards, turn and walk away, quickly, slowly.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's set. The day after tomorrow. The twenty-fourth. Good luck.

<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERGROUND - NIGHT

JACK sits impassively among noisy Christmas TRAVELLERS. The train stops. SOMEONE pops a balloon. JACK gets up and alights, followed by a streamer. He disappears into the crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO - CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT

JACK hangs up his hat and coat, examines himself in the mirror. He picks up a small roll of paper. He unfurls it. A Christmas party hat.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Christmas festive atmosphere. The casino interior is decorated with red and green balloons, silver and gold streamers, a large tree hung with £1000 chips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK is dealing at a blackjack table. Like the other croupiers and dealers, he is dressed in a fancy red coat with green trim. He wears a silly paper hat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PUNTERS at Jack's table include MR TCHAI and four expensively dressed CHINESE MEN. The BODYGUARD stands behind them. They are gambling big money. Wads of £50 notes are changed into £100 chips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK is coolly winning for the house. REYNOLDS looks on impassively in his Santa Claus suit. Three or four PUNTERS are watching the CHINESE lose heavily. MR TCHAI and his friends occasionally exchange a phrase in Chinese but they show no emotion as they lose. With each hand they prepare to lose even more. JACK pushes hundreds of pounds into the box beneath the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REYNOLDS signals a SECURITY MAN to collect the cash which is building up. He comes over with a safety cart. During a short break the money is taken from under the table in a box, loaded into the cart and wheeled away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO - BAR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO COLD-LOOKING MEN in suits are drinking mineral water at the bar. They watch the SECURITY MAN with the cart pass by and disappear through a green baize door marked PRIVATE. One of the SUITS looks at his watch: five minutes to midnight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK is now at a roulette table. He sees a PUNTER's watch: 2.45. The atmosphere around the crowded table is noisy, laughter, loud voices. 1 One of the two MEN in suits from the bar eases himself into a chair. JACK sees him. The SUIT throws him £500.
</DIRECTION>
<SUIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifties. Ten of them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUIT>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What colour chips?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<SUIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUIT>
<DIRECTION>
JACK gives him ten pale blue chips and puts another pale blue chip into the rack alongside the rainbow of colours used by the other punters. The SUIT looks at his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two men in raincoats, DETECTIVES, approach REYNOLDS and talk to him. REYNOLDS becomes nervous, looks around the casino. The table at the bar where the SUITS sat is empty. The PRIVATE green baize door slowly closes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ball bounces into number 5. There are cheers of delight from the winners, 5 is heavily covered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SUIT casually slides a pale blue chip onto the number at the side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK Sees the obvious cheat. So do other PUNTERS.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(stiffens)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sir, I can't accept that bet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
The SUIT gets up and comes around the table to JACK.
</DIRECTION>
<SUIT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you calling me a cheat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUIT>
<PUNTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are a cheat. I saw you.

</PUNTER>
<SUIT>
<DIRECTION>
(grabbing Jack's lapel)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm talking to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SUIT>
<DIRECTION>
JACK pushes him away. The SUIT hits JACK'S face with his fist. Uproar around the table. JACK hits the man. The SUIT grabs JACK and pushes him backwards across the table, knocking all the chips over. The PUNTERS start shouting. They grab their chips, especially the losers. One PUNTER tries to restrain the SUIT. JACK kicks the SUIT hard. They fight, trading blows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the blackjack table MR TCHAI and the other CHINESE see the fight. MR TCHAI barks at the BODYGUARD in Chinese. The BODYGUARD heads for the fight at the roulette table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO DEALERS rush over to stop the fight. Somewhere in the distance there is the sound of a gunshot. PEOPLE start screaming. The SUIT punches JACK in the stomach. JACK doubles up. The SUIT breaks away, rushes across the casino, pushing screaming WOMEN aside, heads for the door. MR TCHAI's BODYGUARD blocks his way and fells the SUIT with a hammer blow to the head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The TWO DETECTIVES come up. One of them handcuffs the SUIT, who is lying on the floor. The casino is in uproar. A strange, violent Christmas party.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK lies groaning on the floor. MR TCHAI is standing, watching JACK. REYNOLDS'S VOICE comes over the tannoy system:
</DIRECTION>
<REYNOLDS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and gentlemen, please be calm. There's no cause for alarm. Enjoy yourselves. It's Christmas.
	</DIALOGUE>
</REYNOLDS>
<DIRECTION>
REYNOLDS'S VOICE is replaced by a breezy version of 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer'. JACK struggles to his feet, amid the chaos. He falls back in pain. MR TCHAI and the other CHINESE leave the casino with the BODYGUARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL - CASUALTY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK is sitting in a Christmas-decorated cubicle, a curtain drawn round. An INDIAN NURSE is bandaging his arm. He has two large plasters on his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The NURSE finishes the job, smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
She hands him two pills and a glass of water. In the background there are party sounds. The NURSE leaves. JACK fingers the charm around his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a pause. Then the curtain is pulled back. MARION enters. She carries a bottle of wine and two cartons of Chinese take-away. JACK is surprised.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How did you know I was here?

</JACK>
<MARION>

She starts to pour wine. JACK is still puzzled.

JACK sits alone at a corner table, drinking, watching the fun, unsmiling. One plate cracks into a wall behind him. A MAN stumbles backwards into JACK's table. JACK swiftly moves his drink out of the way. The MAN apologises, turns to JACK. It is MATT.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jacko! How're you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes Jack's hand vigorously)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard about the raid. Pity they didn't pull it off. I wish I'd been there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<DIRECTION>
MATT has to shout above the noise and music. JACK smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you were there Matt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<DIRECTION>
MATT doesn't hear.
</DIRECTION>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? You know what happened to me, don't you? That bitch Bella shopped me. I'd like to beat the shit out of her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATT>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd like to buy you a drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<MATT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cheers. Happy New Year. I really like you, Jacko, you're so fucking straight.

INT. GREEK RESTAURANT - NIGHT

There are four or five PEOPLE left among the debris. MATT has gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK is still there, drunk now.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The music stopped, Jack was drunk... hallucinating. He was back, as a child, in the Wild Coast Casino.

</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
A BLACK WOMAN comes over to him. Her name is LUCY.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've been avoiding me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<JACK>
<DIRECTION>
(blearily)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Lucy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what do you do, Lucy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a witch. A white witch. Why don't we move on?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you going to put a spell on me?

</JACK>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I might.

EXT. GREEK RESTAURANT - DAWN

<DIRECTION>
LUCY guides JACK to a parked car. He is drunker than she. When he sees the car he starts to laugh. It is his Austin Healey.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice car. How much did you pay for it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Too much. Eighteen hundred.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
She opens the door for him. They climb in. LUCY starts the car.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where to?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<JACK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn left at the lights.

They drive off.

EXT. STREET - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A deserted intersection. The Austin Healey swings around a corner. A WOMAN steps out from the kerb.

INT. CAR - DAWN

<DIRECTION>
JACK reacts. He swings the wheel. LUCY shouts. The car swerves, missing the WOMAN.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! I saw her!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<DIRECTION>
JACK looks back. The WOMAN is shouting after the car.
</DIRECTION>
<LUCY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't trust women drivers, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LUCY>
<JACK_S_VOICE>

	Jack didn't trust anyone. Except himself.

INT. JACK'S FLAT - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK sits at his computer. He is watching the printer unloading page after page. JACK assembles the typescript.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was finally finished. He thought of sending it to Giles. But that wouldn't be right. He would select a publisher at random, like a number.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE UP: The dedication: 'To Marion'.

<DIRECTION>
The sound of the ball bouncing against the wheel.

INT. CASINO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>

The ball falls into 10. JACK puts the doll on 10.

No one at the table has the winning number. JACK sweeps away the losing bets.

<DIRECTION>
INT. CASINO - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A Blackjack table. The bets are placed. JACK turns over the bank's cards: a KING and an ACE. He takes all the chips from the five PUNTERS.

	You're wasting yourself. With your luck you ought to come over to our side.

</PUNTER>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET. BOOKSTORE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK comes up to a bookstore window. A sticker reads: 'IT'S A WINNER'. There are quotes blown up from the reviews: "AN INCREDIBLE INSIDE JOB...IT'S ALL HERE, THE SYSTEMS, THE SCAMS, THE SLEAZE...A TALE OF TRIUMPHANT DISGUST...OF EXHILARATING CONTEMPT..." The display is just one book: 'I, CROUPIER'. Number 1 Bestseller.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even his publisher had no idea who the author was. He had done the deal through a lawyer. It gave him a good feeling, no one knowing...

<DIRECTION>
REYNOLDS is reading the book. He laughs out loud at something.

<JACK_S_VOICE>

INT. UNDERGROUND - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JACK is sitting in his croupier's suit on the crowded tube. He sees a WOMAN reading 'I, CROUPIER'. For the first time we see the back cover...'by ANONYMOUS'.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...It gave him an exquisite pleasure, being an underground man. With all his money, he hadn't even bought a car. Jack knew the truth about himself, he was a one- book writer. A one time winner who had quit while he was ahead...

Five in the morning.

JACK'S face is a mask, tight, fixed.
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_SR_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The woman thinks I'm going to marry her. But you know me. It's a shame things didn't work out. But we saw you all right. You didn't gamble the ten grand, did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_SR_S_VOICE>
<JACK>

	As a matter of fact I did. But I won.

JACK slowly puts the phone down. He takes a deep breath. Then smiles.

<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that was it. The final card. Blackjack. His father, eight thousand miles and twenty seven years away, was still dealing to his son Jack from the bottom of the deck...

Laughing, JACK pours himself a vodka, raises his glass.

	To you. To both of you.

He drinks at a gulp. He turns. Standing in the doorway is BELLA, wearing a nightdress. She is sleepy.

<BELLA>

	What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?

</BELLA>

INT. CASINO - NIGHT

We are back in the FIRST SCENE. The ball bounces around the spinning wheel. The FACES of the PUNTERS. Frozen expressions. They are almost still. We do not see the croupier. Then...
</DIRECTION>
<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now he had reached the point where he no longer heard the sound of the ball...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Nothing moves except the little white ball in the spinning wheel. The ball slows...

	<DIALOGUE>
	...the spin of the wheel had brought him home to the place where he was born.
	</DIALOGUE>

JACK'S face. A hint of a smile.

<JACK_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The croupier's mission was accomplished.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JACK_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The ball falls into green Zero. JACK rakes all the chips off the table. There are no winners. The film ends on a

CLOSE-UP of JACK'S face. A look of calm satisfaction.

THE END
