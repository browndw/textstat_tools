I confess I'm, in no small part, to blame for the vociferous gossip that has turned my Varsity letter scarlet, but - for anyone hoping that the sizzling details of my sordid past will provide you with a reason to lock the door and make love to a dollop of your sister's moisturizing lotion - you'll be gravely disappointed.

Bored, Olive sits at a desk in a classroom, reading a tattered copy of `The Scarlet Letter.' She's dressed much racier and is starting to look pretty hot.

<DIRECTION>
There's only one other person in the room. The BULLIED KID seen by Olive leaving Gibbons's office the day before.

The bullied kid is thin as a rail, pale as a ghost and slightly effeminate. He looks miserable. Not just by this detention, but from life in general.

</OLIVE>
<BRANDON>

</BRANDON>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

<BRANDON>

	Haven't you heard? I'm the new school slut!

	As a matter of fact I did hear that. I heard you banged a guy twice your age.

<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No way. He's a freshman in college.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<BRANDON>

</OLIVE>
<BRANDON>
<DIRECTION>
Tell me about it.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>

He's not real. The guy I slept with. I made him up.
</DIRECTION>
<BRANDON>
<DIRECTION>
So, you started the rumor?
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
Indirectly? Sort of. Well, not really. No. No, I didn't.
</DIRECTION>
<BRANDON>
<DIRECTION>
But you're perpetuating it. That's fucked up.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
(OFFENDED) Excuse me?
</DIRECTION>
<BRANDON>
<DIRECTION>
It's true. There's only one thing worse than these tabloid-chasing celebutantes with their vapid minds and their immoral souls and that's the people who want to be like them.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
Did I say I wanted to be like them?
</DIRECTION>
<BRANDON>
<DIRECTION>
No, you just want everyone else to think you are.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
Why does it matter if it's not who I really am? No offense, Brando, but maybe you could learn something from me.
</DIRECTION>
<BRANDON>
<DIRECTION>
You're saying I should pretend to be straight, so people will like me? What a novel idea. You should do seminars. Oh, wait a minute, I forgot... In high school, EVERYBODY PRETENDS TO BE SOMETHING THEY'RE NOT!
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Calm down, Adolph. There's a vein popping out of your neck. I'm simply suggesting that maybe these kids we call peers have got the right idea. Maybe Bridget Schumacher isn't as hippy-dippy as she pretends to be. Maybe that's just the label she's put on herself to avoid having to bathe as often as society deems necessary. Or take Marianne Bryant. It's convenient for her to act like a stuck-up Jesus-freak.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(Thinking about this)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I'm wrong. I think she's actually just a stuck-up Jesus- freak. But do you think she cares that that's the way she's perceived? No. Maybe she was just sick of being just another nameless, faceless entity in a place and a time that reveres people for extremity?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
Brandon realizes why she's chosen this path and feels for her.
</DIRECTION>
<BRANDON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are some of us, though, that want to just blend in to the crowd.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRANDON>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then maybe you need to go to that extreme. Or make the steadfast decision not to care. Even better if you can manage to do both.

Olive, looking like a million-fuckin'-bucks, prances into the party with Brandon, who's looking pretty snazzy himself. They appear drunk and are falling all over each other.
</DIRECTION>

People stare in complete amazement at a.) Their appearance and b.) That they're even together in the first place.

You'd never guess that this was anything less than an A-LIST TEEN COUPLE, ripped from the pages of Teen People.

Olive falls against Brandon laughing. He hoists her up, as their host, MELANIE BOSTIC (17), a fairly pretty girl, approaches.

Olive plops down on the bed and stretches out. Brandon lays beside her. She moans for the benefit of the audience she knows has assembled outside. She moans again and it's very convincing.

Olive reaches into her handbag and pulls out her copy of `The Scarlet Letter' and reads it while she makes sex noises. Brandon laughs at this and Olive smacks him with it, prompting him to stop. She puts her finger over her lips, giving him the `Shhhh' sign.

The bully immediately hands Brandon a beer and throws his arm around him, leading him drunkenly down the hallway, with a crew of guys after the dirty details.
</DIRECTION>

Olive looks at this and smiles, satisfied. Then she realizes that, though the guys have gone, there are a whole slew of girls looking at her completely differently. They avoid her eye contact, as one would ward off Medusa.

Olive - visibly upset - is cutting something, meticulously, out of RED FABRIC. In fact, she has yards of red fabric draped across her lap.

When she finishes the shape, she tosses it behind her and begins another one.

Olive sews these red scraps to her clothes. When she finishes one piece, as before, she tosses it behind her and grabs another item from the crumpled wardrobe on her floor.

A FIERY RED `A'

Erections are popping up all along the halls, as well as looks of total disbelief from the girls.

She works it like a Debbie Who Just Did Dallas, Düsseldorf, Des Moines, Daytona, Detroit and Darfur.

	Evan, if you're watching this - shame on you. I hope you never treat another girl the way you treated me or you will die alone, wishing it was because you're fat. And since we're playing the shame game... While I appreciate the sentiment, Lewis, a pretend hand job should have warranted a little more than a hundred dollars worth of AMC Movie Passes. They had an expiration date AND were only able to be used for movies that had been running for two weeks. But even that's better than Tyler Jennings, who gave me a ten percent off coupon to Bath and Body Works. Seriously. A fucking coupon. Is that how good my imaginary blow job was to you? Huh? Is chivalry dead? I want John Cusack holding a boombox outside my window. I want Richard Gere climbing up my fire escape with the limo waiting downstairs. I want to ride off on a lawnmower with Patrick Dempsey. Although, I'm ashamed to admit I'd prefer him to look like he looks now. What woman wouldn't? But no. I get to save two fifty on a bottle of Juniper Breeze Hand Lotion. Maybe chivalry isn't dead, but it's in a coma and the prognosis isn't good.

It was just that a lot of people had been asking me to do things and I thought it was okay, because it wasn't real. It was make-believe and no one was getting hurt. But a lot of people hate me now.

She assured me that she had never meant for anything to happen with Micah. She confessed to me how when she was a child she always dreamt of being Maria Von Trapp, not Mary Kay Letorneau.

	Oh, and nobody does it better. Makes me feel sad for the rest. Nobody does it half as good as me. Baby, baby! Darlin', I'm the best!

</OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
She walks over to a couple of HORN PLAYERS, and runs her fingers seductively over their (uh) instruments.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd goes wild - some appalled, but most enthused.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olive sashays through the crowd as the MALE TEENS scream and stuff money down her bodice.

:SC: INT. OLIVE'S BEDROOM - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sun is setting as Olive speaks into her webcam. But this time, we're not seeing it through the lens, but from a different point in the room.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And here you all are. Waiting outside the closet door for me to kiss Todd, listening to me pretend to have sex with Brandon, paying me to lie for you, calling probably the last virgin in school a whore. Guys. Seriously.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
All of a sudden -- from outside and downstairs --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
James' `LAID' begins to play.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Olive goes over to the window and sees Todd below, holding up a BOOMBOX (a la John Cusack) and there's a RIDE-ON LAWN MOWER (a la Patrick Dempsey) behind him.

Olive can't get the smile off of her face as she goes back to the camera.

<DIRECTION>
We see her through the lens.
</DIRECTION>
<OLIVE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Todd. Not that I owe any of you any more confessions, but I'm really in love with him. And I am going to lose my virginity to him. I'm not sure when. It could happen five minutes from now or tonight or six months from now or maybe on our wedding night, but the really amazing thing is that it's nobody's business.

(As an afterthought)
</DIRECTION>

</OLIVE>

<MONTAGE>
<DIRECTION>
We see, from the perspective of their computer screens, various reactions to Olive's webcast --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- A proud Brandon watches from a hotel room. A MUSCULAR BLACK GUY in a towel comes up behind him and kisses his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- The Abernathys watch with the same demented glee they derive from watching anything.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Mrs. Griffin watches with the face of a person who's been found out and who's days are numbered. They are.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Rhi seems contemplative. Maybe it's because she's been in love with Olive since grade school. Duh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</MICAH_S_GRANDMOTHER>
<DIRECTION>
-- Rosemary and Dill are too busy making out to watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
-- Anson has a jar of vaseline and is ready to jerk off, but is upset that she isn't `exposing herself' in the aforementioned way.
</DIRECTION>
<ANSON>
