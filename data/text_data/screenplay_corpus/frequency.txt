...the theory of black holes was developed before there was any indication from observations that they actually existed. I do not know of any other example in science where such a great extrapolation was successfully made solely on the basis of thought. It shows the remarkable power and depth of Einstein's theory. There is still much we don't know, such as what happens to objects and information that fall into a black hole. Do the reemerge elsewhere in the Universe, or in another universe? And can we warp space and time so much that one can travel back in time? Maybe someone will come back from the future and tell us.

EXT. MANHATTAN BRIDGE - PREDAWN - 1969
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Darkness. Headlights bounce off thick sheets of RAIN. 6,500 gallon Esso OIL TRUCK barrels over wet studded pavement, heading towards Manhattan. It's going fast. Too fast.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead...at the BASE OF THE BRIDGE:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large reflective sign - lit up by arc lights: MEN AT WORK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are TWO WORK CREWS, several hundred feet apart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FIRST CREW is CON ED. A corrugated vacuum tube feeds into an open MANHOLE. A WORKER drops into the hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE SECOND CREW is CONSTRUCTION. They're at the apron of the bridge securing lumber supports for the roadbed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's late and the men are tired. A mistake is made. A FORK LIFT loaded with LUMBER fails to negotiate a turn...whacks into an abutment... spilling its load onto the roadway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bad timing, because right now that Esso OIL TRUCK hits the OFF RAMP. Not a lot of time for the driver to react to a roadway spewed with lumber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He does his best. Slams the brakes, spins the wheel, hits the horn, but it doesn't matter: 18 wheels skid across the blacktop - spitting thick smoke and burnt rubber, lifting off the slick pavement...twisting...flipping...hemorrhaging oil from its ruptured tanks...grinding its way towards...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MEN AT WORK. Seconds to react as an 80,000 pound juggernaut of death plows through parked cars like paper...crushing the Con Ed equipment...lurching to a halt on top of the MANHOLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FIRE STATION - 9TH BATTALION - CONTINUOUS

TWO FIRE TRUCKS (1000 Gallon Pumper and Mack Tiller Ladder) pull into the street.

SIRENS wail, cherry tops spin.

<DIRECTION>
FRANK SULLIVAN, 40, is strapped into an open-air jumper seat. A real life hard charger, Frank is the kind of iron's man fire fighters want coming in after them, should they get caught in harm's way. Kind-hearted and hard-fisted, he has the grace and courage of a man living by his convictions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across from Frank sits GRAHAM GIBSON, 20. A good-looking African-American, "Gib" is a Fire Fighter Fourth Grade, a tank man... and one nervous probie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through a window into the CAB, we SEE LT. BUTCH FOSTER, 50, on a walkie-talkie. A beefy old pro who's been through more fires than he can remember.
</DIRECTION>

A walkie-talkie sits in a cradle between Frank and Gibson.

EXT. MANHATTAN BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tableau of impending danger. Thick black OIL bleeds from teh truck onto the street...pouring underneath the rig...and into the MANHOLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POLICE urgently cordon off the area, evacuating the workers. EMERGENCY PERSONNEL deal with the badly injured TRUCK DRIVER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Firemen wedge sandbags between the hull of the truck and the three-quarters covered manhole -- trying to divert the oil away from the underground vault.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FIRE COMMANDER O'CONNELL yells at his men to finish the job and get the hell away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BIG TRUCKS ARRIVE. PUMPER ENGINE and Frank's LADDER TRUCK -- rapidly guided into position by men on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank, Gibson, Butch and the rest of the unit are on the ground instantly and ready for orders. They are looking at a nightmare ready to happen. Frank takes in everything.

</COMMANDER>
<DIRECTION>
Frank has been staring at the capsized rig.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Butch knows what he's thinking. But it's too late. Frank is gone...slogging through the oozing oil to the hull of the tanker. He kneels over the three-quarters covered manhole, using a flashlight to peer into the darkness below. Sparks from the loose cables spit off flashes of light as the cables hiss and slap against the ceiling and walls of the vault.

Frank grabs a "halaghan claw tool" and a walkie-talkie. Gibson nervously picks out two helmet lights...and they are off and running.

INT. MANHOLE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

Frank and Gibson descend into the tunnel, strap lights on their leather helmets to illuminate the damp darkness. They race down the subterranean passage. The stench is thick. Butch's voice suddenly booms out of the walkie-talkie:

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I should'a been a fucking mailman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIBSON>
<DIRECTION>
Frank reaches the rusted 'submarine-like' VAULT DOOR. Pounds on the door... a faint response. He goes to work on it with the halaghan tool. Gibson arrives...pretty rattled. Frank gives him a wink and a smile. It's gonna be okay.

<BUTCH>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank, where are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BUTCH>
<DIRECTION>
Frank digs down, suddenly the DOOR GIVES WAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oil and water rush from the VAULT, pouring over Frank and Gibson, foaming into the tunnel. But the door is mounted three feet off the ground. There is still three feet of oil and water trapped inside. And the smell of gas is now overwhelming...
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(into walkie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're in, Butch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Frank probes the dark vault with the FLASHLIGHT BLADE. Through smoke we see TWO MEN huddled in the corner, trapped by three loose 'HOT' CABLES - WHIPPING AROUND THE TINY VAULT LIKE AN ELECTRIC HYDRA. Con Ed Worker #2 shivers, ankle broken, leaning on older Con Ed Worker #1.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time to go home, fellas.

Gibson sprays the room, clearing out most of the smoke. Frank steps into the vault.
</DIRECTION>
<CON_ED_WORKER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Careful. If the hot end of those cables hits you, it'll conduct to the water and we're all fired.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CON_ED_WORKER_1>
<DIRECTION>
Frank drops to his knees, ducking under the cables, shuffles to center of the vault. Places his hands at opposite ends of the halaghan tool, hoping for the cables to pass directly over his head. A hairy beat, then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank jackknifes out of the water, ramming the halaghan into the ceiling. It worked. The teeth on the "claw-end" and the spike on the "adz-end" are embedded into the concrete -- STAPLING THE CABLES TO THE CEILING. Make that balls of steel.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go, Gibby! Everybody move it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Gibson and Con Ed worker #1 help injured Worker #2 out of the vault. Frank checks to make sure they've cleared the vault and lets go of the tool.
</DIRECTION>

Frank jumps into the tunnel, hoists the injured worker over his back and races back down the tunnel.

<DIRECTION>
Frank, Gibson and the Con Ed men scramble towards the manhole. Butch and another fireman are waiting up top. They help the men -- who are covered in oil and slime -- up onto the street. And then they all tear away from the manhole...around a corner... collapsing on the pavement against a building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
K-A-B-O-O-M -- A MUFFLED EXPLOSION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The vault ignites, the tunnel "FLASHBACKS" -- a towering geyser of FLAMES AND DIRT ERUPTING out of the manhole from which Frank has just escaped.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, FLAMES erupt out of the other manhole...engulfing the OIL TRUCK...blowing it into a million pieces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the INFERNO at the base of the Manhattan Bridge, Frank can see that no one is hurt. His eyes glistening with adrenaline and relief, he sits back against the building and throws an arm around Gibson.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>

	You did good, Gib. Real good.

Inside the tunnel. Dark. Moving fast. Flashes of LIGHT bounce off the shiny tile walls. The deep throated ROAR of a '67 HARLEY battles with Martha & the Vandellas' HEAT WAVE. We are with Frank, wearing a leather jacket with the insignia of his fire-fighting unit emblazoned on it, and a New York Mets BASEBALL CAP pulled down tight, as he rockets his chopper through traffic, out of the tunnel, and up into...

Frank glides the Harley alongside his house. A feisty DALMATIAN PUPPY ELVIS barks his welcome from behind a fence.

<DIRECTION>
Feeling fatigued, Frank dismounts and enters teh backyard, playing for a moment with Elvis while he uprights a TRAINING BICYCLE, tidies up BASEBALL EQUIPMENT, and glances up at a HAM RADIO ANTENNA secured to the roof, before entering through a backdoor. There is a sense of routine to all this.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

<DIRECTION>
The kitchen is empty. Breakfast dishes in the sink. Frank flips on the RADIO. It plays out under the rest of the MONTAGE as coverage of the oil truck crash blends into other news stories.

A note on the refrigerator reads: 8:15. Hey, Bud. I'm off to work. Johnny's at school. Elvis is fed. I luvs you.

Setting a grapefruit and a slice of toast on the table, Frank glances at the Daily News. But his eyes are tired, he stares off into space...letting go.

CRASH! A SOFTBALL BLOWS through the window from the BACKYARD, landing on the rug next to the bed. Frank bolts awake, staring at the busted window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He checks the clock. It is 5:15. He steps to the broken window. SEVERAL SMALL BOYS scurry from the yard. Two others, JOHNNY SULLIVAN and GORDO HERSCH, both 6, stand frozen in place. Elvis tears in circles around them. All is very quiet. Then, from somewhere beyond the bedroom door, we HEAR The Beatles' BACK IN THE THE USSR...

<DIRECTION>
EXT. OUTER SPACE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Countless points of light blaze across vast blackness. A luminous blue sphere floats peacefully below EARTH. We are 22,000 miles away in geosynchronous orbit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR PIECE OF HARDWARE drifts into and fills the frame - 1 1960's COMMUNICATION SATELLITE, NASA & HUGHES logos affixed to the glistening aluminum hull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All is still for some moments. But then a sound disturbs the quiet of the cosmos. It's coming from the horizon. From something that looks like a hole in the fabric of space.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bright streaks of starlight swirl around into that hole.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And slowly the satellite begins drifting towards it - pulled in by some invisible force.

FOLLOW THE SATELLITE AS IT IS SUCKED INTO THE VORTEX.

EXT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - DUSK - 1998
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH the screen door, we are CLOSE ON A MAN'S FACE, staring out... JOHN F. SULLIVAN, 35. John's eyes tell us he needs more than just a shave and a good night's sleep. This man has demons. Right now he is LOOKING OUT AT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAMANTHA TAYLOR, 33. A knockout. Dark blonde hair, piercing blue eyes. Not happy. She jams a suitcase into the back seat of her car and starts back for the house.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>

She grabs clothes from teh dryer and exits to...

Samantha steps into the bedroom to an open suitcase and travel bag. She starts jamming the clean clothes into the suitcase and then begins to close the case and bag.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. We should've quit a long time ago.

Sam can't hold back anymore - she cries openly.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not your fault. It's mine. I can't change. Wish I could, Sam. But I can't.

</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
And suddenly Samantha's tears turn to anger.
</DIRECTION>
<SAMANTHA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not true and you know it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAMANTHA>

John has no reply. All he can do is watch as she takes her stuff and heads for the door.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Goodbye, Chief.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
John stands immobilized in the middle of the room. He looks down and spots a TEDDY BEAR half stuck under a reading chair. And then to a photo of him and Sam at a CARNIVAL SHOOTING GALLERY. Sam's holding the teddy bear. John turns at the SOUND of the backdoor slamming. Looks out a window down to Samantha getting in her car and driving away.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Swigging Bushmills as he steps to a combination portable phone/answering machine, John takes off his jacket. We notice two things: an NAPPED DETECTIVE SHIELD and a .38 REVOLVER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRRIING. John grabs the phone.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? It don't matter, Lady. Why?... Cause I don't got no friends or family.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
BANG. Slams down the phone. And stares around the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE'VE BEEN IN THIS HOUSE BEFORE -- 29 YEARS AGO. This was Frank and Julia sullivan's house. Time has not been good to it. Furnishings haven't changed much, but the house is missing the warmth it had when a family filled it with love.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John's eyes dart to a PHOTOGRAPH next to the desk. It is a picture of THE SULLIVAN FAMILY from back then. Too many memories. He grabs his coat, heads out...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL FIELD - QUEENS - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The field is EMPTY. Covered in shadows. John sits alone on the top row of the BLEACHERS, cradling his bottle of BUSHMILLS. He takes a long pull. As he stares down at the empty field, his eyes slowly drift over to home plate...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AUDIO FLASHBACK: a VOICE rises up out of the darkness. The voice of memory...
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Batting next. Johnny Sullivan.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the SOUNDS of CHEERING parents. The CLAPPING, WHISTLING & SHOUTING is hauntingly juxtaposed against the empty playing field and bleachers we see on the screen.
</DIRECTION>

CRACK: sound of the bat solidly connecting with the ball.

</GORDY_JR>
<DIRECTION>
John thinks about it for a second. Noting the curious glee in little Gordy's face, nods OK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gordy Jr. pops open the latches, opens the trunk. Gordo crouches down beside his son, checks out the dusty contents.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HOLD ON JOHN'S REACTION to what Gordy Jr. finds in the trunk.

Gordy Jr. reaches in and takes out: FDNY HELMET & JACKETS. Briefly puts on the enormous helmet, then sets it aside.

Reaches back into the trunk and pulls out the disassembled pieces of a 12 gauge SHOTGUN.
</DIRECTION>
<GORDO>

	Hey! Gimmie that!

</GORDO>
<DIRECTION>
Gordo takes the shotgun from the boy and places it gingerly inside the closet.

Simultaneously, Gordy Jr. hands off a leather-bound SCRAPBOOK to John. Before John can react, Gordy Jr. lifts up an AMATEUR RADIO TRANSCEIVER.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - CONTINUOUS

Glass doors separate the study from the family room. The HAM RADIO is set on a dusty wooden desk. Scotch-taped to the top of the radio is a diagram for the radio setup and "QSL" cards: certificates from around the world acknowledging "contact" with "WB2YXB" -- FRANK SULLIVAN, BAYSIDE NY.
</DIRECTION>

Gordo hooks up the radio. Gordy Jr. shuts off the TV.

GORDO TURNS THE RADIO ON. Shows Gordy how it works. Gordy rotates the tuning dial, nothing but "dead bands." STATIC.

Gordo and family pour into the yard between the two houses. John shuffles out behind them. Gordo and Gordy Jr. quickly disappear into their house, but Ellen lingers for a moment - looking back at John standing alone.

	You all right, John?

</ELLEN>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah.

Ellen holds her glance for a moment. John smiles, thinly masking his sadness. Ellen nods okay, and she is gone. John looks up at the stars, then down to the HAM RADIO ANTENNA on his roof, now looking raggedy from 29 years of neglect.

</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
John puts down the phone. Stares at the FDNY trunk. He stumbles to it. Sits down and opens it up. It's filled with his Dad's stuff. He picks up and leafs through the old SCRAPBOOK - PHOTOS and CLIPPINGS illustrate FAMILY HISTORY...

A quick glimpse of Dad's high school baseball team; Mom and Dad's 60's wedding.

A folded newspaper drops out. John picks it up. Front page of the DAILY NEWS. Top half READS: "October 13, 1969. AMAZIN'S TAKE GAME 2 - SERIES EVEN." The lower half READS: "FIREMAN KILLED IN WAREHOUSE BLAZE"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shoves the paper back in the scrapbook. Puts the album down - he can't deal with those wounds. He glances up at the TV:
</DIRECTION>
<LARRY_KING>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this anomaly connected to the space storm and the NASA satellite that disappeared in 1969?

</HAWKING>
<DIRECTION>
NOTE: Larry King's show plays for the duration of this scene.

John settles in, takes off his work shirt. Underneath he has on a T-shirt. We notice a NICOTINE PATCH on his arm. Doesn't stop him from burning another Marlboro.

Silence. The signal is gone. Frank leans forward, jiggles the frequency dial, trying to regain the signal. No luck.

The same Little League field that Frank circled on his Harley yesterday, October 10, 1969. And the same field at which John sat in the stands drinking last night, October 10, 1998.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are in the 9th inning of a friendly SOFTBALL GAME between the local COPS and FIREMEN. A lot of NYPD and FDNY T-shirts, sweats and caps. Plenty of Mets stuff, too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Having made the catch, Frank coolly pulls the ball from his mitt as he starts running toward the infield diamond. Tagging up at 3rd, sorely tempted to try for home is SATCH DELEON, 30, NYPD Detective. Satch feints for the plate, Frank feints the throw. For a maddening, gleeful moment, Frank has Satch caught between 3rd and home.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the STANDS, Johnny Sullivan, Marge Hersch and the FAMILIES of the other ballplayers scream for whomever they want to win this game of chicken.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the SIDELINES, Johnny, Gordo and the other KIDS serving as BATBOYS and WATERBOYS, jump around in anticipation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At HOME, Butch Foster stations himself to take the throw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Satch fakes to 3rd, then bolts for home. Frank pegs it to Butch, who tags the sliding Satch. Game over.
</DIRECTION>
<SATCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lucky throw, fire boy.

</SATCH>
<FRANK>

	Luck, my ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
They square off. Pretending to fight. Julia steps between them. And they all descend into laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank and Satch each wrap an arm around Julia and start off. Within a step, Johnny slips in under Frank's other arm.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	See that, kid. Practice. Practice.

INT/EXT. BUTCH'S HOUSE - DAY - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Close on a TV: PRESIDENT NIXON tosses the first ball to open the 1969 WORLD SERIES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE to see many of the PLAYERS and FAMILIES from teh softball game are parked around a couple of TVs watching the game. BEER flows from a keg. SOFT DRINKS are passed around. HAMBURGERS and HOT DOGS are cooking on the BBQ.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Satch sits with Johnny and Gordo and some other kids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank and Julia tend the BBQ. Butch brings out some beers. A fun day.

EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - DAY - 1998
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A DETECTIVE'S CAR pulls up next to a couple of BLUE & WHITES at West 155th St. The Northern tip of Manhattan Island.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across construction barricades is a half-torn down GREEK RESTAURANT. Several UNIFORMS can be seen beyond it, looking at something on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As John exits the car, the passenger door swings open and we MEET a guy we haven't seen in 29 YEARS - SATCHEL DELEON, 59. Shaved head, square jaw. A ram-rod straight, craggy warrior. Thirty-plus years on the force now endow him with a rare combination of smarts, guts and sense of humor.
</DIRECTION>
<SATCH>
<DIRECTION>
(as they walk)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't choke on your pride, Sull. You ain't ever gonna catch another one like that.

	She made up her mind. Nothin' I do is gonna change it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<SATCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing you're willing to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SATCH>
<DIRECTION>
Spotting John and Satch, a UNIFORM approaches them. They keep on walking.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the story?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<UNIFORM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Survey crew found a body. Actually a skeleton. Over here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</UNIFORM>
<DIRECTION>
The uniform leads John and Satch around some overgrown weeds to SEE a patch of freshly unearthed dirt...out of which sticks a HUMAN SKULL and COLLAR BONE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the B.G., a CRIME SCENE unit can be seen arriving by van.
</DIRECTION>
<SATCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Be real careful when pulling it out. And get the dirt around it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SATCH>
<DIRECTION>
As Satch turns to talk to a second UNIFORM and a couple of SURVEYORS, John notices a man raking leaves in a yard not far away. As he starts to him, to Satch:
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'll visit the neighbor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHEPARD RESIDENCE - DAY - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON FRED SHEPARD, 72. As the scene unfolds, we can SEE the half torn down diner/crime scene through a window. Satch oversees the operation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MRS. SHEPARD, 70, hands John a cup of coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
John looks out the window.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SHEPARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Used to get breakfast there all the time back from the boat. Them Greeks were good people. Once that McDonalds opened up on Dyckman, they lost all their business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SHEPARD>
<DIRECTION>
John glances around the room - notes family PHOTOGRAPHS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a picture of Shepard in younger days on a commercial fishing boat. Next to it a faded black and white picture of Mrs. Shepard, 35. A few pictures of the Shepards and their YOUNG SON. And at the end, a color photograph of the same son, about 20, in DRESS BLUES, graduating from the Police Academy - CLASS OF '64.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your son on the job?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<MR_SHEPARD>
	<DIALOGUE>

<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>

Shepard points to a frame above the fireplace: Distinguished Service Medal, CARL SHEPARD, awarded posthumously.
</DIRECTION>
<MR_SHEPARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My boy lived and bled blue.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MR_SHEPARD>
<DIRECTION>
Silence. Mr. and Mrs. Shepard stand very still. John discreetly glances at his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THUNDER in the distance. CRIME SCENE personnel have made some progress in unearthing the skeletal remains. A couple of drops of rain tap the ground and the bones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John stands looking down at the skeleton. A long beat. And then he turns to Satch and they start for the car. Behind them, the skeleton is carefully pulled free from the ground. WE SEE its wrists are BOUND with GLASS TAPE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</JULIA>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look who's talking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
They share a laugh. And then slowly the laughter dies. John's expression changes as he quietly lights a cigarette. Julia knows what he's thinking...
</DIRECTION>
<JULIA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	29-years tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JULIA>
<DIRECTION>
A long beat.
</DIRECTION>

Julia glances at an old photo of Frank, then back to John.

A death shudder creeps up Frank's spine. And for the first time in his life, Frank Sullivan is SCARED SHITLESS.

Frank stares up at the sky, transfixed. THUNDER punches the sky with a huge roar. RAIN starts to fall.

Frank and Gibson step into the warehouse. Butch behind them. Flames haven't reached this area yet, but the ROAR of the fire above them is deafening, and smoke billows down THE STAIRWAY before them. They sprint towards it and start up. ONE FLOOR. TWO FLOORS. THREE FLOORS, and suddenly they are face to face with a WALL OF FIRE blocking access to the 4th floor.

Now Frank's only way to go is up the stairs toward the 5th floor. He turns to Gibson. Coming up behind him is Butch. Across a gulf of flames Frank yells and waves at them to get the hell out. And then suddenly, part of the 3rd floor around Gibson and Butch starts to go.

Johnny's eyes: SHAME & FEAR - doesn't want to disappoint his father again, but too scared to get on the bike. Frank reaches out, holds Johnny's hand.

Frank lets go. Johnny keeps pumping those little six-year old legs. A bit wobbly at first, but he's gonna make it. On Johnny's eyes: determination & self-confidence.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - STUDY - NIGHT - 1998
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John walks in the front door, takes off his coat...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house looks different. Cleaner, furnishings less ragged. John moves through his home, taking in the subtle changes. He reaches the study. And there, beside the desk, is something that makes him stop:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PHOTOGRAPH on the wall beside the desk -- FRANK, JULIA & FOURTEEN YEAR-OLD JOHNNY SULLIVAN.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my God...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
The picture changed. John aged from 6 to 14. Julia's hairstyle and clothes changed from 60's to 70's. Frank's hair receded and grayed. Jon is staring at evidence of a history that didn't exist before.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John grabs the old family scrapbook he found in Frank's trunk. Opens it, unfolds "FIREMAN KILLED" CLIPPING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The main headline still reads: "OCTOBER 13, 1969. AMAZIN'S TAKE GAME 2. 2-1 LEAD. SEE SPORTS."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But the sub headline now reads: "FIREMAN RESCUES RUNAWAY FROM INFERNO"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John turns, stares at the radio questioningly. He starts to sit down at the desk when he spots something on the front edge of it. WORDS CARVED INTO THE WOOD, 29 YEARS AGO by fire fighter Frank Sullivan. The day John saved his father's life: I'M STILL HERE CHIEF
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The last letter is missing. But then a patch of wood starts to morph - as if it were being carved by an invisible knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A BURST OF STATIC. RADIO CRACKLES TO LIFE.

Frank grips the radio mic, stunned.

	Well, you think about it. And you remember, cause I don't wanna lose you again. I don't ever want Mom...

<DIRECTION>
Julia and other medical personnel are working on a heart attach victim and they are winning. She is in charge and she is impressive. Cool...efficient...expert.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sixth sense causes her to look up to see:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing behind the windows. Motionless. Gazing at his wife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julia holds on him for a split second, concern and surprise etching across her face. She turns back to her work, then says something to another ER nurse, who nods okay. Satisfied the patient is out of the woods, she peels off her gloves and heads for the door.

But Frank is silent. So they just stand there, holding each other. And then Julia notices the burn and scrape marks on Frank's arms and neck.

<DIRECTION>
The intern steps back: "Oh shit." Julia takes charge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The patient stirs: a SCRAGGLY HIPPIE, looks kind of like Pacino in SERPICO. A breathing mask covers his bearded face. Barely conscious, his eyes focus on Julia.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a quick double check of the patient, Julia looks up. Through the glass door she can see Frank watching.

A terrified and disoriented John stumbles out of bed. He moves to the bathroom. But he stops. Something is wrong. The bedroom has changed. It looks like a DUMP.
</DIRECTION>

John shakes his head, trying to blink away the nightmare. But the room does not change back. He goes to teh bathroom. Splashes his face. He looks up to the mirror and...

The same horrible instant replay. Flashes of faces swimming into the POV...

He is CROUCHED UNDER A TABLE. STARING AT THE CASKET. Alone. Bewildered. Crying.

INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

<DIRECTION>
The kitchen looks different: dirtier, uncared-for. John looks different too: like a guy on the tail end of a lifetime bender. He cracks open a Bushmills. Pours a couple of shots into his instant coffee. Several sips to settle his nerves. He reaches for the cordless phone and HITS SPEED DIAL #3.

John knocks on the door. It opens to reveal a Jamaican woman clutching a crying infant, a toddler hanging off her leg. Behind them we half recognize Julia's apartment. We know it's her apartment because of the BAY WINDOW and the view of THE GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE. But everything else is different. Different furniture. Different pain job.

John stands speechless. The Jamaican woman regards him...

Karen looks in the direction of the accident, and for a split second, her eyes lock with Frank's. Embarrassed, Frank looks away as he rights himself.

Frank checks out everyone in the bar, not knowing quite what he's looking for.

Karen slips into the booth with her friends. Ad lib HELLOS.

Frank orders a beer, but his eyes are fixed on the booth. Karen and a friend take note of Frank staring at them. Embarrassed, he turns away, checking his watch: 6:40PM. And at just that moment a SCRAGGLY MAN passes by, taking a seat at the end of the bar. We have seen this man before.

INTERCUT - INTERROGATION AND OBSERVATION ROOMS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With great ceremony John removes his watch, his gun, and lastly, his badge, and sets them off to one side.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, Daryl, sometimes, despite all the training we cops go through. Despite all that we are taught about right and wrong. Despite all that we would like to honor in ourselves, we can come to a place where we don't give a fuck. Know what I mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
And John starts up from his seat and walks toward Daryl.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You are going to tell me what I need to know, Daryl.

SUDDENLY, in the door strides...
</DIRECTION>
<SATCH>

<SATCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He ain't our guy, John.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SATCH>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just cause he didn't want to look at the photos doesn't mean he isn't the doer. Not everyone fits the profile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
Long beat.
</DIRECTION>
<SATCH>

	If he was gonna give something up he would'a done it already.

INT. PEPPERMINT LOUNGE - MEN'S ROOM - EVENING - 1969
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SUSPICIOUS MINDS filters in. Frank zips up, heads to the sink. Bends over to wash his hands, and suddenly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His face is smashed on the edge of the sink. He twists to the floor, fighting to maintain consciousness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A black Frye boot explodes into Frank's gut. He rolls over, looks up at the LONG HAIRED GUY from the bar. Frank seems to recognize him. We know him too - SCRAGGLY MAN. But we don't know his name yet. So we'll call him...
</DIRECTION>
<KILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You following me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KILLER>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Killer's eyes, evil fuckin' black dots. He lifts Frank to his knees. Then rips a fist into Frank's face.
</DIRECTION>
<KILLER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I asked you a question, asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KILLER>
<DIRECTION>
Frank is clearly incapacitated. Killer lifts him to his feet so they are eye-to-eye.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
(barely able to speak)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mary Finelli...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
A look of absolute shock wipes across the Killer's face.
</DIRECTION>
<KILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the fuck are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KILLER>
<DIRECTION>
Caught off guard, Frank is able to slam his knee into Killer's balls. Killer goes down like a stone, but Frank is too battered to take advantage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He collapses on top of Killer, who pushes him off, scrambles up, and delivers a massive kick to his head. Frank is out cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quickly, Killer rolls Frank over and rifles his pockets finding his WALLET. He grabs something from it, then tosses it aside. He then takes something out of his pocket, a thin leather garrote. He coils it around his hands and snaps it taut. He bends down to start the job when suddenly, the bathroom door opens and...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO very stoned MEN stumble in.
</DIRECTION>
<STONED_MAN_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa, dude. Is he okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STONED_MAN_1>
<KILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. He just needs a little time kissing the porcelain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KILLER>
<DIRECTION>
And Killer muscles Frank into a toilet stall and puts his head in the bowl. He closes the door, quickly leaving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the stall, Frank spills onto the floor, his legs sticking out into the bathroom. His face flush to the tile, his eyes trying to focus on something lying just outside the stall...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His WALLET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Frank starts to come around. He reaches out and grabs his wallet off the floor. His money still there. Credit cards, too. But something's missing. His DRIVER'S LICENSE.

	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay, Ma'am. I'm the police.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Old Lady skeptically looking him up & down - noticing Frank's bruised face. She quickly closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank reaches inside his jacket pocket, pulls out a small bent metal wire, homemade LOCKPICK. He goes to work on Sissy's lock. CLICK, CLICK, CLICK - got it. He opens the door, steps inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SISSY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's dark. And then a sound...scratching and popping, the sound of a PHONOGRAPH NEEDLE makes when it reaches the end of the vinyl and is scratching against the label.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wind catching a curtain allows the shaft of a street light to beam brightly into the room, and in one swift moment, Frank is staring at a NIGHTMARE: Sissy Clark's murdered body. Her dress hiked above her waist. Her panties ripped off. Paper stuffed into her mouth. Her hands bound with glass tape. Frank is transfixed and sickened by Sissy's twisted face, her eyes frozen open in horrible death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SISSY'S APARTMENT HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank staggers out of the building towards his Harley. He bends over and blows his dinner, then mounts the bike and kicks the motor over. As he roars off down the street, WE SEE in the building window...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE OLD LADY looking down at him.

<DIRECTION>

Mr. Shepard reaches to open an album. There are several photographs of the young Mrs. Shepard. A couple where she is dressed in a NURSE'S UNIFORM.

John is stunned. One can only imagine what is now racing through his mind.

Shepard says nothing, but his eyes are burning into John.

<DIRECTION>
John slips something on the bar, next to Shepard. It is a crime scene photo of Shepard's murdered mother. He reels back, totally losing his veil of composure. He is freaked.

	Who are you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEPARD>
<JOHN>

	I'm the train wreck you didn't see coming. And I'm gonna steal your life away. You went down 30 years ago. You just don't know it yet.

A long beat. Frank sees Julia staring at them. She is now a bundle of growing anxiety. Frank stands up.

<FRANK>

And then he and Satch walk out the front door.

	Where were you last night, Frank?
	</DIALOGUE>

</FRANK>
<SATCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know where I found this?

<SATCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wanna be wrong here. But we need to go to the precinct and talk about it.

</SATCH>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, okay. I need to go say something to Julia and finish up with the guy on the radio.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<SATCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can talk to Julia. Forget the radio.

</SATCH>
<DIRECTION>
Frank nods. Takes stock of the cops by the cars and heads back into the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SULLIVAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Julia, who has been watching through a front room window with Johnny, moves to meet Frank. Behind Frank, Satch signals Phil and the uniforms that all is okay, giving Frank a couple of steps on him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank steps into the house and wraps his arms around Julia, turning so he can see both Satch outside and where he wants to go inside.

Frank moves Julia toward teh desk, lulling Satch a moment, then quickly steps to the HAM radio and hits the squawk bar.

<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John, you there?

</FRANK>
<JOHN>

</JOHN>
<FRANK>

Julia stares dumbfounded at Frank.

<SATCH>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SATCH>
<DIRECTION>
Satch strides by Julia and reaches to take Frank's elbow. Frank wheels at the sound of his name and the touch, and he lurches back from Satch.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...you gotta help me, Chief.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
-- and the movement yanks the mic cord to the radio tight, dragging it to the edge of the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnny tears into the room and clutches onto his mother. "Daddy, Daddy!"
</DIRECTION>
<SATCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not the deal, Frank. Don't do this to your family.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SATCH>

And Frank throws his hands up in front of his chest in an "I give up" gesture.

And the HAM radio CRASHES to the floor in 1969.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SMASH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
1998. The HAM RADIO TRANSFORMING...a large dent appearing in its casing before John's eyes...dials cracking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dread creeps into John's face as we SMASH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHN'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see what John sees in 1998. But we also go inside his mind and glimpse flashes of new childhood memories. Memories of seeing his father arrested for murder. Images that match JOHNNY'S POV from moments ago in 1969.
</DIRECTION>

INT. 17TH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY - 1969
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank sits at a metal table bolted to the floor, Satch sits across. Phil stands. Two cups of coffee on the table. The room is very bare. Cinder block walls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Padded locks and bars over the windows. A small metal cabinet against the far wall. Satch and Phil smoke. Frank does not.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>

Satch looks over at Phil.

It's quiet for a moment. And then a sound filters in under the door. The sound of cops cheering. It's the World Series.

Frank sits up - takes a beat.

<FRANK>

	What if I could prove it to you, Satch?

<SATCH>

We hear the bolt slide, the knob turns and the door opens.
</DIRECTION>
<PHIL>

Satch nods okay to Phil. He closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<SATCH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatta you want me to tell her?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SATCH>
<DIRECTION>
Frank struggles for an answer...but comes up speechless. Satch looks like his heart is breaking. Unable to comprehend how Frank could have slipped this far. A long beat, then...
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's in harm's way. He's gonna be coming for her.

Satch snorts, incredulous. Frank reaches over the table and takes his hand, deadly serious.

Satch walks down the stairs. Julia alone on the bench.

She sees Satch approaching, stands up, looking at him for an answer, for an explanation...for hope.

<SATCH>

Julia nods okay. They exit the precinct house and into...

INT. COFFEE SHOP - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Satch and Julia sit at a booth in the back. Satch stirs his coffee, trying to start a very hard conversation. As he struggles to begin, the camera notices something in the B.G. At the counter: a few stray people gathered around watching the WORLD SERIES on an old TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AUDIO COMES UP.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 17TH PRECINCT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

Shepard passes the COFFEE ROOM. It is packed with detectives, gathered around a TV...watching the game. Phil Hayes is among them. And as Shepard passes, Phil half catches a glimpse of him as he glides down the hall and enters.
</DIRECTION>

INT. 17TH PRECINCT - INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

Frank looks up to see Shepard, who quickly closes the door behind him... and unholsters his gun. An eerie moment.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEPARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On your feet.

Frank waits a beat. Then very slowly, he stands.

<SHEPARD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now turn around, face the wall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEPARD>
<DIRECTION>
Frank steps back, slowly turning. Shepard holsters the gun. Kicks Frank up against the wall as he reaches into his pocket and takes out the leather garrote we saw in the Peppermint Lounge Bathroom. He coils it around his hands.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEPARD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

But Frank turns.

<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You try putting that thing around my neck and I'll rip your throat out. You want me dead, use the gun.

</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
Shepard smiles, unfazed...
</DIRECTION>
<SHEPARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me draw you a picture. You live at 1060 41st Ave. You have a wife who works at New York Hospital. And a six-year old at P.S. 130.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEPARD>
<DIRECTION>
Shepard gives Frank a look that would make a Marine Drill Sergeant shit his pants. Shepard knows Frank's weakness, the one thing that would make him submit to death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Closing his eyes, Frank turns to face the wall...But the door handle rattles, someone is outside coming in. Shepard quickly yanks Frank away from the wall, shoving him in a chair at the interrogation table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens.

<DIRECTION>
Frank's expression begins to harden. His eyes search teh room. CLOSE ON his EYES. He looks like John - controlled rage piercing through that Sullivan thousand yard stare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands, turning around, looking for something, anything that he can use to get the hell out of there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His mind's racing, fire fighter training kicking in. And then he looks up - just below the ceiling, above the door - a 2'X2' ELECTRICAL CONDUCTOR BOX.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Follow Frank's eyes to something else. An AIR CONDITIONER MOUNTED IN THE WINDOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank goes to the window. Runs his fingers along the air conditioner's thick electrical cord - thinking. He unplugs it. And then he RIPS cord out of the unit, exposing wire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 17TH PRECINCT - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

A loud cheer rises out of the coffee room - the game is heating up. Shepard and Phil are still standing outside the interrogation room. Shepard flashes a smile, having said something that makes Phil laugh...

	Yeah, half the uniforms are either at the game or on the street. It's gonna be a riot if they pull it off.

Julia's crying. Satch has no words to comfort her, now way of explaining any of this. He reaches out across the table...taking her hand. And as they sit quietly.

CAMERA tracks towards the counter. And we hear something that Satch does not. The sound of a voice. TV ANNOUNCER. THE SERIES...

Frank, in full throttle, drags a chair against the wall. Climbs on the chair, uses a dime to unscrew the ELECTRICAL CONDUCTOR BOX.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He then unscrews the master fuse and SHOVES ONE END OF THE ELECTRICAL CORD'S EXPOSED WIRE AROUND THE FUSE CYLINDER. After re-tightening the fuse, and careful not to touch the other end of the cord, he jumps off the chair.

Frank, sweating bullets now, takes the two coffee cups off the table and pours their contents ON THE FLOOR. The coffee forms a SMALL PUDDLE which Frank is careful not to let slip over the door saddle.

He puts the cups down. Then opens the cabinet, rifling through, finding a can of LYSOL spray.

The door knob turns. The door half-opens. Shepard sticks his head in, scanning the room. He relaxes a bit when he sees Frank sitting quietly at the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shepard opens the door a little further, takes a half step into the room...and into the puddle of coffee!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank raises his arm. He's holding the live electrical cord. Shepard: What the fuck? Frank flicks the cord...which lands like a snake at Shepard's feet...in the puddle of coffee.

5,000 volts surge through Shepard's body.

But something is wrong with the TV. A spark shoots out of the back of the set.

And then the entire 17th Precinct goes DARK. Frank has shorted out the electrical system.

The cops look at each other in a moment of pissed confusion.

Frank lunges over the table, smashing a wooden chair over Shepard's head. He's in overdrive. Kicking the still live cord out of the coffee puddle, he then drags Shepard's body into the room, shutting the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank quickly rips off Shepard's SPORTS JACKET, pocketing Shepard's WALLET and BADGE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then, moving very fast, Frank grabs the LYSOL can and the matches Phil left on the table. He LIGHTS A MATCH and holds it IN FRONT OF THE LYSOL CAN. He points the can at the ceiling - at the FIRE ALARM SENSORS. Hits SPRAY button - Professional Fire Fighter ingenuity - HOMEADE BLOW TORCH.

Sprinklers rain down on Frank as he moves down the hall. Through the darkness he can see someone coming. It's Phil. Frank covers his face...searching for a place to disappear.

Nobody breathes. All eyes on the TV.

The count is now 2-2. The pitch is a high fastball. Clendenon takes a massive swing. He nails it. HOME RUN!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The coffee shop breaks into cheers. Everyone screaming their heads off. Everyone except Satch, who just stands there, in complete and utter shock. Julia looking at him questioningly.

</DIRECTION>

Power is still off. Sprinklers still gushing. Amidst the chaos, a bathroom door swings open. A man steps out. A cop. Leather jacket, gold shield. It's Frank. He slips through the madness, heading down the hall and towards the stairs.

Frank quickly steps behind a pillar as Satch tears by him and up the stairs.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY - 1998
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John stalks down an apartment building hallway, gun drawn. He reaches a door. Two locks and a bell. Fuck 'em. John smashes his bulk into the door...one...two...three times. It bursts off its hinges. John charges in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Place is empty. Like somebody got the hell out in a hurry. A few odds and ends left behind in the haste...including a pile of unpaid bills. CARL SHEPARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John's eyes glaze over in rage and fury. But then he sees something that makes him stop and think. There is a telephone on the floor, in a corner. John stares at the phone, wheels spinning. He reaches in his coat and takes out his notebook. Flipping through pages. Notes on Shepard: social security, address, DMV registration, and a series of phone numbers...home, office, cellular.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John runs to the phone. Punches in the cell number. Ring.

INT. SHEPARD'S APARTMENT - WEST 74TH ST. - DAY - 1969
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK, CLICK -- dead bolt turning...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Front door opens and SHEPARD WALKS IN. His '69 apartment is far nicer than the place we just left John in '98.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shepard runs to the bathroom. Rips off the toilet's tank lid, reaches down and pulls out a .357 Magnum Colt Python, wrapped in clear plastic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He rips off the plastic, shoves the pistol in his waistband, heads into the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gropes behind the refrigerator, close on an envelope glass taped to back of the fridge. Shepard's hand finds the envelope...he rips it loose. And then he opens it - revealing its contents, souvenirs, POLAROID PHOTOS OF THE NIGHTINGALE MURDERS, WOMEN'S JEWELRY, NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shepard takes out a match to burn the photos. But then...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The broom closet door bursts off its hinges. Frank instantly on top of Shepard. The souvenirs go flying in the air. Frank pummels Shepard's head and back. But Shepard smashes his elbow in Frank's Adam's apple, lands a solid uppercut square on Frank's nose. Frank's eyes watering up, VISION BLURRING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank's hand, groping for the handle of a glass pitcher atop the kitchen counter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shepard reaches for his gun, points the .357 at Frank's head. Shepard's finger squeezing the trigger. It's over. But...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANK SMASHES THE GLASS PITCHER down on Shepard's skull. Shepard drops. CRACK, the gun fires, BLASTING AIR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANK scrambles for the window. He's outta there, expertly thundering down fire escape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEY BEHIND SHEPARD'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank hits the pavement, twisting his ankle. Hears metal rattling, looks up. Shepard's clattering down after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shepard tries to get off a shot through the fire escape grid. BANG! The shot ricochets wildly. Frank takes off, limping and staying close to the building out of the line of fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The streets are still empty, the city glued to their TV's. Frank hits CPW. He glances left, right, straight ahead. Central Park.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank runs into the park.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHEPARD'S APARTMENT - W. 74TH ST. - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door is kicked open. Satch and Phil enter, guns drawn. They take in the damage from the fight. Following the trail of blood back to the kitchen. And there, strewn across the floor are Shepard's photos of his victims, the newspaper clippings, the jewelry, and the envelope with the glass tape still on it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Satch knows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CENTRAL PARK BRIDGE - UNDER CONSTRUCTION - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank hears pounding footsteps - Shepard is catching up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank's adrenaline kicking in, sprints around a bend in the path, reaches long wooden bridge spanning Central Park Lake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bridge is being restored. Barricades across the entrance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank hurdles over the barricades, runs onto the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shepard trips in the dirt. Gets back up, reaches the bridge, knocks over a barricade, runs to the middle of the bridge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANK'S DISAPPEARED. Shepard stops, listens - nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CENTRAL PARK BRIDGE - UNDERNEATH - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank dangles below the bridge, holding onto the steel girder of substructure - 8 ft. above water. Not moving a muscle, not making a sound, barely even breathing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON SEWER RAT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crawling on Frank's arm. Caught off guard, Frank flinches, sending the rat tumbling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CENTRAL PARK BRIDGE - TOP OF BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bridge side railings have been removed for construction.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shepard hears something hit the water. Rushes to the side of the bridge, points his gun at the water. BANG!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shepard leans out further aiming the gun at the water. Shepard's outstretched arm only a few feet from Frank's head. Frank silently swings his body forward reaching out...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Snags Shepard's arm, pulling him hard, over the side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SHEPARD FALLS, grabs for something, anything. Wraps his arms around Frank's leg, hangs on tight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank struggles, kicks wildly, trying to shake Shepard off. Shepard hangs on with his left arm. Pulls out the gun with his right. He aims it at Frank's head. Cocks back the hammer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANK LETS GO. KERPLUNK. They plunge into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CENTRAL PARK - LAKE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Murky water, thick with dirt and slime, 5' deep.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank's hanging on to Shepard's arm, trying to wrestle the gun free. But Shepard's using his free hand to gouge Frank's eyes. Frank bites down hard on Shepard's wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gun sinks silently to the muddy lake bottom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Shepard gets both hands on Frank's throat. Shoving his head into the shallow water. Shepard's grip is like a vise, Frank futilely tries to pry Shepard's fingers open.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank is blinded by polluted water. Starting to lose consciousness. Desperately, he searches the muddy lake bottom for the gun. But he's getting weaker, fading out...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he feels something. A BRICK, fallen off the bridge, half buried in the mud. Frank struggles to dig it up. Summons his last ounces of strength, yanking it back and forth, it's getting loose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
But Shepard's hands are squeezing tighter. Frank finally goes limp. A few last bubbles float to the surface. Shepard smiles. Catching his breath, slightly loosens grip on Frank's lifeless neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank springs off the lake bottom, rises out of the water like a jack-in-the-box. Holding the brick with both hands, he swings. CONTACT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The brick smashes against Shepard's head. Knocking him to yesterday. He drops like a rock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank waits for Shepard to come up for air. Nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank crawls out of the water, collapsing onto the embankment. He just lies there, heart pounding, chest heaving.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And suddenly, Frank is startled by a MASSIVE ROAR - the sound of eight million New Yorkers screaming in unison. The Mets have just won the World Series.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank laughs, slowly getting to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CENTRAL PARK WEST & 65TH - PAY PHONE - DUSK

Frank's dripping blood and filthy lake water. The streets have instantly erupted with celebrating Mets' fans. A giant party. Cars whiz by, honking their horns, passengers leaning out, pumping fists in victory. Frank has to yell above the racket.

The shock-wave is over. But the house is different. Changed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shepard scans the changed room - disoriented, bewildered. CRASH! John pounces. Pounding blows to Shepard's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John is on top of Shepard, hands on his neck. As John squeezes the life out of him, Shepard struggles to reach down his leg with his good hand...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's something down there. An ankle holster. Shepard strains to get his hand on the gun. He does.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a flash, Shepard has the gun to John's temple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK. Shepard cocks back the hammer.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEPARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were the kid. I remember now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEPARD>
<DIRECTION>
Keeping the gun pressed against John's temple, Shepard gets to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<SHEPARD>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this time, no Daddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHEPARD>
<DIRECTION>
John closes his eyes. It's over, he knows he's gonna die.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SILENCE. Then a sound. A sound we've heard before. A sound you never forget. Music to our ears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHUUT, CHUUT, CLICK: THE SOUND OF A 12-GAUGE PUMP-ACTION SHOTGUN RATCHETING A ROUND IN THE CHAMBER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shepard looks up to see: MAN HOLDING SHOTGUN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
B-O-O-O-M: SHOTGUN BLAST: Buckshot ripping into Shepard. Impact lifting him off his feet. He lands dead on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON JOHN'S FACE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Opening his eyes. Looking up at the doorway. Blinking through shotgun smoke, trying to focus. Not believing what he sees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRANK SULLIVAN - AGE SIXTY-NINE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John looks up at his father, speechless.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm still here, Chief.

EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL FIELD - MORNING - SOME YEARS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are soaring high above a baseball diamond. Clear light air, you can see for miles. Float down to the field...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The first taste of Spring and Softball. Picnic baskets. Flowers. Kites flying. Children running.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bleachers filled with families and loved ones.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Among them sits SAMANTHA. She's smiling, she's glowing...she's pregnant. PULL BACK to reveal SATCH, GORDO, ELLEN & GORDY JR. A dalmation puppy scampers at their feet, barking in recognition as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank Sullivan steps into the batter's box.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pitcher: 22 year-old African-Amerasian, a muscular beanpole. Embroidered on the back of the his FDNY jersey is his nickname: PHIRE POWER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quick shot of first baseman. GRAHAM GIBSON - once a nervous PROBIE, now a seasoned vet. And one hell of proud father.
</DIRECTION>
<GIBSON>
<DIRECTION>
(to pitcher)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it easy on him son, he's older than Moses.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIBSON>
<DIRECTION>
Frank sneers at Gib, then glances up at GIB's WIFE in the bleachers. She looks familiar, it's the girl Frank saved in the warehouse 29-years ago.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PHIRE POWER twirls his arm...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank takes a big swing...contact...the ball fouls back behind the plate. Towards the parking lot. Where among the old Chevys and Fords sits a brand new MERCEDES. The custom license plate reads: YAHOO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CRASH! Frank's foul ball comes down hard. As the Mercedes' windshield spiderwebs we hear an off-camera scream...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is Gordo, jumping up, running across the field. From the parking lot his eyes meet Frank's. An I'M SORRY shrug, and Frank turns his attention back to the game.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The next pitch is high and outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank takes a looping swing...driving the ball to the gap in right center. Frank jogs to first. An easy single.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From first, Frank glances over at the third base coach: JULIA. Her hair pinned up under a Mets cap, Julia puts two fingers in her mouth and belts out a loud whistle as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The next batter steps out of the dugout. It is John Sullivan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John as he makes his way to the plate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Check out his eyes: they're different, he looks like his father. They've got that Frank Sullivan sparkle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John steps into the batter's box, cocks back to wood.
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bring me home, son! Bring me home!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK>
<DIRECTION>
PHIRE POWER uncorks the fastest softball pitch you've ever seen. John jumps on it. Rips a massive shot to deep center, way over the fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crew in the stands are on their feet, cheering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank rounds third, John catches up. A double high-five from Julia and they jog home together. The game is over.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Frank puts his arm around John. Heading for the bleachers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A little boy totters up to them. Jumping into John's arms. His name is Frank Jr.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey there, Chief.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHN>
<DIRECTION>
John gives his son a kiss, glances up at Samantha in the bleachers. They share a smile. And as they step off the field, his little boy reaches up, takes John's hat off his head and puts it on his own...
</DIRECTION>
<FRANK_JR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elvis has left the building...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FRANK_JR>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John's face. In his eyes, bliss.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUE Bruce Springsteen's: TAKE ME OUT TO THE BALLGAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
END CREDITS ROLL OVER:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Archival film footage. 1969 World Series. Game Five. The last pitch. Mets win. Shea stadium erupts. Fans stream onto the field. Lifting the players on their heads. The madness continues for a while, then slowly fade to Fifth Ave. Mets' ticker tape parade. It's a hell of a party.
</DIRECTION>
