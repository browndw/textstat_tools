:SC: JASON X
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WE OPEN ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An EYE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We have seen this eye before, but we can't be sure just where. It stares at us implacably. Malevolently. It blinks. Blinks again. Then closes. We are in...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DARKNESS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The darkness is slowly broken by moving vertical lines. At first we don't realize what we're seeing. But soon the lines resolve themselves into PILLARS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We are moving past pillars. A vast line of them -- cold, concrete -- marching away into the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Extreme close-ups reveal bits and pieces of maybe... a figure. We see the hint of a shoe, a link of a chain, a scrap of tattered leather... A MASK. An EYE. The eye closes and again we are in --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACKNESS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we hear FOOTSTEPS. We go from black to gray as we move past the large concrete pillars. In the distance looms --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A PEDESTAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rising high off the seeping concrete floor, it is framed by pillars on either side -- and lit from above by a single shaft of harsh white light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Something stands on the pedestal. Something huge. But from this distance we can't see what it is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Moving with the footsteps, we approach --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we are CLOSE enough to see a massive figure, wrapped in a STRAIGHT JACKET and secured by CHAINS to the floor below and the ceiling above. He is immobile, imprisoned -- chained like an animal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we get closer, we recognize this figure. His massive limbs...his MASK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A HOCKEY MASK!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And behind the mask: the eyes. The left eye is gone. Long ago gouged out and scarred over. But the right eye stares with dark, brooding fury.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON VORHEES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lives.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An IV is plugged into his neck, a steady drip of tranquilizer coming from a HANGING CLEAR BAG.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A young woman enters with a plate of brownies. Let's call her TRACEY. She stops and stares at Jason for a moment until a voice causes her to jump slightly.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNSON>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Creepy, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNSON>
<DIRECTION>
Tracey turns to see JOHNSON, a young soldier posted behind the 50 Cal.
</DIRECTION>
<TRACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRACEY>
<JOHNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I said it's creepy -- the way he keeps staring out like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNSON>
<TRACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Creepy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRACEY>
<JOHNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know you're not supposed to be in here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNSON>
<TRACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know. I just thought you'd like some company.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRACEY>
<JOHNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Love some. But Rowan would shit kittens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNSON>
<TRACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got brownies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRACEY>
<JOHNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Double-fudge?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNSON>
<TRACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	With nuts...just the way you like 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRACEY>
<DIRECTION>
Tracey offers up the plate and Johnson grabs a couple, wolfing them down. Tracey sets the plate down, turns to Johnson and reaching into her (blouse?) pulls out a camera.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNSON>
<DIRECTION>
(mouth full)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no... no way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNSON>
<TRACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on... you promised.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRACEY>
<JOHNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you kidding? If Rowan finds out we'll both get pink slips.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNSON>
<TRACEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a couple of quick shots...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(unbuttons blouse)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...something kinky?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRACEY>
<DIRECTION>
Johnson grins, mouth full of brownies, heart full of light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnson is snapping photos of Tracey posing with Jason. She mock kisses him, grabs Jason's crotch...kid stuff. It pulls slightly from Jason's neck, nearly comes out. Neither takes notice. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROWAN ENTERS
</DIRECTION>
<ROWAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROWAN>
<DIRECTION>
Johnson and Tracey compose themselves quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, doc. We were just goofing around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNSON>
<ROWAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goofing around. That's exactly what got 167 people killed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROWAN>
<DIRECTION>
Tracey grabs her plate of brownies and dashes out.
</DIRECTION>
<ROWAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (continuing; to Johnson)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to put you on report for this, Johnson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROWAN>
<JOHNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm on report. Look, we weren't hurting anything. You've been pumping him full of drugs for two years. The guy's harmless. What can he do?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNSON>
<ROWAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You better hope you don't find out. Now get back behind that weapon and keep your eyes on him at all times.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROWAN>
<JOHNSON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir. Er, ma'am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNSON>
<DIRECTION>
Johnson gets back behind the 50 as Rowan stares at Jason for a moment. Everything looks in order. She exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnson stares at Jason for a few moments then goes and throws a sheet over his head. It doesn't weigh much but its enough to pull the IV from Jason's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Johnson doesn't notice.
</DIRECTION>
<JOHNSON>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D) (continuing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stare at that, you ugly son-of-a bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOHNSON>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a nondescript sign that reads: CRYSTAL LAKE RESEARCH FACILITY. In the distance is a small concrete building. Something about its structure suggests that it leads underground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A military personnel truck stops at the concrete building. Soldiers jump out of the back and disappear into the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Wimmer moves with the soldiers towards Jason's room when Rowan comes up.
</DIRECTION>
<ROWAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROWAN>
<DR_WIMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think -- I'm taking the specimen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_WIMMER>
<ROWAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you can't. I haven't prepared the cryostasis chamber yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROWAN>
<DR_WIMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want him frozen, Doctor. I want him alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_WIMMER>
<ROWAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've already discusses this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROWAN>
<DR_WIMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, well, I went over your head. I have the Army's permission to remove the specimen to our Scranton Facility.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_WIMMER>
<ROWAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But Dr. Wimmer you can't risk transporting him through open country.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROWAN>
<DR_WIMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have to see the bigger picture here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_WIMMER>
<ROWAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've seen it, or should I remind you of the last time you tried to move him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROWAN>
<DR_WIMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've come a long way since then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_WIMMER>
<ROWAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm telling you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROWAN>
<DR_WIMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, this isn't open for discussion. His unique ability to regenerate lost and damaged tissue, even to defy death simply calls for more research.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_WIMMER>
<ROWAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're willing to risk the deaths of innocent civilians if he escapes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROWAN>
<DR_WIMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one is truly innocent, besides, I'm sure Sgt. Mazur and his men can handle the transfer. Right, Sgt.?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_WIMMER>
<SGT_MAZUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't worry, ma'am. He so much as twitches, I'll blow him right into Tomorrow-morrow land.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SGT_MAZUR>
<DR_WIMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dr. Wimmer, please...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_WIMMER>
<DR_WIMMER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've done good work on this project, Rowan, but you are no longer needed here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Mazur)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sergeant?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_WIMMER>
<SGT_MAZUR>
<DIRECTION>
(to his men)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's move him out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SGT_MAZUR>
<ROWAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROWAN>
<DIRECTION>
As they brush past Rowan and she's powerless to stop them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOLDING CELL - MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Once again, we're in the cavernous room line with pillars. Mazur and his men move quickly to surround Jason' pedestal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No one speaks. Doctor Wimmer's upper lip is slick with sweat. The men close in around the STILL-SHROUDED JASON. Some have CATTLE PRODS. Others carry noose polls with slip knots on the end. Still, others hold BILLY CLUBS at the ready. And all of them carry HOLSTERED SIDEARMS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They stand there, waiting for the word from Mazur, who goes to the pillbox and raps on the wall near the snout of the machine gun.
</DIRECTION>
<SGT_MAZUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Careful with that 50, soldier. You've got friendlies out here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SGT_MAZUR>
<DIRECTION>
Mazur then circles Jason cautiously.
</DIRECTION>
<DR_WIMMER>
<DIRECTION>
(agitated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you waiting for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_WIMMER>
<SGT_MAZUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just takin' my time, doc. I only want to have to do this once.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to his men)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, boys. Let's knock him out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SGT_MAZUR>
<DIRECTION>
Three men with CATTLE PRODS move in and administer a methodical SERIES OF JOLTS through the shroud.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shrouded figure twitches violently, then falls still. After a moment, the black shroud falls off and slips silently away. Mazur and Wimmer react with horror!
</DIRECTION>
<SGT_MAZUR>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the Christ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SGT_MAZUR>
<DR_WIMMER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It can't be!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DR_WIMMER>
<DIRECTION>
But it is.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOHNSON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of the chains is cinched around his neck. His face is ghostly blue. He couldn't be more dead. Grim realization dawns on Sgt. Mazur who spins around wildly, frantic eyes searching. Then finding...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
emerging from the pillbox. His straight jacket is split open at the seams. Broken chains hang off his wrists and drag behind his legs. He stands firm, the massive 50 in hand as if he were about to mow them all down.
</DIRECTION>
<SGT_MAZUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SGT_MAZUR>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Jason swings the massive gun, CRACKING a nearby soldier's skull.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The remaining men OPEN FIRE, peppering Jason with ordinance, but this only seems to infuriate him. Jason grabs a nearby soldier and holds him up like a shield just as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Another soldier FIRES. Riddling the captive soldier with bullets. Dropping the dead soldier, Jason windmills both arms, WHIPPING THE CHAINS over his head. One length of chain wraps around a soldier's neck. The other hits the side of Sgt. Mazur's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A soldier runs at Jason with a NOOSE POLE and tries to put the NOOSE around his neck. Jason grabs a POLE and smashes the soldier across the forehead. The soldier at the end of the chain tries to run. Jason JERKS the chain, snapping the soldier's neck and pulls him off his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dr. Wimmer turns to run, but he only gets a step before Jason throws the NOOSE POLE and spears Dr. Wimmer through the chest. He falls to his knees and forward. The tip of the pole hits the floor. Holding the Doctor up as he dies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Soon no one is left alive except Sgt. Mazur, who struggles to stand, shotgun in hand. Jason closes in. Mazur fires point blank. To no effect.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason moves toward him. Mazur disappears behind a pillar. Jason moves off down the line of pillars, heading for an exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. UNDERGROUND CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mayhem hasn't reached this hallway yet. It remains tranquil and quiet as Rowan walks along, carrying a cardboard box stenciled on the side "DESTROY".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a SOLDIER runs past.
</DIRECTION>
<ROWAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, what's the...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROWAN>
<DIRECTION>
But the soldier is GONE. Then another runs by.
</DIRECTION>
<ROWAN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROWAN>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, BOOM! A third running soldier accidentally FLATTENS ROWAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The box goes flying, scattering JASONIANA all over the hallway: blood-encrusted work gloves, newspaper clippings. We watch one ARTIFACT go skittering across the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JASON'S MACHETE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The soldiers disappear through a door. Sounds of GUN FIRE and SCREAMS echo through the hall. Rowan struggles to her feet and moves slowly down the hall towards the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WHAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door flies off its hinges as Sgt. Mazur lands nearby. Rowan, blood pouring from his mouth, kneels beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<SGT_MAZUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out of here! Get out now!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SGT_MAZUR>
<ROWAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROWAN>
<SGT_MAZUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's escaped!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SGT_MAZUR>
<ROWAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damnit, Wimmer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROWAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Sgt. dies in her arms. She takes his shotgun, locks and loads, and moves off down the dark hallway.
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	JASON VORHEES
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
comes into the corridor, filling it with his bulk, back-lit and ominous.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason picks up his old MACHETE. It fits in his hand like an old friend. He moves past the dead Sergeant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRS SUBTERRANEAN - LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ROWAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Steel steps ring with her footsteps as Rowan pounds down the stairs. She shivers with the cold as she looks for a place to hide among the huge tanks and gothic-looking ducts and pipes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason moves down the stairs into the subterranean lair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON ROWAN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She crouches in the dark, shotgun cradled in her arms. She spots a large STEEL DOOR and moves to it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CRYO LAB - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rowan darts behind a RACK OF GAS CANISTERS. Jason enters, his machete ready. In one corner, the door to a boxy, cell like chamber. THE CRYO UNIT. Stands open. There's no sign of the girl.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason looks around, seeking his prey. Suddenly, Rowan STEPS OUT OF HIDING, shotgun at the ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The point-blank blast nails Jason in the back and drives him forward. He spins as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's hit in the knee. He stumbles but doesn't fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABLAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason is hit in the shoulder. But doesn't fall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This isn't working. Thus Rowan glances to a ROLLING RACK OF GAS CANISTERS beside her. USING her foot, she shoves the rack,
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wheels squeak as it rolls forward finally stopping at Jason's feet. Jason looks at the rack like "You gotta be kidding me..." He looks back to:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rowan, who just grins and lowers her shotgun. She fires at the canisters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KABOOM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The canister's pressurized contents explode, sending Jason falling into the Cryo Chamber. Rowan dives for cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hurling herself across the cryo lab, Rowan slams shut the Cryo Unit door. And Jason is trapped inside.
</DIRECTION>

THROUGH CRYO UNIT WINDOW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear a sibilant HISS as CRYO GAS cascades over Jason. His movements slow as the coldness sets into his flesh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly the hiss dies away as the unit goes silent and still. Rowan breaths a sigh of relief. She sags against the door. Then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE MACHETE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BURSTS through the steel door and into Rowan's gut. ALARMS SOUND.

	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
She grabs the edges of the door, but it swings inexorably closed. She yanks her fingers away at the last second before they're pulverized by the closing door. Massive pressure bolts suss the door shut.

Rowan, frozen on the floor, and Jason, motionless behind the Cryo Unit Door.

INT. SUBTERRANEAN LAIR - 445 YEARS LATER

PITCH BLACK. A light slices through the darkness. Then another. Illuminating the stale air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cloaked figures, holding lights, move down the concrete steps and into the dusty space below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They reach the LARGE STEEL DOOR. Ice has crusted over the window in the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CYRO LAB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A thick layer of ice and frost covers the floor and ceiling. Through the door we can see lights on the other side of the frozen door.

Now we hear a HUMMING sound followed by TURNING GEARS. Then the sound of CRACKING ICE as the metallic door opens.

The mixture of warm and cold air creates a THICK FOG. Through the fog steps a BEAUTIFUL FEMALE (19-22). We notice that her movements are fluid, perfect and precise. Almost too precise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is KAY-EM 14, and as time goes on, we realize that she's a science droid.

She casually glances around the room, sniffs the air, then speaks in a warm contralto that is, like her movements, almost too exact.

A SHADOW FALLS over her. She adjusts her light. She turns and stares in silent shock at Jason. She opens her mouth to scream, but Jason GRABS HER by the throat! She kicks wildly as he studies her, then --

Looking up, as Adrienne's face is shoved into the liquid nitrogen. Her SCREAMING face FLASH FREEZES before our eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her body goes limp. Jason pulls her up and stares at her frozen head. Her eyes open, mouth locked in a scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shoves her head against a counter top. The head SHATTERS and the pieces rain down on the floor as he tosses the body across the room.

Jason heads for the door. Pauses. A glint of gleaming metal catches his eye.

The tray is full of futuristic autopsy instruments: self powered cutting utensils, chest crackers, rib spreaders, and one very, very, VERY LARGE chrome, sharp, lethal blade. Jason's wet dream of a killing tool.

STALKING POV

Something watches Dallas, his back to us. Dallas stops, listens. He stares toward the stalker, but sees nothing, then continues on.

The stalker closes in. Suddenly Dallas rolls and comes up with his weapon ready.

HIS POV

A huge ALIEN CREATURE leaps at him, all dripping fangs and sharp claws. Dallas FIRES! The blaster hits home. The alien is blown to pieces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His back against a stack of STEEL CRATES, Dallas SIGHS and wipes his brow. Suddenly another ALIEN rises from behind the crates. It leans in close over Dallas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A glob of clear, shiny goo drips from its mouth and splats on Dallas' helmet. Dallas feels the impact and rubs hi hand up there tentatively. Apprehensively.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and looks up. There's nothing Dallas can do. He's a goner. Then --

FZZZZT! A burst from elsewhere BLASTS the creature.

Jason steps up behind him. Brodski spins and fires. But Jason absorbs the rounds without flinching. He twists the rifle from Brodski's grip and flings it across the bay.

She works her way edgily across the Cargo Hold, the GRUNT GUN held ready.

She continues, an act of sheer will. At last she reaches the corner of the STOR-POD where she thought she saw the body. She braces herself, whips around the corner to see --

<DIRECTION>
NOTHING

<DIRECTION>
Just two bloody steel rods sticking through the STOR-POD.

Rowan takes a few steps backward, panic seeping in. Suddenly she senses danger to her right -- jumps back and levels the grunt-gun all at the same time. She's this close to firing when she sees --

<DIRECTION>
BRODSKI

Trashed. Laying on the floor of Cargo Bay. How he managed to drag himself off the steel rods is anybody's guess.

JASON

Brings his machete down when suddenly --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BRODSKI rises behind Jason and STABS him in the leg.
</DIRECTION>
<ROWAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Brodski!

Jason reaches down and breaks the knife blade. Kay-Em glances up at Brodski.

<KAY_EM_14>

The exertion and loss of blood leaves Brodski weak. He stumbles, nearly falls, but Rowan and Waylander catch him.

<KAY_EM_14>

The slugs BURST through the back wall, SHATTERING the assorted glassed specimens.

INT. WALKWAY "B" - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason must be wondering why Kay-Em fired AROUND and not AT him, but he doesn't contemplate the moment, instead he raises his weapon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kay-Em opens fire again, BLOWING Jason's arm off. Jason stares down at the severed limb as Kay-Em barrels toward him. She spins and throws a round-house kick, SLAMMING him RIGHT THROUGH the shattered wall!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LAB ONE - CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jason tumbles through SHATTERING the remaining specimens, which fall all around him and cover him with goo. He lands in front of the N2.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kay-Em leaps through the hole firing, then holsters her gun. She reaches back and retrieves the rocket launcher. If Jason could speak, his first words would probably be "Oh shit!"
</DIRECTION>
<KAY_EM_14>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I'm gonna fuck you up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KAY_EM_14>
<DIRECTION>
And then Kay-Em unleashes a final SAVAGE ONSLAUGHT of firepower. A rocket blows his leg to hell. Another slams into the side of his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And finally, Kay-Em zeros in on his head and fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV THROUGH JASON'S MASK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rocket screams right toward him, then --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KAFOOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A third of his mask and skull is blown to hell. The remaining mass drops to the ground. And now -- finally -- Kay-Em approaches with Jason's machete. She spikes it ceremonially in the last little lump of Jason that remains.

The N2 continues to twitch and spasm, sending random scanning beams around the lab.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
