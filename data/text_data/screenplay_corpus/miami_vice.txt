The exception is "Born to Win's" sponsor, a blonde, dreadlocked, bearded 6'4" SWITEK. He looks like a dot-com entrepreneur who got out in time.

Crockett and Tubbs are directed to get out. They're pushed around and searched. A working class Glaswegion Scot, a couple of 5'10" Brits are off to the side with short hair and shoulders that are too deep and faces like Rugby players (ex- SAS). Russians are ex-KGB. Languages overheard: smatterings of Russian, Hebrew and English. Crockett and Tubbs look at each other: they get it. This is the cream of private sector security. And it says top dollar infrastructure.

The arms and back belong to the deep- chested Aryan Brother we saw from the Stevens' house and Coleman's double-wide. MOVE IN ON GINA. He reaches below the frame and does something.
