</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON... A BRONZE PLAQUE which reads, "PEARL STREET BRIDGE."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE BRIDGE... RAIN POURS DOWN. An SUV steers out of control and CRASHES into a STALLED OUT VEHICLE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's quiet NOW, EXCEPT FOR THE INCESSANT pounding rain. IN THE DISTANCE, police lights approach.

EXT. PEARL STREET BRIDGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THROUGH A TELEVISION CAMERA... The image is GRAINY and FRENETIC. A HEAVY RAIN POURS DOWN on a MELEE OF ACTIVITY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POLICE CARS block either end, their LIGHTS ignite the sky in a dizzying RED and BLUE design. The attention centers on...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The SUV and the CRASHED VEHICLE lay in the middle of the bridge. A MAN, 30's, madness on his face, his right hand holds a HOSTAGE, a woman, 20's, racked with fear, tight to his body. His left holds a GUN!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two DETECTIVES, slowly approach the Man. ONLY SEE THE DETECTIVES FROM BEHIND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A News Reporter, KAREN CROSS, 30's, blond with energy to burn, shields herself from the rain, steps in front of the camera...
</DIRECTION>
<KAREN_CROSS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Police on scene are approaching the suspect. They're at the center of the Bridge now.
	</DIALOGUE>

A loft apartment, scarcely furnished, except for BOOKS, HUNDREDS OF THEM, fill stacks of shelves. Hearing but not watching the television, METICULOUSLY preparing a GIN AND TONIC, is...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DETECTIVE QUENTIN CONNERS, a grizzled, intense veteran. His charisma, which he has in spades, gets him into as much trouble as it gets him out of. At present a somber mood. The shadows from the rain stream down Conners's face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE GLASS'S REFLECTION... The TV Report plays. (NOTE: most of, if not all, of the TV report will in reflection.)

The IMAGE cuts to an earlier interview with... CAPTAIN MARTIN JENKINS, 50's, chronically tired and unsympathetic.
</DIRECTION>
<JENKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In a civilized society, the men and women entrusted with serving and protecting the community are to be held accountable just like everyone else. Simply put... Just because you are a cop, doesn't mean laws don't apply to you. This is no longer the wild, wild west.

BLACK CLAD #2 ushers people out of side offices, gun-points them into the lobby!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK CLAD #1 races upstairs, gathers people from the 2nd level, forces them downstairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the corner of Lorenz's eye... The SECURITY GUARD's hand creeps toward his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<LORENZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That... you don't want to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORENZ>
<DIRECTION>
The Security Guard reluctantly obeys. BLACK CLAD #1 DISARMS the Guard, then GUN BUTTS HIM over the head! The Guard drops, unconscious! CUSTOMERS, EMPLOYEES scream out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Black Clad #1 rips keys from the Guard's belt, tosses them to Black Clad #2!

</DIRECTION>
<JENKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you seen my watch?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENKINS>
<DIRECTION>
Teddy gestures to the night stand. Jenkins retrieves the watch. He also slides his WEDDING RING back on. This ain't love, this is a relationship of convenience.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jenkins slips on his jacket, secures his tie and, after one last check in the mirror...
</DIRECTION>
<JENKINS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This was fun. You should get out of bed. You'll be late for work.
	</DIALOGUE>

And with that, Jenkins exits. Teddy waits for the door to close, then collapses back onto the bed.

BEHIND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WINDOWS--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An EAGER TELLER, 30's, seizes the moment. He reaches up and PRESSES THE SILENT ALARM BUTTON!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BLACK CLAD #4 turns just in time to see it, quickly FIRES his weapon! The Eager Teller slumps against the wall, BLEEDS profusely from his neck, not dead yet.

Lorenz hustles over to Black Clad #4.

</BLACK_CLAD_4>

Lorenz GLARES DISGUSTEDLY at his accomplice.
</DIRECTION>
<LORENZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would've made more sense to shoot him before he pushes the fucking alarm. Not after.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at the Eager Teller)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus.

	And... If you're going to do something.

</CONNERS>
<LORENZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone who matters is fine. Of course, I would've preferred not having the authorities involved at all. We weren't planning to be here this long. But, since Seattle's finest needs a presence on the scene, I'm glad it's you.

<CONNERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My fame proceeds me.

<LORENZ>

	Don't be flattered. I needed someone who's been through the experience before. Hopefully this time it will go better for all involved. I plan on living a full, long and rich life. I didn't, however, expect them to find you so quickly. I thought you were suspended.

<CONNERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Someone's dead?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONNERS>
<LORENZ>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Theory... put to practice isn't always perfect. Can't expect to keep the hostages in check if a bad deed goes unpunished or they may... randomly decide to revolt. Chaos... has some order to it.

Time. The word rings in Conners's head. He starts to put it together.
</DIRECTION>
<CONNERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Precisely. He knows police protocol, not to mention the shit in our own precinct. He's disguising his voice, means he's got a record and has done this before. He's heavily armed and well-connected. He knows he's surrounded. He hasn't asked for a damned thing. He drops that hint about sunrise, prepping us for a long wait. He's buying time. Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONNERS>
<VINCENT>
<DIRECTION>

	The hostages are in imminent danger. They've confessed to killing someone, an automatic murder one charge - that's a life sentence, maybe a needle for all of them. So why keep witnesses around to testify? Longer we wait, the greater the risk. We need to go in. Now.

Now, depending on who you talk to... there was anywhere from five to nine perps. And nobody got a good look at any of'em, wore their masks the whole time. Dax is rounding up the security tapes now. That should give us a firm number.

But he's already gone.

<DIRECTION>
DEKKER hops onto the fire escape, hoofs down the iron stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richards... drops to the pavement. Heads for the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DEKKER, a flight from the bottom, realizes his disadvantage and HURLS himself over the rail! Hits the ground HARD, WIPES OUT!

<DIRECTION>
Jumps up, shaking it off. STAYS IN PURSUIT!

Dekker races around the corner... A FORD F-350 SPINS the corner. Targeting DEKKER!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dekker jerks out his Glock. FIRES!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BULLETS RICOCHET OFF THE GRILL, SPARKS FLY! Windshield spiderwebs. But this train ain't slowing down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The F-350 swerves, clips a Harley.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dekker JUMPS before impact, bounces off the hood and rolls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The truck hits the street, speeds away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dekker, grimacing through the pain, scrapes himself off the pavement. Dekker's eyes dance... spot THE HARLEYS.
</DIRECTION>

<DIRECTION>
Richards' Truck speeds around a SLOW MOVING VEHICLE and whips into an alley.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
I/E HARLEY-RICHARDS' TRUCK/ ALLEY #1 - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Richards fishtails down the alley. Barely maintaining control. GARBAGE DUMPSTERS are littered about creating an obstacle course. Dekker pursues.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
I/E HARLEY-RICHARDS'S FORD TRUCK/ INTERSECTION - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richards barrels out of the alley, through the intersection and into another alley. Opposing traffic skids out. ANGRY DRIVERS let him have it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dekker skids sideways, steers around the blockage. Catches sight of...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWN THE BLOCK... A PATROL CAR speeds down Hastings Street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dekker revs the engine, maneuvers around the ANGRY DRIVERS and follows Richards into the SECOND ALLEY!

Richards races, checks the rearview mirror... Dekker's Hog closing in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
UP AHEAD... The alley exits onto RICHARDS STREET.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richards approaches the mouth of the alley, just as A STREET CLEANER appears, starts to block the exit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richards STAMPS ON THE ACCELERATOR, speeds through the small opening, just past the Street Cleaner!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dekker's not so lucky. Sees the Street Cleaner too late... Lays out the hog and rolls just as... The Hog slides into the Street Cleaner!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
I/E RICHARDS' TRUCK/ STREET INTERSECTION/ PATROL CAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Dekker gets up, looks down the street, SEES...

Richards getting away, speeds down the street, through another intersection, when...
</DIRECTION>

CRASH! Conners, in a patrol car, plows into the rear of the truck, spinning it around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dekker races towards the crash site.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Conners climbs out of the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Richards shakes his head, clearing it. Blood squirts from his mouth. He sees, through the windshield, Conners coming for him. He scrambles for his handgun, looks up to see Conners, but he's not there. Richards turns as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Conners appears in the Driver's side window, grabs the back of Richards' head and SLAMS it into the steering wheel! Again!

Conners reaches inside, grabs the handgun. As Dekker arrives...

(To Dekker)
</DIRECTION>

Marnie gives DEKKER an amorous glance, which he returns.
</DIRECTION>
<MARNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Dekker)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You, on the other hand... I gotta bike myself. Maybe we can go for a ride sometime? Or maybe I can just ride you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARNIE>

Conners looks at both of them.
</DIRECTION>
<CONNERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can we get back to work?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONNERS>
<MARNIE>

	We got passports, sun tan lotion, Bermuda shorts, thong bikini, hopefully hers and this...

She opens a LARGE DUFFEL BAG. Conners and Dekker look inside the bag... It's FULL OF CASH! All denominations.

</MARNIE>
<DEKKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEKKER>
<MARNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't put words in my mouth, but... Two things jump out here. First, each bank branch has their own money bands. This is not American National's. After a little checking, it belongs to Pacific Savings of Seattle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARNIE>
<DEKKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That sounds familiar.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEKKER>
<MARNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It should. Four months ago, a half million dollars was stolen in an armed robbery there. Just a smash-n-grab job. They caught the guys a day later, recovering about $400,000. Those guys have been in lock up since and their trial's still pending. Which leads us to point number two. Do you smell that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARNIE>
<DEKKER>
<DIRECTION>
(smells the bills; grimaces)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEKKER>
<MARNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When evidence is taken in, any physical contact might affect the ability to lift prints, so, to mark it, we now spray a scented solution directly on the bill.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARNIE>
<CONNERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that new?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONNERS>
<MARNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wave of the future. Gotta keep up with the times, Conners.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARNIE>
<DEKKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So this money's not from our bank.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEKKER>
<MARNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. This is the money from the Pacific Savings job and our evidence room.
	</DIALOGUE>

	When you said it was your "family business" I didn't think... I guess I just didn't connect the dots.

<DEKKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. No relation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEKKER>
<CONNERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Captain, he just kind of "discovered" you. Through the academy, to excellent evaluation reports, while on the beat, to the high test scores on the detective's exam.

</CONNERS>
<DEKKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something like that.

A small, cold room with a large mirror along the WEST WALL.

Gina sits at the table, shivering. Her breath visible, so are her nipples through a WHITE, SEATTLE P.D. T-SHIRT. Conners paces around her like a CIRCLING SHARK. Dekker's in the corner, observing.

	Me!? I didn't do nothing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GINA>
<CONNERS>
<DIRECTION>
(frustrated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's "I didn't do anything." "Didn't do nothing" is a double negative, infers the positive. The grammar in this country sucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONNERS>
<GINA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then I didn't do ANY-thing!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GINA>
<DIRECTION>
Conners takes a seat next to Gina. His EYES BURN through her.

	This isn't going away. You want to walk out of here, you tell me something... now.

<DIRECTION>
The small home in a RURAL AREA is now COMPLETELY SURROUNDED by COP CARS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BERNIE CALLO'S HOME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A typical family-themed home. FAMILY PICTURES adorn the walls. Everything in its right place. Except for... MRS. CALLO, 40's, sits in the kitchen SOBBING. Police encircle her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the center of the Living Room... BERNIE CALLO LIES DEAD, a bullet wound right between the eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SEVERAL UNIFORMED OFFICERS and CSI OFFICERS muddle through every nook and cranny of the tiny home. Conners, Teddy and Dekker are led around by a UNIFORMED OFFICER...
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER_AT_CALLO_HOUSE>

Vincent enters from the basement carrying a LARGE BOX.
</DIRECTION>
<VINCENT>

Lorenz stares ahead, transfixed by something.

<LORENZ>

	Are you connecting the dots? Are you putting it together? Is the pattern emerging? They wouldn't punish you, but I will.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LORENZ>

Dekker leans back against the car, Conners approaches...
</DIRECTION>
<CONNERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What they told Callo was the plan and what the plan really was may be two different things. Clearly this wasn't part of a plan Callo would've agreed with.

</CONNERS>
<DEKKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd think a cop would be smarter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEKKER>
<CONNERS>

	<DIALOGUE>
	So, Callo was involved and now they're dragging you into it. Why?

	</DIALOGUE>
</JENKINS>
<DEKKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me get this straight, they didn't touch the cash or the safe deposit boxes. So, they... break into a bank, blow it up, and steal nothing?

Dekker watches as BERNIE CALLO's body is loaded into the Coroner's vehicle. Teddy assists MRS. CALLO into a police car. Vincent carries the box of evidence from the home.

Dekker and Conners watch as Dax operates.

<DAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The tapes confirm five bad guys, but since the vault cam blew in the explosion what they did in there was a mystery.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAX>
<DIRECTION>
ON A COMPUTER MONITOR - The EIGHT SECURITY CAMERA ANGLES appear.
</DIRECTION>

ON THE MULTIPLE SCREENS... Just as in the opening, Lorenz leads this crew through the bank. Immediately the group splits up. IN THE VAULT... One of the Black Clads arrives and radios in.

Dax rewinds, to before the explosion...

<DEKKER>

	There. Stop. Play it. Look closely, camera five, the vault cam, dominates our attention because of the explosion. But while that's happening, check out Camera two, customer service.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DEKKER>
<DIRECTION>
ON SCREEN... Several BANK EMPLOYEES cower to the Black Clad. Suddenly, another Black Clad DISAPPEARS UNDERNEATH THE SECURITY CAMERA.
</DIRECTION>
<DAX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd he go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAX>
<DIRECTION>
ON SCREEN... As the EXPLOSION GOES OFF, CAMERA #2 PANS AWAY FROM THE CUSTOMER SERVICE SECTION, TOWARDS THE LOBBY.
</DIRECTION>
<CONNERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He moved it. Changed the angle. He didn't want us to see something.

Dax rewinds the tapes again, before the camera was moved and FREEZES FRAME ON: a lone COMPUTER TERMINAL in the corner.

Dekker and Conners look on.

	Last time I was here, you said that table in the corner was the "best in the house."

LATER, STILL AT THE RESTAURANT--

<DIRECTION>
A PIANO PLAYER recreates the sweet sounds of Italy. PATRONS sing along. Eating, drinking and being merry.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT THE DETECTIVE'S TABLE--
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Vincent and Teddy have joined Conners and Dekker. A MOUNTAIN OF FOOD still remains. A COUPLE BOTTLES OF WINE have been consumed, empty plates and basket rolls spread about. The mood is happy, light. Not thinking about their day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Conners tells an anecdote, something that Teddy and Vincent have heard before, but don't care. Dekker watches the Detectives, admires in their closeness.
</DIRECTION>
<CONNERS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shane, what was that thing you said back at the house about "returning to the beginning path" or something?

	He can talk to an elephant?

	</DIALOGUE>
</DEKKER>
<VINCENT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't believe what you read or see on TV. If anything, our tie to Conners is stronger. He's one of the best. Even when things got pretty wild today and everyone else panicked, he was in control. That doesn't just happen. He's just that good.

	It's a computer virus. "The Computer Virus." It randomly withdraws money from all the accounts and deposits it into the bad guys' account. If you check the transactions, no two withdrawal amounts are the same and none of'em are over $100. Most security systems work on the size of the money, not number of transactions. Wire out one million from a handful of accounts and red flags go up. Wire out a less than a hundred from ten million accounts, no flags.

ON TOP OF A CONTAINER... York UNLEASHES, until... CLICK! Out of ammo.

Dekker, hearing this, pops up, RETURNS FIRE!

York leaps off the backside of the container!

Dekker approaches the tug. Each step slow and deliberate. EYES TRANSFIXED on the seaplane.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he nears the Seaplane... A SHADOW RISES from BEHIND HIM. From on top of the TUG BOAT!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dekker turns just as...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
York throws a fishing net on top of Dekker. As Dekker struggles in the net, HIS GUN DISCHARGES!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
York with a PIKE POLE in hand, leaps down, CLUBBING Dekker over the head with the weapon. Dekker goes down!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dekker's gun SLIDES off the dock, into the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
York charges Dekker with the PIKE POLE, ready to stab, when...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the last second... DEKKER ROLLS AWAY! THE PIKE POLE BREAKS A WOODEN PLANK TO PIECES, sticks into the ground beneath the water.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dekker, still tangled in the net, KICKS OUT York's legs. He falls to the planks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
York quickly rebounds. He POUNCES on Dekker, from behind he wraps his arm around Dekker's throat, CHOKING HIM.

Dekker wildly SWINGS at York who dodges easily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
York SLAMS Dekker into the side of the TUG. Still choking.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dekker, on his last gasp, PUSHES OFF THE TUG!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
York stumbles backwards, GETS HIS FOOT CAUGHT IN THE HOLE! He twists, spinning around, falling down onto...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... THE REMAINING PIKE SPEAR! The Pike punches through his chest... POPS out his back!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
York, blood and life escaping him, his eyes find Dekker. Then go dead.
