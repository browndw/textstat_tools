EXT. BANK - DOWNTOWN - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hostage situation. Police barricades. Dozens of squad cars, ambulances, spectators, SWAT team. It's a stalemate. Roper's Trans Am pulls to a stop at the barricades. He hops out, weaves through the spectators and past the barriers.

A FEMALE DETECTIVE, EIKO KIMURA, rushes up to him.

Kimura points to the diner in the middle of the block. Roper heads toward it. As they walk Kimura briefs him...
</DIRECTION>
<KIMURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The suspect came in shortly after the bank opened. Botched robbery. A teller hit the silent alarm. He took seven hostages. Shot one -- the guard. He's still alive. So far he's asked for...

Across from the bank. This is where the "command post" is setup. About a dozen cops and the accompanying support staff are here. Lieutenant SAMUEL BAFFERT is in charge. Roper saunters in.

Roper walks over to the counter where Baffert is standing.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do we have a profile on Mr. Earl?

Baffert hands him a folder. Roper opens it.

Roper refers to the folder.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got a guy who's probably on drugs. He's got a record of 459's and he was busted on possession. But he's never been busted on a major felony. What's his demeanor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<KIMURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well he's a little fucking agitated -- he ripped the phone out.

</BAFFERT>
<ROPER>

	You got 7 hostages in there, 1 of them's wounded -- We don't know how bad it is -- The guy ripped the phone out -- SWAT said he's got a gun to the head of a female hostage. If SWAT makes entry now, you're gonna lose 1 hostage, maybe 2. I gotta go in. Maybe I can see what's going on in there.

<BAFFERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.

	Not that we know of.

	Maybe we can get a throw phone in there.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crouches motionless, staring through the scope of his rifle, watching as Roper calmly walks toward the bank.
</DIRECTION>
<FORBES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you think he's got in the bag?

INT. BANK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tense situation. A wild-eyed, white punk, fuck-up of a BANK ROBBER, EARL, is holding a pretty, young TELLER around the neck with a cocked gun held to her temple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other bank employees are cowering on the floor. A few are giving aid to the wounded bank guard who is half-conscious and oozing blood from his side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roper strolls right through the front door and walks toward Earl, very sociable.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Earl, I'm Scott Roper. Wanna donut? I ate the glazed but there's a bunch of chocolate and a --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
Earl swipes the donuts out of Roper's hand and starts frisking Roper for weapons with his free hand. The other hand still has the gun poised at the young teller's head.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a negotiator, Earl. I don't carry a weapon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
Roper smiles reassuringly at the pretty teller. It seems to help. Earl finishes patting Roper down, straightens back up and puts his hand around the teller's neck.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's the car?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to get something straight first.

</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
Roper looks over at the other bank employees huddled on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's the manager?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
A balding, middle-aged MAN sheepishly raises his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANAGER>
<DIRECTION>
Roper takes a step toward him.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When did you start keeping longer hours?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last spring.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANAGER>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really! Because I've been thinking of moving to this branch. It would be really convenient for me --
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	HEY, SHUT UP!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
Earl wags his gun against the Teller's ear.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want me to start killing people?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
Roper holds his hand up defensively.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my job to see that no one gets killed, Earl... Including you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then where's my FUCKING car!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
Earl is pouring sweat. His gun hand is shaking uncontrollably.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm getting it, Earl, but we have to do this the right way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
Roper keeps his eyes locked on Earl. His voice is calm.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First I need you to point that gun away from --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the teller)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your name?

<TELLER>
<DIRECTION>
(voice trembling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Debbie...

</TELLER>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Point the gun away from Debbie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Debbie's brains are going to be splattered all over the floor if I don't see a car in five minutes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
Roper takes a long look at Earl. The guy is a hair trigger.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright! But let's be clear about one thing. If you kill someone, I can't help you. The SWAT guys will take you out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
Earl glances at the army of cop cars poised outside. Reflects for a moment on the reality of the situation.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are my chances of getting out of here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
Roper calmly moves toward where the wounded guard is laying.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not bad. Last month, a guy robbed a bank in Daly City...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
Roper crouches down, smiles at the blurry-eyed guard.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How ya doin'?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
The guard groans. He's not doing very well. Roper peels back the bloody handkerchief, takes a look. Winces.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Earl)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Cops gave him a car, and he lost them on the freeway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
Earl is encouraged by that.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely. Bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
Roper looks directly into Earl's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He didn't kill anybody, though.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
Roper bends over the guard.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is gonna hurt.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs the guard under the arms and starts dragging him across the floor. The guard MOANS piteously.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, leave him alone. What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
Roper keeps dragging the guard toward the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's part of my negotiator's oath. If there's an injured party and I can help them, I'm duty bound by my oath to do that. You can shoot me if you want, but the next negotiator in here is going to tell you the same thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
Earl is unsure what to do, but he guesses an oath is an oath. He lets Roper drag the guard to the door.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be right back, Earl. Point that gun away from Debbie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
Earl compliantly moves the gun away from the teller's head, then re-thinks and jerks it back against her temple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BANK - DAY

Roper drags the guard out the front door and deposits him on the sidewalk. Two SWAT OFFICERS rush up to give aid. One of them is Jennings.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering to Jennings)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me your gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
(NOTE: The method of disarming Earl is still to be determined) Jennings inconspicuously pulls his gun out and slips it to him. Roper quickly cocks it and shoves it in his waistband under his shirt and vest.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't had to shoot anyone in three years.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<JENNINGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not keep the streak alive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JENNINGS>
<ROPER>

	Because this strung-out junkie is too stupid to get out of this without killing somebody.

	HEY, WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING OUT THERE!

The two cops hustle off with the wounded guard, and Roper calmly walks back into the bank. Stops about five paces from Earl.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As a rule, I need one hostage released as show of good faith.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
Roper glances at Debbie. Gun pressed against her head. Tears start rolling down her cheeks. She's being tremendously brave.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me Debbie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
Earl squeezes the gun even tighter against the side of her head.
</DIRECTION>
<EARL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take the old guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</EARL>
<DIRECTION>
The other hostages watch this exchange tensely.

<EARL>

	Take them.

Roper decides that this is the best he's going to get.

<ROPER>

	Oh, there's one last thing.

In one swift motion, Roper turns, aims and FIRES!...

One SHOT. It tears into Earl's shoulder. One inch from Debbie's neck. Earl is blown back against the counter. Debbie shrieks at the top of her lungs.

EXT. STREET - SHORT TIME LATER

Roper is exiting the bank and putting back on his gun when he hears the sound of a CAMERA SHUTTER. He turns to see VERONICA (RONNIE) TATE holding the camera. She snaps one of Roper with Earl in the b.g. being placed in a squad car.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>

She takes the lense cap off her camera. Roper primps his hair to make sure he looks good for the picture... CLICK! Suddenly Roper notices that his Trans Am is being towed. He rushes over to his car.

<ROPER>

	Hey, that's my car.

INT. METRO DIVISION HEADQUARTERS - DAY - RAINING

INT. HALLWAY - DAY - RAINING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A quiet contrast to the squadroom. This is the executive branch of Metro. All the big-wigs are officed here. Roper walks down the carpeted hall. No one here except Kevin McCall quietly sitting outside Captain Solis' office. Roper and McCall make brief eye contact. Roper thinks nothing of it. He goes into the Captain's office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAPTAIN SOLIS' OFFICE - RAINING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAPTAIN FRANK SOLIS is on the phone. There's a file on the desk in front of him. He motions Roper to sit down.

</ROPER>
<SOLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's been some concern about you continuing to work without back-up.

Solis dumps his cards on the table.

<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your concern is heartwarming.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that what the guy in the Sunday School suit is doing outside?
	</DIALOGUE>

Roper grabs an empty soda bottle from a neighboring desk. He takes the cap off a ball point pen and drops it into the empty bottle. He places the bottle on his desk.

Roper grabs his jacket and walks off, leaving McCall to ponder the problem. McCall looks over at another cop who has been observing. The cop shrugs his shoulders. He hasn't got a clue. McCall sits down and thoughtfully peers into the bottle.

Korda heads toward the kitchen area. Baffert uses this as an opportunity to drift around the room. Do a little snooping.
</DIRECTION>

He takes a sip. Korda watches him like a cobra. Baffert puts the glass down on the table.

	Well, I'm on my way to the game. I appreciate your cooperation, Mr. Korda.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Judge Stone... This is Lieutenant Samuel Baffert. I'm at a suspect's residence. I'm requesting a telephonic search warrant in connection with an armed robbery at a jewelry store. There's visible evidence on the premises. Glassine envelopes with jeweler's markings were seen in the trash can...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAFFERT>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator hits the first floor.
</DIRECTION>
<BAFFERT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...I believe a full search of the premises will turn up some stolen property...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAFFERT>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator opens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Korda is standing there with a knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Baffert has no time to react...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The knife hand slashes forward... Stabbing the chest and slashing across the throat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Korda calmly exits the building as Roper crosses the street, returning from the payphone. Neither of the men take any particular notices of each other. A WOMAN carrying her groceries enters the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roper gets to the truck. A SCREAM from inside the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Baffert is laying in the open elevator, knife wounds to his neck and chest. Roper rushes over to him. It doesn't look good.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The woman with the groceries is standing halfway up the first flight of stairs. Frozen. Roper pulls out his gun and rushes by her up the stairs.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. KORDA'S APT. - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roper nudges the door open, takes a step inside, gun ready... No one there. Suddenly, from the hallway, the click of a door. Roper races out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roper sprints to the door at the end of the hall, KICKS it open. Gun aimed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APT. 302 - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A five year old stares up at him. Scared stiff. Roper holds up a reassuring hand, and, as quickly as he arrived, he leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roper burst out the front. Down the stairs to the sidewalk. Looks both ways down the street... Realizes in dismay that Korda is long gone. A SIREN approaches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SOLIS OFFICE - NIGHT - RAIN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Angle outside window to Roper sitting in a chair by the window looking out to the rain. Solis is in the b.g. on the phone.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes sir. Every resource will be brought to bear. We will find this guy... Yeah, he's here now. I'll tell him.

Two detectives. A female named KIMURA and a tall guy named GLASS, try to make a getaway as they see Roper coming.

<ROPER>

	Hey, hey, hey...

</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
Roper intercepts them.

<ROPER>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<KIMURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Solis said to keep you clear of this.

</KIMURA>

INT. PICKUP

Thru the windshield. We see Roper as the windshield wipers flap back and forth. His face seems dazed and lost.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RONNIE'S HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roper knocks. Ronnie's cheerful voice can be heard.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Roper makes no effort to pull himself together. The door opens and Ronnie's face registers surprise. She's dressed casually in jeans, a nice shirt, but wears make-up and earrings.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey yourself. Came by to see Troy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Jack Daniels?

<ROPER>

</ROPER>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe you should be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You heard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>

She nods, sympathetic, but doesn't leave the doorway.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I come in?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie opens the door reluctantly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roper enters. Instantly we see he's at home here. He hangs his coat in the closet, puts his keys on the table, notices a photograph on the wall. Quite imposing. Very unique style.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That a new picture?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Roper gazes at it indifferently. He falls silent. Thoughts turned inward. Suddenly, TROY, (the dog), bounds in. He's ecstatic to see Roper. He puts his front paws on the couch and his head in Roper's lap.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Troy. How ya doin' boy?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Ronnie)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He heard my voice.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
Roper smiles briefly, pats the dog, taking comfort from his presence. His words are light. His tone isn't.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's the good dog. I miss you buddy. You miss me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie watches them, suddenly showing the sadness she's carefully buried.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He misses me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
She nods. A moment's silence.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I won't stay long. I had to talk to someone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(a bit surprised at his openness)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was my fault. I was right downstairs. I should have gone up with him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scott, You can't save everyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've proved that, didn't I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
She's not coming closer. She wants to, but she won't do it. She seems uneasy, glances towards the door. Roper rises.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, hell, forget it. This won't work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(gentle)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want from me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something I guess I can't have anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
(surprised, hurt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think I didn't need you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you did, you never showed it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ronnie...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches for her and she looks like she might give in to him, but at that moment there's a KNOCK ON THE DOOR. Ronnie pulls back, confused and guilty.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You expecting someone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
Her silence is the answer... A flash of pain from Roper.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This day just keeps getting better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie watches as he searches for his keys in his pockets.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
(soft)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're on the table where you always leave them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs the keys as she opens the door. GREG stands outside waiting. He's a big, good looking guy with a smile on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<GREG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, baby, I thought maybe you were...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GREG>
<DIRECTION>
Greg's smile fades as he sees Roper.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was just leaving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
Roper strides past Greg who remains in the doorway. Ronnie makes brief eye contact with Greg, but then moves past him to follow Roper. She calls after him.
</DIRECTION>
<RONNIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Scottie... take care of yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RONNIE>
<DIRECTION>
Roper doesn't look back. He just goes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PIER 26 - EARLY MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A huge warehouse. Sun coming up over the East Bay, CLARENCE TEAL rides up on a HARLEY MOTORCYLE, carrying a large cup of coffee to go. He enters the warehouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WAREHOUSE - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Car and Boat parts stacked in aisles ten feet high. Clarence shuffles through to his watchman's quarters which are connected to the end of the warehouse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WATCHMAN'S QUARTERS - SAME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Built on pilings with a panoramic view of the bay. Korda is waiting behind the door as Clarence enters. He seizes Clarence from behind and slams him against the wall and spins him around. Hot coffee soaks the front of Clarence's shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<KORDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you weren't family I'd kill you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KORDA>
<DIRECTION>
Clarence is scared. He offers no defense.
</DIRECTION>
<KORDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You told Antonucci that shit came from me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KORDA>
<CLARENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that we could get the best price. He's got respect for you. He's gonna try to lowball me, Mike.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARENCE>
<DIRECTION>
Korda tosses Clarence down onto the cot.
</DIRECTION>
<KORDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fucking idiot! Why do you think I use you?... To be a walking advertisement.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KORDA>
<CLARENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Mike. I never heard of LaMarra flipping on anyone before. He said he had the cops paid off. Antonucci never flipped on anyone before. He had the cops paid off.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARENCE>
<KORDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not the fucking cop that showed up at my door!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KORDA>
<CLARENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What happened, Mike.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARENCE>
<KORDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't want to know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KORDA>
<DIRECTION>
Tears start to come to Clarence's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Mike.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARENCE>
<DIRECTION>
Clarence sincerely feels bad. It's kind of touching in a twisted way. Korda moves over to the window to keep from striking Clarence again. He looks off across the bay.
</DIRECTION>
<KORDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God damn it! I still needed to case that fucking store. It's too risky to show my face now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KORDA>
<CLARENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got a couple thousand bucks. You could leave town.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARENCE>
<KORDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave town? They're going to know me in fucking Des Moines now!...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They got over ten million in jewels in that place. That's freedom, man. I could go anywhere I want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KORDA>
<DIRECTION>
Clarence watches Korda warily. Things are beginning to add up in his head.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you kill him, Mike?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARENCE>
<DIRECTION>
Korda turns to Clarence with a penetrated stare that answers the question. Clarence is shaken by that. He starts to whimper again.
</DIRECTION>
<CLARENCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Mike. I'm really sorry...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLARENCE>
<DIRECTION>
We're talking major fear here...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Korda moves to him and we think he's going to bash him around again, but, surprisingly, he hugs Clarence's head against his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<KORDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not your fault you're stupid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KORDA>
<DIRECTION>
Tears of relief from Clarence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. METRO DIVISION HEADQUARTERS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roper enters the squadroom. His mood is contained. He walks to a desk where Kimura and Glass are huddling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A couple desks over, McCall is reclining in Roper's chair, reading a book entitled, "Strategies and Counter Measures in Hostage Situations". On the desk in front of him is the bottle with the pen cap still in it.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<KIMURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roper...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMURA>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what about bars? We can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<KIMURA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roper, we're into it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</KIMURA>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Solis appears at their side.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've had this conversation once, Roper. You're not active on this case.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLIS>
<DIRECTION>
Roper looks at him icily.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's in everyone's best interest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLIS>
<DIRECTION>
McCall, Kimura, Glass all watch this confrontation tensely. After a beat, Roper gives in. Indicates his compliance. Solis heads back to this office.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
(softened)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You guys are doing good work.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
He moves toward the desk. McCall gets up when he sees him coming.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry about your friend. I had a friend in SWAT killed. I know how it can be.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCALL>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I appreciate your concern. Let's leave it at that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
McCall respectfully drops it. Roper looks down at the soda bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't see much progress here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
McCall holds up a finger. Not so fast. He picks up a pot from a nearby "Mr. Coffee" machine. It's filled with water. He takes the water and slowly pours it into the bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE BOTTLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The pen cap floats to the top and McCall plucks it out without touching or moving the bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very nice... You get an "A". Notice... No force required. No damage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
Just then a SERGEANT calls to Roper across the squadroom.
</DIRECTION>
<SERGEANT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roper, domestic disturbance at 472 6th Street. Possible hostage situation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SERGEANT>
<DIRECTION>
McCall grabs his duffel bag. Roper starts away from the desk, then notices the book on "Hostage Strategies". He looks at the title, then makes a demonstration of dropping it in the trash can. He and McCall head out.

Roper nods. Walks back over to the pickup. Looks up. Eyeballs the building.

<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How are we gonna get him out of there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<MCCALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We could fill it with water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCALL>
<DIRECTION>
Roper throws him a look. McCall walks to the back of the pickup, reaches into the cab and digs around in his duffel bag.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Officer #1)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you evacuated anyone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<OFFICER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only that floor.

</OFFICER_1>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is the hostage injured?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<OFFICER_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't know. She keeps screaming to stay out. He keeps screaming to stay out. We decided to stay out.

<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, there's a good amount of agreement on that.

McCall slams the truck door, sniper rifle in hand.

<DIRECTION>
(surveying the area)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can get a good sight-line from that roof across the street.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCALL>
<DIRECTION>
McCall marches off across the street.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remember, Quick Draw, we're trying to limit the force here.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
McCall calls back over his shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know my job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCALL>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment, a scream echoes down from the third floor window. Roper heads for the front door of the building.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APT. HALLWAY/STAIRCASE - (ACROSS THE STREET)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McCall bounds up the stairs of the building to the rooftop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. 6TH ST. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The screams are getting more panicky. Roper comes down the hall quickly. The door to the apartment is open. It's been that way since the guy in the green slacks fled. Roper hurries toward the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APARTMENT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The WIFE is in bra and panties and the HUSBAND is 6'4". He's giving her a good beating. It's a studio apartment. Unmade bed. Belongings strewn all over. Window open with sun streaming in, and a good view of the building across the street. We hear ROPER'S VOICE from out in the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm coming in. I'm not armed.

The husband snatches his wife by the hair and holds a knife to her throat.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay the fuck out of here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<DIRECTION>
But Roper steps into the apartment. Sees the wife. Face swollen. Knife to her neck. The enraged husband, contemplating murder. One inch from committing the act. Roper doesn't bat an eye.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know how you feel, Ray.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<DIRECTION>
He presses the knife against the wife's throat. She winces. Her chest heaves.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.

Roper reaches into his pocket and pulls out his wallet. He extracts a photo.

<DIRECTION>
CLOSEUP PHOTO

<DIRECTION>
ROPER

holds it up so Raymond can see it.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I ain't interested in your life story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.

	She's the one to blame. Not me.

Everyone where we left them. Roper looks at Ray with utter sincerity.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<DIRECTION>
And now Ray is crying. Blubbering actually. And he's not that coherent.
</DIRECTION>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm down at Consolidated and I'm begging. I'm saying I'll take half my pay. Eight years, man. I don't even have to work the loading docks anymore. I'll do maintenance. "We're cutting back. We're streamlining, Ray. West Central's running things now. It's out of our hands" Fuck them! Fuck them! FUCK THEM!

(deep sigh)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna kill her and then I'm gonna kill myself, 'cause I don't wanna live anymore.

Roper reaches out to him.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ray, if you walk out of here with me, I'll get you a job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Doing what? Cleaning toilets?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't guarantee you what it will be. But I swear on my life, I'll find you work.

</ROPER>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And why the fuck would you do that for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not for you, Ray. For me. A close friend of mine was killed this week. The way I figure it, I stop you from doin' what you said, I'm one up on body count.

</ROPER>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who the fuck are you, Mother Teresa?

<ROPER>

</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
Ray stares blankly at Roper's outstretched hand, the knife clutched tightly in his fist... The wife squeezes her eyes closed. Everything waits for an excruciatingly long beat... Then...
</DIRECTION>
<RAYMOND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need my coat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RAYMOND>
<DIRECTION>
It's on a coat rack in the corner. But to get there he has to pass by the window. Ray drops his wife on the bed, turns and goes to get his coat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses in front of the window... Reaches for the coat. POP! A bullet slams into his skull. Ray falls to the floor. The wife runs out of the room, screaming!
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NOOOO!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
He rushes over to Ray. Circle of blood soaking into the carpet. Ray's empty eyes. His hand still wrapped in his coat. He was dead instantly. Roper slams his fist into the wall. A couple of cops, guns drawn, arrive at the doorway. Roper bolts out of the room... Pounds down the hallway... Pounds down the stairs... down another flight...

	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
McCall, still stone-faced, reaches the apartment. Yellow "crime scene" tape is being placed across the doorway. Cops are tiptoeing around, surveying evidence. McCall ducks under the tape. Roper follows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. APT. - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
McCall goes over to Ray's body. Crouches down. Roper comes up behind him. McCall picks up the coat covering Ray's arms. Clutched in Ray's hand is a gun "Saturday night special" variety. McCall looks up at Roper.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SWAT is a lifesaving unit, remember? I just saved a life. Yours.

Roper doesn't miss a beat.

</DIRECTION>
<MCCALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. My mistake.

He walks out of the room. Roper whips the sheet off the bed, contemplates the gun gripped in Ray's hand... Then tosses the sheet over Ray's dead body.

INT. METRO DIVISION - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
Roper seated in the hallway, waiting outside a door marked "Internal Affairs". Things are quiet. Roper stares at the floor. Waiting.

<DIRECTION>
The door opens. McCall comes out, escorted by two internal affairs INVESTIGATORS. One of the investigators pats him on the back.
</DIRECTION>
<INVESTIGATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like a clean shoot. Go home and get some rest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INVESTIGATOR>
<DIRECTION>
McCall shakes hands with the investigators and they disappear back into the office. Roper approaches McCall. He's cooled off considerably. Even a tad friendly.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. Let's go for a drink.

</ROPER>
<MCCALL>

INT. BILLY GOAT TAVERN - NIGHT

A neighborhood bar. Roper and McCall are playing pool. Half- finished beers are on a nearby table. McCall is bent over the table trying to make a particularly tricky shot. Roper studies him.

<ROPER>

McCall misses the shot.

Roper lines up his shot.

	<DIALOGUE>
	She's from Hoboken.

<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, "city girl". Don't you ever long for companionship with her such a long way away in New Jersey?

<MCCALL>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MCCALL>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
A couple of months sounds like an awful long time to Roper.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a lot of commitment. I admire that.

</ROPER>
<MCCALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you really?

	Thanks for clearing that up.

</MCCALL>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did you hear that?

</ROPER>
<MCCALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Around. Barnett's tough competition.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCALL>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well that's a sore subject, and therefore out of bounds to a young sprout of a hostage negotiator under my tutelage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
A beat and then McCall realizes that this comment is a major acknowledgement of acceptance from Roper. Roper misses his shot. Picks up his beer glass.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lesson two, "Dead Eye"... should have been lesson one. Never exchange yourself for a hostage.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<MCCALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I can handle that one.

</MCCALL>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, you think so, but it comes up.

Roper takes a drink of beer. Nears the bottom of his glass. Calls to the BARTENDER.

<DIRECTION>
Roper turns back to McCall.

Roper nods. Maybe he can.

</MCCALL>
<DIRECTION>
REVERSE ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a training room. It's built to approximate a convenience store. Several mannequins are placed around the room to represent a hostage situation. The "BAD GUY" has a walkie- talkie strapped around his neck. Roper's voice CRACKLES out of it.
</DIRECTION>
<BAD_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck do you think is going on, turdhead? I'm about to waste everyone in this place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAD_GUY>

McCall hesitates, trying to figure out a response. He seems stiff and awkward.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	H... how can I help you? Tell me what...

<DIRECTION>
(looks off to his right)
</DIRECTION>

Roper enters the training room from a side door. He's holding the other walkie-talkie.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you think? I'm going to let you practice on real people?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
Roper comes up beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First things is, don't say, "What's going on?" Everybody knows what's going on. I come into this situation, I say,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(addressing the mannequin)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"I'm glad to see nobody's hurt. That's good. I'm here to help you."
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns back to McCall)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Second: You hesitated. Don't hesitate. If you're thinking, talk while you're thinking, or else he's going to think you're plotting. Which you are. If he thinks you're plotting, you're going to make him nervous. You don't want him nervous. Got that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<MCCALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

Now he's stumped.

Roper re-enters the training area.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So what do I say to this guy?

(addressing the dummy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Tell me what the scumbag's name is. Maybe we can work something out."
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<MCCALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Bring somebody in so he can cut his nuts off?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCALL>
<DIRECTION>
Roper turns to McCall.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you want to be a successful negotiator, you've got to learn to lie.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<MCCALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not good at lying.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCALL>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get good at it.

</ROPER>
<MCCALL>

Roper gives him an amused smile.

<MCCALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou shall have no other God before me.

That's not the answer Roper wanted.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, forget that. What's the main one.

</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
McCall is tired of guessing.

<MCCALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You tell me.

<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thou shall not kill... You've killed, right?

</ROPER>
<MCCALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

</MCCALL>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

</ROPER>
<MCCALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To save lives.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCALL>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So why would you hesitate to lie to save lives?

McCall can't argue with that one. Roper turns and heads back to the side door.

Roper comes through the side door.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Close your eyes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
McCall is surprised by the command but closes them. Roper turns him away from the hostage scene.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<MCCALL>
<DIRECTION>
(rapid-fire)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A dirtbag behind the counter holding a sawed-off. A Berretta nine millimeter in his belt. A female hostage, red dress, on the floor in front of the cereal display. Male hostage, jeans and blue checked shirt, three feet to her right. Another male hostage, white pants, green shirt, Nikes, laying in front of the magazine rack. A female dirtbag with a gun under her shirt, sitting against the beer cooler, trying to pass herself off as a hostage, and there's a special on toilet-paper, four for a buck twenty-nine.

McCall opens his eyes. Roper's impressed.

INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roper and McCall are sitting in the dark watching a video tape. It's grainy footage of a hostage situation in a sporting goods store. A negotiator confronted with a gunman holding a ten year old girl hostage. The negotiator holds his hands out imploringly... Carefully moves toward the gunman. The negotiator exchanges himself for the little girl. The gunman grabs the negotiator around the neck, holds the gun to his head. The little girl runs out of the picture to safety.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roper remains dead silent during all this. McCall looks over at him. The blue light flickers over Roper's motionless face.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Was that your partner?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCALL>
<DIRECTION>
Roper nods.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did he do it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCALL>
<ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because he knew the little girl had zero chance of survival and his chances would be a little better... We had a plan, but SWAT opened up too early. He got caught in the crossfire.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a sad beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's move on... Notice this. Always use the eyes to keep the connection. It almost like hypnosis. That's the most important thing. Create a connection. You're always on their side...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
McCall watches him for a beat, then turns his attention back on the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GOLDEN GATE RACETRACK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beautiful day. Roper and McCall leaning against the rail at the walking ring. The horses are being paraded and saddled. Roper scrutinizes them with an expert eye. McCall seems totally disinterested.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know why I like the track?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<MCCALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a compulsive gambler?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCALL>
<DIRECTION>
Roper ignores that.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because there are a multitude of possibility's. Everything is there to see if you know what to look for. You have to read the conditions, just like in a hostage situation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
Roper points across the ring to a particular horse.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See the four horse. Dropping in class. No works. Front wraps. Looks like he's broken down. But notice the woman in the sun hat. She's the owner. She wouldn't have come if her horse was broken down. He's live. We use him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
McCall listens indifferently.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See the favorite? Tail up. Washy. He doesn't want to run today. Cross him off... Now the Six looks good. On his toes. Coat shiny. This trainer/jockey combo does well. We can't leave him out.

McCall sits like a wax figure.

ON THE TRACK

<DIRECTION>
The FOUR horse crosses the finish line in front. The SIX horse is flying... Needs to beat one horse to be second... He's running out of room... With one last surge he hits the wire and... It's too close to call.

Roper and McCall collect their money. Four hundred a piece, not bad. McCall pockets his money.

EXT. JEWELRY STORE - UNION SQUARE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marble facade. Tastefully reinforced windows and door. Choppers circle overhead. Both ends of the street are sealed off. Barricades are up. Spectators and news crews crowd behind those. Numerous police circulate. This is a major operation in full swing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRAVEL AGENCY - COMMAND CENTER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's across the street from the jewelry store. Second story. The walls are plastered with travel posters. A poster of Tahiti is the most prominent. Members of police and SWAT are standing over a blueprint of the jewelry store spread out on a table. Right behind them is a TV monitoring the front of the store. Solis is at another desk, on the phone. He's talking to the suspect.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLIS>

	We're working on that, Joe. These things aren't quite that simple.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLIS>

EXT. STREET - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roper and McCall push through the barricades and come walking down the cordoned-off street. McCall takes a look at the jewelry store. Well fortified, foreboding.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This does not look good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MCCALL>
<DIRECTION>
Roper looks over there, gives no reaction. They reach Solis' convertible Cadillac. It's parked out front of the travel agency building.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See this. Solis has me driving the shit-mobile, and he picked this up straight out of impound for fourteen grand. Probably worth thirty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<MCCALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Police corruption. It's everywhere.

</MCCALL>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COMMAND POST - DAY

Roper and McCall enter. McCall joins the men who are studying the blueprint. Roper stands by Solis and listens, takes note of the poster of Tahiti. Looks inviting.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This will take time to setup. I'll have to get authorizations.

(he listens)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, you relax, and I'll --

Solis pulls the phone away from his ear. Joe has obviously hung up.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do we got?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<SOLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	32 minutes ago the silent alarm went off, then the fire alarm. A unit was a block away, and the suspect got trapped inside.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLIS>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any verification on numbers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<SOLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've only seen and talked to one suspect. He calls himself "Joe". There's two jewelers, two salespeople, the manager, a security guard, and an elderly woman. This particular store is where they do a lot of jewelry making and repair. They have anywhere from 8 to 10 million in raw stones on any given day, so they sure as shit didn't just wander in. They knew what they were coming for.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLIS>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What have you promised them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<SOLIS>

McCall returns from checking out the blueprints.

<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any good points of entry?

McCall shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCALL>

	<DIALOGUE>
	My name's Roper. How are you people doing in there?

Roper clicks off the phone. He already doesn't like the sound of this guy.

EXT. STREET OUTSIDE JEWELRY STORE - DAY

Roper, bulletproof vest, hands in the air, walks across the eerily deserted street straight toward the jewelry store. It's quiet now. The choppers have been pulled back.

Roper reaches the sidewalk right in front of the store. Korda cracks the door open.

Korda takes a half step out the doorway. The gloved hand that is visible is not holding a weapon. The other half of his body is hidden inside the doorway. He wears jeans, a black shirt, and black Nike tennis shoes. He stares fiercely from behind the ski mask. There's no sign of fear in him.

</KORDA>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yep.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>
<KORDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want a car. Like a four wheel drive. I want it in perfect condition. I want a uniformed cop to drive it up right here. I want him to leave the engine running and walk to the end of the street. Then we'll come out. I don't want any remote control devices in it. I know all the tricks. If it's not in perfect condition, and I mean if its even low on wiper fluid, I'm going to kill somebody and we're gonna start again.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KORDA>
<DIRECTION>
Korda lets that sink in.

	<DIALOGUE>
	No. You just do shit for me right now.

Korda's eyes glare from behind the ski mask. He's an ominous figure.

</ROPER>
<KORDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll give you something.

Korda pulls a wadded-up handkerchief out of his pocket and tosses it to Roper. Roper unwraps the handkerchief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DETAIL SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It's a human ear.

	In fifteen minutes it'll be a bigger piece. I assume there are no "misunderstanding".

Korda disappears back behind the door.

EXT. COMMAND CENTER - DAY
</DIRECTION>

Roper trudges back in. Things are more active now. Logistical officers are making flow charts. Photos of the hostages are being posted on a bulletin board. Roper approaches Solis, McCall and the SWAT CAPTAIN who are anxiously waiting for his report.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
(flatly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're going to have to take this guy out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROPER>

That draws a long silence. That's something Roper rarely says.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can't we wear him down?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLIS>
<DIRECTION>
Roper hands Solis the handkerchief with the ear in it. Solis eyes it with dismay.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe there's at least one fatality in there already. The fire alarm was probably set off by gunfire. I believe he's working alone, both from his conversation and the fact that he wouldn't come out beyond the doorway. He was holding a gun on the hostages while he was talking to me. His demeanor is calm and controlled, that's what really scares me. The other bad news is that he also indicated a familiarity with our techniques.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(a beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, do you want to go in or wait for him to come out?
	</DIALOGUE>

McCall calmly offers his opinion.

Solis nods. That'll be the plan.

The underling hurries off to take care of it. Solis looks at Roper dejectedly.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel this thing going sideways on us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLIS>
<DIRECTION>
Roper tries to buck him up.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There is some good news. He's wearing a ski mask, so he's protecting his identity and hasn't determined to kill all the hostages...

The male MANAGER, good-looking, thirties, three piece suit. TWO SALESGIRLS, nicely dressed, late twenties. A FEMALE CUSTOMER, gray-haired Hillsborough matron. They are all seated against the wall. There are two fatalities lying on the floor. The guard and one of the jewelers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Korda points his gun at the manager and the other jeweler and motions to the dead bodies.
</DIRECTION>
<KORDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drag them behind the counter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KORDA>
<DIRECTION>
The two men reluctantly get to their feet and commence the grim task. The two salesgirls watch Korda fearfully. The older female customer seems to be in a lesser state of reality. Her eyes are a bit far away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Korda moves over to the remaining display cases that haven't been looted. With the barrel of his gun, He SMASHES the glass, reaches in and picks out the jewelry. He dumps it in an open satchel already half-filled with packets of raw gemstones and gold chains. Suddenly, the older woman customer gets to her feet. She seems fairly out-of-it. Maybe in shock. She starts walking toward the front door frowning with dissatisfaction.

<DIRECTION>
He grabs a handful of the woman's coiffed gray hair and drags her away from the door. She shrieks. The manager takes a step toward Korda.
</DIRECTION>
<MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave her alone!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANAGER>
<DIRECTION>
Korda pistol whips her across the forehead and drops her unconscious to the floor then turns the gun on the manager.
</DIRECTION>
<KORDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a brave one, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KORDA>
<DIRECTION>
The manager glares at him. He's about Korda's size. He thinks about making a run at him.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down, Doug.

A long beat... The manager sits back down on the floor with the other hostages. Salesgirl 1 is giving aid to the old woman. Korda looks down at her.
</DIRECTION>
<KORDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If she's not conscious when it's time to leave, I'll have to kill her.

The white vapor cloud swirls. The hostages, spattered with blood, scream and scatter. The figure in the ski mask lies dead on the sidewalk.

The brakeman charges down the aisle while Korda has his attention focused out the back and tries to shove him off the cable car...

Roper moves up an interior stairway, gun in "ready" position. He knows Korda is somewhere in the parking structure. He glides up the stairway to the third level. Checks back over the rail... No one around... Then a sound from inside the garage... Footsteps maybe.

Roper carefully opens the door... Swings in with his gun...

Roper searches between two rows... Comes up beside a van... Thinks he hears something stirring inside. Whirls a gun toward the window.

He heads toward the exit... Suddenly a SCREECH of tires... Roper whirls to see a sedan bearing down on him. He drives and FIRES! Bullets shatter the windshield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The car continues toward Roper. He has to roll out of the path of the car. The car swerves past Roper. Tries to make it down the ramp. Roper fires again, taking out the rear window and a rear tire. The car slides along the guard rail and continues down to the next level. Roper runs after it.
</DIRECTION>

GARAGE - 2ND LEVEL
</DIRECTION>

As the car reaches the next level, Korda loses control and piles into a parked car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Korda crawls out of the car clutching his precious satchel of jewels. Dazed, he staggers away from the wreck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roper moves to him with a face grim as death. He strips the satchel from Korda's hand and slams him against the open car door. Korda goes to his knees. Roper holds the barrel of his gun right up between Korda's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<ROPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give me one reason why I shouldn't kill you right here.

And that makes Roper even angrier... But he keeps it all inside. His expression is as cold as a San Francisco night.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He yanks back hard on Korda's hair. Pushes the gun tighter against Korda's forehead. He's on the verge of executing this guy.
</DIRECTION>
<KORDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't kill me like this.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ROPER>
<DIRECTION>
Roper jams the gun back under Korda's chin. A pull of the trigger would send a bullet straight up through Korda's skull. And now Korda is fully convinced. He squeezes his eyes closed. Face straining so hard, he looks like he's going to burst out of his skin.

Long, long beat. Roper eases up and Korda smiles. Just when we feel the scene is over, Roper turns back quickly and kicks Korda in the stomach, then grabs Korda by the hair, pulls his head back and shoves the gun in his face.

Ronnie stirs the macaroni.

Ronnie puts the lid on the macaroni. There is a beat before she continues.

INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Ronnie unbuttons her blouse as she moves to the...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She takes off the blouse, goes to the closet door... throws it open. She looks around. Something's not right. She takes a step into the closet and finds what she's looking for -- A laundry basket -- tucked away in the corner. She puts the soiled blouse in the hamper and takes a fresh one off a hanger. She buttons the clean blouse as she walks to...

Dark. She turns on the light. She goes to the mirrored medicine cabinet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE REFLECTION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind her the shower curtain is drawn, fluttering ever so slightly. She opens the medicine cabinet. Takes out some perfume. Dabs some on her neck. She puts back the bottle and closes the cabinet. We fully expect someone to be standing right behind her in the reflection... There's no one there. She turns off the light as she walks out of the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

Ronnie walks back to the kitchen... Notices something on the floor further down the hallway... What is it? She moves closer... And now we get to the POV that tells us someone is in the house... Watching her through a cracked doorway.

BRIEF CUT

<DIRECTION>
A hand opening a buck knife. Water drips from the fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK IN THE HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ronnie bends down. It's a wet spot. Like half a shoeprint. She reaches down to touch it...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BUZZZZZ!!!! The oven timer. She hurries back to the kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RONNIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns off the timer and pulls some chicken out of the oven. She puts it down on the counter and cross to the refrigerator. She opens the door and looks inside. The refrigerator door obscures half the FRAME... She digs around for something... We're sure that when she closes the door, he's going to be behind it... She takes out a head of lettuce and... Closes the door... Still no one there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns... Clarence is standing there. Dripping wet. Ronnie shrieks... The knife flashes forward... She grabs the lid from the sauce pan and CLANG... Fends off the blade. She bolts for the hallway. Clarence grabs her by the blouse... RIP! She pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IN THE HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She races down the hall. Clarence lunges into FRAME. She goes down... He goes down... the knife goes skidding down the hallway... Ronnie scrambles to get it... Clarence has her by the ankle... She claws for the knife... Just out of reach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. RONNIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT

Roper's pickup pulls up in front. He gets out. Paco jumps out behind him. It's raining harder. They hurry up the walkway toward the house. Suddenly Roper realizes he forgot the wine. He goes back to the truck. Paco pads after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roper opens the driver's side door, reaches in and grabs the wine. He closes the door, starts away, but pauses to check himself in the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a floodlight comes crashing through Ronnie's front bay windows. It SPARKS and FLASHES. Still plugged in, it bungees to a stop hallway down the front of the house. FLICKERING and FLASHING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roper rushes toward the house... Crashes through the front door... Up the stairway... Paco bounds after him... Roper hits her front door running... Wham! He bounces off. He shoulders it again... The door doesn't give... He pulls out his gun... BAM! BAM! Shoots off the lock.

EXT. BACK OF RONNIE'S - NIGHT

Raining more heavily now. Roper bursts out onto the back porch. Sees Clarence leaping off the last rung of the fire escape to the alley. Roper flies down the fire escape... Vaults the last flight and races after Clarence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clarence sprints down the block... Through the intersection... HONK! SCREECH! A car barely misses him. It does a one-eighty on the rain-slick pavement. Clarence disappears into the shadows. Roper arrives a beat later... Streaks through the intersection... Into the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ANOTHER STREET - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This one is steep. Clarence huffs and puffs as he labors. He shoots into a doorway. Tries the door. Locked. He looks back. Roper is coming. Relentless. He rushes across the steep street. Almost slips on the reflective asphalt. Roper spots him crossing and picks up the pace. He can see that Clarence is faltering.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
NEAR THE TOP OF THE HILL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Clarence staggers into an alleyway...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Narrow, dark and dripping with rain. Roper arrives at the mouth of the alley. Gun ready, he moves cautiously, eyes adjusting to the darkness. The PATTER of rain off the rooftops. His FOOTSTEPS. No other sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches the end of the alley... A brick wall. No way out. Or so it would seem. However, Clarence is nowhere in sight. Roper turns back. Brick walls tower on both sides, rising into darkness. Roper checks a steel door. Locked. He checks another one on the opposite side of the alley. Also locked. Where did Clarence go? He moves back toward the misting light of the street... Slowly...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The FAINT RATTLE of a fire escape... And Clarence leaps down out of the shadow. Slashing with the knife. He catches Roper across the arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rips through his clothes right down to the skin. Roper's gun CLATTERS under a parked car and into the street. Clarence has first jump. He scrambles into the street, around the car and grabs the gun...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Roper dives over the hood of the car and knocks Clarence down before he can aim. They roll into the middle of the street. Both have a death grip on the weapon. Clarence fights like a trapped animal. Thrashing desperately. Roper pins him on his back, but can't pry the gun out of his fingers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER SHOT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Headlights radiate over the crest of the hill. Coming quickly. Roper sees this. He rolls out of the way, abandoning the battle for the gun. Clarence struggles to his knees. Turns the weapon on Roper... A speeding cab lunges over the top of the hill. Clarence turns, trapped in the searing headlights. Tires squeal. Brakes lock. Clarence is transfixed... WHAM! He's launched through the air like a ragdoll... His body lands limply 30 feet down the street. The CABBY gets out of his vehicle.
</DIRECTION>
<CABBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ. What was he doing?!

EXT. ROOF - DAY

McCall moves slowly across the tar paper roof. Clouds overhead threaten rain. Vet 1 turns to him suddenly, wobbling the wheelchair. Vet 2 shrieks and nearly goes over. McCall's heart jumps into his mouth.

Dave obliges. He looks at McCall with eyes that have lost the battle for sanity. McCall is momentarily frozen by those eyes. Beads of sweat have formed on his forehead.

Dave starts to look over into the street, he tips Walter forward, Walter shrieks in mortal fear. White knuckles the armrests of his wheelchair and then:

</MCCALL>
<DAVE>

McCall even surprises himself with that one. It was a sheer act of desperation. He holds his breath and waits to see what the effect is. Dave turns back around.

<MCCALL>

</MCCALL>
<DIRECTION>
Now he's got Dave's interest. McCall slowly takes out his beeper.
</DIRECTION>
<MCCALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See this. I'm jamming them, Dave. I'm jamming their frequency so they can't control your mind anymore. Don't you feel that? You don't have to do what they say.

Dave listens to his head.

Then with sudden swiftness.

<DAVE>

	I thought I could do it. I was so damn sure of myself. But I didn't know what to say. The words wouldn't come. My mouth turned to mush. You make it look so easy, Roper. But it is not. It's not easy.

Korda signs the sheet. The guard pushes a button. The metal lock SNAPS, and the door POPS open. Korda takes his card and sticks it in the woman's coat pocket.

<DIRECTION>
It's a small parking area, with security gates on either end, and a ceiling of heavy steel wire open to the sky. There are three or four CARS parked against the wall. Korda checks inside the first car, looking for keys and finds none. Then the second, and the third until...

</DIRECTION>
<KORDA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's funny, I wonder how that happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KORDA>
<DIRECTION>
In a flash, Korda PLUNGES the pen DEEP into the guard's throat. The BLOOD jumps out of his throat, onto the window of the car as the guard, gagging in stunned silence, slumps to ground. He then falls backward between the two cars, drowning in his own blood.

Palmed in his hand, the ENVELOPE containing Ronnie's diamond.

Korda swings into position a CONTROL BOX, the buttons held down with TAPE.

Korda pulls free the tape, the huge lathe beginning to TURN, very slowly, the cutting device activated... if the table keeps turning, Ronnie's body will soon be under the blade.

(PRODUCTION NOTE: Lathe will be cutting into a section of steel plate, demonstrating what will happen to Ronnie.

Korda presses the STOP BUTTON, the lathe stopping. He releases his finger again, the lathe turning. He stops it.

We can see that Korda is immensely proud of his 'creation', his focus more on sadistic payback than anything else at this point.

He turns, walking quickly towards his car, TALKING, LAUGHING, to himself.

<DIRECTION>
Roper looks to the car, then back at the SATCHEL where the .45 is still taped to the bottom. But Roper can't move, unable to change his position more than a foot or two. He looks around him, no way to stop the lathe if he releases the button.

	Whoa! Wait a minute, Ronnie. Hold on. I know it's beautiful here. The sun, the sand, the sea and all that nature shit can really get to you. But we've got to keep our perspective here. This place isn't real. This isn't reality.
