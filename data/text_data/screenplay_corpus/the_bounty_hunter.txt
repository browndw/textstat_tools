<DIRECTION>
Dec 21st. Clear sky, snow on the ground. Cold as fuck. With the sounds of laughter and music, we MOVE IN ON:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An office Xmas party in progress, not a pretty sight: tipsy receptionists laugh and spill drinks on the rug, red-faced reporters loosen their belts and burp cocktail weiners...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING QUICKLY THROUGH THE PARTY TO AN OPEN OFFICE DOOR. Arriving just in time for the door to SLAM in our face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OFFICE- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A woman stomps back over to her desk and picks up her pen. MEET CASSIDY DALEY (dirty blond, striking, manic energy). Ink- stained fingers, notepads in every pocket: Cass doesn't have time for office parties, she's working.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her door cracks open and STEWART (almost as good looking as he thinks he is) appears, holding a Kahlua bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm working, Stewart.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<STEWART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, take a break.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(enticing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got Kahlua...
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEWART>
<DIRECTION>
Cass picks up a stapler and LAUNCHES it at Stewart's head. Stewart DUCKS OUT just in time. The phone rings. Answering:
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cassidy Daley. Talk to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Jimmy. Tell me you love me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Depends on what you got.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got a confirmed place and time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Cass is on her feet, excited.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you! So, when? Where?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think I'm gonna say this shit over the phone? I could get killed. Just meet me at the usual place. Oh, and Cass? This one's gonna cost an extra hundred.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
CLICK. He hangs up. Cass drops the phone, grabs her stuff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. NEWSPAPER OFFICE- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cass races for the elevator, Stewart hot on her heels:
</DIRECTION>
<STEWART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where ya going?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEWART>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hooters. I go there for the hot wings.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<STEWART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. Nobody goes there for the hot wings. You got a tip.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEWART>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got a hundred bucks on you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
Stewart considers this, then hands her 5 20's.
</DIRECTION>
<STEWART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now are you gonna let me in on it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEWART>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry. No can do. I have to protect my source.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<STEWART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what? We need to talk about our relationship.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEWART>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't have a relationship. We made out 3 years ago in the copy room. I was drunk. I was broken- hearted. I would have made out with the xerox machine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<STEWART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, but you made out with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEWART>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
She exits. He shouts after her:
</DIRECTION>
<STEWART>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want in on that story!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEWART>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET/JERSEY CITY- DAY

<DIRECTION>
Cass driving like a maniac, doing the one thing she loves: TRACKING A STORY...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DUNKING DONUTS PARKING LOT- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVING IN ON- A BEAT-UP HONDA CIVIC (JIMMY'S CAR) IN THE BACK CORNER OF THE LOT...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JIMMY'S CAR- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIMMY (20's, goatee, Mets baseball hat, nervous) sits in his car, rolling a cigarette while he waits for Cass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy puts the cigarette in his mouth and pulls out a lighter. Just as he flips the lighter open, HIS FRONT WINDSHIELD EXPLODES. A MAN HOLDING A TIRE IRON (MAHLER, heavyset, crew-cut, rarely speaks, all business) reaches through the broken window, AND DRAGS JIMMY OUT OF THE CAR...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DUNKING DONUTS PARKING LOT- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cass drives into the lot and pulls up next to Jimmy's car.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Jimmy, I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
She realizes he is not in the car. THEN SHE SEES THE BROKEN GLASS ALL OVER THE DRIVER'S SEAT.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jimmy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
SCREECHING TIRES behind her. Cass glances up and sees JIMMY'S BASEBALL HAT IN THE BACK WINDOW OF A GREY CHEVY. The Chevy is racing out into traffic. Cass throws her car into reverse...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASS' CAR- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cass tries to follow the grey Chevy, but GETS STUCK AT A RED LIGHT. Shit. She looks around, decides fuck it, and HITS THE GAS. Her car leaps into the intersection. SIRENS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cass looks into her rearview mirror: A PATROL CAR IS RIGHT BEHIND HER, signalling for her to pull over. Up ahead, the Chevy is getting away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cass debates: pull over? Or follow the story? No contest. SHE SLAMS ON THE GAS AND HER CAR SURGES OUT OF FRAME...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cass' car SPEEDS down the street, A COP CAR IN CLOSE PURSUIT...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASS' CAR- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cass is losing sight of the Chevy. She races around traffic and is suddenly HEADED STRAIGHT FOR THE SIDE OF A MOVING VAN. She panics, WRENCHING the wheel to the right...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET- DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CASS' CAR JUMPS THE CURB, CROSSES A LAWN, AND SKIDS TO A HALT ON THE FRONT STEPS OF A CHURCH. THE COP CAR RACES UP AND BLOCKS HER IN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CHURCH- MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cass is out of her car now, arguing with a cop who has her by the arm:
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let go of me, I'm a reporter, I'm warning you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
The cop pulls her towards his squad car. Cass leans over and SINKS HER TEETH INTO THE COP'S HAND. The cop screams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREEZE FRAME.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHIRON: "24 HOURS LATER"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON- A NEWSPAPER COLUMN WITH CASS' PHOTO: windswept hair, head tilted coyly, smile that says "I'm on top of the world. Beneath the photo, the byline: "CASSIDY DALEY".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Someone whistles "We Wish You a Merry Xmas" as a MARKER improves on the photo: MOUSTACHE, BUCK-TEETH, PIMPLES. Then a MATCH enters frame, and SETS THE PHOTO ON FIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Milo!

<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK TO REVEAL:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CRYSTAL'S BAR/JERSEY CITY- LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holding the flaming photo, MEET MILO: rumpled shirt, messy hair, looks like he slept on the floor. The bartender (CRYSTAL, 50's, Eastern European) scowls at him:
</DIRECTION>
<CRYSTAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did I say about the fires?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRYSTAL>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You said "please set fires in my bar". Wait, no, that's not right. "Please don't set fires in my bar".
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(off her look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok, jeez, you try to get in the holiday spirit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
He drops the flaming photo to the floor, pours his drink on it, then GRINDS IT TO PIECES WITH HIS SHOE.
</DIRECTION>
<CRYSTAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shouldn't you be working?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CRYSTAL>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the beauty of my job, Crystal. Tracking down idiots is something you can do pretty much anywhere. See, there's one...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
He points to A DRUNK DRAPED OVER THE JUKEBOX, MOURNFULLY SINGING ALONG TO CHRISTINA AQUILLERA'S "I AM BEAUTIFUL".
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And there's another one...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Pointing to A WOMAN TRYING TO RIP A PAY PHONE FROM THE WALL.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And there's...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Glances at the TV, which is showing LIVE FOOTAGE OF AN XMAS PARADE. Looks closer, recognizes someone, groans:
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe it. That idiot.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Crystal)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Save my seat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Tosses back his drink and SPLITS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CRYSTAL'S BAR- LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo climbs into a Cadillac: dents, patches of rust, cracked windshield, bumper askew.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RACK TO: half a block away, A DARK SEDAN IDLES AT THE CURB.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DARK SEDAN- LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man behind the wheel (DWIGHT, large, babyfaced, Metallica t-shirt) eats a hoagie as he watches Milo get into his car.
</DIRECTION>
<DWIGHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you are, you dipshit.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWIGHT>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a last bite then tosses the sandwich and pulls away from the curb, tailing the Cadillac.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JERSEY CITY- LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVE IN ON- the parade we just saw on TV. Baton twirlers in Santa Hats. Men dressed like reindeer, pulling a sleigh. A boys choir singing "Joy to the World", the kids dressed like orphans that escaped a Broadway musical.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A beautiful scene, if you like that sort of thing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RACK TO- the Cadillac, half a block away, cruising sideways into a spot just beneath a "TEMPORARY TOW-AWAY" sign. MILO climbs out of the car. Shoves his way through the crowd to the curb, cracking open a can of Pabst.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo does not like this sort of thing. He scans the crowd impatiently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, THE CAR THAT WAS FOLLOWING HIM parks half a block away. DWIGHT emerges and heads for:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILO, who has just found what he's looking for. The reindeer are passing him and he makes eye contact with RUDOLPH, who does a double-take.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, you. Rudolph. Come here, you fucking ding-dong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Milo takes a step towards Rudolph and DWIGHT APPEARS IN MILO'S PATH, BLOCKING HIM.
</DIRECTION>
<DWIGHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have to stop meeting this way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWIGHT>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not now, Dwight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DWIGHT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You owe my boss money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWIGHT>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(LAUGHING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I owe everybody money.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, DWIGHT PUNCHES MILO IN THE GUT. Milo doubles-up, gasping, then BRINGS HIS HEAD UP QUICK, CATCHING DWIGHT ON THE CHIN. Dwight goes flying sideways and MEETS A POLICE BARRIER FACE-FIRST. Ouch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The barrier tips over, knocking over the one next to it. THE REST GO LIKE DOMINOS. Milo turns to see that RUDOLPH HAS DISAPPEARED. Then he catches sight of the ANTLERS, working their way through the crowd. Milo lunges after him and Rudolph drags other reindeer with him as he tries to avoid Milo. THE SLEIGH FLIPS. Santa tumbles from the sled. PACKAGES RAIN DOWN ON REINDEER LIKE SHRAPNEL.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All of a sudden, IT'S THE XMAS FROM HELL: BLOODY REINDEER STUMBLING AROUND, SANTA UNCONSCIOUS IN THE GUTTER, KIDS SCREAMING, PARENTS PANICKING. Meanwhile, MILO IS GAINING ON RUDOLPH, who picks up one of the packages and throws it. IT CRACKS MILO IN THE HEAD. Just what Milo has been waiting for:
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(BEAMING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am so happy you did that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Milo TACKLES RUDOLPH TO THE GROUND. Around them, people scream and scatter. One boy bursts into tears:
</DIRECTION>
<BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That man is killing Rudolph!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<DIRECTION>
SIRENS. Uh-oh. Cops SWARM the scene, surrounding Milo and Rudolph, GUNS DRAWN. The LEAD COP (GELMAN, short, over- zealous) steps forward:
</DIRECTION>
<GELMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Release the reindeer!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GELMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Release the reindeer? Milo looks around. He's got 8 or so guns pointed his way and Rudolph gasping at his feet. MILO STARTS TO LAUGH. Gelman bristles:
</DIRECTION>
<GELMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hands behind your head, asshole!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GELMAN>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it easy, skippy, I'm just doing my job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Milo flashes his ID. Gelman inspects it, rolls his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<GELMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bounty hunter. Figures. Why don't you get a real job?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GELMAN>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I can be like you patrol boys and sit around all day with my thumb up my ass?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Gelman turns bright red.
</DIRECTION>
<GELMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you just say?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GELMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, a sergeant (BOBBY, late 30's, obnoxious but likeable, Milo's ex-partner) marches onto the scene, takes one look at Milo and laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Milo Boyd. I shoulda known.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<GELMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sarg, you know this asshole?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GELMAN>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I know this asshole. Guy used to be one of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
RACK TO- DWIGHT, NOSE BLEEDING, MELTING BACK INTO SHADOW...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. STREET- MOMENTS LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo drags Rudolph through the crowd towards his car. Bobby follows, shaking his head, bemused expression on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Milo, I know this is a tough time of year for you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This isn't a tough time of year for me. It's Christmas. Who doesn't love Christmas?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and I try to be sensitive to your situation...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What situation? Being a man who works his own hours and has his freedom and lives the high life?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...because I realize you're unhappy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Unhappy? Are you kidding me, Bob? Look at me: I'm the happiest man alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, they come to where Milo left his car. IT'S GONE. Bobby squints at the huge "TOW-AWAY" sign:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That sign is pretty hard to see.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
And with that, Milo loses it:
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	AAAHHH!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
He rips the sign off the pole. Stomps on it. Kicks it. Tries to shred it with his teeth. Hmm. He doesn't really seem like the happiest man alive. Rudolph, to Bobby:
</DIRECTION>
<RUDOLPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take me to jail. Please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDOLPH>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BOBBY'S CAR- EARLY EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby's car is decorated with photos of his many children, all of whom look exactly like him, even the girls, poor kids.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo's in front by Bobby, Rudolph's handcuffed in the back.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok, I got one for ya: why doesn't Santa have any children? Cause he only comes once a year and when he does, it's down a chimney.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Rudolph snickers. Milo does not. Bobby glances at Milo.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. Have you talked to her lately?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talked to who?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Katie Couric, motherfucker, who do you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I haven't talked to her in three years, why would I talk to her now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, for one thing, so you can stop taking out your rage on innocent bystanders.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<RUDOLPH>
<DIRECTION>
(piping up from the back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Talk to her, man. For real.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDOLPH>
<DIRECTION>
Milo reaches back, gags Rudolph with his own scarf.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do what you want. But this kind of shit will eat a hole in your intestines, you don't deal with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. POLICE STATION/JERSEY CITY- EARLY EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They pull up. Milo exits the car, pulls Rudolph from the back. Bobby leans out.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, why don't you come by the precinct tomorrow for our Xmas bash?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not invited. I'm not a cop anymore, remember?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck that, I'm inviting you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know, Bob. I'm sorta busy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what I'm worried about.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just...take it easy, Ok?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby really seems worried, but Milo waves him off. Bobby drives over, parks by other cop cars. Gets out, mingles with some cops. Laughter, inside jokes. Milo watches from afar.
</DIRECTION>
<RUDOLPH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should go to that party, man. Seriously. You need it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RUDOLPH>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I look like I need advice from a grown man in antlers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Milo gags Rudolph and drags him into the station.
</DIRECTION>

FADE TO BLACK. OVER BLACK:

<DIRECTION>
INT. SID'S BAIL BONDS/JERSEY CITY- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hazy pieces: a tilting clock on the wall. A battered metal desk. Filing cabinets, spitting up papers. A man, SID (wound sorta tight, Milo's best friend) peers down at us:
</DIRECTION>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're drooling on my sofa.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<DIRECTION>
Milo unsticks his face from the leather couch, wobbles upright. Are the walls throbbing, or is it just him?
</DIRECTION>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do have an apartment, don't you? With a bed of some kind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<DIRECTION>
Milo grunts. Sid hands him a coffee.
</DIRECTION>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heard you shut down 5th Street yesterday. Gave every kid in the county the gift of nightmares.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I'm a giving kind of guy. Anyway, what do you care? I brought your guy in, right?

<DIRECTION>
Milo holds out his hand, palm up. Sid COUNTS MONEY INTO HIS PALM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SID'S BAIL BONDS/JERSEY CITY- MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Swearing under his breath, Sid is trying to stuff a Xmas tree into the back of a station wagon. At least half of the tree is hanging out of the back. Milo drinks a beer and watches.
</DIRECTION>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gonna give me a hand, or just stand there killing your liver?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that a trick question?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Sid glares at him. Milo sighs, puts down his beer, and grabs part of the tree.
</DIRECTION>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I told her, fine, I'd handle Xmas this year. I mean, what's to handle? You buy a tree, some gifts, cook a ham, hang some lights. An idiot could do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, we'll soon find out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Sid checks him out.
</DIRECTION>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have plans for the holiday?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The usual.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gonna drink some cheap whiskey and put your fist through a wall?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jealous?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
The tree is definitely not going to fit. They let it go, and Sid pulls out a small hand saw.
</DIRECTION>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then forget it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got an open bond, but your thing sounds like more fun. I'll give it to Doug instead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<DIRECTION>
Sid starts hacking away at the tree.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa. Hold up, Heidi. What the fuck. I want the job, I'm in the hole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're always in the hole.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your point?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<SID>
<DIRECTION>
(SIGHING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The truth is, I'm not sure you're the right person for this job. It could be a total disaster. On the other hand, when one friend sees another friend stagnating in his own filth, he has to do something, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. I just woke up. I was gonna shower.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Sid drops the saw. With one final shove, the tree is in. Phew. Sid slams the back shut.
</DIRECTION>
<SID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok. But remember: you asked for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SID>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches into his pocket and extracts A FOLDED PIECE OF PAPER. Hands it to Milo. Milo unfolds it, gives it a quick look. A second look. A third.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIME STOPS. THE WHOLE STREET GOES SILENT.
</DIRECTION>

	No.

	Let's face it: you're not exactly rational around her. I mean, if I was a cop working a case and some reporter came snooping around, I'd say "no comment". Not "no comment, but care for a cocktail"? And then a month later, running off to some love shack called "Caveman's Cabin" and tying the knot? Who does that?

<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not even close to what happened. For one thing, it was called "Cupid's Cabin". And for another, that was before I knew how conniving she was. Now I know. So all I have to do is track her down, cuff her up, and bring her in.

Milo slips inside, pulling the door shut behind him. It's dark and quiet. He glides through the room, scoping it out. The place is huge, white rug and couch, flat screen TV.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And lining the bookshelves are FRAMED ARTICLES, AWARDS, PHOTOS OF CASS WITH VARIOUS PUBLIC FIGURES: the home of a successful and dedicated journalist.

He picks up one of the framed articles with the headline "LOCAL REPORTER WINS AWARD FOR BREAKING UP 13TH STREET DRUG RING". There's a photo of CASS SHAKING HANDS WITH THE AN IMPORTANT-LOOKING OFFICIAL.

CHIRON: "1:00PM. ATLANTIC CITY. 44 HOURS TO GO."

Milo exits his car and heads inside. STEWART, feeling super sly, pulls up to a space near Milo's car, but another car slips into the spot.

Milo knocks on the door. A woman in heavy makeup (LOIS, Cass' mother) opens the door, takes one look at Milo, SLAMS the door shut. Milo waits. After a moment, Lois opens it again.

Men running around in gowns and feather boas. A completely recovered Lois sits by a make-up mirror, adjusting a wig. Stuck to her mirror is a PHOTO OF MILO AND CASS, ARMS AROUND EACH OTHER, SMILING. Milo gives the photo a dirty look.

<MILO>

	Where is she, Lois? I need to talk to her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<LOIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Milo, where did it all go wrong? Do you have any idea what it means to waste a woman's child- bearing years? It's criminal. Every month her eggs are jumping out of her ovaries like sailors abandoning a sinking ship. I mean, I know you were mad about that article...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOIS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't mad about that article. In fact: what article?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<LOIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me, Milo: Cassidy may be a strong independent woman on the outside, but on the inside she's just a girl who wants to be protected and loved by her man. What happened between the two of you devastated her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOIS>
<MILO>

Milo's jaw hits the floor.

<MILO>

</MILO>
<CASS>

Strange, charged moment as they look at each other. Then they have a casual contest:

Cass immediately stands.

<CASS>

	You know what? I don't have time for this, I'm working.

Milo doesn't budge. Spelling it out for her:

<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I do is, I track down criminals. People who jumped bail. Idiots who decided to go on the run after biting police officers. I find them, and I take them to jail.

Cass stares at him, eyes wide:
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>

	Now, hold on just a second, Milo...

<MILO>

	Tell you what: I'll give you more than a second. I'll give you 10. For old times sake.

Milo moves his leg, kicks back, starts to count.

Cass stares at him, her jaw working, trying to decide what to do. Then, all of a sudden, she BOLTS. Milo smiles. THE LOUDSPEAKERS ANNOUNCE: "AND THEY'RE OFF!"

With that, Milo sweeps her up into his arms. AND THEY FIND THEMSELVES FACE TO FACE. BREATHING ON EACH OTHER. THEIR LIPS INCHES APART.

Cass stares at Milo. Is he gonna kiss her? Again, she feels weird. Confused.

He smiles at her, waves, then SLAMS down the lid.

</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bad news for you, then. I wouldn't help you if you were the very last baby sea turtle in the world, dragging its tiny weak body across the burning hot sand while sea gulls circled overhead. I'd just pull up a chair, sip a pina colada, and let nature take its course.

Long beat. Suddenly, CASS STARTS TO SOB. LOUD, HYSTERICAL SOBS. Milo listens for a moment, out of a purely clinical interest, then:

	Hey, I used to be a sucker, but no more. You can cry til the cows come home, for all I care.

Milo groans and crumbles to the ground. Cass jumps out of the trunk and stands over him:

Finally, he has her on her back, TRAPPED. He gets his face right over hers and STARTS TO LET A GLOB OF SALIVA FALL FROM HIS MOUTH TOWARDS HER FACE.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	NOOOO! Uncle, uncle, uncle!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>

Milo collapses onto the ground next to her, laughing. She looks at him and she starts laughing too.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dirty fighter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me? I'm the dirty fighter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
They both laugh harder. Then Milo stands and offers her a hand. She takes it, and he helps her up. Awkward pause as they look at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should we...I don't know...hug, or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. What the hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
He opens his arms. She moves closer. They hug. Milo feels her hands moving towards the gun in his belt. He smirks. CLICK. HE SNAPS SOME HANDCUFFS ONTO HER WRISTS.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. I had to try, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get in the car.

INT. CADILLAC- AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are driving along, both a little dishevelled, ONE OF CASS' HANDS CUFFED TO THE PASSENGER DOOR. They pass casinos as they head out of Atlantic City.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your windshield's cracked.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Captain Obvious.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Cass turns to inspect him more closely.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you look like shit, Milo. What have you been doing, sleeping on the floor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
Milo has been sleeping on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I enjoy sleeping on the floor. Matter of fact, I love sleeping on the floor. I love everything about my life. Great job, good friends, hot girlfriend...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have a girlfriend?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(he does not)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes I do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Cass is skeptical:
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? What's her name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(the first name that pops into his head:)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Teresa. Rocking hot body. Likes to cook pasta for me and perform strip- teases.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. Is she missing a chromosome?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, she has all her chromosomes, believe you me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Cass thinks this over, then counters:
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, my life is great, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can tell. You and Stewart make a great couple, by the way. You and me made a terrible couple. But you two? Like peas in a pod.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
About to deny that she and Stewart are a couple, it occurs to Cass: Milo seems a little JEALOUS. She jumps on this:
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I like about Stewart?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't imagine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not even on his best day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or his worst.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll bet he has a lot of those.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still betting, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't win if you don't play.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Or, in your case, even if you do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
He shoots her a sharp look. She stares back, waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I win all the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? I hadn't noticed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
Ok. That is definitely a challenge.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what? Seeing as how I'm about to come into five grand...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Milo makes a SUDDEN TURN OFF THE HIGHWAY and pulls into the parking lot of BALLY'S CASINO.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'll do a little betting right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you have to take me back?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. I have two days. A monkey could get you back in two days.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Again: famous last words. Milo exits the car. Cass smiles to herself. This is obviously what she hoped would happen. She glances around, spots THE DUFFLE in the back seat. PEEKING OUT OF THE TOP OF THE DUFFLE IS THE TASER GUN. Hmm...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CADILLAC- AFTERNOON

Milo opens her door.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aren't you afraid I'll get away?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope.

</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
He uncuffs her from the door, CUFFS HER TO HIS OWN WRIST.

The clerk at the chips cage recognizes Milo as he and Cass APPROACH:
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merry Xmas, Mr Boyd!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
Behind the clerk, a FEMALE CLERK perks up at this name...
</DIRECTION>
<CLERK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a nice surprise! Let's hope your luck is better today.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CLERK>
<DIRECTION>
Milo glances at Cass.

<MILO>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Yes sir. Of course. My mistake.

Milo sits at a blackjack table, pulling Cass into a seat next to him.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prepare to observe the master.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
He bets while Cass sits next to him, scheming:
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok, how about this:
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
She uses her free hand to pull out her wallet:
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I give you all the cash in my wallet, will you let me go?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm. Lemme see...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
He takes the cash from her and thinks for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope. Guess not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Milo adds her cash to his bet on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hit me.

Milo quickly lays out some more money. A WAITRESS (smells like an ashtray) appears:
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And for the couple over here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(QUICKLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're not a couple.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
<DIRECTION>
(just as quick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why would you think we were a couple?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We used to be together. Back when I was young and foolish.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I was confused.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I was slumming.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And I was drunk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
The waitress looks back and forth between them.
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
<DIRECTION>
(BORED)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great story. I have to get back to work now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait. Champagne! I'm celebrating.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
The waitress rolls her eyes and leaves. Milo turns to see he has lost more money.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(under his breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son of a bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Ok. Cass has had enough of this. She leans closer:
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Milo, the truth is...my Mom is in the hospital.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
Milo perks up.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh? Old Lois not feeling up to par?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She might be really sick. That's why I had to jump bail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(overly sincere)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Taking care of her, huh? Putting aside your career for a loved one? Golly, that's so you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
"Golly"? Cass stares at him, realizing:
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've already been to see her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Impressive. No wonder you got all those awards. So lemme guess: the real reason you jumped bail is cause you're on a story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Cass narrows her eyes:
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stewart. Stewart told you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(CAUGHT)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would have figured it out on my own, trust me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't trust you if you were the last man alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You think about that much? Me being the last man alive? Am I naked in this fantasy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Cass takes a deep breath. This is getting her nowhere. But she is clearly hesitant to give him the real story.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok, you're right. I'm on a story. A very important story. It just so happens that I'm possibly about to uncover a whole ring of dirty cops.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
Milo snorts.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. Isn't the whole "dirty cop" thing kind of old? Maybe you should do a story about something people are interested in. Like internet porn. Or lesbians.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm serious, Milo. This is gonna be big. And here's what I'm willing to do
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(magnanimous): I'm willing to
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	credit you in the article.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, sure, like you credited me in the 13th Street Article?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Cass stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why on earth would I have credited you? I worked my ass off for that story.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's one way of putting it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that supposed to mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it. I don't want to be in your article. In fact, I would rather eat a bowl of broken glass than have my name in any way associated with one of your lousy articles...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. Forget I mentioned it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I already have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, you're not a cop anymore, right? What do you care if people were murdered?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please. Nobody was murdered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>

</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Car accident?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok, ok, maybe he wasn't murdered yet. But I wouldn't be surprised if...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
Milo breaks out into loud guffaws. Cass is furious.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe this whole thing sounds like no big deal to you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what it sounds like? It sounds like you're going to jail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Cass can't believe this.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Milo, listen, you have to believe me, come on, you know me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(getting red)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly! I do know you. Which means I know you are a deceptive, cold- hearted bitch who is going to jail where she belongs.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Wow. That was pretty harsh. Cass looks at him, stunned. They stare at each other in silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The waitress arrives with the drinks:
</DIRECTION>
<WAITRESS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Champagne. So. What are we celebrating?
	</DIALOGUE>
</WAITRESS>
<CASS>
<DIRECTION>
(GRIMLY)

	<DIALOGUE>
	I have to use the bathroom.

EXT. BALLY'S CASINO PARKING LOT- LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Stewart taps his steering wheel restlessly, watching the door of the casino for signs of Cass and Milo. Waiting in this parking lot is boring. Finally, he exits his car. Sidles over to Milo's car. Checks the door handle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IT'S UNLOCKED. Stewart glances around, then climbs in.

Cass enters and Milo follows:
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can I have some privacy, please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
Milo checks the room. Looks like there is no escape from here. He UNCUFFS HER, but then:
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna have to frisk you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get it over with, then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
Milo checks her pockets. Her ankles. Her legs. He goes behind her and checks her shoulders. Her back. He reaches around and checks her belly.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gain a little weight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
<DIRECTION>
(snapping back)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You lose a little hair?

Milo reaches higher and:
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Right. I'm hiding a weapon in my breasts.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
Milo backs off, turning red.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make it quick.

</CASS>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello? Ok, that's long enough, I'm coming in...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
He comes in and SHE JAMS THE TASER GUN INTO HIS NECK AND HITS THE BUTTON. HE SCREAMS AND HITS THE FLOOR. SHE SCREAMS, DROPS THE TASER GUN, AND FLEES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CASINO- LATE AFTERNOON

<DIRECTION>
CASS RUNS OUT, BANGS INTO SOMEONE...
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry...

</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
...and keeps going. She hurries to the curb and tries to flag down a ride.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RACK TO- SEVERAL YARDS AWAY, THE PERSON SHE BUMPED INTO IS STARING AFTER HER. IT'S MAHLER. Mahler compares her to the newspaper photo he is holding. Yup: THAT'S HER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cass glances around, keeping an eye out for Milo, and SPOTS MAHLER STARING AT HER. Suddenly, he starts heading towards her. Cass backs up slightly, nervous. WHO IS THAT GUY?
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Need a lift?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Cass looks around. A trucker has pulled up next to her. Relieved, she quickly climbs on board.

<DIRECTION>
RACK TO- MAHLER, WATCHING THE TRUCK PULL AWAY. He doesn't seem worried. He turns and heads for his car.

Cass is fixing her hair, pulling herself together.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says we made a terrible couple. Which is true. I know that. I'm the one who thought that first. I'm the one who came up with that. The fact is, I don't want to be with someone who can't admit he was wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're available.

EXT. HIGHWAY- LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>

The truck SCREECHES to a halt by the side of the road. Cass gets booted out the passenger door. The door is slammed shut behind her. Cass gives the guy the finger as he drives off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She turns to see a car headed her way. She starts flagging it down. But wait... Yup, IT'S MILO. Shit. She looks around, but where's she gonna go? Meanwhile, as Milo nears, HE SEEMS TO BE SPEEDING UP. Cass stares. He keeps coming, an evil look on his face. IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS GOING TO RUN HER OVER.

Mahler pulls alongside them again and Milo WRENCHES the wheel to the left, SLAMMING THE CADILLAC INTO MAHLER'S CAR. Mahler's car goes skidding across the road, hits a ditch and FLIPS ONTO ITS SIDE.

	Yeah, well, no one's killing you until I get you to jail.

Cass whips her head around to look at him:

<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're still taking me to jail? But it's the cops who are after me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First of all: that guy was not a cop. Second of all, we just left him unconscious in a ditch. You'll be fine.

</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
Milo rolls his eyes and straightens up.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll lay it out for you: some loser with a minor sheet calls you up and says, hey, I've got a big story for you, you interested? It'll only cost you a couple hundred bucks, and I'll tip you onto some criminal activity, it's your chance to expose some bad guys and write the story of your life. Then the moron gets himself caught, he's probably in cold storage somewhere, and now you think the bad guys are after you.

Milo finishes with the tire, throws the jack in the back, and heads back around to the driver's seat.

<DIRECTION>
Cass watches him closely, getting an idea. She reaches into her pocket and pulls out the paper from Jimmy.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
<DIRECTION>
(CASUALLY)
</DIRECTION>

	If only I knew exactly when and where this deal was going down. Course, if I can't figure out that part, then you definitely can't figure out that part, because we both know I'm much smarter than you.

Milo flinches, then forces a laugh.

Milo stares at the paper, wracking his brain. Cass sighs loudly and SNATCHES the paper back.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, well, forget it, I knew you couldn't do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>

Cass stares him in the eye and says the magic words:

Milo stares at her. She stares back. Long beat. Milo's face is red. He clenches his fists. He unclenches them. Fuck. He thrusts out his hand:

Milo glides through the casino, past the blinking lights of the slot machines, headed for the elevators. A DRUNK GUY in a Hawaiian shirt is coming towards him and HE AND MILO COLLIDE...
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(steadying the guy)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You Ok? My bad.

</MILO>
<DRUNK_GUY>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
(under his breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prick.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRUNK_GUY>
<DIRECTION>
The drunk guy continues past. Milo holds up THE ROOM CARD KEY HE HAS JUST SWIPED FROM THE GUY:
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(calling after him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merry Xmas to you, too!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TRUMP CASINO 25TH FLOOR- EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The elevator dings and Milo exits. He turns a corner and heads down the hall. Another elevator DINGS behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo continues down the hall. Suddenly, he STOPS and looks behind him. No one is there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns another corner and FINDS 2504. There is a "DO NOT DISTURB" sign on the door. HE GOES PAST IT AND TAPS LIGHTLY ON 2505.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Room service.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
No answer. He glances down the hall and sees a slight movement. SOMEONE IS WATCHING HIM. He moves away from the door, continues down the hall, THEN SLIPS INTO THE ICE MACHINE ROOM...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ICE MACHINE ROOM- CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo hits the light switch off and waits just inside the door. Someone steps in, and MILO GRABS THEM AND THROWS THEM AGAINST THE WALL. The person SCREAMS. Milo slaps a hand across the person's mouth and switches on the light. And finds himself face to face with:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CASS.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at the handcuff dangling from her wrist, STILL ATTACHED TO THE CAR DOOR ARM REST.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(loud whisper)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
<DIRECTION>
(SAME)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's my story, I don't break stories by staying in the car!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, well,
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(re: the armrest)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	you're paying for that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, ok. Here's a nickle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, Milo goes still. THERE IS A CREAKING SOUND as someone creeps down the hall. Milo puts a finger to Cass' lips.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then he peeks out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILO'S POV- THE CLEANING CART BEING SLOWLY WHEELED DOWN THE HALL BY THE MAID. The maid stops by a room and enters.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perfect.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Cass)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Play along.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY- EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo passes the maid's cart, glancing at her ROOM RECORD SHEET, then continues on to room 2505. He uses the CARD HE SWIPED on the door. Of course, IT DOESN'T WORK.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(LOUD)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Godammit. Son of a bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
The maid peeks out into the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(to Cass)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is like the third card they've given me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
<DIRECTION>
(playing along)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it easy, honey...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tell me to take it easy, now we have to go all the way downstairs again...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Cass looks pleadingly at the maid.
</DIRECTION>
<MAID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAID>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Davenport. Room 2505.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
The maid checks her chart, then crosses the hall and USES HER PASS KEY TO OPEN THE DOOR.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're an angel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Milo and Cass go inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROOM 2505- EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo closes the door carefully behind them, then tiptoes across the room to the connecting door, Cass close on his heels. All is silent.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
<DIRECTION>
(WHISPERING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a second: where's my gun?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(SAME)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. Where is your gun?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't have one.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then you've answered your own question.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Milo tiptoes closer to the door. Cass pulls on his sleeve.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, give me something. You've got, like, a million weapons in the jacket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches for his jacket, and Milo pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. These are not toys. You can't just give them to someone and have them know how to use them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I seem to remember doing just fine with your taser gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
They are at the door. Milo puts a finger to his lips and tries the doorknob: LOCKED. He is about to work the lock when THEY HEAR SCREAMS COMING FROM THE LOCKED ROOM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No time to do this quietly. MILO TAKES A STEP BACK, THEN KICKS THE DOOR IN...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY- EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Halfway down the hallway, THE MAID HEARS THE DOOR BEING KICKED IN. Nervous, she backs away, headed for the elevators...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ROOM 2504- CONTINUOUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo QUICKLY ENTERS THE ROOM, GUN RAISED. THE SCREAMING IS COMING FROM THE TV. Milo clicks it off and checks the room. The place appears to be deserted. He crosses to the bathroom and peers in: EMPTY.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, Cass has cautiously entered the room and sees spots on the rug:
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, god, is that blood?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. Columbo. Wait by the door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm just trying to...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This could be a crime scene. There are clues all over this room that only a trained eye can find. And as I seem to recall, you were the one who was unable to figure this out by herself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Oooh. Cass grits her teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
<DIRECTION>
(under her breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is unbelievable.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are you talking to, your imaginary friend Leslie?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
<DIRECTION>
(BLUSHING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. Lots of kids have imaginary friends, despite what my mother believes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever. You wait by the door. And I'll handle this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
<DIRECTION>
(PISSED)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
She moves back to the door. As she does, she notices a matchbook on the floor: IT'S A GREEN MATCHBOOK WITH A BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A HORSE.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you're saying you don't want my help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm saying I don't need your help.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
<DIRECTION>
(SHRUGGING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
As he turns away, SHE SLIPS THE MATCHBOOK INTO HER PURSE. Milo catches this movement out of the corner of his eye and glances back:
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
<DIRECTION>
(INNOCENTLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What was what?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you find something?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How could I find anything? I'm not the detective.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lemme see your purse...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Milo takes a step closer to her, but:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	FREEZE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Cass and Milo turn to see A HOTEL SECURITY GUARD IN THE DOORWAY, EXCITEDLY POINTING HIS GUN AT THEM. Milo rolls his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hotel security! Stay where you are!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok, Ok, no problem. You're probably gonna want this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Milo holds up HIS GUN.
</DIRECTION>
<GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
(PANICKED)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DROP THE WEAPON, NOW!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GUARD>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it easy. I'm just gonna unload it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Milo drops the cartridge, then TOSSES THE GUN RIGHT AT THE GUARD'S FACE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guard instinctively raises his hands and Milo CHARGES him, tackling him to the ground, then handcuffing him to the table.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo GRABS Cass hand and races from the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY- EVENING
</DIRECTION>

Cass and Milo run up to the elevators. ALL CARS ARE RISING: BACK-UP IS ON THE WAY. Milo hits the fire alarm and pulls Cass into the stairwell...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STAIRWELL- EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo and Cass are almost to the bottom, WHEN SECURITY APPEARS IN THE STAIRWELL BENEATH THEM. Milo looks up. SECURITY IS COMING FROM ABOVE, AS WELL. Shit. Milo cracks the stairwell window and peers out: THEY ARE 4 STORIES UP.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're gonna have to jump.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
Milo considers this, then picks her up and TOSSES HER OUT THE WINDOW.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TRUMP CASINO- EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cass screams as she falls. Milo falls next to her. They fall and fall and BOOSH: THEY LAND IN A SNOW BANK AND TUMBLE TO THE GROUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Seconds later, they are on their feet, RUNNING FOR THE CAR.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>

	Whoa, whoa, whoa. You're with Cassidy? Shit, Milo, you know when you're around her your brain turns to mush.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<MILO>

	Yeah, well, that doesn't change the fact that someone took a couple shots at us.

Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You get a plate number?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Happened too quick. But it was a dark 4-door Chevy, blue or grey, New Jersey plates, and the car was wrecked, I know that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby thinks this over.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok. Lemme look into it. See what I can find. Just hold tight, Ok?

Milo checks his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok. But we're kinda on a clock here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Milo, don't fuck around with this. If there are dirty cops in the house, we all have a problem. So do me a favor: get off the strip, find somewhere to lie low and wait for my call.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BACK OF TRUMP CASINO- EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The scene has calmed down a little. A DARK SEDAN appears and RAY AND DWIGHT exit the car, looking like a an ugly, dangerous Odd Couple.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An employee slips out the back door and hands Ray a PHOTO FROM SECURITY OF MILO AND CASS IN THE CASINO PARKING LOT. Dwight snatches the photo from Ray.

CHIRON: "9:00 PM. ROUTE 9 SOUTH. 36 HOURS TO GO."

	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok. Kill me now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
PULL BACK TO REVEAL MILO AND CASS, parked in front. REVEAL THE SIGN NEXT TO THEM: "WELCOME TO CUPID'S CABIN". Yup. The place Milo and Cass ran off to and got married 3 years ago.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, it's the only place I know off the strip.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going in. What if they remember us?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>

<DIRECTION>
INT. LUXURY B&B- EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small, family-run, luxury bed and breakfast. The kind of place that prides itself on its service. DAWN (long, graying hair, glasses, moccasins) greets them with a smile:

	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait, it can't be...

Before Cass can protest more, MILO GRABS HER ARM.

<MILO>

He pulls her slightly aside.

	<DIALOGUE>
	So. Use a credit card.

(off his look)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What, I like to shop.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
They give each other a horrified look as they both realize what this means. Then they turn back to the couple, put their arms around each other, and smile:
</DIRECTION>
<MILO_CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's our third anniversary!

Milo and Cass snuggle closer. He surreptitiously squeezes her ass. She surreptitiously STOMPS on his foot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LUXURY B&B DINING-ROOM- EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Full of couples in love. Young couples, old couples, gay couples, straight couples. Even a dog couple snuggled up by the fire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then there's Milo and Cass, bruised and dishevelled, being served an elaborate romantic meal. They smile uncomfortably as Edmund arrives with a tray of oysters:
</DIRECTION>
<EDMUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To begin: a little aphrodisiac!
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDMUND>
<DIRECTION>
He gives them both a broad wink.
</DIRECTION>

<EDMUND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So tell me: how have you managed to keep the romance alive all this time?
	</DIALOGUE>
</EDMUND>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I'll tell you, Edmund. The secret to our success is that the little woman here knows her place. She cleans for me, cooks for me, and every night when I come home she gets down on her knees and massages my feet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
He beams at Cass. Cass grins through her teeth.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, Edmund, it's true. I massage his feet to help him feel like a man. It's important, especially when your husband has such a teeny tiny...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, Dawn hustles over, interrupting:
</DIRECTION>
<DAWN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How is everything? Is it like that magical night 3 years ago?

She raises a glass, tapping it with a spoon. Milo and Cass both groan under their breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DAWN>
<DIRECTION>
(to the room)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I have your attention please? Edmund and I would like to share with you the most romantic moment we have ever seen. It was three years ago today, in this very restaurant, when this lovely young man here, right in the middle of the meal, threw down his napkin, got down on one knee, and said marry me, right now, right this second, I want to go to sleep tonight knowing you're my wife!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DAWN>
<EDMUND>
<DIRECTION>
(jumping in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	</DIALOGUE>
</EDMUND>
<DIRECTION>
The whole restaurant starts clapping. Milo turns to Edmund:
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>

This one is obviously true. Both laugh harder.

INT. LUXURY B&B HONEYMOON SUITE- NIGHT

Milo and Cass stagger in, blinking hazily at their new surroundings. A heart-shaped bed. Champagne. A bubble bath. A fireplace. The works. Like Cupid threw up in here.

The laughter slowly fades. Long beat. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. This would be really awkward if we still had feelings for each other. Which we don't...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right. Luckily, we're different people now. We don't feel the way we used to.

</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. We've moved on.

</CASS>
<MILO>

<MILO>

<MILO>

</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>

Which reminds them: THEY DON'T TRUST EACH OTHER. Awkward pause. Then:

Cass disappears into the bathroom, closing the door behind her. Beat. Then MILO HURRIES OVER TO THE DOOR AND LISTENS.

Milo is looking through Cass' purse. HE KNOWS SHE WAS HIDING SOMETHING FROM HIM AT THE CASINO. While searching through her wallet, he suddenly stumbles across A WEDDING PHOTO OF HIMSELF AND CASS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Huh. He glances at the bathroom door. She carries their wedding photo around?
</DIRECTION>

Cass listens while Mom rants:

	I mean, I just don't get it, you're in this romantic place, you have a perfect opportunity to win him back...
	</DIALOGUE>

<CASS>

	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MOM>
<DIRECTION>
(immediately defensive)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was a long time ago! And all I did was serve drinks...

<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just need to know the name of the place.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MOM>

<DIRECTION>
Cass hangs up. She sits for a moment, staring at her phone. Is her mother right? Is she making a mistake right now? She looks around the bathroom. Candles, flowers, thick robes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bottle of champagne chilling by the heart-shaped tub. She slowly stands and checks herself out in the mirror, brushing back her hair with her hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, on impulse, she grabs the bottle of champagne and two glasses. WHAT THE HELL, WHY NOT?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're here, maybe they should seize the moment. She peeks out the bathroom door and sees...

Cass emerges.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. LUXURY B&B SUITE- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SNOW IS FALLING OUTSIDE. PAN FROM THE WINDOW, ACROSS THE ROOM TO THE BED, ACROSS A SNORING MILO TO CASS, EYES CLOSED, HAND CUFFED TO THE HEADBOARD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, CASS' EYES SNAP OPEN. She sits up a little and glances over at MILO'S NIGHT TABLE WHERE HE LEFT THE KEYS AND GUN IN PLAIN VIEW. She smiles...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LUXURY B&B SUITE- TEN MINUTES LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cass is doing a slow, careful, ACROBATIC CLIMB ACROSS MILO'S BODY in an attempt to reach the gun without waking Milo up. She puts a hand on the headboard. She is lifting her knee over him, when he stirs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She freezes, waiting for him to settle. It's like playing Twister, only if the person you're playing with finds out, HE'S GOING TO KILL YOU.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She manages to get herself STRADDLING HIM, arms stretched, THE GUN ALMOST WITHIN REACH, when:
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me.

</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Cass FREEZES.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>

	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>

She looks down. Milo is watching her, wide awake. Hmm. This is going to be a tough one to explain.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>

<MILO>

(INTERRUPTING)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, it's true, I'm still attracted to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
Her hand is groping around blindly, where the fuck is it? She stretches more, bringing her face even closer to Milo's.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really? Wow. That's great news. You know what would be really sexy right now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Uh-oh.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>

</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. If you talked dirty to me.

</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just...all of you.

</CASS>
<MILO>

Cass blushes fiercely. If she didn't want that gun so bad...

	My great hair? My chest? Or...something lower like...

He reaches down and WHIPS OUT:
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My gun?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
THE GUN IS IN HIS HAND. That's why she couldn't reach it. HE KNEW WHAT SHE WAS UP TO THIS WHOLE TIME. She flips off him and back onto her side. Milo sits up, flipping on the lights.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew I couldn't trust you!

	Oh my god, would you get over it already! So I cracked the case before you did, it was 3 years ago, it happened, stop being such a baby and move on!

</CASS>
<MILO>

	Oh I'm moving on. You know how I'm moving on? By cracking this case before you, then taking you in so you can spend this Xmas in jail, all alone.

MILO'S FACE IS TURNING BRIGHT RED. HE GASPS FOR AIR. HE SLOWLY SLIDES OFF HIS CHAIR ONTO THE FLOOR. Cass calmly reaches across the table, taking his keys and unhandcuffing herself.

Car keys in hand, she bends down to whisper in his ear:

Next to an ambulance, Milo is unconscious on a stretcher. An EMT prepares a HUGE SYRINGE, picks a spot on Milo's chest, then PLUNGES THE NEEDLE INTO IT.

Milo JERKS up on a gurney, gasping for air.

The EMT exchanges a look with the ambulance driver, then helps Milo off the stretcher.

	No one tried to kill you, buddy. You just need to be more careful about what you eat.

</EMT>
<MILO>

<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Know where this place is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<EMT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. Charley's, on the boardwalk. And just FYI: when they say "don't touch" the dancers, they mean with with any part of your body, not just your hands.

The EMT folds the stretcher, loads it into the ambulance, and THEY DRIVE AWAY, leaving Milo in the parking lot.

EXT. ATLANTIC CITY BOARDWALK- AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>

Cass pulls up, parks in a lot, and instantly spots CHARLEY'S GREEN SIGN WITH THE BLACK HORSE SILHOUETTE, squeezed between a burger place and a souvenir shop. She slips out of the car, takes a careful look around, then works her way towards the club.

POV OF THE FRONT DOOR, OPENING A CRACK, CASS PEEKING IN.

EXT. BACK OF CHARLEY'S- AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cass finds the back entrance. THE DOOR IS BOLTED. She is looking for a window to climb into, when she spots JIMMY'S METS' HAT ON THE GROUND.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shit. Cass stares at the hat: JIMMY IS HERE SOMEWHERE. She presses her ear up against the back door:

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jimmy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, SHE HEARS GROANING COMING FROM INSIDE. Or grunting. LIKE SOMEONE TRYING TO CALL OUT THROUGH A GAG. She looks around. There is a window higher up on the wall. Cass drags a trash can beneath the window, stacks another one on top of it, and cautiously climbs up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The window is locked and she can't see through it. Hmm. Fuck it. She takes her purse and SMASHES a pane of glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She wobbles on trash cans and GRABS THE WINDOWSILL JUST AS THE CANS FALL AWAY, LEAVING HER DANGLING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CHARLEY'S STORAGE ROOM- AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>

Cass is not impressed. She stares at him coldly.

Milo stares at her. Huh. It actually didn't occur to him...

<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't just "waltz in". You know I had been working it for months, too. Isn't it possible that we're both good at our jobs, and I just happened to come out ahead?

Milo seems surprised to hear this. But before he can respond, THE BOAT ROCKS ON A WAVE AND THEY ARE SENT ROLLING IN CASS' DIRECTION. AS THEY ROLL:
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ow...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit..
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dammit...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
They are stopped when MILO'S FACE IS SLAMMED INTO THE SIDE OF THE BOAT. Milo lets out a grunt. Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Milo?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(MUFFLED)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm Ok. Ok, we need to turn to the right, and wait for the next wave.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
They both start turning separate ways:
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
They turn to the right and wait. After a moment:
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. You were in love with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course I was in love with you, why do you think I married you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
No response. Behind her back, Milo looks sheepish. Cass REALIZES:
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. My. God. You think I married you so I could get info on the case? Who am I, Mata Hari?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
Milo looks confused. He is trying to figure out...
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's a spy, Milo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
Aaah.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(QUICKLY)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know that. Everybody knows that. Mata Hari the spy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Beat. Milo clears his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well. It might be a little late for this. But...nice job on the article.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, if I had something sharp right now, I would stab you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, really, I mean, it was well- written and...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you just get us out of here, please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, A WAVE HITS THE BOAT, AND THEY GO ROLLING TOWARDS THE BOMB. AS THEY ROLL:
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Umph...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ughh...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son of a...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ow...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
And they come to a stop, MILO'S FACE PRESSED RIGHT UP TO THE BOMB. He watches the timer: "00:44, 00:43, 00:42..."
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you see the bomb?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, yeah. I can see the bomb. Now we get up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
MILO GRABS THE BOMB AND HOLDS IT AGAINST HIS BELLY. Cass and Milo push against each other, and struggle up to a standing position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Great. So far, so good.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Only, MILO CAN'T RAISE HIS ARMS. AND THE PORTHOLE IS SIX FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. NOW WHAT?
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you throw it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not exactly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what are you waiting for?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm waiting for a pig to fly in here and grab it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
<DIRECTION>
(starting to panic again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Milo...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok, Ok. Um, on 3, I need you to jump.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Beat.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know: "jump, jump, jump around, jump."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you serious?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. I'm fucking with you. For fun. Just for my own personal enjoyment...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok, Ok.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ok: 1, 2, 3...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PORTHOLE- EVENING
</DIRECTION>

We see MILO'S HEAD POP INTO VIEW, THEN DISAPPEAR.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILO'S HEAD POPS UP HIGHER...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON- THE TIMER "00:06, 00:05, 00:04..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This time, MILO POPS UP HIGH ENOUGH THAT WE SEE HIS HANDS...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON- THE TIMER "00:03, 00:02, 00:01..."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And finally, MILO IS HIGH ENOUGH THAT HE CAN THRUST THE BOMB OUT THE WINDOW...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON THE BOMB AS IT CRASHES INTO THE WATER...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HULL OF BOAT- EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo and Cass, both a little out of breath, stand still, listening. Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think the water defused it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lemme ask you this? Has anything gone our way yet?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
SUDDENLY, A LOW ROAR FROM BENEATH GROWS AND RISES UP BENEATH THE BOAT, ROCKING IT WILDLY AS WATER EXPLODES ON ALL SIDES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cass and Milo get drenched, BUT ARE SAFE.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. You, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now lets find something to cut these ropes off...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think we can catch that cop?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>

Because at this very moment...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MOTORBOAT- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
...Bobby is paddling frantically, pausing every once in a while to curse the motor, WHICH FOR SOME REASON REFUSES TO START. He see the lights of another boat coming up behind him, and he paddles faster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DECK OF YACHT- NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo steers the yacht right up behind Bobby, dwarfing the motorboat. Calling out:
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Bobby. I got one for ya...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby looks up to see MILO POINTING AN ASSAULT RIFLE HE GRABBED FROM THE EVIDENCE BOXES:
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the difference between a snowman and a snowwoman?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(holding something up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The spark plug.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby checks the motor: SO THAT'S WHY IT WON'T RUN. MILO GRABBED THE SPARK PLUG. Milo and Cass grin down at Bobby while he kicks the motor and swears.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PIER 19- DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CHIRON: "6:00 AM. PIER 19. 3 HOURS TO GO."
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cops are everywhere. Cass and Milo are seated on a bench, exhausted, watching as THE COPS UNLOAD BOXES OF STOLEN EVIDENCE FROM THE YACHT. Bobby is cuffed in the back of a squad car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment:
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Merry Xmas. I got you this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Milo hands Cass some seaweed.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You shouldn't have.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
Milo checks his watch.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. I've still got three hours to get you to jail. Looks like I'm gonna win that bet after all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
Cass' eyes go wide. Suddenly, she JUMPS UP and BOLTS.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have got to be kidding me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH- DAWN
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Like an action sequence in slo-mo, Cass stumbles across the sand, exhausted, Milo at her heels. Finally, he makes one last effort, LUNGES for her, brings her down and SNAPS on the cuffs.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
<DIRECTION>
(muffled, face in the SAND)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going without a fight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>

</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop talking.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...and I was unjustly arrested...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
To shut her up, Milo GRABS HER AND KISSES HER. THEN SHE IS KISSING HIM BACK. TIME STOPS FOR A MOMENT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Milo hands her over to the clerk.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(to Cass)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

EXT. POLICE STATION- MORNING
</DIRECTION>

Milo exits. He passes some cops on their way in. ONE GELMAN, THE COP HE INSULTED IN THE BEGINNING.
</DIRECTION>
<GELMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. It's that jerk-off bounty hunter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GELMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Milo stops in his tracks. Mentally weighs the pros and cons. DECIDES:
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, what the hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
He turns around, walks back to Gelman, AND SMASHES HIM IN THE FACE WITH HIS FIST.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh my god, what happened?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
