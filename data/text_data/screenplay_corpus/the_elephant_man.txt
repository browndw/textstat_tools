<DIRECTION>
:SC: CIRCUS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN TO steam shooting out of a huge old half-rusted calliope. The music is very loud and raucous. Moving up and back we see the black awning entrance to the freak tent, where FREDERICK TREVES, Resident Surgeon and Lecturer on anatomy at the London Hospital, is standing with his back to us observing the posters of the freaks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Coming along a muddy walkway at the side of the tent is Treves' wife, ANNE, and their two DAUGHTERS. The shrill over- whelming music seems to engulf her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She looks discomfited, vulnerable, and protective of her daughters. The girls, oblivious to any fear, are finishing their chocolate sweets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UP of Treves looking at a poster.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He hears:
</DIRECTION>
<1_DAUGHTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poppa!
	</DIALOGUE>
</1_DAUGHTER>
<DIRECTION>
Treves turns and looks down to a chocolate-covered face. He smiles at the children and Anne.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anne sees the dirty faces and begins cleaning one of them. The other daughter looks into the freak tent.
</DIRECTION>
<2_DAUGHTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poppa... may we go in there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</2_DAUGHTER>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright... Your turn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<DIRECTION>
She turns the girl away from the freak tent and begins cleaning her face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her kerchief pulls and distorts the little daughter's face. Suddenly the girl sees a ring of elephants in the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<2_DAUGHTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh,look M-ummy! Elephants!
	</DIALOGUE>
</2_DAUGHTER>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, elephants! We'll go see them.
	</DIALOGUE>

	You won't be long?

</ANNE>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll join you shortly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
She takes the children off toward the elephants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves watches them go for a moment, then turns and we go with him into the dark freak tent. He pauses to pay admission at a small booth, then disappears within.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DARKNESS. We hear what could be the trumpeting of an elephant.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves parts the black canvas and enters the main part of the tent. Off to his left he sees a man wrapped in a black cape, holding a conch shell aloft and blowing powerfully into it. The tent is dimly lit with flickering oil lamps. People mill about through the weaving corridors. To Treves' right, he sees a sign reading, "The Deadly Fruit of the Original Sin," over a small, very dark corridor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves enters the passage and disappears into the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The corridor has a series of flaps and turns to disorient the spectator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves carefully pushes his way through and arrives at the inner chamber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In a roped-off space stands a small stage set at eve-level, with curtains on three sides. On the stage is a bell jar filled with grey-murky fluid lit from behind with casts an eerie glow in the chamber. Suspended in the fluid is the life-sized body of a baby-doll with the attached head of a large snake. At the join of head and body is a blob of unidentifiable organic matter. It is obviously phony, but the effect is still very disquieting. At the bottom of the jar, in the muck, sits an apple with two large bites out of it. Behind the jar is a painting on the order of a religious triptych, portraying Adam on one side, Eve on the other, and the tree flowering over the jar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves' impassive face is bathed in the watery glow. He studies the strange object with a critical eye. In the passage we hear movement, and an OLDER GENTLEMAN enters. He seems visibly impressed with "The Deadly Fruit of the Original Sin."
</DIRECTION>
<OLDER_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A wicked birth...
	</DIALOGUE>
</OLDER_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
After a moment, Treves quietly leaves the inner chamber.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As he pushes his way through the corridor, the noise grows and becomes a cacophony of strange sounds. He exits and hears a booming roar and the rush of air as a series of twelve candles, mounted in a row on a ten-foot stand, are blown out by "THE INCREDIBLE WIND-MAN." His BARKER steps up and talks to the people.
</DIRECTION>
<BARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and Gentlemen, his lungs are larger than this mammoth blacksmith's bellows. So great is his power of exhalation, rivaling even that of the Great North Wind, that he will now challenge two grown men to attempt to hold the bellows shut as he applies the mighty blast of his herculean breath! Are there any volunteers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARKER>
<DIRECTION>
A few people raise their hands. The Barker scans the crowd and then points over the heads of the volunteers to TWO MEN toward the back.
</DIRECTION>
<BARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah! I see two likely lads! Come forward! Come forward! Pit your strength against the Mighty Wind- Man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARKER>
<DIRECTION>
During the above, The Incredible Wind-Man removes his cape, revealing his great barrel chest and pot-belly supported by spindly, white, hairless legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the Barker sets the "Volunteers," the Wind-Man walks about the small platform, huffing and puffing and blowing on the conch shell.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The "Volunteers" set, the Wind-Man steps up to the end of the bellows, takes an enormous breath, and twirls his black handlebar moustache as a signal to the Barker.
</DIRECTION>
<BARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gentlemen... Are you ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARKER>
<THE_LADS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes we are... Right... etc.
	</DIALOGUE>
</THE_LADS>
<BARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and Gentlemen!... Let the demonstration begin!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARKER>
<DIRECTION>
The Wind-Man clamps his mouth to the bellows, and with great show begins to exhale, savagely stamping his feet. The Two Lads struggle obviously, and then pretend to be forced apart.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Barker triumphantly lifts the Wind-Man's hand. The Wind- Man ceases to blow, removes his lips from the bellows and the Two Lads instantly collapse together on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<BARKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ladies and Gentlemen!... "THE INCREDIBLE WIND-MAN!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARKER>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd cheers, while the Wind-Man puts the conch shell to his lips and proudly stamps his feet, circling about the Two Lads.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Amidst this applause, Treves smiles indulgently. He moves on, looking for something genuine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO BOBBIES move through the crowd, intent upon a certain destination. Treves conveys a casual interest in them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves moves on to A BEARDED LADY who combs her beard, busily chewing tobacco and spitting into a spittoon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves continues to work his way through the crowd. Up ahead he sees the Bobbies.
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBIES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make way! Make way!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBIES>
<DIRECTION>
They round a corner.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes they are, they're yours alright.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the laughter of a crowd.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves moves closer to see a FAT LADY seated in a chair on the next platform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On each knee she holds a DWARF. They are dressed as babies. A SKELETON MAN stands beside her.
</DIRECTION>
<SKELETON_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I refuse to believe it! I will not accept it! Those babies are simply too ugly, they cannot be mine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKELETON_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd laughs uproariously.
</DIRECTION>
<SKELETON_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want them! Get rid of them! I don't want to see them!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKELETON_MAN>
<FAT_LADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darling, don't be difficult! Let's take our sweet lovely children on an outing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAT_LADY>
<SKELETON_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'll take these miserable whelps on an outing, alright! We'll take them to the zoo... WHERE THEY WILL STAY!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SKELETON_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
From the direction the Bobbies have gone, we hear several screams.
</DIRECTION>
<FAT_LADY>
<DIRECTION>
(pausing at the screams)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Children save yourselves! Prevail upon your Pappa!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FAT_LADY>
<DIRECTION>
The two Dwarves get down from her knees and approach the Skeleton Man. They kneel and tug at his thin legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DWARVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Poppa! Poppa! Poppa, please!
	</DIALOGUE>
</DWARVES>
<DIRECTION>
At this point, a FATHER holding his YOUNG SON in his arms passes by Treves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Young Boy clutches his Father's neck in fear, hiding his face.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER>
<DIRECTION>
(out loud, to no one in particular)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is too much! They should not allow it! They should not allow it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER>
<DIRECTION>
Treves, very curious now, along with several others, make their way around the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Before him, Treves sees an agitated crowd staring at something that from his point of view he cannot see. Brushing past him is a WOMAN pulling a small, confused and frightened LITTLE GIRL. Getting closer to the commotion, he sees four BOBBIES standing with a well-dressed alderman, arguing with the OWNER of this particular exhibit.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A distraught, almost hysterical WOMAN is ineffectually striking the Owner with her fists about his head and shoulders, crying weakly and incoherently.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beast, Beast...
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Treves is just about to see whatever it is that is causing the alarm, when one of the Bobbies says:
</DIRECTION>
<BOBBY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! That's right out! Drop the curtain!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOBBY>
<DIRECTION>
As the curtain drops, Treves just glimpses baggy trouser cuffs and two horribly deformed, root-like feet. The distraught Woman has been pulled away from the Owner and is sobbing on a Bobby's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<OWNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't do that! I've got my rights!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWNER>
<ALDERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have the authority to close you down, and I'm doing just that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALDERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
In the crowd, Treves notices a YOUNG BOY staring open-mouthed, blankly at the curtain. Treves pushes through the glut of people to join the Boy and get a better view. The curtain is actually a large canvas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On it is a life-sized portrait, crudely painted, of a creature that could only be possible in a nightmare. It is the figure of a man turning into an elephant. The transformation, however, is not complete; there is still more of the man than beast. Palm trees in the background suggest the jungle habitat in which this Perverted object might have once roamed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Filled with curiosity, Treves moves toward the curtain.
</DIRECTION>
<ALDERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This exhibit degrades all who see it, as well as the poor creature himself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALDERMAN>
<OWNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's a freak! How else can he live?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWNER>
<ALDERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Freaks are one thing. No one objects to freaks, but this is entirely different. This is monstrous, and ought not to be allowed. These officers will see to it that you are on your way as soon as possible. Good day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALDERMAN>
<DIRECTION>
The alderman turns and leaves the tent.
</DIRECTION>
<OWNER>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Movin' again!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWNER>
<DIRECTION>
He shakes his head in disgust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now at the canvas, Treves tries to lift the edge to get a peek inside the wagon, but the meaty hand of the Owner clamps down on his wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<OWNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have a care, guv'nor.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWNER>
<DIRECTION>
The two men look at each other for a solid moment.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
Treves backs away and returns his gaze to the painted canvas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: OPERATING ROOM - THE LONDON HOSPITAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a bellows pumping air into the open grate of a cast iron stove. We hear moaning in the background. The coals flare to a fierce glow. From the mouth of the stove protrude the handles of several cauterizing irons, their heads imbedded in the coals. Up above the irons, Treves stands by a waist- high operating table covered with black leather. His face is illuminated by an oil lantern held by a nurse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is fairly dark owing to the oppressive overcast sky seen through two windows. There is also a large sink, a cupboard containing dressings, gags, manacles, emetics and other unattractive things, and two hard chairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO STUDENTS and two other DOCTORS, MR. FOX and MR. HILL, are present. The two Students are pulling with constant pressure on a rope tied to the patient's leg. Treves and Mr. Fox are working on a chest wound caused by a machine accident. There are gear-wheel marks getting progressively deeper as they near a great open gash. Mr. Hill places a cotton mask over the patient's nose and mouth and applies drops of chloroform. The patient struggles, but soon his moans subside and he is unconscious.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long has this man been here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<FOX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three quarters of an hour.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOX>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmmm. Hodges, Pierce come closer. Mr. Hill, take hold of the rope please. It's a machine accident. I expect you'll be seeing a good deal of this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
The two medical Students come forward. They stare uneasily at the gaping wound, which bubbles each time the man takes an agonized breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves and Fox quickly and expertly tend the wound as Hodges and Pierce look on.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
(off handedly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Abominable things these machines. One can't reason with them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<FOX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What a mess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOX>
<DIRECTION>
Treves now notices that the student's faces have gone a trifle ashen.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What got you into medicine, Hodges?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<HODGES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father, sir. He's built quite a successful practice. I hope to take it over one day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HODGES>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that your case as well, Pierce?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<PIERCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes sir. Though of course I do have a great desire to help my fellowman.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIERCE>
<DIRECTION>
Treves smiles at them knowingly.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course you do realize that medicine has changed quite a bit since your father's time. In those days we didn't even wash our coats. In fact, the sign of a truly accomplished surgeon-- was his black operating coat, so stiff with dried blood and pus that it could stand up by itself in the corner. I've still got mine upstairs... You don't mind blood, do you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<HODGES_PIERCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(etc.)
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good, that's one thing we've always plenty of.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A hospital MESSENGER BOY, dressed in a blue uniform and a can is making his way down the hall. He stops and looks into an operating room much like the one we have just seen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside, the room is empty. The Boy closes the door and continues on to another operating room. The Doctors move with great urgency around the operating table. Blood is draining down into a white porcelain bowl. A Woman can be heard moaning. The Boy looks carefully, but finally closes the door and continues on his way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TREVES' OPERATING ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a hissing sound and steam from the cauterizing of the wound comes up obscuring part of Treves' face. The patient is being held down firmly by the other men.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and Treves looks up. The Boy pops his head in.
</DIRECTION>
<BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, Mr. Treves, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I found it.

</BOY>
<TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
(studying the Boy carefully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you see it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
The Boy shakes his head slowly, "No."
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be with you in a moment ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
The Boy closes the door.
</DIRECTION>
<FOX>
<DIRECTION>
(quietly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I say Freddie, what are you about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOX>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh nothing... nothing of any great importance.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
AERIAL SHOT from third floor of the London Hospital looking down on the hospital square.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Below, Treves is walking briskly across the square, through a gate and into the slums beyond.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The aerial shot is actually FOX'S POV, and now we see Fox filled with curiosity, watching the figure from a window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Looking down from above and to the side of him, we follow Treves walking through a cobblestone street still wet from a recent rain, covered with horse manure and filth of all sorts. The air is smoky from meat burning fires.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rounding a corner, we see and approach the painted canvas sign of "The Elephant Man" covering the front of a small, dingy shop. The door of the shop is windowless and padlocked. Treves walks into the picture, studies the whole scene for a moment, goes to the shop door and finds that it is padlocked.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves tries to look under an edge of the canvas. To his left he sees a SMALL BOY watching him intently.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know where the proprietor is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
He holds a coin out. The Boy nods, snatches the coin and then disappears around the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves turns back to the canvas.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: A PUB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A noisy pub, long and narrow. Benches run the length of the back wall, with small tables up against them. Men are clustered around the bar, talking in groups.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the Boy standing at one of the tables talking to the Owner, greedily consuming his lunch as he listens. The Boy gestures outside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: OUTSIDE THE PUB
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Boy comes out the door, quickly followed by the Owner hurriedly putting on his coat, fumbling with a riding crop, the last of his sandwich stuffed in his mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: AT THE CORNER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Boy and the Owner are carefully looking around the corner at Treves still in front of the portrait.
</DIRECTION>
<OWNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's not a peeler...

</BOY>
<OWNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No... I don't think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWNER>
<DIRECTION>
They walk into the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: IN FRONT OF THE SHOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Owner and the Boy walk up to Treves.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you the proprietor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<OWNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And who might you be, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWNER>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just one of the curious. I'd like to see it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<OWNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so. No sir, we're closed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWNER>
<DIRECTION>
Treves pulls a purse from his coat, extracts a coin and holds it out.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd pay handsomely for a private showing. Are you the proprietor?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<OWNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Handsomely?... Who sent you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWNER>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pardon me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<OWNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Never mind. I'm the owner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWNER>
<DIRECTION>
He snatches the money.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INSIDE THE SHOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Total darkness. We hear the sound of the padlock being removed. The door opens and light streams in. The canvas covering the windows at the front of the shop obscures all other light. The Owner enters, followed by Treves and the Boy. From his expression, as well as Treves', we can tell there must be an awful stench in the room. No one says a word. The Boy closes the door, while the owner lights a small gas light. We can now see the shop. It it empty, grey with dust, cold and dank. Some old tins and a few shriveled potatoes occupy a shelf. The far end of the shop is blocked off by a curtain suspended from a cord by a few rings.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Owner approaches it.
</DIRECTION>
<OWNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here we are sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(ticking it off by rote)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Life is full of surprises. Ladies and gentlemen, consider the fate of this creature's poor mother. In the fourth month of her maternal condition, she was struck down by a wild elephant
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(leering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Struck down, if you take my meaning, on an uncharted African isle. The result is plain to see ladies and gentlemen... THE TERRIBLE ELEPHANT MAN!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWNER>
<DIRECTION>
The rings rattle back, and the curtain is omen. We see a bent figure crouching on a stool, covered by a brown blanket. In front of it on a tripod is a large brick, heated from below by a bunsen burner. From the blanket protrudes a perfectly normal left arm and hand warming itself over the brick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It does not move when the curtain is drawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves steps closer. The Owner, watching his every move, turns-and smiles at him. He bangs his riding crop on the wall and yells to the crouched figure, as if speaking to a dog.
</DIRECTION>
<OWNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stand up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWNER>
<DIRECTION>
The Boy, excited by his own fear, mimics the Owner.
</DIRECTION>
<BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stand up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<DIRECTION>
The figure comes forward and lets the blanket fall to the ground and we see the ELEPHANT MAN himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves, his eyes wide with horror and wonder, his mouth frozen open, steps backward in an instinctive movement of self preservation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Owner laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Elephant Man is naked to the waist, his feet are bare and he wears a pair of worn trousers from a fat man's dress suit. He is a little below average height, and looks shorter from the bowing of his back. His head is enormous and misshapen, as big around as a man's waist. From his brow projects a huge boney mass, almost obscuring his right eye. His nose is a nose of flesh, recognizable only from its position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the upper jaw projects another mass of bone protruding from the mouth like a stump, turning the upper lip inside out, making a slobbering aperture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It almost gives the impression of a rudimentary trunk or tusk. On top of his head is a handful of lank, black hair. At the back of it hangs a bag of spongy skin, resembling cauliflower. These loathsome growths cover his back and hang down to the middle of his thighs. The right arm is enormous and shapeless, the hand like a knot of tuberous roots. His left arm is not only normal, but delicately shaped, with fine skin and a hand that any woman might envy. From his chest hangs another bag of flesh, like the dewlap of a lizard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His legs are also grossly deformed, his feet great stumps. Behind him, as painted in the portrait, are two crudely constructed palm trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Owner harshly raps again.
</DIRECTION>
<OWNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn around!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWNER>
<DIRECTION>
The Elephant Man begins to turn. The boy filled with malicious glee at seeing the monster obey, screams.
</DIRECTION>
<BOY>

</BOY>
<DIRECTION>
The Elephant Man completes his turn and comes to rest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a CLOSE-UP of the Elephant Man looking at Treves. His face is utterly devoid, and incapable, of expression.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the Elephant Man's eyes. He closes them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: OUTSIDE THE SHOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Owner is locking up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves, facing the street, drinks in the fresh air. He is trying to forget his shock, put everything into focus.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks at the garish portrait again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves produces his purse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Owner, smelling money, turns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves hands him several coins.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So you'll bring him to me, tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.? Mr...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<OWNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bytes. Mr. Bytes. He'll be there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWNER>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll send a cab. Here is my card.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
Treves hands the Owner a card. The Owner, greasy and dirty, shakes Treves' hand and squeezes his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<OWNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now we got a deal... We understand each other... guv. We understand each other completely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWNER>
<DIRECTION>
The Owner gives Treves the evil look of a conspirator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves walks off, disoriented.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Owner reads the card and smiles at Treves walking away down the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: DISSOLVE TO OUTSIDE THE SHOP
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A CABMAN is knocking on the door of the shop, staring at the portrait. The door opens, revealing a figure in a floor-length black cloak. On his head is an extremely large hat, cut to the lines of a yachting cap. A grey-flannel curtain hangs from the bottom of the cap all the way around, hiding his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a horizontal slit in front for the eyes. On the figure's feet are large, bag-like slippers. The only part of the body seen at all is the left arm and hand, which protrudes from the cloak, holding a crude walking stick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure seems to loathe being in the open. We can just barely see in the darkness within the Owner standing to one side of the door, obviously enjoying the surprise on the Cabman's face. The Owner steps abruptly into his view.
</DIRECTION>
<OWNER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't just stand there. Help him up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OWNER>
<DIRECTION>
The Cabman, does so, while a small, curious crowd forms. The Owner gives the Cabman the card. The Cabman jumps up onto the seat and off they go.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: THE RECEIVING ROOM - LONDON HOSPITAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The receiving room is a bare hall, painted stone color. It has rows of benches and a long desk where entries are made, and certificates and other papers are issued. It is a cold, harsh place.
</DIRECTION>
<CABMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at all, sir. My... pleasure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CABMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He exits.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves turns and sees the Matron, staring.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be in my rooms, Mothershead. I'm not to be disturbed.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
She nods silently. Treves looks at the figure for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come with me, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to go out of the room. The hooded figure just stands there, motionless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the whole room, the people now silent. They all stare at the figure.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
No one makes a move.
</DIRECTION>
<MATRON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You heard the doctor... Go on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MATRON>
<DIRECTION>
Treves turns to look at the hooded figure who stands there a moment, then slowly shuffles after him. Mrs. Mothershead and the people in the room watch him go. When he is out of sight, they all begin to talk excitedly.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mothershead stands fixed and watches too, ignoring the noisy room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TREVES' OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and Treves leads the hooded figure to a chair in front of his desk and helps him to sit down, furtively trying to look into the eye-slit of the mask. In the small room the smell of the Elephant Man is overwhelming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves goes to the window and opens it. He nervously tries to compose himself, then turns to the hooded figure.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My name is Frederick Treves... I am a surgeon here at the London Hospital, and I lecture in anatomy at the Medical College... I would very much like to examine you. Would that be all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
The figure in the chair is still. Treves is at a loss. His sense of discomfort is growing. He looks at the floor for a moment, then locks his eyes on the figure's left arm.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah... yes. Um, first I would like to ask you a few questions, would that be all right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
The figure does nothing. Treves sits down at his desk and picks up a pencil.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good. Now, let's see. Your Owner... um, the man who... who looks after you tells me that you are English and your name is John Merrick. Is that correct?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
The figure does nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know where you were born? Where you come from?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
The figure does nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I tell you what, I'll ask you a question, and you shake your head like this for "no" and nod like this for "yes", alright? Do you understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
The figure following Treves' movements nods very slowly, "yes". Treves sighs with relief.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you in any pain?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
The figure begins to babble incoherently. Treves, alarmed, interrupts.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Um, no. Just nod your head like this for "yes" and shake it like this for "no". Now, are you in any pain?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
Again the figure, following Treves movements, shakes his head "no".
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are your parents still alive?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
The figure does nothing. Treves is quite nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you understand? Are they dead? Your father... your mother?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
The figure begins to moan. There are two sharp raps at the door. The hooded figure flinches.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and Fox pokes his head into the room.
</DIRECTION>
<FOX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Freddie, what you doing for... I say do open a window in here or...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOX>
<DIRECTION>
He notices the hooded figure.
</DIRECTION>
<FOX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry, I had no idea that... I say!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOX>
<DIRECTION>
Treves quickly rises and pushes Fox out into the hallway, following him and closing the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: IN THE HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves and Fox are standing outside the door to Treves' office.
</DIRECTION>
<FOX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good Lord, Freddie! What have you got in there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOX>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll know presently. At the meeting of the society. But until then, I beg of you Fox, keep it to yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<FOX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Certainly, if you insist. You must have quite a find there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOX>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what I've got.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<FOX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing of any importance, eh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOX>
<DIRECTION>
Treves turns to go back in, then stops.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you this much, Fox, it's beyond anything you or I have ever dealt with. Keep it to yourself, please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
He goes back in, shutting the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TREVES' OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves turns the key in the door. He turns to the chair the figure had been occupying, but he is not there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The figure is hiding in the corner, crouched behind a black frock operating coat, so stiff with dried blood and pus it stands up by itself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves looks quickly around the room and finally sees him. He looks at the figure for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come sit down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
The frightened figure just crouches there looking at him. Treves goes to him, pulls him up and over to the chair.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit... down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
The figure sits. Treves pauses uncertainly.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'll examine you now. I'll save the questions for later... Will you take off your hat now, please?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
The figure does nothing. Treves moves to him.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be frightened, I simply want to look at you. Do you understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
The figure leans back fearfully. From behind him we see just the top of his wide hooded head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves, standing before him, lifts the hood up and back.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
(more to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's right, don't be frightened. Don't be frightened.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: SMALL ROOM - LONDON HOSPITAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see two cameras set up, their OPERATORS next to them staring at something we cannot see. Treves stands beside them concentrating on the same sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All three are speechless.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves suddenly remembers himself.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you ready?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
The Cameramen mumble, "Yes", and gratefully disappear beneath the black cloths of their cameras.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go ahead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
They trigger the flash powder. In the blinding flashes we briefly see the silhouette of a tremendously bulky figure, starting at the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: DISSOLVE TO LECTURE HALL - PATHOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF LONDON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: BRIGHT LIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we pull back and down in a slow spiral we see the light is coming through high windows. We now see several rows of distinguished doctors talking to each other in anticipation. As we continue to spiral down we see Treves before them at a podium. Behind him are two ASSISTANTS standing beside a curtained stall. Treves raps a pointer stick on the podium to bring the meeting to order. We move behind the stall as the Assistants part the curtains and we see the silhouette of the Elephant Man. The doctors talk among themselves quietly.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is English, he is twenty-one years of age and his name is John Merrick. Gentlemen, in the course of my profession I have come upon lamentable deformities of the face due to injury or disease, as well as mutilations and contortions of the body, depending upon like causes; but, at no time have I met with such a dreaded or perverted version of a human being as this man. I wish to draw your attention to the insidious conditions affecting this patient. Note, if you will, the extreme enlargement of the skull... and upper limb, which is totally useless. The alarming curvature of the spine... Turn him, please... the looseness of the skin, and the varying fibrous tumors that cover 90% of the body.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
Treves' voice fades as we DISSOLVE TO the Doctors, who at first were rigid and flustered, and now bent forward, concentrating, obviously consumed with interest.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Spiraling down again we see Treves finishing his lecture.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...And there is every indication that these afflictions have been in existence, and have progressed rapidly, since birth. The Patient also suffers from chronic bronchitis. As an interesting side-note, in spite of the afore-mentioned anomalies, the patient's genitals remain entirely intact and unaffected.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
Treves nods to the Assistants and they go to the Elephant Man. We see them in shadow untying the loose knot of the loin cloth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UP of the shadow of the head of the Elephant Man. It goes up for a breath.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So then, gentlemen, owing to this series of deformities: The congenital exostoses of the skull; extensive papillomatous growths and large pendulous masses in connection with the skin; the great enlargement of the right upper limb, involving all the bones; the massive distortion of the head and the extensive areas covered by papillomatous growth, the patient has been called, "The Elephant Man."
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: TREVES OFFICE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Elephant Man (hereafter the E.M.) wearing his cloak, is seated by the desk. Treves stands behind him, measuring his head with calipers. He removes the calipers and notes the span, then sets them on the desk. He places the hood over the E.M.'s head. Treves sits at his desk and makes some final notes. He becomes more absorbed in his notes than in the E.M. The E.M. makes an unintelligible sound.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
The E.M. is silent. Treves, only now realizing that the E.M. has said something, looks up at him.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmm?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
The E.M. is silent. Treves passes it off as a sigh and turns back to his work.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been a long day for everyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
He closes his notebook and rises. He remembers something.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yes, you'll need a cab...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the E.M.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
He exits. The E.M. is alone. He rises and shuffles slowly about, investigating the room. He goes to the desk and begins touching things, including the calipers. He notices the card Treves gave to the Owner tucked in the back pages. He pauses for a moment and then takes the card. His hand disappears into the cloak, and he moves back into the corner behind the stiff, black operating coat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves re-enters.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
The E.M. takes up his stick and follows Treves out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - THE LONDON HOSPITAL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Treves and Fox alone at a window. They are looking down on the hospital square Treves had previously crossed and see the E.M., lit by gaslight and moving to a waiting cab.
</DIRECTION>
<FOX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never mentioned his mental state.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FOX>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's imbecile, no doubt from birth. He speaks, but... it's all gibberish. No, the man's a homeless idiot...

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pray God he's an idiot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
The E.M., as he is getting into the cab, stops, turns and looks to the upper stories of the hospital. Treves and Fox are joined by three laughing colleagues who clap Treves on the back.
</DIRECTION>
<THE_FIRST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quite a coup, Freddie. You'll look splendid in the journal.

From outside the window we see Treves surrounded by his laughing friends.

<DIRECTION>
ENTRY HALL - TREVES' HOME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a door. It opens and Treves walks in. He shuts the door, locks it, goes to a coat rack on the wall and hangs up his overcoat and hat. He notices his reflection in a mirror and examines himself wearily. Anne's smiling reflection appears beside his.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did it go well, darling?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, very well, I think. Are the girls in bed?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<TREVES>

We move past Anne's reflection to a CU of Treves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: WHITECHAPEL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We now see a bunsen burner roar of flame reflected in Bytes' eyes. Pulling back we see Bytes, quite drunk, sitting, cooking sausages over the hot brick.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes another drink from his gin bottle. Up comes a wet belch and he takes another drink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The E.M. is crouched against the wall with a bowl of potatoes and a cup of water in front of him. With his good hand, he is picking tiny pieces of potato and feeding himself. The eating is fairly loud and animal-like. The drinking is even worse.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Boy is across the room asleep, wrapped in ragged little blankets.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The E.M. takes a drink of water, making a loud smacking, slurping sound.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bytes looks up from his cooking with a smoldering look, just waiting for him to make the sound again. He does and Bytes takes his crop and violently jabs him.
</DIRECTION>
<BYTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Belt up, you misbegotten garbage.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(mumbling to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can I eat with that?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Bytes takes a mouthful of gin and mockingly slurps it mimicking the E.M.'s sound.
</DIRECTION>
<BYTES>
<DIRECTION>
(yelling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How can I eat with THAT?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYTES>
<DIRECTION>
The E.M. picks and eats some more and then drinks again very tentatively.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Because of his fear the water catches in his throat and he spits and coughs out onto the floor, gasping and wheezing for breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bytes is up and whacks him with his riding crop.
</DIRECTION>
<BYTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out of my sight!
	</DIALOGUE>

The E.M. struggles to get up, carrying his food.

<BYTES>
<DIRECTION>
(not satisfied with his speed)
</DIRECTION>

He jabs the E.M. again, spilling his potatoes and water onto the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<BYTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You clumsy sod!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYTES>
<DIRECTION>
He pushes the E.M. again, then slips on the potatoes and falls heavily to the floor, crying out in shock. Then rage hits him. The E.M. backs up.
</DIRECTION>
<BYTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	YOU!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYTES>
<DIRECTION>
The Boy wakes up in fear. Bytes moves quickly toward the E.M. raising his crop. The E.M. stumbles and falls backward onto the floor. His head goes back and he begins gasping for air. Bytes yanks him up and hits him in the face with his riding crop. The force of the blow knocks a glob of spit into the air from the E.M.'s mouth. The E.M. gasps and wheezes horribly as Bytes hits him again and again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From across the room.

We hear the sound of wheezing coming from the E.M. who is sitting propped up against the stage, wrapped in a blanket. His head bent forward toward his knees. Bytes is going to the door as it opens and the Boy leads Treves in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves immediately goes to the E.M.

Treves turns his attention to the E.M. He lifts his head higher and examines the E.M.'s eyes. The E.M., who had been oblivious up until this point, looks into Treves' eyes and recognizes him. With his good hand, he reaches up and touches Treves' arm almost as if appealing to him. Treves' eyes lock on his.

It is a long, high ceilinged room with large windows along one wall. Beds run the length of both sides of the room. It is a woman's ward and nurses are serving the patients breakfast.

There is one tiny barred window located high up on the far wall. There is also a bed, two hard chairs and a table. The E.M. is sitting on the bed in shadow and his disguise is now hanging from a peg on the wall beside him. He is still wheezing and appears to be very weak. Treves serves the mixture to the E.M., who sputters and gags on it, but manages to get it down. Treves goes to the table and puts the two bottles in his bag. He goes to the door and turns to the E.M.

Merrick's seated in a tin bathtub trying to hide his nakedness. Mrs. Mothershead pours the water in. She scrubs his back with obvious distaste, but does her job.

Mothershead clamps a hand on Merrick's left arm. At her touch, he is instantly subdued, at least physically. He sinks back into the tub and begins to weep.

Finally, he comes to a young beautiful woman, her eyes wide open, watching him with intense fear. On either side of her are two very ancient women, snoring deeply.

	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
Treves walks up the path into the hospital.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HALLWAY (MORNING)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves, carrying a bowl, crosses the upper hall and starts to the narrow stairway to the Isolation Ward. Over his shoulder we see him knock twice on the door. As the door swings open, the camera pushes past him and we see the room. The lamp is still burning, but Merrick is nowhere to be seen. Treves enters, looking about for him.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Merrick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
There's movement in the corner beside the bed. Merrick rises slightly from the shadow. The light from the lamp hits his frightened eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	....Good morning... John. I've brought your breakfast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
Treves is unsettled by the sight of Merrick cowering down on the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick begins to babble. Treves enters the room, placing the bowl on the table and going to Merrick.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing down there? Come up John, come up on the bed. The cold floor is bad for you. I won't hurt you, come on now...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
He helps Merrick up onto the bed and goes back to the table for the bowl.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must eat. We must keep your strength...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
He has turned back to the bed, but Merrick has slipped to the floor again, still trying to hide himself in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...What on earth is the matter with you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
He puts the bowl down again and goes back to Merrick, who seems very upset at leaving his hiding place.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now please, John, you must do as I say. Come up from there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to help Merrick up, but Merrick just presses himself farther back in the corner, still babbling. There are two raps at the door. Treves goes to it and lets Mothershead in.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHERSHEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHERSHEAD>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not quite yet, Mrs. Mothershead. There seems to be some difficulty this morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
They both look at the bed. Merrick has almost disappeared under it.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHERSHEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Won't come out, eh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHERSHEAD>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, he's very upset about something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<MOTHERSHEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHERSHEAD>
<DIRECTION>
She goes to Merrick and takes hold of his left wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHERSHEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, my son, none of this fuss. Come up from there, this instant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHERSHEAD>
<DIRECTION>
She starts to force him up from the floor. Merrick is moaning now, still trying to get away.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Don't pull at him like that. We don't want to frighten him more than he already is.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
By this time Mothershead has almost got him back on the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHERSHEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Honestly, sir, you must be very firm with this sort. Otherwise they'd lay about on the floor gibbering all day long. All he understands is a good smack.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHERSHEAD>
<DIRECTION>
They help Merrick settle back on the pillow. Merrick is still making desperate, unintelligible sounds.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's had his share of "smacks", Mothershead. I expect that's what drives him under the bed. We must use patience and understanding with this man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<MOTHERSHEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHERSHEAD>
<DIRECTION>
She exits. Treves shuts the door behind her and turns back to the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What good am I to you...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
He goes to the bed and sits down in front of Merrick, angered by his own seeming uselessness in the situation.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...What is my purpose? ...It's so important that I understand you. I want to help you, I want to be your doctor...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(directly to Merrick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	but I can't help you unless you help me, unless I know what you are feeling. I believe there's something back there, there's something you want to say, but I've got to understand you. Do you understand me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick hesitates, then starts babbling again.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! You are going to talk to me! We are going to show them! We're going to show them that you're not a wall. We are going to talk! Do you understand? Nod your head if you understand me!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly Merrick nods yes.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You do understand me! You understand. Now you're going to say it. I've got to hear how you say things. Now, very slowly, say "yes."
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
Treves carefully mouths the word.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"Yes."
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick is still hesitant, from years of fear, but his eyes betray a growing excitement. Slowly, he tries to talk, his voice a tremulous whisper.
</DIRECTION>
<MERRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yyyy... Yyye... yyyess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRICK>
<TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
(grabbing Merrick's arm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes John!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
Throughout their dialogue, Merrick is still very garbled, but he no longer babbles. He makes a great effort to speak slowly, to form words the way Treves forms them, to be understood.
</DIRECTION>
<MERRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Yyes
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRICK>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yyyess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<MERRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yyess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRICK>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's much better. I could understand that "yes".
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<MERRICK>
<DIRECTION>
(pleased)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRICK>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very good! Oh yes! Now listen. I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to repeat them... um... I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand? I'm going to say some things to you and I want you to say them back to me. Do you understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<MERRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRICK>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excellent! Now, say... "Hello"

:SC: DISSOLVE TO HALLWAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Mothershead comes out of the kitchen with a supper tray and walks down the hall, passing the open ward door. We see nurses serving patients their supper. Nora comes out of the ward with a tray which she holds tightly against her. A bowl of soup is spilling on her apron. She catches up with Mothershead. They speak as they walk.
</DIRECTION>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, Mrs. Mothershead, please forgive my behavior yesterday. I'm sorry if you're having to do extra work on my account. It was just seeing it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<MOTHERSHEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Patients here are not "its". They are either "he's" or "she's", but that's alright, Ireland. This one's going to be more work for all of us. Good God girl! Mind your broth.

</MOTHERSHEAD>
<DIRECTION>
Mothershead continues on. Nora guiltily watches her go.

Treves and Merrick are absorbed in their work. A knock comes at the door.

<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
Mothershead enters.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>

	Why, my dear Mrs. Mothershead, how good of you to join us. Mr. Merrick, will you please introduce yourself?

(hesitantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, my name is John Merrick.

<MOTHERSHEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHERSHEAD>
<TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
(exuberantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've made tremendous strides today, Mothershead. He listens and repeats with great attention, and this certainly isn't easy for him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<MOTHERSHEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHERSHEAD>
<TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
(lowering his voice)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure that if Mr. Merrick made a good impression on the hospital committee they'd see that he's the exception to their rule. Now I'm not expecting miracles. I'm not saying he'll be able to read or write, but I do think that I can get him to speak for himself. I'm going to arrange things with Carr Gomm right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Merrick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That was very good, John, very good. That's all for today. We shall do some more tomorrow. Mothershead?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Mothershead sets the tray down beside Merrick.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see you soon.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
He and Mothershead exit. Merrick watches the door close. He sighs quietly, looks about, and sees the Bible on the bedside table. He picks it up and, gently runs his fingers over the cover.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: RECEIVING ROOM - THE LONDON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is total pandemonium in the receiving room. The room is filled with screaming men, women and children. Two drunken women have been fighting with broken bottles and are now covered with blood and cuts. The women are still hysterical, one minute they're sobbing, then in an instant screaming and intent upon fighting again. The crowd keeps them apart. Two Bobbies stand in the background making no move to intercede.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
To the side we see Bytes watching everything. It is still too violent a scene for the Nurses to come to the women's aide and they stand up in the front of the room waiting. Bytes makes his way along the side of the crowd waiting for a chance to get behind the Nurses and on into the hospital. Now the women begin sobbing again and things quiet some. The Nurses come forward into the crowd. Bytes moves over closer to the hallways. When the Nurses have all gone into the crowd he seizes the chance and disappears into the hospital.
</DIRECTION>

Bytes appears and walks down hospital hallway looking about.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, Treves...
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARR>
<DIRECTION>
Treves sits in the armchair. Carr Gomm is sitting at his desk.
</DIRECTION>
<CARR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you contacted the British Home and the Royal Hospital?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARR>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, no sir. I had planned to see them in the morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<CARR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good! How is the patient?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARR>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's doing very well. In fact that's why I came to see you. I think that if I were to present Mr. Merrick to the hospital committee, then they would have a chance to see for themselves not only the extraordinary nature of the disease, but of the man as well. If the committee had a chance to speak with him, hear him say a few words for himself, I'm sure they would see him as a patient, rather than as a violation of the rules.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<CARR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A few words? I thought he was imbecile?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARR>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well sir, perhaps I should explain...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<CARR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really don't think that's necessary Treves. I'm quite sure the committee will be able to make an equitable decision on the merits of the case, such as they are.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARR>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't agree. No one can make a reasonable decision about this man's future without at least meeting him. No doctor would presume to diagnose a patient he had never met.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<CARR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Treves, it's out of the question. Now if it was up to me, I'd say "Certainly, let's meet the fellow, by all means," I'm sorry, I simply can't speak for the other members of the committee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARR>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then will you meet him, as a representative of the committee.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<CARR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Treves, it's out of the question. I want to hear as soon as possible what the other hospitals can do. I'm sorry.

We see Treves leave Carr Gomm's office and walk toward us to the stairwell.

As Treves begins down the stairs, he sees Bytes on the next landing coming up.

Bytes spots him and goes toward him.

<BYTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want my man back.

(shouting)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYTES>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what...

<BYTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal!

Now we see Carr Gomm standing above them, at the top of the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<CARR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By all means do so. In fact, I'll fetch them myself. I'm quite sure they'd be very interested in your story, as well as ours.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARR>
<DIRECTION>
Livid, Bytes looks from Carr Gomm to Treves, at a loss for words.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I think we really do understand one another.

He backs slowly down to the landing eyeing Treves and Carr Gomm. At the landing he casually turns and disappears down more stairs. Treves turns and gazes at Carr Gomm.

	Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves.

TREVES' HOUSE - BEDROOM (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Anne is at her dressing table, brushing out her hair. She is in a very flattering dressing gown, ready to turn in. We see her reflected in the mirror as well as Treves who is in his robe in the background seated at his side of their bed, deep in thought. Anne looks at Treves and smiles affectionately.

	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
Anne puts down the brush and rises.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
Anne, sympathizing with his concerns goes to him and puts her arms around him.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
(impatiently)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity?

(slightly hurt)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.

She releases Treves and lies down. Treves realizes that perhaps he has been unkind.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know.

	I've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, when Carr Gomm meets him. Somehow, between now and then I've got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man... Why am I fooling myself? Nothing short of John delivering the Sermon on the Mount is going to sway Carr Gomm...

Merrick is propped up in bed. Suddenly the door bursts open. The Night Porter, an arm around a drunken giggling tart, stands in the doorway. As soon as the Charwoman sees Merrick, she screams as does Merrick, and she wriggles free, making for the stairs. The Night Porter watches her go and then turns to Merrick laughing noisily. He then pulls the door shut with a bang.

Merrick, very frightened, crawls down into his hiding place.

If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we?

Treves and Carr Gomm are speaking together as they walk along.

<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear.

Treves cannot easily answer this question.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<CARR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARR>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<CARR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them.

Carr Gomm starts up the stairs. Treves remains behind, watching him for a moment, then follows.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick is standing beside his disguise on its hook. He nervously smooths the cloak down, repositions the Bible on the bedside table and smooths the cloak again. He looks at the door, expecting it to open. It doesn't. His hands smooths the cloak over and over again. Voices can be heard outside the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick freezes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There are two raps at the door. Merrick flinches, clutching the cloak. The raps are repeated. He pulls himself together and walks to the middle of the room. He takes a deep breath and closes his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<MERRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come in.

</MERRICK>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and Treves and Carr Gomm enter. Carr Gomm's eyes are rivited on Merrick, but he contains his shock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick is breathing unevenly, his eyes still closed. Treves goes to him and touches his shoulder. Merrick opens his eyes and looks up at Treves. Treves turns to Carr Gomm, as does Merrick. Carr Gomm lowers his eyes.

	I'm sorry too. He simply doesn't belong here. He's be much happier somewhere else, where he could be constantly looked after. Believe me, Frederick, it's better that it worked out this way. Good day.

Merrick is in bed, very tired. It's been an exhausting day. Suddenly the door opens and Mothershead comes into the room. Merrick looks up at her very apprehensively. She walks over to the bed, picks up the Bible from the table, opens it and hands it to Merrick.

Merrick is in his bed as always. He holds the portrait of the beautiful woman, gazing at it longingly. He hears a door close far away in the silence of the hospital.

Suddenly we hear the heavy footfalls of the Night Porter's boots. As they get louder and louder we move slowly closer to Merrick's face.

The sound is very close now, and Merrick's eyes are visibly agitated.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive the redundancy, gentlemen, but there is no other place for him. Both the Royal Hospital and the British Home have turned him down even if sufficient funds for his care were provided. The workhouse is certainly out of the question. The patient has an overwhelming fear of returning to the horrors of his past. His appearance is so disturbing that all shrink from him. He cannot, in justice to others, be put in the general ward of the workhouse. The police rightly prevent his being exhibited, and he is mobbed in the streets wherever he goes. What is to be done with him?

	Gentlemen, John Merrick is not an animal, he is a man, fully aware of his condition. An intelligent, sensitive, literate man, with an intimate knowledge of the Bible. His horrible infirmities do not reduce him to anything less than what he is, a man; and it would be criminal if we of the London Hospital, his final refuge, the last place on earth where this man can find peace, were to cast him out.

	Gentlemen, may I make a suggestion. There are two small rooms off Bedstead Square that are no longer in use and would be admirably suited to Mr. Merrick's needs. I also propose to write a letter to The Times, appealing to their readers for assistance. Knowing the generosity of the British public, I feel we would have little trouble in raising the funds for his maintenance. Indeed, this hospital's rules do preclude the admission of incurables, but if ever there was an exception to the rule, it is this patient. So therefore, I propose, if Mr. Treves is finished, that we put it to a vote. All those in favor of keeping Mr. Merrick here?

<DIRECTION>
(to Carr Gomm)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	and when you appeal for funds, I think you should appeal for a more appropriate place for him as well. I agree the British public is generous, and I'm sure that somewhere the creature will find a happy and permanent home, but not here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROADNECK>
<DIRECTION>
One of the committee members says "I quite agree". Carr Gomm scowls a bit.
</DIRECTION>
<CARR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see. All, then, that move we keep Mr. Merrick here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CARR>
<DIRECTION>
Carr Gomm raises his hand. None of the others do. Treves and Carr Gomm exchange hopeless glances. Carr Gomm looks at the man who had originally raised his hand. He looks away, ashamed.
</DIRECTION>
<CARR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All those opposed?

Broadneck and the rest raise their hands.

</CARR>
<BROADNECK>
<DIRECTION>
(triumphantly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well then. In the meantime, of course, he needn't be turned out. He may stay in the rooms off Bedstead Square until such time as more suitable arrangements can be made, thus freeing the Isolation Ward for more deserving patients. Well then, Mr. Chairman, if there is nothing further to discuss, I move that we adjourn this meeting and all go bout our normal business.

Carr Gomm cannot conceal his contempt.

<WOMAN>

	...terrible though his appearance is, so terrible indeed that women and nervous persons fly in terror from the sight of him, and that he is debarred from seeking to earn his livelihood in any ordinary way, yet he is superior in intelligence, can read and write, is quiet, gentle, not to say even refined in his mind.

:SC: DINING HALL - THE LONDON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The room is elegantly furnished and heavily carpeted. The walls are panelled in richly gleaming walnut with finely wrought brass lamps spaced regularly along their length. In the center of the room is a long oak table with a fine linen table cloth, around which sits a number of Doctors, among them, Fox.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Some of them are still eating. A waiter is clearing away a few plates and several Doctors are helping themselves to port wine kept in decanters in the center of the table and to cigars in humidors. One of them is reading The Times. At one end of the table sits Treves, picking at his food.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a small, very dusty, dirty room, filled with boxes and bedsteads and other things stored over the years. The one grimy window is locked shut.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door opens and two middle-aged CHARWOMEN enter. They look around at the room with distaste and drop their mops and buckets.
</DIRECTION>
<1ST_WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are cleaner rooms in the gasworks.

	Blimey, now we're cleanin' up for circus animals!

Merrick sitting on his bed, hunched over in concentration reading an Illustrated London News. He is staring at a picture of the Eddystone Lighthouse.

	<DIALOGUE>
	"A silent shaft of stone on a deserted promontory, the lonely Eddystone is a beacon of aid and comfort to mariners of all nations."

He looks at the picture silently. There is a knock at the door. Merrick says, "Come in". Treves enters, holding a book.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>

	Very well, thank you. I have something for you, John. I'm sure you'll enjoy it, it's very popular.

He holds the book out to him. It's an "Alice In Wonderland".

<DIRECTION>
(surprised)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you... so much... oh it's beautiful!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRICK>
<DIRECTION>
He lovingly feels the leather binding and looks at Treves with speechless gratitude.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick carefully opens the book to a colored frontpiece, the picture of Alice grown too large for a hallway, looking imploringly at the dwarfed White Rabbit. The caption reads "...curiouser and curiouser". He leafs through the pages looking at the other illustrations as Treves, delighted with the gift's effect, looks on.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I came to tell you that I'll be here early tomorrow morning. We're moving you to your permanent home. I'm sure you'll be very happy there, John. So get a good night's rest, there'll be new people to meet tomorrow. Good night.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Treves' words have disturbed Merrick. He sinks into the pillows, the book before him. We see the picture of the Mock Turtle perched upon his rock, great tears rolling down his cow-like face, as Alice and the Gryphon look on with intense sympathy. Merrick looks up at his disguise hanging on the wall.

Merrick, in his disguise, and Treves, one arm around him, are walking together. Merrick seems very uneasy.

The room is now spotless. It is furnished with a bed and the required pillows, a small table and chair by the window, now curtained. Adjoining this room is a smaller one which contains a bathtub.

Merrick enters and looks around, confused. Treves stands in the doorway.

Merrick turns to him.

Merrick inspects his new home. He seems pleased-by the bathtub, by the table, by the window to the outside world.

Merrick pulls the curtain aside and opens the window. He looks out and then up with a small intake of breath. Before him, beyond the hospital fence, the spire of St. Phillips Cathedral stands resplendently in the morning light.

<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Mothershead enters from the bathroom, speaking over her shoulder to Merrick.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHERSHEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I think I can safely hand the duties over to you girls now. Mr. Merrick will require a bath every day... that way he won't pong quite so much. Nora, you can instruct Kathleen on the finer points of Mr. Merrick's bath. You'll be on your own tomorrow.

ENTRY HALL AND SITTING ROOM - TREVES' HOME

The door opens. Merrick, disguised, enters, followed by Treves who closes it and hangs up Merrick's mask on the coat rack. The mirror has been removed, leaving a faint outline on the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick is enchanted by the house. Treves takes him by the arm and leads him into the sitting room. Anne appears at the top of the stairs.

	Come and meet our quest, my love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
Anne manages a smile, comes down the stairs and together they go into the sitting room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick is examining everything in the room. Nothing in this almost magical world escapes his attention. The furniture, the personal mementoes, particularly the pictures on the fireplace. He turns around when he hears them enter, lowering his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John Merrick, I'd like you to meet my wife, Anne Treves.

<MERRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm very...
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRICK>

Then, Merrick bursts into tears. Anne is at a loss as to what to do. Merrick takes his hand from hers and covers his eyes, weeping pitiously. Treves puts his hand on Merrick's shoulder.

	Yes, we do have a lot of room. But you should see the place on weekends, when I see patients here. Sometimes there are so many, we have to set them down wherever we can. In fact, Mrs. Treves sometimes says that the only room she can call her own is the bedroom.

	Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<MERRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She has the face of an angel... She was an angel. She was so kind... so kind to me. It's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. I'm sure I must have been a great disappointment to her.

	Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.

	<DIALOGUE>
	If only I could find her. If only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. You, Mrs. Treves, and you, Mr. Treves. Then maybe she would love me as I am. I've tried to hard to be good.

At this, Anne is so extremely touched that she begins to cry. She tries to hold it in, but to no avail. She reaches a hand out to Merrick and he takes it. He tries to comfort her.

Merrick goes to his table and puts the box down. He hangs up his disguise, then goes back to the window and pulls the curtains aside. Moonlight bathes the table, illuminating the portrait of his Mother. John seats himself and sets the box in front of him. He reaches for a pencil, and then begins to draw windows on the front of the box.

She turns and walks to the cabinet for linen and bath supplies. She opens it and takes out a clean towel and a blanket. She pauses, and turns to look back at the table.

Merrick is concentrated on his work. Nora, curious now, walks to the table.

	Oh, but how will you finish it? You haven't any more cardboard.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Merrick, at a loss, shrugs his shoulders. The movement makes Nora aware of his body, and he is the Elephant Man once again.

	Tell me about it, please!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRICK>
<KENDAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but I should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. You may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. Onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. The theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, Mr. Merrick. It is lights and music, gaiety and joy. It's... well, it's romance.

</KENDAL>
<MERRICK>

Merrick finds a place and begins to read.
</DIRECTION>
<MERRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Romeo and Juliet. I know of this... "If I profane with my unworthiest hand, This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand, To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss."
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick, embarrassed by these last words, starts to close the book.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Kendal knows Juliet's lines by heart. She looks at Merrick for a moment, then replies tenderly.
</DIRECTION>
<KENDAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmer's kiss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENDAL>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick pauses, looking at Kendal, then continues.
</DIRECTION>
<MERRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
	</DIALOGUE>

<KENDAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENDAL>
<MERRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRICK>

They both look at each other for a long, silent moment. Treves is touched and amazed.

People are happily drinking and singing and laughing. Bytes and the boy are keeping a watchful eye on the Night Porter, who is making a deal with a couple of men at a table. They hand over a few coins and follow the Night Porter out of the pub. Bytes finishes his beer and thumps the glass down on the bar. He wipes his mouth with his sleeve and he and the boy casually follow the other three men out.

Bytes and the boy stand by the pub door, watching the men cross the street and go to the back gate of the hospital which the Night Porter unlocks, and leaves unlocked, but closed, behind them. They walk into Bedstead Square, laughing quietly.

Bytes crosses the street and goes to the gate. He walks along the iron fence and watches the Night Porter and his "customers". He stops and waits to see where they go.

The Night Porter stands the two men before a window and motions for them to wait. He goes through a door into the hospital. After a few moments the window opens wide, and there, neatly framed and silhouetted, stand Merrick and the Night Porter, gripping Merrick's neck. The two men outside start back in shock, but stand mesmerized by what they see. We hear the laughter of the Night Porter echo across the empty square.

	"Mrs. Kendal, always at the forefront of fashion and form, was seen leaving The London the other afternoon. No, dear readers, the most facile actress of our day has not been taken ill, but rather said she was 'visiting a friend'. And who was the lucky recipient of this attention? Quick enquiries proved it to be none other than Mr. John Merrick, The Elephant Man, with whom our readers are undoubtedly familiar. After a chat of three-quarters of an hour, Mrs. Kendal was kind enough to leave Mr. Merrick with an autographed portrait of herself. Owing to a disfigurement of the most extreme nature, Mr. Merrick has never been properly presented to London society. But knowing that wherever Mrs. Kendal goes, others inevitably follow, the questions arises: Will London society present itself to him?"

Above Merrick's bookshelf we see a row of framed pictures of prettily smiling society women. Mrs. Kendal has started a fad. We pan slowly by them and down to Merrick's table where his Mother and Mrs. Kendal have their place of honor. The cathedral is also there. Beside it is a modest tea service.

<DIRECTION>
Merrick rises. Treves ponders over what Merrick has just said. He looks at Merrick and something very odd happens. Merrick is looking levelly at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For the first and only time, we see expression on his face. It is a calm, knowing look, almost a benign smile. At that very moment there is a bright flash of light behind Merrick's head, seemingly from the window. Treves blinks, unable to comprehend what has just happened. When he looks again, the moment has passed. Merrick, his back to Treves, moves to the bookcase to replace the volume.

	John...?

Nora enters with a brown paper parcel tied with string. Merrick says nothing.

<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you looking for me, Sister?

<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No sir, Mr. Merrick.

<DIRECTION>
(to Merrick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I have something for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<DIRECTION>
She puts the parcel on the table and opens it. We see several squares of new cardboard, a cutting knife, a pastepot, and a few brushes and some paint.
</DIRECTION>
<NORA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought these things would be helpful with your cathedral.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORA>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick examines the materials with reverence, and thanks her profusely.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Treves is moved and a little disconcerted. Merrick lays the things aside carefully and begins to pull the crude spires from the discarded box. Nora smiles at the busy Merrick and exits.
</DIRECTION>

	The cathedral is coming along nicely.

	Yes, soon I will start the main spire, but I must finish these columns first, How kind of her!

Treves notices to his dismay that the growths on Merrick's head are larger.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He finds it very difficult to disguise his concern.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How blind of me. Is there anything else, John, anything at all that I could get for you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<MERRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh no! There is nothing! I have everything, you have given me everything I could possibly want. I am happy every hour of the day. I only wish there was something I could give to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRICK>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please John, it would give me so much pleasure to give you something. Something just for yourself. Isn't there something you would like to have?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick is silent. He goes over to his cloak, reaches into it and pulls out a folded up advertisement. He hands it to Treves, who examines it closely. It is an advertisement for an-elegant gentleman's dressing bag, boasting ivory brushes, silver fittings and Moroccan silk lining.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want a dressing bag, John?

	Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ANNE>
<TREVES>

It is very dark. There is a dim red glow coming from the holes in a furnace door. We hear a door open and footsteps coming downstairs. A man comes into the basement carrying something large and black. He approaches the furnace and opens the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The man is Treves. He is holding the stiff black surgeon's coat of which he was once so proud. He looks at it for a moment, and then stuffs it into the furnace. Inside, the coat starts to smoke heavily, then bursts into flames.

Treves watches it burn, and then closes the door.

	Ahh! Broadneck! You'll no doubt be pleased to know that we've received a smashing response to my letter. It's all very heartwarming, though several letters do mention how beastly it would be to part the poor fellow from Mr. Treves and the staff, but since the committee insists...

Carr Gomm and Mothershead look up to see a porter with the buff envelope enter. Carr Gomm takes the letter and the porter exits. Carr Gomm opens the letter and reads, his expression changing from concern to delight.

Broadneck and the other committee members are seated at their table, anxious to get the meeting underway. They talk among themselves.

The door opens and Carr Gomm and Treves enter. Treves seems quite nervous, but Carr Gomm is relaxed and smiling.

Broadneck explodes to his feet. Carr Gomm smiles at Treves, who looks quite grim.

	Mr. Broadneck?

</CARR>
<BROADNECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Chairman! I was under the distinct impression that we had concluded discussion of this disagreeable matter. Had we not ascertained that an Elephant Man is not acceptable as a patient? Have we not, very generously, allowed the creature to use two of our rooms until such time as he could be properly disposed of? Have we not...

<DIRECTION>
Merrick is working on his cathedral, painting details with a very fine brush.

As he lifts the brush from the paint jar, a drop falls on the table. Merrick carefully lays down the brush and wipes up the spilled paint with a cloth.

:SC: CUT TO COMMITTEE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<BROADNECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Which brings to mind my next point. The rules, gentlemen, the rules. In a society such as ours, it is of paramount importance that we not stray from the established order. Has that order not already been fearfully strained by allowing this... this... sideshow exhibit to take up residence, however temporary, in two very useful rooms, the purpose of which would be far better served in accommodating treatable patients, patients to whom this hospital was originally dedicated? I believe we have a duty...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROADNECK>

Carr Gomm still smiles. Treves is about to spring to Merrick's defense, but Carr Gomm catches his eyes and motions for him to remain silent. Treves is perplexed. Carr Gomm checks his pocket watch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO MERRICK'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick as before, busily working away. We see a ladybug crawling slowly across the roof of the cathedral. Merrick notices it and watches for a moment, then reaches up and lays a finger alongside the bug. The bug crawls onto his finger and Merrick holds it closer to him.

:SC: CUT TO COMMITTEE ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Broadneck is still talking.
</DIRECTION>
<BROADNECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...In light of these facts, our course is clear. The question is not whether to accept this creature as a patient, the question is when will those rooms be vacated for use by better qualified, more deserving cases? I move that this Elephant Man be removed from the premises immediately. We have a sacred duty to cure the sick, not care for circus animals. That is my last word on the subject. Mr. Chairman, shall we vote?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BROADNECK>
<DIRECTION>
Broadneck turns to Carr Gomm. Carr Gomm checks his watch and clears his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<CARR_GOMM>

	I take it, Mr. Broadneck, that your mind is fixed on this matter?

We see two nurses, their backs to us, walking down the hall. They start to go in a doorway when they stop suddenly, very startled, and curtsey deeply.

Carr Gomm checks his watch. The door to the room begins to open. He smiles.

	Indeed I am sir, as is the Queen. I have a brief communication from her Highness which she has requested I read to you: To the Governing Committee, London Hospital. I would very much like to commend you for the charitable face you have shown Mr. John Merrick, the Elephant Man. It is laudable that you have provided one of England's most unfortunate sons with a safe and tranquil harbour, a home. For this immeasurable kindness, as well as the many other acts of mercy on behalf of the poor, of which Mr. Carr Gomm has kept me informed, I gratefully thank you. Signed Victoria, Empress of India, Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.

Broadneck seems very unnerved.
</DIRECTION>
<CARR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well then, I move that Mr. John Merrick be admitted to the London Hospital on a permanent basis, on condition that the Hospital shall receive a yearly payment equal to the cost of occupying one bed, and that the funds for his care shall be clearly separate from hospital funds. All those in favor.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Carr Gomm raises his hand. The other members, puzzled, look at Broadneck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Quite red in the face, Broadneck looks at Carr Gomm, then to Treves, then to the Princess. He seems to almost deflate, then slowly raises his hand. The other members, now thoroughly confused, raise their hands as well. Carr Gomm bangs his gavel, smiling broadly. Treves is almost beside himself with happiness, and the Princess is obviously very pleased.
</DIRECTION>
<CARR>

	The motion is carried.

Treves hands Merrick the package. Merrick carefully pulls off the wrapping paper. Treves smiles. It's the dressing bag. Merrick is overjoyed with the gift. He lovingly handles the articles, taking them in and out of their compartments opening and closing the bag.

There's a good crowd in tonight; lots of drinking and shouting and glasses breaking. Several of the neighborhood "working girls" are having a bit of a rest, looking for a laugh. The Night Porter is rounding up customers, his pockets ringing with coins. People have their hands raised urging the Night Porter to take them along to see The Elephant Man.

MERRICK'S ROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
(Merrick as before) he reaches over to the picture of Mrs. Kendal and picks it up. We see his face reflected in the glass. Merrick sets the picture down on the table. He takes up one of the silver brushes and, using the picture as a mirror, neatly brushes his hair over his monstrous skull. He lays the brush down in its specific spot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick takes his ring and puts it on his left hand. He opens the cigarette case and stuffs one into his right hand. He takes up his walking stick, breathes deeply, then walks around the room in a slow circle. Merrick is transforming himself. Merrick comes back to the table and examines his reflection in the picture. With the ring, the stick, the cigarette and his neatly brushed hair, Merrick is the very image of a dashing young man about town. He inclines his head to the picture.

</NIGHT_PORTER>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick is frozen, caught. Seeing Merrick in his outfit, the Night Porter's jaw drops. They both stare at each other. The Night Porter begins to laugh hysterically. Merrick frantically begins to put away his dressing bag articles. When Merrick starts taking off his ring, the Night Porter comes over to him and grabs him by the cloak.
</DIRECTION>
<NIGHT_PORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no! You look lovely. Don't change a thing, darling. You look like the bleedin' Prince of Wales.

The Night Porter drags him by the neck to the window. He throws the window open out in the square is the waiting audience.
</DIRECTION>
<NIGHT_PORTER>

He starts kissing each whore. The crowd is mesmerized. Bytes moves in behind the Man with the Whores.

<BYTES>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps the ladies would like a closer look?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYTES>
<DIRECTION>
The Man begins to laugh. The Whores laugh drunkenly and halfheartedly resist being taken in to see The Elephant Man. As they are pushed through the door,
</DIRECTION>
<WHORES>

The Whores reluctantly enter the room. The Night Porter laughs at their discomfort. The Man notices all of Merrick's pictures of women.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>

	'Cor, he's a real ladies' man, come on... give the ladies' man a kiss.

	</DIALOGUE>
</WHORE>
<DIRECTION>
The Night Porter has turned Merrick and is holding him for the approaching kiss. The crowd is egging them on. The man forces the Woman closer and closer and raises her arms to force her into an embrace. As Merrick and the Woman touch, being pressed together, the Woman begins to scream. The Night Porter, the Man and the crowd all laugh with glee. Merrick and the whore now have their faces pressed together. The Whore is screaming and Merrick is crying out and screaming too.
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here that's enough romance. Now into bed.

	</DIALOGUE>
</NIGHT_PORTER>

He pushes the screaming Whore down onto Merrick. Her screaming face goes right into his. Merrick tries to move away and as he does his head goes too far back and his cried turn to horrible wheezing.
</DIRECTION>
<NIGHT_PORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mind his head... You'll kill him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIGHT_PORTER>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd outside is trying to see in the window. Five or six more have gone into Merrick's room to see. All are laughing and screaming and trying to get a close look at The Elephant Man.
</DIRECTION>
<NIGHT_PORTER>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bring him out then, so's we all can see him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYTES>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick recognizes his voice and looks frantically around for his former owner. The Night Porter pulls Merrick up by the window again. He then begins pushing the crowd out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<NIGHT_PORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everyone outside!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIGHT_PORTER>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly one of the crowd outside reaches up and grabs Merrick's good hand and pulls him half out the window. Others follow suit and haul him all the way through. The cathedral falls to the floor, breaking into several pieces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Because of the horror of touching him, the crowd outside lets Merrick fall to the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Night Porter whirls around and sees that Merrick is gone. He pushes the rest of the people outside and quickly goes to Merrick, lifting him to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unseen by anyone, Bytes slips into Merrick's room. Merrick is now standing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd moves in. The Night Porter is enjoying the festivities, but looks around nervously for trouble.
</DIRECTION>
<ONE_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give 'im a drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ONE_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
The Man grabs Merrick and pours some gin into his mouth, then pushes him away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's caught by another man, fed liquor and pushed away. He's pushed now from person to person faster and faster. Finally Merrick falls to the ground, dizzy and a bottle of gin on Merrick's head. He coughs and moans through the wheezing. The crowd is now strangely silent circling The Elephant Man like a pack of dogs closing in on a terrified rabbit. Suddenly Merrick starts to wail. The crowd joins in and they hoist him above their heads, screaming with laughter, around and around, joining him all the while.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we see a window reflecting the scene of terror. A curtain is pulled aside and we see through the reflection the face of the Young Porter, watching everything.
</DIRECTION>

</NIGHT_PORTER>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd moves through the iron gate of Bedstead Square. In the background we see Bytes' boy sitting on top of a wagon. The Night Porter takes Merrick into his room and puts him on the bed. He drunkenly stumbles about trying to out the room in order. He places the smashed hulk of the cathedral back up on its table, inadvertently leaving the spire and a few columns on the floor. He picks the cloak up and replaces it on the peg.
</DIRECTION>
<NIGHT_PORTER>
<DIRECTION>
(to Merrick)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did real well tonight.

He takes a purse full of coins out of his pocket. He removes one small coin and flips it on the floor in front of Merrick.
</DIRECTION>
<NIGHT_PORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here... buy yourself a sweet.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIGHT_PORTER>
<DIRECTION>
The Night Porter turns and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick, alone now, hears the Night Porter's echoing footsteps and the distant sound of the gate being closed. There is a long silence as Merrick collects himself. He then leans back into his pillows with a deep sigh. His eyes close.
</DIRECTION>

Bytes lifts Merrick up off the bed. He reaches out for Merrick's cloak. We slowly PAN over all the smiling women's faces as we hear the following:

</BYTES>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick's good hand comes into the frame trying to reach his mother's picture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs at the table cloth and pulls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now we see Bytes gripping Merrick's arm and pulling. We see the picture fall to the ground with a THUD.

MERRICK'S ROOM (MORNING)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Morning sunlight on the floor of Merrick's room. We move slowly around, discovering the church spire, the columns, the penny and Merrick's mother's picture.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Over this, the sound of knocking on the door. Through the door, we hear Treves calling, "John?... John?" More knocking. The door opens.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<DIRECTION>
Treves surveys the empty room. Quickly he goes into the side bathroom. He comes out with a very worried face. He goes to the cathedral model and is horrified by its condition. He finds the spire and then Merrick's Mother's picture. He quickly leaves the room and walks down the hall. The Young Porter, waiting in the hall, approaches Treves and stops him.
</DIRECTION>
<YOUNG_PORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Treves?
	</DIALOGUE>
</YOUNG_PORTER>
<DIRECTION>
Now we see Mrs. Mothershead entering Merrick's room surveying the same scene.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her face hardens as she sees the picture of Merrick's Mother.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHERSHEAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good God... John?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOTHERSHEAD>
<DIRECTION>
Now we see Treves filled with anger. He's got the information from the Young Porter and bolts down the hall at full speed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mothershead, still in Merrick's room, now become activated with determination to get to the bottom of all this herself. She leaves the room. In the distance is Treves marching off. Closer to her is the Young Porter, looking worried. She calls him to her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UP of Treves angrily walking.

:SC: OPERATING THEATRE

<DIRECTION>
The Night Porter is adding fresh coal to the operating room stove. The old coals were still quite hot and now smoke begins to rise. The Night Porter takes up the bellows and begins to pump the coals into a blaze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door bangs open and Treves is there, standing stock still, in a cold murderous rage.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	WHERE IS HE?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>

The Night Porter, frightened by Treves' intensity, begins to sputter.

Treves stalks over to him.

	Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>

Treves takes the Night Porter by the arm and begins to drag him out. The Night Porter throws his hand off violently, whirls around, his back to the door, and seizes the poker from the stove.
</DIRECTION>
<NIGHT_PORTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have a care, Mr. Treves. I ain't afraid of you! You and your bleedin' Elephant Man! I'm glad what I did! And you can't do nothing! Only Mothershead can sack me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NIGHT_PORTER>
<DIRECTION>
Treves, blind with fury, tears the poker from the Night Porter's hand, and is on the verge of using it. Unbeknownst to them, Mothershead has storm into the room, just in time to hear the last of the Night Porter's speech. Without a break, she strides over to him and with a lightning movement, boxes him soundly on the ears. The blow is staggering and makes quite a formidable sound. The Night Porter falls to the floor, barely conscious.

Treves is standing in the street looking at the now bare shop front. He walks to the window and tries to clean a small circle in the glass. He peers in.

From inside, through the smeared dirty window, we see Treves' distorted face.

	I'd like to think I felt no less for John than you, Treves, but face the facts, the man has disappeared, very likely to the continent.

FADE TO BLACK:

<DIRECTION>
:SC: INSIDE A WAGON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A moving circle of light in blackness.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As we move closer to the light, it becomes distinguishable as a peephole in the side of a wagon. Through the peephole we see a dark overcast sky. It is dusk. We move even closer to the hole. Just beside it we see the head of a horse with blinders on moving alongside. We move closer still to see its rider, a policeman. He notices the peephole and leans forward in the saddle, looking in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From outside, we see the peephole and an eye gazing out. The eye is replaced by a plug.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The policeman starts back and pulls up on the reins. As he falls behind we see the portrait of the E.M., from the front of the shop in London, on the back of the wagon. The policeman looks at the poster. The wagon moves on out of frame and the policeman slows his horse to a stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wagon is being driven by Bytes. The boy sits beside him. Another policeman rides abreast of him. They ride a few yards more and then the policeman stops by a sign at the fork of the road, reading "AALST 30 km". "Brussells 80 km." The policeman gestures for Bytes to move on. The wagon continues down the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bytes and the boy are riding along the road. Bytes turns in his seat and opens a hatch in the roof. He looks down in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the wagon, lit by the last dregs of the sunset, is Merrick, huddled in his sleeping posture. He feels the light and looks up weakly, wheezing, obviously very sick. A small bowl of potatoes sets untouched beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<BYTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Still haven't eaten, eh?

He snaps the hatch shut and turns forward muttering to himself.

<BYTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm beginning to feel your weight.

<DIRECTION>
FIELD & ROAD (MORNING)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a field with a road in the distance, leading to it. It is misty, the sun barely peeking through the rolling clouds above. On the road, the wagon is plodding toward us. At the bottom of the frame a FEMALE PINHEAD in a dress comes into view. She is watching the wagon. A DWARF comes into view beside her. She points to the wagon and she and the Dwarf excitedly confer. They turn back to watch its progress and the Dwarf reaches up and takes the Pinhead's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move back slowly to reveal a ring of circus wagons in the field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER DWARF comes up to the two other Freaks and watches the wagon. We pull back further to see a small circus. There are little stalls, and cages containing two mangey lions, some screeching spider monkeys and some squawking parrots. The circus is abustle in the drab grey field.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UP of the Pinhead jumping up and down in her excitement. There is a clap of thunder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DISSOLVE TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A rainstorm over the freak show. We pass along the row of freak wagons.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
These freaks truly deserve the name. They are quite different from the rather domestic ones we saw in the circus in England. These are not fakes. A rope cordons us off from them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The audience, which we see all around us, is enjoying the freaks, but there is a sense of vulgarity in their gaiety. They seem hard, and cold and jaded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We move by pinheads, a Hermaphrodite and a Legless Wonder. Some Siamese Twins are playing cat's cradle. Past them runs a Dwarf with a plumed hat playing a small flute. Trailing behind him on a string is a small wooden ark on wheels.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A lionfaced man is combing the hair that covers his face. A Rubber Man pulls the skin of his neck up over his face. There is a fairly big crowd standing around a Tall Man, affectionately rubbing the Small Parasitic Twin, growing out of his chest. The Barker-Owners compete with each other and the occasional thunder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally we hear the patter of Bytes, telling of the horrible fate of John Merrick's Mother on that African Isle so many years ago. A very big crowd is listening to him. They are looking at the poster at the back of the wagon, waiting impatiently to see the Elephant Man.
</DIRECTION>
<BYTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...The result is plain to see. Ladies and Gentlemen... THE TERRIBLE ELEPHANT MAN!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYTES>
<DIRECTION>
He raps twice with Merrick's silver-tipped walking stick and pulls the poster up. Merrick is standing unsteadily in the wagon. He is quite sick. The audience gasps and shudders. A few shrieks are heard. The Elephant Man is always the Elephant Man.
</DIRECTION>
<BYTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn around!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYTES>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick slowly turns around, the audience gasping at the sight of the horrible tumors. Bytes raps the walking stick twice.
</DIRECTION>
<BYTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dance!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYTES>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick begins a series of awkward movements, his pained version of a dance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Without his walking stick it is very difficult for him, but he strives to do it. Some of the crowd laughs at this, others shudder at the strange sight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly Merrick falters and comes to a stop, breathing irregularly. Seeing this, Bytes goes to him and bringing the stick behind Merrick, out of view of the audience, jabs him savagely in the back.
</DIRECTION>
<BYTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dance!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYTES>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick groans with pain and some of the people in the first row flinch back.

Merrick begins to dance again as people throw coins onto the stage, which the boy gathers and puts into a cap.

Beside him on the floor is a bowl of what looks to be slop and potatoes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bytes is standing at the back of the wagon looking down at Merrick. He picks up the bowl and jabs it at Merrick.
</DIRECTION>
<BYTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eat, my treasure.

Merrick looks wearily at the bowl but makes no move to accept it.

Merrick closes his eyes. This really enrages Bytes.

<BYTES>

	Eat, damn you. EAT! EAT!
	</DIALOGUE>

He jabs the bowl at Merrick, almost as if he'd shove it down his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<BYTES>
	<DIALOGUE>

At this last word he throws the contents of the bowl splattering in Merrick's face. He stands for a moment looking down at Merrick who has lapsed into a coughing fit.

There is a small crowd gathered in a circle on the grass. Merrick stands amidst them on a small wooden stool, Bytes jabbing him from behind again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick is making a strange moaning cry, slightly reminiscent of the trumpet of an elephant. The boy is passing amongst the people with a cap, collecting coins. Merrick lifts his face to the sky, the sound of his own misery mingling with his elephant call.

	The result is plain to see. Ladies and gentlemen... THE TERRIBLE ELEPHANT MAN.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYTES>
<DIRECTION>
He raps twice with the walking stick and pulls the poster up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick is now extremely sick. He almost looks as if he is unable to stand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The audience, as always, is quite alarmed. Bytes smiles and comes forward.
</DIRECTION>
<BYTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn around!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYTES>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick looks incapable of even this simple movement, but he slowly manages to turn. The crowd reacts to the horrible condition of Merrick's back and head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bytes satisfied that the Elephant Man is having the proper effect, raps the walking stick again.
</DIRECTION>
<BYTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dance!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYTES>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick's eyes look painfully up to the heavens and he begins to shuffle clumsily about the platform. Without his stick this is very difficult for him, causing him great pain. It is a humiliating spectacle and the crowd unimpressed by the halting movements of the monster begins to heckle him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bytes seeing that the dancing isn't being received well moves to place a stool next to Merrick.
</DIRECTION>
<BYTES>
<DIRECTION>
(rapping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Up! Up!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYTES>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick, already exhausted by his little dance, wheezes and coughs, attempting to ascend the stool. It is useless, he is just too tired. Again the audience shouts its disapproval, booing and hissing the Elephant Man. Bytes curses and raps again, demanding obedience from Merrick who again bravely tries to mount the stool. He cannot do it!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bytes, striving to save the moment and please the angry crowd, goes to Merrick and roughly helps him up. Merrick teeters precariously on the stool. Bytes raps the stick.
</DIRECTION>
<BYTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give the call of the elephant!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYTES>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick hesitates and Bytes bangs the stick on the wagon. The audience quiets down to hear the elephant call. Merrick senses this lull, but he is very frightened and sick. He lifts his head wearily and makes a few wavering cries that sound very little like an elephant.
</DIRECTION>
<BYTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Louder!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYTES>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick tries again but there is no improvement. The crowd begins to jeer at
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick, exhorting him to make the call of the elephant. Merrick is now almost swaying on the stool. He attempts to step down, but as he does it finally becomes too much for him and he collapses into a heap on the wagon floor. The crowd is no longer in the least bit challenged by this piteous mess and they break out into a vocal fury, throwing objects at the wagon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bytes is humiliated at first, and then is quickly angry. He turns to Merrick.
</DIRECTION>

SMALL CIRCLE OF WAGONS (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bytes is seated by a campfire drinking from a bottle of wine. He is very drunk. From the wagon behind him we can hear Merrick coughing and wheezing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We also hear the boy, almost pleading with Merrick to stop coughing and to try to eat. As Bytes listens he gets angrier and angrier. Finally he rises clumsily to his feet and stumbles over to the back of the wagon.
</DIRECTION>
<BYTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Another bleedin' heart!
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
The boy is crouched over Merrick, who looks little better than a corpse.

Bytes points a menacing finger at Merrick.

He reaches in and grabs Merrick roughly by his arm, dragging him out of the wagon.

</BOY>
<BYTES>

<DIRECTION>
He drags Merrick across the way to a small monkey wagon. The boy follows, his face filled with sympathy for Merrick. Bytes opens the cage door and stuffs Merrick in as the monkeys scream.

	Don't!

<BYTES>

He slams the door and latches it. Then he quickly turns, still in his rage, and starts for the wagon. As he passes the boy, the boy tries to stop him.
</DIRECTION>
<BOY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bytes, please...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOY>
<DIRECTION>
Bytes knocks the boy down with the back of his hand. He stalks to his wagon and climbs inside. After some muffled sound, Merrick's food bowl comes flying out. There are more muffled sounds as Merrick's stick, cloak and hood are also thrown out one by one.
</DIRECTION>
<BYTES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Out!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BYTES>
<DIRECTION>
The boy looks to Merrick who is in a panic trying to keep himself away from the monkeys who scream loudly in all the excitement. We hear Bytes, cursing to himself, in the wagon. The boy, frightened, goes to the fire and pulls a blanket around him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick crawls to one corner of the cage away from the screaming monkeys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly one of the braver ones leaps at Merrick with a scream, biting him on the arm, and moving quickly away. Merrick yelps with pain and struggles to move away. The other monkeys have gotten the idea now and they begin to move warily toward Merrick, screeching threateningly. Another leaps out and clings to Merrick's shoulder, biting and scratching furiously then he too jumps away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick cries out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Now the monkeys are getting braver and more and more of them lash out at Merrick with their paws. They jump onto him with savage screams, biting him on the head and neck and shoulders. Merrick's eyes search for escape. The monkeys come on and on without a break, screaming madly all the while.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With his good hand Merrick begins to pull himself up with the aid of a bar.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The monkeys strive to pull him down. Merrick looks through the bars at the wagon and screams frantically.
</DIRECTION>
<MERRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bytes! Bytes, please!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRICK>
<DIRECTION>
But Bytes won't come. Something is happening inside Merrick. A wave of feeling is growing, coming from a place in him very deep down and far away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This feeling seems to give him strength and he is able to pull himself all the way up in spite of the hairy moving mass that now seems to cling to every part of his body.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The feeling is surging up inside Merrick making his body shake uncontrollably as if he were a volcano about to erupt. The monkeys keep on biting and screeching, pulling at him. Suddenly a formidable cry rings out of Merrick's mouth, with a power and assurance we have never heard from him before. He whirls about and cries out again a shattering "No", the force of which scatters most of the monkeys away from him onto the cage floor, dumbfounded.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick grabs a monkey who has managed to hang and throws it into the group of monkeys on the floor.
</DIRECTION>

</MERRICK>
<DIRECTION>
The monkeys have been shocked into silence, pushed into the other end of the cage. Merrick, perhaps as surprised as the monkeys, rests against the bars of the cage. The monkeys make no move toward him. They sit across the cage from Merrick silently watching him with fear.

We now see Merrick crouched in a corner of the cage in his sleeping position.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the monkeys again, and hear whispering in the still night. CU of merrick's head resting on his knees. The whispering continues and a shadow falls across Merrick. Merrick begins to stir, his head comes up, and he looks around. The whispering stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We pull back to see some of the freaks from the circus gathered around the monkey cage in a small group. They are: 2 pinheads (male and female), the dwarf we saw earlier with the plumed hat and the ark on a string, another male dwarf, a female midget, a lion-faced man, and an armless wonder. The female pinhead reaches into the cage and pats Merrick's head.

He looks to the lion-faced man and speaks to him in a foreign tongue. The lion-faced man unlatches the cage door. Then, after further instruction, from the plumed dwarf, the freaks gently help Merrick out of the cage, closing the door behind him. The dwarf speaks to the others again and the lion-faced man and the armless wonder move to each side of Merrick. The lion-faced man pulls Merrick's right arm over his shoulder. Merrick puts his left arm around the armless wonder.

He and the other dwarf light two lanterns and they begin to move off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boy by the wagon has awakened. He sees the small caravan of freaks moving in the darkness, the light from the lanterns bobbing over the grass. His first instinct is to call for Bytes, which he almost does, but then he thinks better of it. He rises and goes to where Bytes threw Merrick's stick and disguise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He nicks them up and goes to the small band of strangely shaped beings. They stop and watch him warily.

The small band moves away through the wagons. The boy watches the lantern light receding in the darkness. He turns and looks to the wagon, the poster of the Elephant Man, and the dying fire. He moves to the fire quickly collecting a few blankets and belongings. Then taking one last look at the garish poster just visible in the night, he runs off into the darkness.

The intrepid freaks approach a bend in the road. They go around the corner and before them stands a small train station, a train sitting amongst the steam by a platform. The freaks stop just outside the light of the station and the plumed Dwarf's instruction get Merrick into his disguise. The female pinhead, who has carried his stick, hands it to Merrick, squeezing his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MERRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>

He turns and confers with the freaks who all rifle through their pockets and produce some coins. Then he and Merrick walk into the station, the freaks watching and waving.

:SC: ON THE PLATFORM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The train is about to leave. At a barrier two ticket collectors are taking tickets of a few last-minute passengers, who hurry off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Plumed Dwarf and Merrick appear and walk to the barrier. The Plumed Dwarf hands over the ticket.

<PLUMED_DWARF>

</PLUMED_DWARF>
<DIRECTION>
They walk off down the platform. The collectors stare after them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Plumed Dwarf, his arm around Merrick, is helping him down the platform, as fast as possible, his ark trailing behind him. As they pass the windows of the first-class carriages, we see the ornate interiors and the happy, handsome people on their plush seats.

<DIRECTION>
The Plumed Dwarf finds an empty compartment and opens the door.

<PLUMED_DWARF>

He looks down the platform. The Ticket Collectors are watching them with great interest.

<DIRECTION>
Merrick climbs laboriously aboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other people on board see Merrick, react, and move away from him as far as they can in the cramped, 3rd class carriage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Plumed Dwarf notices this and sniffs at the people with contempt.

	Luck, my friend, luck. Who needs it more than we?

Merrick nods "yes", and holds out his hand. The train is moving a little faster. The Plumed Dwarf grabs his hand and they shake.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He shuts the door. As the carriage passes, Merrick's mask is pressed up against the window. The Plumed Dwarf waves to him as the train moves away.

He looks at the train for a moment, then walks back down the platform.

Merrick is in the corner, facing into the carriage. He looks slowly around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The other passengers have moved away, forming almost a moat of space around him. We see the whole carriage now; the cowering people and Merrick at the far end. Seeing their silent, horrified stares, he moves to the opposite seat, facing the back wall. Merrick looks around for a moment, then sees his reflection in the window. He stares at himself.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: THIRD CLASS CARRIAGE

The carriage is dark now, and empty except for Merrick. He looks out the window at a sign above a station platform that says "Oostende", and at the few people still walking about.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OOSTENDE STATION PLATFORM (NIGHT)

<DIRECTION>
We see the side of the carriage. Merrick, inside the darkened car, is not visible. A CONDUCTOR walks to the end of the carriage and turns a valve. He opens the door to Merrick's compartment.
</DIRECTION>
<CONDUCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, you'll have to leave now.

Merrick is motionless, reluctant to leave the security of the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<CONDUCTOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is the end of the line, you'll have to leave now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONDUCTOR>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick pulls his walking stick from the darkness and plants it firmly on the floor with a loud THUD. The Conductor, expecting violence, draws back. A few people on the platform, who have stopped to watch this exchange, gasp.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick rises with the help of his stick, and slowly descends from the carriage watched very carefully by the others. He looks around for a moment, then walks off down the platform. TWO YOUNG TOUGHS follow a little distance behind him, laughing and mimicking his uneven gait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OOSTENDE QUAY (NIGHT)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see a short line of people waiting to board a cross-channel steamer. The First-Mate is standing by the gangplank, smiling at the women passengers and making the most of his handsome face and crisp white uniform. He surveys the line, stops and smiles even more broadly. A very pretty Young Woman at the end of the line is smiling back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the end of the quay disappearing into darkness towards the station.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rhythmic sound of Merrick's stick is heard as he slowly moves into the light.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Woman, still smiling at the First-Mate, demurely lowers her eyes. Merrick appears behind her, breathing heavily from the long walk. The woman's face freezes. She turns her head, ever so slightly, and sees Merrick. Her face drops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The First-Mate sees the Woman change, then sees Merrick. He walks out of frame. Merrick is still trying to catch his breath as the First-Mate walks up. The Woman looks up at the First-Mate imploringly.
</DIRECTION>
<FIRST_MATE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	May I see your ticket?

Merrick, confused at first, produces his ticket from his cloak. The First-Mate examines it and hands it back.

<DIRECTION>
TWO DRUNKS are sitting against the wall, drinking and singing. One of them gets up and walks out of frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick peeks around a corner at the Drunk. They stare at each other for a long moment. Merrick disappears. The other Drunk comes back, sits down, and they both start singing again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick is in darkness, seated around the corner, tapping his left hand against his leg, keeping in time with the drunken music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OOSTENDE QUAY (MORNING)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see Merrick behind some crates, watching the ship. On the wharf a different First-Mate waits until the last of the morning passengers board the ship. He then nods to the Ticket Taker and ascends the gangplank, nodding to a crew man. On board, everyone prepares to get underway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick pitches forward from behind the crates, half running, half stumbling toward the Ticket Taker. The Ticket Taker, about to board the ship, drops the tickets on the ground and stoops to pick them up. As he collects the scattered tickets a hand comes into frame holding a ticket out to him. He reaches for it, and calls over his shoulder to the crewman at the plank.
</DIRECTION>
<TICKET_TAKER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait! One more!

Merrick is crouched in a dark corner underneath a stairway, his head resting on the points of both knees, his arms clasped around them. He is asleep. A few drops of rain fall and hit his cap, then a few more and finally it begins to rain. He wakes up and looks around. He hears a voice.

They laugh and hug each other and run inside out of the rain. Merrick's hand comes into the shot, grasping a stair and pulling himself up slowly. He rounds the stairs and walks onto the deck looking after the young couple.

Merrick walks to the railing and leans over it, oblivious of the rain. We see the cliffs of Dover.

Through a rain-streaked window we see rolling green countryside. We pull back to see an Elderly Man in a heavy black overcoat with a wide-brimmed rain hat eating an apple. Beside him his wife knits.

A few other people similarly clothed are sleeping. We PAN across them to see Merrick at the back of the car watching the Elderly Man eat.

Grey light filters through the windows in the high canopy ceiling over the trains in the station. The platforms below fill with people as trains arrive and depart. We now see the station with its newsstands, sweetstalls, shoeshiners, and passengers moving to and fro, carrying luggage and looking for their train.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A YOUNG BOY is seated on a pile of baggage looking very adult and bored. His MOTHER stands beside him, though we see only a portion of her billowy skirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear her voice in rapid conversation with another Woman. The Young Boy scans the crowd looking for excitement. He sees something.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Elderly Man we saw on the train and his wife are moving past the barrier.

The Young Boy slowly pulls a peashooter from a pocket, puts a pea in his mouth, and raises the pipe to his lips. His Mother's hand shoots out and grabs it.

Merrick still looking around, suddenly turns in Little Jim's direction. He sees the Boy tugging at his Mother's skirt and pointing at him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and walks in the opposite direction along a wall stacked with trunks and luggage, trying as best as he can to blend in. Little Jim gets up and moves after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick continues along the wall. A few people give him a second look, but pass on. Little Jim comes up alongside him.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey Mister, why is your head so big?
	</DIALOGUE>

<LITTLE_JIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mister!
	</DIALOGUE>

One of the boys reaches down and snatches the hem of Merrick's cloak. He lifts it, trying to catch a glimpse of the mysterious stranger. Merrick pulls away and tries to go faster. Relishing the hunt, the boys follow him, taunting him all the way. As they approach the arch, Little Jim, determined now, steps in front of him cutting him off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick comes to an abrupt standstill, shrinking from the boy. Little Jim reaches up to the hood and grasps it firmly.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_JIM>

	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_JIM>
<DIRECTION>
He lifts the hood and then staggers back onto the floor in a spasm of fear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lets out a shrill scream. Merrick turns wildly away, looking for another escape. Little Jim's Mother, hearing her son's cries, looks up immediately.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She sees Merrick and the howling boy in the middle of the station.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My son! My son! Help!

Merrick, hearing this, looks in her direction and whirls away. He stumbles toward another archway exit. People, hearing the noise, watch him go. He knocks down a little girl in his flight and she, too, starts screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the archway comes a bobby. Jim's Mother, now with her son, calls to him.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>

Merrick stops at the sight of the bobby. The bobby at the arch, now aware of the commotion, sees Merrick and walks quickly towards him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick changes course, but, a group of men, alerted by Jim's mother's screams, move forward together, cutting him off. They yell at him angrily.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One of them darts toward him and grabs a hold of Merrick's hood. Merrick turns frantically away and as he does, the hood is pulled off him. The crowd shouts at him as he goes, following him in wary pursuit. He moves back past the children and Jim's Mother. They all scream and shield themselves from his approach. Another group of people move toward him blocking all escape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind him, he sees a door to a urinal. He moves through it followed by the crowd. We hear fearsome echoes inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the urinal, the crowd presses Merrick toward a wall. They have become angry now. They shout and there is fear in their voices. They hem Merrick in. He looks around hoping for an opening. There is none.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He gives a strangled cry and collapses as the bobby pushes his way through the crowd.

Merrick puts his good hand over his good ear trying to block out the screams of the crowd.

MERRICK'S ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick stands before the row of smiling ladies on his wall. He surveys them lovingly for a long moment. He is holding in his hand a bundle of evening clothes, the handsome black bow tie lying on the new silk shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<MERRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You women are such strange and wonderful creatures... Alas, it seems to be my fate to fall in love with each and everyone of you. I especially wish you could all be with me tonight... I'm finally going to the theatre.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRICK>
<DIRECTION>
He stands for a moment, reluctant to leave their company. He goes to his bed placing the clothes upon it, and then to the cathedral. He compares it with St. Phillips outside. He picks up the main spire and gazes at it, but his mind is somewhere else.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see the whole theatre. It is very ornate. The orchestra is tuning up and the house is filled with elegant, well dressed, handsome people all happily chatting and calling to one another. We see young men and women flirting boldly and generally enjoying each other's company. In the Royal Box Mothershead and Nora in evening gowns sit up front relishing the spectacle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the back of the box John sits between Treves and the Princess. He is dressed in his evening clothes, his cloak tied over his shoulders like a cape, but he does not wear his hood.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Princess is explaining to Merrick the workings of a pair of opera glasses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He takes them and delightedly spies about the theatre.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
John is breathless as the house lights dim and the curtain rises. Enter chorus.
</DIRECTION>
<CHORUS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend The brightest heaven of invention, A kingdom for a stage, princes to act And monarchs to behold the swelling scene! Then should the warlike Harry, like himself, Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels, Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire Crouch for employment. But pardon, gentles all, The flat unraised spirits that have dar'd On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth So great an object: can this cockpit hold The vasty fields of Rance? Or may we cram Within this wooden O the very casques That did affright the air at Agincourt? O, pardon! since a crooked figure may Attest in little place a million; And let us, ciphers to this great account, On your imaginary forces work.

Treves smiling at John. He exchanges knowing smiles with the Princess. John watches with the unconstrained delight of a child; but his rapture is even more intense and solemn. His attitude is one of wonder and awe, and he often leans forward, panting in his excitement. To John the characters are not actors in make-up and costume, but real people.

	I know no way to mince it in love, but directly to say "I love you". What! A speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a black beard will turn white; a curl'd pate will grow bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax hollow; but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon, or rather the sun and not the moon; for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course truly.

During the above, the CAMERA moves in on John.

<DIRECTION>
Amidst great applause the curtain rings down. Through the curtain comes Mrs. Kendal to renewed applause. She motions the audience to quiet down.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_KENDAL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you for your warm greeting. Ladies and gentlemen, tonight's performance was very special to me, because it was very special to someone else, a man who knows the theatre and loves the theatre, and yet tonight is the first time he's ever actually been here. I would like to dedicate... the whole company wishes to dedicate, from their hearts, tonight's performance to Mr. John Merrick, my dear friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_KENDAL>
<DIRECTION>
She gestures toward the Royal Box. There is modest applause as the audience rises and turns toward it. Merrick cannot be seen in the shadows, and the crowd cranes their necks trying to get a glimpse of him. We hear whispers of "Oh look! It's the Elephant Man! The Elephant Man!' run through the audience. Treves turns to John.

Merrick rises and comes forward to thunderous applause. The audience begins to rise and they clap their hands even louder.

Merrick is overcome by the applause. Tears run down his cheeks. Treves, Nora, Mothershead and the Princess, filled with pride, beam at John.

Merrick, in a night-shirt, is seated at his table working on his cathedral.

Treves is nearby.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Wasn't Mrs. Kendal wonderful? I can't blame the King for wanting to marry her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Merrick closes his eyes and his head tilts forward slightly. It seems unbearably large: too large for him to support.
</DIRECTION>
<TREVES>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will the cathedral be finished soon, John?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TREVES>
<MERRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, very soon.

Merrick rises and goes with Treves to the door.

<MERRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You too, my friend. Goodnight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRICK>
<DIRECTION>
Treves smiles at John then walks down the darkened hallway. Merrick watches him for a moment, then slowly shuts the door. We hear the distant echo of Treves footsteps. Merrick goes back to examine his cathedral, looking at it from different angles. He picks up a fine brush, dipping it into the paint, and makes a few final brush strokes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He moves back into the middle of the room and gazes at it for a long time. He lowers the brush to his side.
</DIRECTION>
<MERRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is finished.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRICK>
<DIRECTION>
The cathedral is a masterwork of detail and shading, as if it were St. Philips itself shrunk to a miniature. He goes to the table, dips the brush into the paint and carefully signs his name at the base of the main spire.
</DIRECTION>
<MERRICK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	John... Merrick!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MERRICK>
<DIRECTION>
He sighs deeply, lays the brush down on the table and pushes the model towards the window. The movement causes him pain. He puts his left hand up and feels the back of his head. Merrick turns out the lamp and goes to his bed. He looks at the cathedral again, then around at his room. We see in the dim light his books, his gallery of smiling women, his dressing bag, his cloak and hood, and finally his mother's picture on the table. A slight breeze billows the curtains. We move in very close to them.
