<OSCAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did he lick the mailbox?

Oscar notices a leather strap hanging down from the top shelf of a book case. He pulls up a chair to investigate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The strap leads to an old pair of binoculars. Behind it, dusty books about birds. Oscar grabs the binoculars and climbs down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oscar holds the binoculars to his face but the lenses are too far apart. Oscar compensates by closing one eye and looking through only one lens. He focuses on his grandpa's nose hair.

<OSCAR>

INT. MALL - CANDY STORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tucked inside a mall, the candy store does brisk business. Pimple-faced clerks ring up clumps of overweight families.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oscar pretends to look at hard candies while he listens to Joe and the MANAGER.
</DIRECTION>
<MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're telling me this Fancy Corn stuff is some kind of health food?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANAGER>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's a candy... and a health food. Absolutely. Absolutely.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I don't know. We don't have much more shelf space.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANAGER>
<DIRECTION>
Oscar spots a GIRL perusing wax lips. She looks to be about five or six. Joe ignores the manager and reads ingredients off a Twizzler package.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Glycerol monostearate? What is that? I can't even read that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe spins a can of Fancy Corn around and points to the ingredients.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
The manager leans close.

	No. The first thing listed. The number one ingredient.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Corn.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANAGER>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. Corn. Can you think of anything more wholesome? It's all American for Christ's sake.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
The manager's not buying it. Oscar takes action. He positions himself next to the girl.
</DIRECTION>
<OSCAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know if they sell fancy corn here?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSCAR>
<DIRECTION>
The girl looks at him suspiciously.
</DIRECTION>
<OSCAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you even know what fancy corn is?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSCAR>
<GIRL>

She looks back to the lips and tries to ignore Oscar.
</DIRECTION>
<OSCAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I heard that the strawberry fancy corn gives you bionic strength.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSCAR>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's stupid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<OSCAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's true. Some kind of chemical in the strawberry flavoring. If you eat a whole lot of it, it gives you bionic strength.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSCAR>
<DIRECTION>
The girl gives Oscar a long stare.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRL>
	<DIALOGUE>

</GIRL>
<OSCAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care if you do or not.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSCAR>
<DIRECTION>
The girl watches him for a moment and then walks over and tugs her mother's shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I read where these chemicals are getting into the streams, making hermaphrodidic frogs! You think mothers want to expose their kids to that stuff? No way. More and more people are looking for healthy alternatives which is why the demand for this product is so huge right now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<MANAGER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like I said, I already put in all the orders I want for this year.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	It seems wrong though doesn't it... to throw everything away.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORAH>
<DIRECTION>
Rose tosses a tattered fanny pack onto the heap in the garbage can. Norah plucks it out and opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Norah pulls out a PHOTO ID. She holds it up. The woman on the ID looks street-worn and crazy.
</DIRECTION>
<NORAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I bet this is her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORAH>
<DIRECTION>
Rose sweeps. Norah digs deeper into the fanny pack and pulls out a small packet wrapped in satin ribbon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Norah unties the ribbon and finds a stack of old school photos. Each photo is of a different grade. Norah flips through the stack and the girl appears to grow up.
</DIRECTION>
<NORAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow, look at this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORAH>
<DIRECTION>
Norah holds the senior photo next to the ID. The resemblance between the two is clear.
</DIRECTION>
<NORAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Think it's her daughter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORAH>
<DIRECTION>
Rose looks. Shrugs.

<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's none of your business, Norah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>

Rose picks up a bag stuffed with cans and fast food wrappers. She screams and drops the bag. A giant ball of maggots writhes at her feet.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hand me that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Norah grabs the dust pan and hands it to Rose.
</DIRECTION>
<NORAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What if she doesn't know? Wouldn't you want to know if this was mom?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORAH>
<DIRECTION>
Norah looks closely at the I.D. as Rose deposits trash and maggots into the garbage bin. The comparison angers Rose.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom was never like this. Mom would never have been like this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Norah thinks about that and looks back at the I.D.
</DIRECTION>
<NORAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wonder how she died?

</JOE>
<OSCAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSCAR>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's those teachers who are retarded. You're probably just too advanced for those classes. You're bored. Do you get bored in class?

</JOE>
<OSCAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSCAR>
<JOE>

</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was so disgusting. I mean the smell, you would not believe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Mac's in the sex zone. He unbuttons his shirt and tunes out all those distracting words tumbling from Rose's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rose, animated, slips her skirt off and tosses it aside.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There were flies everywhere and, really, the smell. I can't even describe it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>

Mac's shoes hit the floor with a thud. He sets his belt and gun on the dresser.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>

	Shhhh.

Rose pulls her shirt over her head. Mac kisses her belly.

<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, after we finished... you woulda never even known. We took all that away... made it right.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Mac pulls off his pants. Rose hangs her bra on the back of the chair and slips off her undies.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe you... I mean, I feel like I got you into this mess.
	</DIALOGUE>

(Suddenly very serious)

Rose smiles. Apparently it's some private joke.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yeah, definitely talk about crown molding.

The phrase seems to send a ripple of pleasure through Mac.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Property easements, square footage, appliances...

Mac reacts to each word as if it were some filthy sex talk. He looks at Rose and raises an eyebrow.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Curb appeal.

</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Mac growls and pounces on Rose. It's fun and light. Rose laughs while Mac makes a show of mauling her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He falls on the bed and reaches out. Rose takes his hand. It's rough against hers. There's a circular indentation where his wedding ring isn't.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rose stops laughing. She touches the invisible ring.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why'd you pick her?
	</DIALOGUE>

Mac looks up. Buzz kill. The residue of a smile fades.

</MAC>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>

As they approach, the clerk drops out of sight behind the counter. Rose leans over to see the clerk on his knees searching for something small and lost.

On the TV, a waitress enters the frame. Rose stops. She and Norah both turn and look at the TV.

	General purpose cleaners, extraction cleaners, odor control. We carry both the Winzyme and the DR 450. Disinfectants, stain removers and shampoos. Steamers, buffers, foggers, that kinda stuff's in there, for rent or purchase. Quick absorbing sawdust, good for vomit.

</NORAH>

Lynn smiles. Norah releases the stop button. Nothing happens.
</DIRECTION>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not moving.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<NORAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's press the alarm button.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORAH>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn shrugs. Norah presses the alarm button. There's a loud quick ring. They wait for something to happen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An awkward silence hangs in the air. Norah gives it another quick punch for good measure. Smiles. They look at the ceiling. They look at the floor. Norah makes little noises.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Norah takes out her sign language book. She steals a quick sideways look at Lynn before settling on the series of small, illustrated hands before her.
</DIRECTION>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go to the university?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<NORAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me? No.

Lynn leans close and checks out the book.
</DIRECTION>
<NORAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hobby...
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORAH>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn sizes Norah up.
</DIRECTION>
<NORAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's this gorilla who knows sign language and I've always thought that would have to be the most amazing thing ever. You know? To actually talk to a gorilla.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORAH>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I've seen something on--
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Norah nods.
</DIRECTION>
<NORAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	KoKo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORAH>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, yeah, with the kitten.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Norah offers a sad nod.
</DIRECTION>
<NORAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kitten died. It wasn't KoKo's fault. She was heartbroken.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORAH>
<DIRECTION>
A KNOCKING sound reverberates through the elevator.
</DIRECTION>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kind of weird, don't you think? Teaching a gorilla to talk. Probably, gorillas aren't supposed to talk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<NORAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what's so cool about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORAH>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn takes a long bold look at Norah. Norah sweats. The elevator moves.
</DIRECTION>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry again about the...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<NORAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, don't... it's fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORAH>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn lightly touches the crook of Norah's arm.
</DIRECTION>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got nice veins.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Norah smiles self consciously. She's flustered. Not a familiar sensation. The doors open to the "Albuquerque Blood Services."
</DIRECTION>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should give blood.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LYNN>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn steps off the elevator and grabs a white coat from a rack. She glances back with a smile just as the doors close.

INT. LORKOWSKI HOUSE - NORAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Norah pulls the photos from her bag and sets them on a shelf next to the candy heart. Then, she drops to the floor and pulls the LUNCH BOX from under her bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She surveys the contents: lipstick tipped cigarette butts, an eyelash curler, a Blue Jay feather, an old photo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the photo two girls, twelve and five, stand with their mom. A cigarette dangles from the mother's ruby red mouth.
</DIRECTION>

This time Rose's Sentra sits alone. No blue Camry in sight.

Rose lies in bed and listens to cars go by on the highway. She checks her watch, picks up the phone and dials.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. Could you tell me what time you have? Okay. Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Rose hangs up and falls back onto the bed, feet dangling off the edge. She stares at the ceiling and whispers.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am strong. I am powerful. I am a winner.

</ROSE>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you talking about? You can't quit real estate. You're gonna be great at real estate. You got the whole look and besides, that's where everything's headed. Hell, it's what I should have done forty years ago.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Rose sits at the table next to Oscar. She looks miserable. Oscar looks at his mom.
</DIRECTION>
<OSCAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Want me to make you something happy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSCAR>
<DIRECTION>
Rose can't help but smile.

Rose hands Winston a canister of Fancy Corn and a business card. Rays of the sun dart off the edges of the card in a style of a child's drawing. It reads, "Sunshine Cleaning."
</DIRECTION>
<WINSTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sunshine Cleaning. Nice.

</WINSTON>
<DIRECTION>
Rose hands Winston a stack of cards. He places them in an owl business card holder in front of several Clean Sweep business cards.
</DIRECTION>
<WINSTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is great but you guys should really get out there and market yourselves.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINSTON>
<DIRECTION>
Oscar plays with an extraction cleaner and accidently turns it on. Winston gives him a nod that indicates that he should turn it off. He does.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, marketing? Like...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<WINSTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Funeral Homes, property managers... What you really want is to get in with the insurance companies. They can throw you a ton of work.

Oscar walks into the back room.

INT. CLEANING SUPPLY STORE - BACK ROOM - DAY

Oscar crawls into the passenger seat for a closer look. He sees the CB mounted on the ceiling and tugs Norah's sleeve.

</OSCAR>
<NORAH>

	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSCAR>
<DIRECTION>
Sherm grabs the handset to demonstrate.
</DIRECTION>
<SHERM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's a CB. You talk into this thing and hold this thing down and it turns your voice into radio waves and sends it into the heavens.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHERM>
<OSCAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Heaven?

INT. VAN - DAY

Rose drives. Norah sits shotgun and sings the baseline to a 70s era porno. Oscar kneels between them staring at the CB.
</DIRECTION>
<NORAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bow-chicka-bow-bow. Can I drive?

</NORAH>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.

</ROSE>
<OSCAR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try the CB!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OSCAR>
<DIRECTION>
Rose reaches up and clicks the CB on. Nothing but static. She adjusts the frequency dial until she lands on the faintest hint of a voice buried beneath the crush of static.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oscar's face lights up with amazement. Rose is under-whelmed. She clicks the CB off.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Antenna's probably broke.

Norah points out the window.

Rose pays for three soft serve cones and makes her way to the picnic table where Norah and Oscar wait.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Norah points to an `apartment for rent' sign on the building across the street. A big bosomed woman sits on the porch with a rabbit in her lap.
</DIRECTION>
<NORAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How cool to live across from the Ice Cream Hut.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORAH>

Rose distributes the melty goods.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You should rent it. Seriously, you're making money now.

Norah assesses the building. The RABBIT LADY sees them staring. She waves. Rose and Norah turn around amused.
</DIRECTION>
<NORAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah well, what about Dad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORAH>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh please, Dad would survive just fine. You should do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
As Norah thinks about a possible move glistening rivulets of chocolate ice cream drip down Oscar's cone, over his hand and on to Norah's leg.
</DIRECTION>
<NORAH>

	Ahh! Lick around the base. Secure the perimeter.

<DIRECTION>
(To Rose)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you teach this kid anything?

Norah demonstrates proper technique. She extends her tongue out to the bottom edge of the dripping glob, then twirls the cone to lick away the troublesome chocolate.
</DIRECTION>

	It's the gorilla girl.

Lynn looks at Rose. An awkward moment passes.
</DIRECTION>
<NORAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My sister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORAH>
<DIRECTION>
Rose smiles, nods a hi. Something familiar about the girl nags at Rose. She searches to connect a face out of context.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn eyes Norah. Chemistry.
</DIRECTION>
<LYNN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We have snacks you know. Juice boxes.

</LYNN>
<NORAH>

	I'm glad to see you're doing a little homework. A lot of people, you know, they think they can just jump in to this, make lots of money. But, they don't know what they're doing. No idea. They're not professional and that makes us all look bad.

<NORAH>
	<DIALOGUE>

<OSCAR>

Sweat drips down Joe's face. He continues his labor and avoids looking at Rose.

As Norah rubs her injured hand, she hears the teeniest MEOW rise from the bushes. She investigates.
</DIRECTION>

A little orange fluff ball at the base of some box hedges looks up with big startled eyes. Norah smiles.

	Oh my God, you're the cutest thing ever. Did you get left behind?

Fear grips her as she scans the area for her sister. Then she sees Norah, sitting in the van across the street. Headphones on. Kitten curled up in her lap.

	Well, if you had been here to help me but no, you're off desperately trying to impress stupid high school people who don't even matter.

</ROSE>
<WINSTON>

Rose doesn't respond. She slowly blinks and lets her new reality ooze over her.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's not a lot I'm really good at, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Winston looks at Rose.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really. I'm good at getting guys to want me. Not date or marry me. But want me. I've always been good at that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Winston looks away.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And cheering. I was pretty good at that too.

</ROSE>
<WINSTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cheering is good.

Smoke slinks from a cigarette on the makeshift ashtray.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rose looks up to see Oscar in his PJs, one arm tucked in his shirt, the sleeve dangling empty. Rose musters a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You brush your teeth?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>

Oscar nods, kisses her good night. Rose watches him walk to his room and takes a drag from her cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There's a knock at the door.

Mac smiles for the both of them.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was starting to think you were on a date or something.
	</DIALOGUE>

Rose looks at him like he's speaking a foreign language.

<MAC>

Rose nods.

Mac sags a bit. Then rallies. Flexes an eyebrow.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got you something.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Mac pulls a small gold box from his pocket and presents it to Rose. The top is engraved with her initials.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's for your business cards. You put `em in there and, I don't know... impress people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
He laughs at the silliness of the whole concept.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Rose stares at the small shiny box. It seems to make her sad.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't like it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I like it very much.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Rose looks up and Mac senses something bad is coming his way.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's just this thing we're doing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, let's not do that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>

But Rose is resolute. She looks Mac in the eye.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't want this anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Disbelief gives way to the unpleasant understanding.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So that's it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAC>
<DIRECTION>
Rose gives an almost imperceptible nod. Mac tries hard to ignore the rising slurry of hurt and anger.
</DIRECTION>
<MAC>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it then.
	</DIALOGUE>

Mac hesitates, hoping for a last minute reprieve. Finally, he nods and Rose watches him walk away.

</DIRECTION>
<NORAH>

</NORAH>
<DIRECTION>
Lynn takes the packet. As she walks back to the reclining blood donors she tosses the photos in a trash can.

A smiling Korean woman gives Norah a cup of juice and puts an `I gave blood today' sticker on her chest.

INT. HINKLE'S RESTAURANT - A FEW DAYS LATER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rose, Oscar, Joe and Winston sit in a carnival like restaurant. Oscar opens a gift in the shape of a binocular case. He beams with anticipation.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oscar snaps open the case and pulls out the old familiar pair of binoculars. Rose looks disappointed. Oscar looks confused.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That other pair we looked at, full of gadgets and gimmicks. They just didn't have the heft you want in a pair of lenses. No weight. No history.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Oscar nods. Joe points to the old binoculars.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	These here are the real deal. I want you to have them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Oscar smiles. Rose shakes her head. It's not like she didn't see this coming. But still.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad, you promised him those others. From the store. He's been talking about it for weeks.
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Joe looks at Rose with new found confidence.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No Rose, I want to him to have these.

Winston eyes the binoculars.

Joe nods.

Norah grabs some paper towel and holds it out for her sister.
</DIRECTION>
<NORAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Winston cleans up pretty good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORAH>
<DIRECTION>
Rose isn't biting. She doesn't even look at Norah. She leans past Norah and gets her own paper towel. Norah tries again.
</DIRECTION>
<NORAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I read somewhere that beauty is really all about symmetry. Like having eyes the same size and all that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, you know, when you factor that in he's like, hot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORAH>
<DIRECTION>
Rose won't play. She dabs her face and ignores Norah. Norah walks to the door, starts to leave, then turns around.
</DIRECTION>
<NORAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, I know I fucked up, okay? Like really huge and I know that and I'm sorry, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORAH>
<DIRECTION>
It's a bullshit apology. More defensive than sincere. Just the thing that pushes Rose's buttons.
</DIRECTION>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God, that drives me crazy! That whole `Oh, I'm sorry, I'm just a big fuck up' routine. Like that's a legitimate excuse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Norah's defensiveness loosens its grip. She steps towards Rose. This is hard for her. Sincerity is not her strong suit.
</DIRECTION>
<NORAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I really am sorry. But it really isn't all my fault, Rose.
	</DIALOGUE>
</NORAH>
<ROSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think there's something wrong with you. The way your brain works. I mean, what the hell? It's like you can't be trusted with anything. You just screw around all the time like it's all a big fucking game. It wasn't a game, Norah. We're not all just here for your amusement. You should have been paying attention. You should have been focused on the job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROSE>
<DIRECTION>
Rose finally hears herself. It's all the same old stuff. She grinds to a stop. She knows it wasn't all Norah's fault.
</DIRECTION>
<NORAH>

<ROSE>

Norah shakes her head.

Oscar slowly retracts his arm again. With his remaining arm he lifts the binoculars to his face.

Rose walks toward the van with a trash bag that swishes with each step. She takes one last look, then peels the Sunshine Cleaning door magnet off and drops it into the trash bag.

She crawls into the front seat and tosses empty pop cans and candy bar wrappers into the trash bag. A faint sound nags at her. She looks up to see the CB on.

Soft white static fills the van. Rose sits a long moment before taking the handset.

With windows down, Norah drives across an open landscape. She glances at a wind battered map. A highlighted route cuts across the country. Destination - California.

Norah bobs her head to the radio, sucks on a slurpee. She holds her arm out the window and lets her hand surf the wind.

EXT. CATHOLIC SCHOOL - SCHOOL YARD - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oscar, in a Catholic school uniform, holds binoculars to his face. He watches a scrawny girl across the school yard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girl ties a strand of hair to her pigtail then loops the invisible strand over a pencil. She glances over to Oscar. Oscar doesn't flinch.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With school girl slight of hand, the pigtail rises and falls. It is a magical, flirtatious pigtail greeting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Oscar lowers the binoculars and pulls his sleeve up to reveal the Lil' Bastard tattoo. The girl smiles. Oscar smiles.

Blocks and brightly colored plastic toys litter the ground. Sitting in the middle of the play area is an enormous black gorilla. KOKO. She turns her massive head and looks at Norah.
