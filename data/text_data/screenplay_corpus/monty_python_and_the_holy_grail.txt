EXTERIOR - CASTLE WALLS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mist. Several seconds of it swirling about. silence possibly, atmospheric music. SUPERIMPOSE "England AD 787". after a few more seconds we hear hoofbeats in the distance. They come slowly closer. Then out of the mist comes KING ARTHUR followed by a SERVANT who is banging two half coconuts together. ARTHUR raises his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa there!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
SERVANT makes noises of horses halting, with a flourish. ARTHUR peers through the mist. CUT TO shot from over his shoulder: castle (e.g. Bodium) rising out of the mist. On the castle battlements a SOLDIER is dimly seen. He peers down.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Halt! Who goes there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It is I, Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot. King of all Britons, defeator of the Saxons, sovereign of all England!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
Pause.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get away!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am... And this my trusty servant, Patsy. We have ridden the length and breadth of the land in search of knights who will join our court at Camelot.. I must speak with your lord and master.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? Ridden on a horse?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're using coconuts!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've got two empty halves of coconuts and you're banging them together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
(Scornfully)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So? We have ridden since the snows of winter covered this land, through the kingdom of Mercea.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did you get the coconuts?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Through ... We found them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Found them? In Mercea. The coconut's tropical!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you mean?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, this is a temperate zone.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The swallow may fly south with the sun, or the house martin or the plover seek warmer hot lands in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not at all. They could be carried.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What? A swallow carrying a coconut?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why not?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll tell you why not ... because a swallow is about eight inches long and weighs five ounces, and you'd be lucky to find a coconut under a pound.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It could grip it by the husk ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not a question of where he grips it, It's a simple matter of weight - ratios ... A five-ounce bird could not hold a a one pound coconut.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it doesn't matter. Go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
A Slight pause. Swirling mist. Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look! To maintain Velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings four hundred and ninety three times every second. right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
(irritated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Am I right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SOLDIER>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not interested.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<SECOND_SOLDIER>
<DIRECTION>
(who has loomed up on the battlements)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It could be carried by an African swallow!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_SOLDIER>
<FIRST_SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes! An African swallow maybe ... but not a European swallow. that's my point.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRST_SOLDIER>
<SECOND_SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes, I agree there ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_SOLDIER>
<ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
(losing patience)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you ask your master if he wants to join the Knights of Camelot?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<FIRST_SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But then of course African swallows are non-migratory.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRST_SOLDIER>
<SECOND_SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_SOLDIER>
<DIRECTION>
ARTHUR raises his eyes heavenwards and nods to PATSY. They turn and go off into the mist.
</DIRECTION>
<FIRST_SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So they wouldn't be able to bring a coconut back anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRST_SOLDIER>
<SECOND_SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait a minute! Suppose two swallows carried it together?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECOND_SOLDIER>
<FIRST_SOLDIER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, they'd have to have it on a line.
	</DIALOGUE>

Stillness. Silence again.

:SC: ANIMATION/LIVE ACTION SEQUENCE - DEATH AND DEVASTATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO Terry Gilliam's sequence of Brueghel prints. Sounds of strange medieval music. Discordant and sparse. Wailings and groanings. The last picture mixes through into live action. BIG CLOSE UP of contorted face upside down. A leg falls across it. Creaking noise. The bodies lurch away from CAMERA to reveal they are amongst a huge pile of bodies on a swaying cart that is lumbering away from CAMERA. It is pulled by a couple of ragged, dirty emaciated WRETCHES. Behind the cart walks another MAN who looks slightly more prosperous, but only on the scale of complete and utter impoverishment. He wears a black hood and looks sinister.
</DIRECTION>
<CART_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bring out your dead!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CART_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
We follow the cart through a wretched, impoverished plague-ridden village. A few starved mongrels run about in the mud scavenging. In the open doorway of one house perhaps we jug glimpse a pair of legs dangling from the ceiling. In another doorway an OLD WOMAN is beating a cat against a wall rather like one does with a mat. The cart passes round a dead donkey or cow in the mud. And a MAN tied to a cart is being hammered to death by four NUNS with huge mallets.
</DIRECTION>
<CART_DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bring out your dead!
	</DIALOGUE>
</CART_DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
There are legs stick out of windows and doors. Two MEN are fighting in the mud - covered from head to foot in it. Another MAN is on his hands in knees shovelling mud into his mouth. We just catch sight of a MAN falling into a well.

<DIRECTION>
The CART DRIVER looks at the LARGE MAN for a moment. Then they both do a quick furtive look up and down the street. The CART DRIVER very swiftly brings up a club and hits the OLD MAN. (Out of shot but the singing stops after a loud bonk noise.)
</DIRECTION>
<LARGE_MAN>

	That's all right. See you on Thursday.

They turn ... Suddenly all the village fall to their knees, touching forelocks etc. ARTHUR and PATSY ride into SHOT, slightly nose to the air, they ride through without acknowledging anybody. After they pass, the LARGE MAN turns to the CART DRIVER.

</ARTHUR>
<DENNIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, very nice. King, eh! I expect you've got a palace and fine clothes and courtiers and plenty of food. And how d'you get that? By exploiting the workers!

EXTERIOR - FOREST - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIX THROUGH to ARTHUR and PATSY riding through the forest. They pass rune stones. We TRACK with them. CLOSE-UPS of their faces as they ride. MIX to another TRACKING SHOT of them riding through the forest. They come to a clearing and stop, looking ahead intently. Their eyes light up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sound FX of fight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO their eyeline. A clearing on the other side of which is a rough wooden foot-bridge across a stream. At the start of the bridge a tremendous fight is going on. A huge BLACK KNIGHT in black armour, his face totally masked in a visor, is fighting a slightly smaller KNIGHT in green armour. (Perhaps the GREEN KNIGHT's armour is identical to the BLACK KNIGHT's save for the colour.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO ARTHUR and PATSY. They watch, growing more impressed as they watch the fight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO the fight. The GREEN KNIGHT lunges at the BLACK KNIGHT, who avoids the blow with a skillful side-step and parry, knocking the sword out of the GREEN KNIGHT's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO ARTHUR and PATSY even more impressed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO the fight. The GREEN KNIGHT has drawn out a particularly nasty mace or spiked ball and chain, much longer than the BLACK KNIGHT's sword.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARTHUR narrows his eyes, wondering whether the BLACK KNIGHT will survive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK to the fight. The GREEN KNIGHT swings at the BLACK KNIGHT, who ducks under the first swing, leaps over the second and starts to close on the GREEN KNIGHT.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO ARTHUR and PATSY watching like a tennis match. Sound FX of the fight reaching a climax. Four almighty clangs. Then Silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK to see the GREEN KNIGHT stretched out. The BLACK KNIGHT sheathes his sword.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARTHUR looks at PATSY. Nods and they move forward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT BACK TO the BLACK KNIGHT picking up the GREEN KNIGHT above his head and hurling him into the river. ARTHUR and PATSY approach him.

Hint of a pause as he waits for a reaction which dosn't come. ARTHUR is only slightly thrown.

EXTERIOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A village. Sound of chanting of Latin canon, punctuated by short, sharp cracks. It comes nearer. We see it is a line of MONKS ala SEVENTH SEAL flagellation scene, chanting and banging themselves on the foreheads with wooden boards. They pass a group of villagers who are dragging a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN dressed as a witch through the streets. They drag her to a strange house/ruin standing on a hill outside the village. A strange-looking knight stands outside, SIR BEDEVERE.

<FOURTH_VILLAGER>

	... Wood?

PEASANTS stir uneasily then come round to this conclusion.

<ALL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see. Yes, of course.

<BEDEVERE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So how can we tell if she is made of wood?

	Make a bridge out of her.

<BEDEVERE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. So... logically ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEDEVERE>
<FIRST_VILLAGER>
<DIRECTION>
(beginning to pick up the thread)

	<DIALOGUE>
	If she ... weighs the same as a duck ... she's made of wood.

	We shall use my largest scales.

</BEDEVERE>
<DIRECTION>
He leads them a few yards to a very strange contraption indeed, made of wood and rope and leather. They put the GIRL in one pan and the duck in another. Each pan is supported by a wooden stave. BEDEVERE checks each pan then ... ARTHUR looks on with interest.
</DIRECTION>
<BEDEVERE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Remove the supports.

Two PEASANTS knock them away with sledge hammers. The GIRL and the duck swing slightly but balance perfectly.

5. MIX TO SIR GALAHAD surrounded by chickens. He is wearing a carpenters apron over his immaculate armour and is finishing off a hen-house. We see the group approach and he throws off the apron and puts down the hen-house and goes to join them.

INTERIOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO interior of medieval hall. A large group of armoured KNIGHTS are engaged in a well choreographed song-and-dance routine of the very up-beat 'If they could see me now' type of fast bouncy number. The poorer verses are made clearer by CUTTING to a group of knights actually engaged in the described task while the line itself is sung. They sing:
</DIRECTION>
<KNIGHTS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're knights of the round table We dance whene'er we're able We do routines and chorus scenes With footwork impeccable. We dine well here in Camelot We eat ham and jam and spam a lot. We're knights of the Round Table Our shows are formidable But many times We're given rhymes That are quite unsingable We're opera mad in Camelot We sing from the diaphragm a lot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KNIGHTS>
<DIRECTION>
Booming basses. A routine where two XYLOPHONISTS play parts of KNIGHTS' armour producing a pleasing effect.

<KNIGHTS>

<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>

</ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
They set off again almost immediately they are suffused in ethereal radiance and strange heavenly choir music. The PAGES, horselike, take fright for a moment, they whinny and rattle their coconuts. ARTHUR and the KNIGHTS fall on their knees. A holy voice booms out.

CUT BACK TO battlements of castle. FRENCH SENTRIES suspiciously peering towards the English lines. Wind whistles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shot of the empty scrubland or undergrowth or woodland around the castle. Emptiness. Wind. More shots of the FRENCH SENTRIES peering into the dusk. As night falls. MIX THROUGH TO night On the battlements a brazier burns or torches on the wall as the SENTRIES peer into the dark. Shots of the woodland with fires burning where the English lines are.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
During all this the sounds of extensive carpentry have possibly been herd, followed by silence, followed by renewed outbursts or activity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE-UP FRENCH looking very nervous. Dawn breaking. Shot of woodland. Nothing. Wind. Dawn still breaking. Shots of the FRENCH. They suddenly hear something. A faintly detectable squeaking which is getting louder.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO WIDE SHOT of castle and woodland. Squeaking getting louder. Shot of the FRENCH TAUNTER pointing. WIDE SHOT again. The squeaking gets louder an enormous twenty-foot-high wooden rabbit is wheeled out of the undergrowth into the open space in front of the castle. The ENGLISH scuttle back into the undergrowth. The rabbit has a large red bow tied round it and a rather crudely written label, which reads "Pour votres amis Francais". The CHIEF TAUNTER looks at it, narrowing his eyes. Then he turns and leaves battlements.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO ARTHUR and COMPANY watching from the bushes. The main gate of the castle opens a little and the CHIEF TAUNTER's head sticks out, then another Froggie head, then another. They mutter to each other in French, look rather pleased, then rush out and start to pull the giant rabbit in.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Defeat at the castle seems to have utterly disheartened King Arthur ... The ferocity of the French taunting took him completely by surprise and Arthur became convinced that a new strategy was required if the quest for the Holy Grail were to be brought to a successful conclusion. Arthur, having consulted his closest knights, decided that they should separate, and search for the Grail individually. Now, this is what they did. No sooner...

EXTERIOR - GLADE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A KNIGHT is trotting along through a wooden sun-dapled glade, followed by his trusty PAGE banging the usual half coconuts. As we see them approach we hear the beautiful lilting sound of medieval music, and see that the KNIGHT is followed by a small retinue of MUSICIANS in thirteenth-century courtly costume, one sings, and plays the tambourine, one bangs at a tabor (A small drum O.E.D) and one plays the pipes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The KNIGHT looks very proud and firm as we hear the first part of the song, but the combination of the lyrics and the large signs they pass, start to have their effect ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SONG:

Bravely bold Sir Robin, rode forth from Camelot, He was not afraid to die, Oh Brave Sir Robin, He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp Or to have his eyes gouged out and his elbows broken; To have his kneecaps split and his body burned away And his limbs all hacked and mangled, brave Sir Robin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His head smashed in, and his heart cut out, And his liver removed, and his bowels unplugged, And his nostrils raped, and his bottom burned off, And his penis split ... and his ...

They now pass three KNIGHTS impaled to a tree. With their feet off the ground, with one lance through the lot of them, they are skewered up like a barbecue.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then they pass three KNIGHTS sitting on the ground with one enormous axe through their skulls. They look timorous.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR - STORM - FOREST - DUSK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the storm rages we pick up GALAHAD forcing his way through brambles and over slippery rocks. Progress is hard. He pauses and at this moment we hear the howling of wolves. GALAHAD turns, then hurries onward even more urgently. Another louder, closer howl is herd and GALAHAD stumbles and falls heavily. Though obviously injured he bravely struggles forward a little and regains his feed reacting with pain. More louder closer howling. He grips his sword valiantly and as he glances around a flash of lightning reveals the silhouette of a huge terrifying castle, perhaps looking rather derelict. He makes up his mind in an instant and stumbles manfully toward it. More louder howling. He reaches the forbidding and enormous doors of the castle and beats on the doors with the handle of his sword, looking over his shoulder the while. Pause. He beats again, shouting:
</DIRECTION>
<GALAHAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open. Open the doors. In the name of King Arthur. Open the doors. I am Sir Galahad, a knight of the Round Table.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALAHAD>
<DIRECTION>
Some suitable noises are herd inside.
</DIRECTION>
<GALAHAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I am on a quest for the Holy Grail. I seek shelter.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALAHAD>
<DIRECTION>
Some rattling chainy noises come from inside with huge bolts being drawn. The wolves' howling is very close. As the door creaks open GALAHAD steps quickly inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - CASTLE - NIGHT

<DIRECTION>
From inside we see GALAHAD enter, wiping the rain from his eyes, and turn as the door crashes behind him. GALAHAD turns to the door reacting to the fact he is trapped.

(OUT OF VISION)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOOT>
<DIRECTION>
GALAHAD turns back. We see from his POV the lovely ZOOT standing by him smiling enchantingly and a number of equally delectable GIRLIES draped around in the seductively poulticed room. They look at him smilingly and wave.
</DIRECTION>
<GIRLIES>

</ZOOT>

She turns away and leads him towards a door leading to a corner leading to the bedchamber
</DIRECTION>
<GALAHAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well Look, I'm afraid I really ought to be ...

</ZOOT>
<DIRECTION>
There is a gasp from the other GIRLS
</DIRECTION>
<ZOOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You would not be so ungallant as to refuse our hospitality.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOOT>
<DIRECTION>
GALAHAD looks at the other GIRLS. They are clearly on the verge of being offended.
</DIRECTION>
<GALAHAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALAHAD>
<ZOOT>
<DIRECTION>
(she moves off and GALAHAD unwillingly follows)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours. We are but eightscore young blondes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle, with no one to protect us. Oooh. It is a lonely life ... bathing ... dressing ... undressing ... making exciting underwear....
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOOT>
<DIRECTION>
They reach the end of the corridor and enter the bedchamber. ZOOT turns
</DIRECTION>
<ZOOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We are just not used to handsome knights ...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she notices him limping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But you are wounded!

<GALAHAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, It's nothing!

<ZOOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must see the doctors immediately.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(she claps again)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You must lie down.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOOT>
<DIRECTION>
She almost forces him to lie on the bed as PIGLET and WINSTON enter the room. They are equally beautiful and dressed exotically. They approach GALAHAD.
</DIRECTION>
<PIGLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, what seems to be the trouble?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIGLET>
<GALAHAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're doctors?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALAHAD>
<ZOOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They have a basic medical training, yes. Now you must try to rest. Dr. Winston! Dr. Piglet! Practice your art!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ZOOT>
<WINSTON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try to relax.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WINSTON>
<GALAHAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No look, really, this isn't nescess ...

</GALAHAD>
<PIGLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We must examine you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIGLET>
<GALAHAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's nothing wrong with ... that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALAHAD>
<PIGLET>
<DIRECTION>
(slightly irritated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please ... we are doctors.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIGLET>
<DIRECTION>
ZOOT reappears. GALAHAD tries for one brief moment to relax. Then there is a sharp boing from the lower part of his armour. WINSTON glances quickly in the appropriate direction as GALAHAD sits up and starts getting off the bed and collecting his armour, saying:
</DIRECTION>
<GALAHAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no, this cannot be. I am sworn to chastity!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALAHAD>
<PIGLET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back to your bed! At once!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PIGLET>
<GALAHAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, I must go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GALAHAD>
<DIRECTION>
GALAHAD hurries to the door and pushes through it. As he leaves the room we CUT TO the reverse to show that he is now in a room full of bathing and romping GIRLIES, all innocent, wide-eyed and beautiful. They smile enchantingly at him as he tries to keep walking without being diverted by the lovely sights assaulting his eyeballs. He nods to them stiffly once or twice and then his eye catches a particularly stunning YOUNG LADY. He visibly gulps with repressed emotion and cannot resist saying:
</DIRECTION>

	Good evening ... Ah, Zoot! Er ...

INTERIOR - PRINCE'S ROOM IN CASTLE - DAY

<FATHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, lad, I built this kingdom up from nothing. All I had when I started was swamp ... other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same ... just to show 'em. It sank into the swamp. So I built a another one ... that sank into the swamp. I built another one ... That fell over and THEN sank into the swamp .... So I built another ... and that stayed up. ... And that's what your gonna get, lad: the most powerful kingdom in this island.

<DIRECTION>
He points to a wedding suit on a table or chair. FATHER throws one last look at the BOY and turns, goes out and slams the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The PRINCE slumps onto window seat, looking forlornly out of the window. MUSIC INTRO to song ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door flies open, the music cuts off and FATHER pokes his head in.

</FATHER>
<DIRECTION>
FATHER slams the door again. The GUARDS take up their positions. The SON gazes out of the window again ... sighs ... thinks ... a thought strikes him ... he gets up, crosses to his desk and scribbles a quick note and impales it on an arrow ... takes a bow down from the wall ... and fires the arrow out of the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks wetly defiant at the GUARDS, who smile pleasantly.
</DIRECTION>

EXTERIOR - A FOREST - DAY

CUT TO the middle of the forest. SIR LAUNCELOT is riding along with a trusty servant, CONCORDE.
</DIRECTION>
<LAUNCELOT>

	</DIALOGUE>
</LAUNCELOT>
<DIRECTION>
CONCORDE does the run-up with the coconuts. He does the break for the leap ... there is a thwack. SIR LAUNCELOT is waiting for the horse to land.
</DIRECTION>
<CONCORDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Message for you, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONCORDE>
<DIRECTION>
He falls forward revealing the arrow with the note.
</DIRECTION>
<LAUNCELOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Concorde - speak to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAUNCELOT>
<DIRECTION>
He realises he might be in danger and so starts to crawl off ... when he notices the note. He takes it out and reads it.
</DIRECTION>
<LAUNCELOT>
<DIRECTION>
(reading)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	"To whoever finds this note - I have been imprisoned by my father who wishes me to marry against my will. Please please please please come and rescue me. I am in the tall tower of Swamp Castle."

</LAUNCELOT>
<DIRECTION>
SIR LAUNCELOT's eyes light up with holy inspiration.
</DIRECTION>
<LAUNCELOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At last! A call! A cry of distress ...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he draws his sword, and turns to CONCORDE) Concorde! Brave, Concorde ... you shall not have died in vain!

</CONCORDE>
<LAUNCELOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good Concorde ... stay here and rest awhile.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAUNCELOT>
<DIRECTION>
He makes to leap off dramatically.
</DIRECTION>
<CONCORDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'll be all right to come with you, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CONCORDE>
<LAUNCELOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I will send help, brave friend, as soon as I have accomplished this most daring, desperate adventure in this genre.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAUNCELOT>
<CONCORDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Really, I feel fine, sir.

</CONCORDE>
<LAUNCELOT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Farewell, Concorde!

SIR LAUNCELOT plunges off into the forest.

<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR - CASTLE GATEWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two hanging banners one each side of the gate with the monogram: "H & L".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO SENTRIES with spears ... slightly weddingly ... red ribbons on their right spears. We can hear from inside revelry and celebration music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear LAUNCELOT's footsteps. The TWO SENTRIES are watching him. One of them raises his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<FIRST_SENTRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Halt, friend ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</FIRST_SENTRY>
<DIRECTION>
LAUNCELOT leaps into SHOT with a mighty cry and runs the GUARD through and hacks him to the floor. Blood. Swashbuckling music (perhaps). LAUNCELOT races through into the castle screaming.
</DIRECTION>

EXTERIOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO inside of the castle grounds or courtyard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
in the sunlight beautifully dressed WEDDING GUESTS are arriving. Converging on a doorway. A country dance in progress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIR LAUNCELOT rushes towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO HAND-HELD CLOSE-UPS as he charges through the crowd, hacking right and left a la Errol Flynn at all who come in his way.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He fights his way through the country dance. Blood. Shrieks. Bemused looks of GUESTS - not horror so much as uncomprehending surprise.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Possibly Errol Flynn music.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One COUNTRY DANCER is left holding just a hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Right and left the GUESTS crumple in pools of blood as he fights his way through the door and into the main hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO interior of main hall. Sound of busy preparations. MEN setting up huge hogsheads of wine. MEN putting up last minute flower arrangements. COOKS bearing huge trays of food, pies, suckling pigs, a swan, boar's head, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BRIDE being dressed by several ATTENDANTS. FATHER ordering SERVANTS around - organizing the STEWARDS etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIR LAUNCELOT bursts through the middle of them, slashing heroically, hacking, wounding and killing. Again fairly CLOSE-UP chaotic SHOTS. We see GUESTS stagger back wounded - a COOK bites the dust, etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SIR LAUNCELOT eventually reaches the staircase ... runs up it and into a small door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INTERIOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO SIR LAUNCELOT running up spiral staircase. He reaches the door of the PRINCE's room. he flings it open.

SIR LAUNCELOT runs to the window and kneels down in front of the PRINCE, averting his head.

Sitting on the throne on a dais is KING BRIAN THE WILD. He is roaring with roaring with laughter. and his court is slightly shabby - bearing all the marks of a faded richness. it is a court without women, and nobody does the washing or shaves very well. perhaps there is washing however on the line over the castle. KING BRIAN'S ADVISERS stand around him. Everyone bears the signs of past injuries (Except for BRIAN himself) I.E. they have an arm in a sling or head bandaged; all the people at court, except for BRIAN have their left arm missing (possibly the result of some violent edict a few years back)

The KNIGHTS register delight and wheel round on themselves.
</DIRECTION>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But follow only if you are men of valour. For the entrance to this cave is guarded by a monster, a creature so foul and cruel that no man yet has fought with it and lived. Bones of full fifty men lie strewn about its lair ... therefore sweet knights if you may doubt your strength or courage come no further, for death awaits you all with nasty pointy teeth.

EXTERIOR - DAY

CUT TO impressive rock face with caves in it. The KNIGHTS are 'riding' towards it. A foreboding atmosphere supervenes. TIM gives a signal for quietness. ARTHUR shushes the 'horses'.

<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shhh!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
The PAGES decrease the amount of noise they are making with the coconuts for a few seconds. Then there is a burst of noise from them including whinnying.

TIM takes a strange look at them. They walk on leaving the PAGES behind. After a few more strides TIM halts them with a sign.
</DIRECTION>
<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Behold the Cave of Caerbannog!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO shot of cave. Bones littered around. The KNIGHTS get the wind up partially. A little dry ice, glowing green can be seen at the entrance. Suddenly we become aware of total silence. Any noises the KNIGHTS make sound very exaggerated. They unsheathe their swords.

They all turn,, and see a large white RABBIT lollop a few yards out of the cave. Accompanied by terrifying chord and jarring metallic monster noise.

<TIM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TIM>
<DIRECTION>
As TIM points they all spin round to see the RABBIT leap at BORS' throat with an appalling scream. From a distance of about twenty feet there is a tin opening noise, a cry from BORS. A quick CLOSE-UP of a savage RABBIT biting through tin and BORS' head flies off. The RABBIT leaps back to the mouth of the cave and sits there looking in the KNIGHTS' direction and growling menacingly.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>

They all charge with swords drawn towards the RABBIT. A tremendous twenty second fight with Peckinpahish shots and borrowing heavily also on the Kung Fu and karate-type films ensues, in which some four KNIGHTS are comprehensively killed.

Slight pause. Then from the area where the 'HORSES' are, a small group of MONKS process forward towards the KNIGHTS, the leading MONK bearing and ornate golden reliquary, and the accompanying MONKS chanting and waving incense. They reach the KNIGHTS. The hand grenade is suffused with the holy glow.

<DIRECTION>
EXTERIOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The KNIGHTS emerge from the mouth of the cave to find themselves in a breathtaking, barren landscape. Glencoe. They are half they way up the side of a mountain. They rest a few seconds and get their breath back.
</DIRECTION>
<GALAHAD>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<DIRECTION>
They look and see on the side of the mountain there is a sort of milestone which bears the words: "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! 5 miles" and an arrow.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God be praised. This must be the gorge of which the old man spoke in scene twenty-four.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
The KNIGHTS set off along and rather perilous track edging along the side of the mountain. GALAHAD is leading.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MIX THROUGH they are climbing higher. The path gets more and more slippery and dangerous. They reach another milestone which says: "Aaaaarrrrrrggghhh! 4 miles" and an arrow, and "Ni! 82 miles" and an arrow pointing in the opposite direction. They go on. It is dangerous and difficult. Tension in their faces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As they are climbing, BEDEVERE turns to ROBIN and ARTHUR.
</DIRECTION>
<BEDEVERE>

EXTERIOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO them struggling along. Perhaps downhill now. It is growing misty. SIR LAUNCELOT stops them and points. They peer.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO see in the mist ... a weird bridge with mist swirling up from the gorge below. We cannot see the other side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beside the bridge an OLD MAN stands, he is the blind soothsayer they met earlier in the forest.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
(to BEDEVERE)

	He's the Keeper of the Bridge. It's the old man.

ARTHUR restrains him.

<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>

<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good luck, brave Sir Launcelot! Be careful ...

They shake hands, Arthur's eyes moisten. LAUNCELOT approaches the Bridge of Death.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to the questions.

</ARTHUR>
<BEDEVERE>
	<DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>
<BRIDGEKEEPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIDGEKEEPER>
<DIRECTION>
SIR LAUNCELOT stops. The KNIGHTS watch anxiously. ARTHUR sniffs briefly and glances momentarily down at SIR ROBIN's lower armour.
</DIRECTION>
<BRIDGEKEEPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who approaches the Bridge of Death Must answer me These questions three! Ere the other side he see.

<BRIDGEKEEPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right. Off you go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRIDGEKEEPER>
<DIRECTION>
SIR LAUNCELOT runs across into the mist. The bridge perhaps disappears into the mist and we cannot see the other side. ARTHUR and SIR ROBIN exchange glances. ROBIN breathes a great sigh of relief.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>

	That's easy!

EXTERIOR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO SIR LAUNCELOT who is only just arriving on the other side. He looks back across the invisible chasm. Dimly in the distance he hears:

SIR LAUNCELOT stands on the other side of the bridge. In the distance we hear the ritual of questions and then a scream and thud, suddenly a hand lands on LAUNCELOT's shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<POLICEMAN>

(VOICE OVER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Well you have to know these things when you're a king, you know.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly they appear at water's edge. They look across the water. A huge expanse disappearing into the mist. How can they cross?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the air is filled with ethereal music, and out of the mist appears a wonderful barge silently and slowly drifting towards them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They gaze in wonder. The mysterious boat comes to where they are standing. As if bewitched, they find themselves drawing closer to the boat. As they are about to step in, a ragged figure looks up at them.
</DIRECTION>
<BOATKEEPER>
<DIRECTION>
(he is the same as the BRIDGEKEEPER and the SOOTHSAYER)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He who would cross the Sea if Fate must answer me these questions twenty-eight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOATKEEPER>
<DIRECTION>
He fixes them with a baleful eye, ARTHUR and BEDEVERE exchange glances, then turn, with minds made up, pick him up bodily and throw him in the water. They climb into the boat and the boat moves off into the mist
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE OUT

A wondrous journey in animation carries them across the lake.

EXTERIOR - DAY

The boat carries them across a magical lake. They land and get out of the boat, their faces suffused with heavenly radiance, and fall to their knees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crescendo on music.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	God be praised! The deaths of many find knights have this day been avenged.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
Music swells. They bend their heads in prayer, before the castle for which they have searched for so long. Suddenly a voice comes from the battlements.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Music cuts dead.
</DIRECTION>
<FROG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha ha! Hello! Smelly English K...niggets ... and Monsieur Arthur King, who has the brain of a duck, you know.

The KNIGHTS look up.

<FROG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We French persons outwit you a second time, perfidious English mousedropping hoarders ... how you say: "Begorrah!"

</FROG>
<DIRECTION>
ARTHUR stands and shouts.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How dare you profane this place with your presence! I command you, in the name of the Knights of Camelot, open the door to the Sacred Castle, to which God himself has guided us!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come.

</ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
ARTHUR and the KNIGHTS advance towards the castle.
</DIRECTION>
<FROG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How you English say: I one more time, mac, I unclog my nose towards you, sons of a window-dresser, so, you think you could out-clever us French fellows with your silly knees-bent creeping about advancing behaviour.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I wave my private parts at your aunties, you brightly-coloured, mealy-templed, cranberry-smelling, electric donkey-bottom biters.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FROG>
<DIRECTION>
By this time ARTHUR and BEDEVERE and GALAHAD have reached the door. ARTHUR bangs on the door.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the name of the Lord, we demand entrance to this sacred castle.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
Jeering from the battlements.
</DIRECTION>
<FROG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No chance, English bed-wetting types. We burst our pimples at you, and call your door-opening request a silly thing. You tiny-brained wipers of other people's bottoms!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FROG>
<DIRECTION>
French laughter
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you do not open these doors, we will take this castle by force ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
A bucket of slops land on ARTHUR. He tries to retain his dignity.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In the name of God ... and the glory of our ...
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
Another bucket of what can only be described as human ordure hits ARTHUR.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Right!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to the KNIGHTS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That settles it!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
They turn and walk away. French jeering follows them.
</DIRECTION>
<FROG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, depart a lot at this time, and cut the approaching any more or we fire arrows into the tops of your heads and make castanets of your testicles already.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FROG>
<ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
(to KNIGHTS)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walk away. Just ignore them.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
ARTHUR, BEDEVERE and GALAHAD walk off. A small hail of chickens, watercress, badgers and mattresses follows them. But they are on their dignity as they try to talk nonchalantly as they walk away into the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<FROG>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now remain gone, illegitimate-faced bugger-folk! And, if you think you got a nasty time this taunting, you ain't heard nothing yet, dappy k...niggets, and A. King Esquire.

CUT BACK TO the drenched BRIDGEKEEPER/SOOTHSAYER beside the lake He rises up into SHOT.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stand by for attack!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</BEDEVERE>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO enormous army forming up. Trebuchets, rows of PIKEMEN, siege towers, pennants flying, shouts of "Stand by for attack!" Traditional army build-up shots. The shouts echo across the ranks of the army. We see various groups reacting, and stirring themselves in readiness.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who are they?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<BEDEVERE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, just some friends!

</BEDEVERE>
<DIRECTION>
We end up back with ARTHUR. He seems satisfied that the ARMY is ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PANNING down the serried ranks, pikes ready, pennants flapping in the wind. Some of the horses whinny nervously, and rattle their coconuts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ARTHUR is satisfied at last. He addresses the castle.
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	French persons! Today the blood of many valiant knights shall bee avenged. In the name of God, we shall not stop our fight until each one of you lies dead and the Grail returns to those whom God has chosen.

ARTHUR lowers his visor, turns to have a last look at ARMY, then:
</DIRECTION>
<ARTHUR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	CHARGE!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ARTHUR>
<DIRECTION>
The mighty ARMY charges. Thundering noise of feet. Clatter of coconuts. Shouts etc.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The charge towards the castle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly there is a wail of a siren and a couple of police cars roar round in front of the charging ARMY and the POLICE leap out and stop them. TWO POLICEMAN and the HISTORIAN'S WIFE. Black Marias skid up behind them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ARMY halts.

SIR BEDEVERE is led off with a blanket over his head. They are bundled into the black maria and the van drives off.

The rest of the ARMY stand around looking at a loss.

A few reaction shots of the ARMY not quite sure what to do.

	</DIALOGUE>
</INSPECTOR_END_OF_FILM>

	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, put that away sonny.
	</DIALOGUE>
</INSPECTOR_END_OF_FILM>
<DIRECTION>
He walks over to it and puts his hand over the lens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The film runs out through the gate and the projector shines on the screen.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a blank screen for some fifteen seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly jazzy music. Animated titles. (A new film completely free with the Monty Python film.)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
"THE CREDITS".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Four or five minute film (mainly animated) about the credits, i.e it includes the actual credits for the film but is really elaborate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slushy organ music starts and the houselights in the cinema come on ... organ music continues as the audience leave.
