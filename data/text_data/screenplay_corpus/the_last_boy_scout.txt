You wanna be a detective? Here's what you do: Take a trusted friend, and imagine the worst thing, the most despicable thing, the thing it would never even cross their minds to do. Then assume they've already done it twice. Joseph R. Hallenbeck, Private Investigator.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
When you consider that a career in pro foot- ball means maybe ten years, after which you got no legs left, and during which you're a painkiller drug addict, a million a year sounds about right. So when people bitch at me about the money I made, I have a pat response: Go fuck yourself. James Alexander Dix, Former quarterback, L.A. Stallions.

INT. DARK BEDROOM The only light, that of a flickering TV screen. A big MAN lies, shirtless, on the bed. Watching a sports program. We hear:

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eliminating the draft? Worst thing ever happened to pro football. Already you got Eric Dickerson, no team's good enough for him... You got Dion Sanders, this guy, Bosworth, bunch of peacocks. Nagurski, I saw him play for 25 bucks a game. And he woulda played for free, you get me? He loved the game. Nowadays? Forget about it.

	Kid from Ohio is looking real good, Billie...

The Man's hand unclenches. A container of pills spills over the blanket. He stammers:

The PHONE CLICKS off. NFL running back Billy Cole stares straight ahead, mouth working spastically. CUT TO:

AERIAL SHOT - SNOWSTORM OVER Chicago, Illinois, as the CAMERA SPIRALS DOWN TOWARD a teeming football stadium. We hear crowd noise and marching band music, deafeningly loud, as we SUPERIMPOSE the legend:
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	SOLDIER FIELD, CHICAGO NOVEMBER 14
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ANNOUNCER'S BOOTH The BROADCAST TEAM huddles inside the quilted jackets, squinting through the snow. Speaking into headset mikes.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good afternoon and welcome to Soldier Field, Chicago, site of today's confrontation between the L.A. Stallions and the Chicago Bears. This is Vern Lindquist with Terry Bradshaw, and, yes, my friends, it is that cold.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME TIME Billy Cole sits, alone, in front of his locker. Eyes glazed. Face bathed in sweat. He takes a bottle of pills from the locker. Pops three. Hisses a stream of air through his teeth as we -- CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY (FOURTH QUARTER) A deafening CRUNCH as a defensive back hammers a wide receiver, nearly decapitates him. The ball rolls free. The back recovers it.
</DIRECTION>
<ANNOUNCER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... Big Ray Walton puts a devastating hit on Bricmont, so Chicago turns over the ball with a minute and forty seconds left.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SIDELINES - SAME TIME The injured player goes by on a stretcher, moaning. Cheerleaders jump and frolic.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BILLY COLE gets up off the bench. The rest of the offensive unit sprints onto the field. Cole walks. Straight ahead, eyes front. Like a robot. His HEARTBEAT THUDS on the soundtrack.
</DIRECTION>
<COLOR_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And so L.A. has a chance to ice the game, no pun intended... And you gotta be thinking, give the ball to Billy Cole. He has had an outstanding day, racking up 138 yards against a tough defense.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
DOWN ON FIELD The huddle breaks. The L.A. team trudges through the snow to the line of scrimmage. Cole adopts a three-point stance. Everything happens in hyper-real SLOW MOTION: The snow falls. The receivers breeze past, in motion to begin their patterns. Moving like gazelles. Cole's fingers paw the cold earth. Gouging it. He is like a spring. Coiled and ready. The ball is snapped. Turf and snow. Erupting. A firecracker series of POPS as linemen collide. Legs churning.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ball floats through the snowy air. Pitch-out to Cole. He takes it on the run. Tucks it under his arm. Behind him, the quarterback bites the dust, leveled. Cole turns the corner. Picks up a blocker. Feet pounding. Arms pumping. Up ahead, the free safety barrels toward him. Low and hard. Cole does not blink. He reaches beneath his jersey. Pulls out a GUN. Pumps THREE SHOTS into the free safety's head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The bullets go straight through. On the back of his helmet. A mixture of blood and fiberglass. Cole keeps going, jogging for the end zone. Around him, sound. Fury. Impact. Confusion. Another defensive back. Straight ahead. Reacts with almost comical terror. Dives to one side. Cole FIRES. Blows out the guy's knee. Ends a career. Keeps going. We are now in full-scale panic. The players are fleeing the field. Shouts. Pandemonium. A few brave men gather around the fallen players.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POLICE are on the field now. Running full out. They've got riot guns, cocked and locked. Sprinting through the snow. Cole crosses the goal line. Touchdown. Drops the ball. Turns, facing the cops. His eyes are insane. The crowd is screaming. People are running back and forth like extras in the Keystone Cops. The first TWO BLASTS from the cops' RIOT GUNS go high and wide. One SHOT BLOWS APART the base of the goalpost. The forty-foot-high monument pitches over, collapsing like a wounded giant. Lands in a shower of snow and ice. Cole is oblivious to the bars crashing around him. He smiles and says:
</DIRECTION>
<COLE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm going to Disneyland...

Puts the GUN to his helmet. FIRES. CUT TO:

EXT. L.A. STREET - IN SHADOW OF FREEWAY - MORNING We SUPERIMPOSE the legend: WEST LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA DECEMBER 20. Good morning, Mr. and Mrs. America, and all the ships at sea. Welcome to another lackluster morning in Southern California. Palm trees limp. Windless silence. 80 degrees at 8:00 AM. CAMERA CRANES DOWN PAST a huge, rotting billboard. On the billboard, a girl in tight jeans. Grabbing her own butt. A surprised look on her face. Yes, honey, that's your butt. MOVE IN ON a tiny, weather-beaten bungalow. In the shadow of the 405 Freeway. A shingle hangs from a wrought iron post: JOSEPH R. HALLENBECK, CONFIDENTIAL INVESTIGATIONS. On the lawn, a late-model Plymouth. The sprinkers come to life. Fling water across the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE Inside the car, a lone man is asleep, arms akimbo. Sprawled across the seat. Half-empty bottle of Seagrams V.O. RADIO on, playing tinny JAZZ music. Picture the tiredest, meanest, grouchiest son of a bitch self-hating loser you can. Now give him a two-year-old suit from C & R Clothing. Such is the aforementioned HALLENBECK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE THREE neighborhood KIDS have gathered around the car. Enjoying the spectacle of a sleeping drunk. One tosses a baseball from hand to hand. One picks his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<KID_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dude's trashed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<KID_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, we should do something to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Kid #3 continues mining for nose eggs. It looks like his entire fist is up there. Pause, then:
</DIRECTION>
<KID_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know where there's a dead squirrel.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KID_1>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - BUNDLE OF PAPER TOWELS - SOME MINUTES LATER with a tail sticking out. The youngest Kid holds it aloft reverently. Looks in the open car window at Hallenbeck. Still snoozing. Dead to the world.
</DIRECTION>
<KID_1>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They heave the squirrel into the car and run away. A pause. Another pause. The sprinkler goes round. Nothing happens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE Hallenbeck snores. The mashed squirrel perches on his chest. A shadow falls across him as --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KIDS return, scratching their heads. Staring in at him.
</DIRECTION>
<KID_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn. Dude's trashed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<KID_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take his bottle.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Kid #1 smiles nervously. Reaches in with infinite patience. Trembling hand inches closer and closer -- And closes on the bottle as, without warning --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HALLENBECK sits bolt upright and grabs the Kid and stuffs a .38 revolver in the Kid's face and cocks it.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, motherfucker.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Kid, of course, shrieks. And the light of sanity dawns in Hallenbeck's eyes. He sucks in a deep breath. Releases the struggling Kid. Swears under his breath. Watches the boys flee in terror. Notices a dead squirrel in his lap. Scowls. Heaves it out the window. Pumps a Camel into his mouth. Lights it. Rescues the bottle of Seagrams.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thus begins his morning. He opens the car door. The sprinkler douses him. He gets out. Stands on the lawn. One of the Kids, the toughest one, is standing on the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<KID_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not scared.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck scowls.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're on my property, kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
<KID_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sidewalk belongs to the government.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck stares at him. Smiles weakly.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He leans over and vomits on the lawn. One hand gripping the car fender. The sprinkler goes round and round.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MALIBU BEACH FRONT - MORNING A redwood beach house, mellow in the morning sun. There was a party here last night. Banners. Balloons and streamers. Tawdry in the light of day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEACH HOUSE - SAME TIME A plush bedroom. Sun streams in the window. A YOUNG MAN sits, straddling a backwards chair. Bare- foot, bare-chested. Blond hair, perfect tan. He is nursing a beer. Smoking and staring at --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BED where a tawny golden girl lies, serene and innocent. Like a sleeping kitten. Rumpled sheets, one breast exposed. No tan line. The man takes a drag off the cigarette, studies the sleeping girl. Meet Jimmy Dix. Twenty-seven years old, former National League heartthrob. He shakes his head and mutters:
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(YOUNG MAN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, kid, if only you weren't so damn ugly.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up and goes into the head. Pulls out a glass vial. Dips a coke spoon with practiced ease. Sucks it up a nostril. For one moment, he catches his own eye in the mirror. FLASH CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FLASHBACK - FOOTBALL FIELD Seventy thousand people screaming. Jimmy in the middle. Younger Jimmy. Fresher Jimmy. It's a night game at the Coliseum. He's the quarterback. The snap. Jimmy fakes the draw. Rolls right. Around him, all is impact. Sound and fury. He targets a receiver and unleashes a rocket. Sixty- yard toss, hits the guy between the numbers.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIMMY'S FACE Covered with dirt and mud. Blood, too. Young and proud. Seventy thousand voices tell him he's alive. He makes a difference.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO PRESENT Alone in the bathroom... leaning on the counter. Head down. A voice calls softly from the bedroom:
</DIRECTION>
<SLEEPY_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jimmy, are you still here...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pause, then:
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks up at his reflection. Glazed eyes, beard stubble. Crows' feet around the eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I guess I am.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He sniffs, clearing his nose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WEST L.A. BUNGALOW - MORNING Hallenbeck opens the door and shambles in. Dark. Depressing. Sprawl of furniture. Stack after stack of sports magazines. Drop all your belongings out of a plane. They will land like this. He flicks on the light. Crosses to the couch and flops down. Plucks a bottle of aspirin from an end table. Next to the bottle, we see --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS side by side. In one, younger Hallenbeck is kissing younger bride. Smiling. In the other, the President of the United States presents Hallenbeck with a medal. They are both smiling beneath the Presidential Seal.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE Hallenbeck scowls and chews three aspirin. Swallows. The PHONE RINGS. He groans. Chain-lights another smoke, stubs out his old one. Chins the receiver and says:

	<DIALOGUE>
	Terrific. And, Joe, big favor, okay? Try to... fix yourself up, if you can manage it. Look the part. Not like the last time, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck catches his reflection in the mirror over the TV. His face is ashen grey. Hollow eye sockets. Blotchy skin.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gimmee the address.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MALE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUNGALOW - MORNING Hallenbeck emerges into the blinding glare. His tie is crooked. His cuffs are too short. He looks like a grouchy bear. He looks up at the girl on the billboard.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Morning, gorgeous.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Gorgeous does not respond: Coy. Very coy. Hallenbeck slides behind the wheel of his Plymouth. KEYS the IGNITION. Phil Woods' SAXOPHONE fills the air. He looks at himself in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nobody likes you. Everybody hates you. You're an asshole and you're stupid. You're gonna lose.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(pause)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smile, you fuck.

He stretches his mouth into a grimace. Pulls out into the street. Off he goes. CUT TO:

INT. MALIBU BEACH HOUSE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy Dix leaves the bedroom. Pads barefoot down a hall littered with beer cans, food wrappers. A sleeping guy. Stops at a door, peeks in: all-night poker game in progress. Four bleary-eyed men. Unshaven. Stack of wrinkled money on a card table.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Morning, boys.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They all grunt. One of them, name of HENRY, looks up at him. Holds out a half-smoked doobie:
</DIRECTION>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Jimmy. You want some of this?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, man. Why do you think they call it dope?

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Henry, did I do anything last night that I should know about?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HENRY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You puked a couple times. Pointed at some lady's tits. Chased a dog for a half an hour. Fucked a congressman's daughter, shit on someone's car.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, man, I meant something bad, that I should know about.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HENRY>

	Mmmm. Nope.

Everyone plays cards. No one looks at him. He frowns. Leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER Jimmy is seated in the devastated living room. Putting on shoes. He hears a COMMOTION outside: A woman scream- ing. Water splashing. He frowns, puzzled. Gets up. Pads out onto a redwood deck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. REDWOOD DECK - SAME A six-foot behemoth is seated in a jacuzzi at the far end of the deck. He is dunking a terrified female head under the water and laughing. Jimmy clears his throat.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ho. Ray.

The MAN looks up, annoyed.

<JIMMY>

She surfaces, sputtering and screaming. Ray thrusts her beneath the surface again.

<RAY>

	Bitch won't blow me.

<JIMMY>

(pause, then)

	Too early in the morning, Ray. Let her go.

<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you. She's not coming up till she starts blowing.

Jimmy swallows hard. Says:

<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ray. Let her go.
	</DIALOGUE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you, loser. What are you doing at a league party, asshole? You and ol' Dex Manley should get together, swap stories about gettin' booted.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy controls himself with an effort.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ray, she's gonna drown.
	</DIALOGUE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not if she blows me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's eyes are smoldering. He steps to the right. Casually scoops up a football lying on the deck.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Last chance, Ray.
	</DIALOGUE>
<RAY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go spit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy turns, as if to walk away. Instead, he spins back and launches the football. It sings, that's how hard he throws it. And when it smacks Ray in the face, something breaks. It ain't the ball. The big man howls. Clutching his flattened nose. The girl comes up for air. Gagging and choking. Jimmy is at her side instantly. Pulls her out of the water.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get out of here. Go.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She goes. He leans over and grabs Ray by the hair. The guy is bleeding. Delirious. Jimmy yanks until their faces are inches apart.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Best arm in the National League, you son of a bitch. Remember that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He lets go. Ray sags, semi-conscious. The poker players come running as Jimmy walks back inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COAST HIGHWAY - DAY Jimmy gets into the car. Takes out his vial. Spoons some powder, sucks it up. A voice in the background: "Hey, someone shit on my car!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY Joe Hallenbeck slides his Plymouth to the curb in front of a cozy stucco dwelling. Gets out, crosses the lawn. A fat NEIGHBOR is watering shrubs next door. He waves.
</DIRECTION>
<NEIGHBOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Morning, Joe, how's it going?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My ears are burning, Andy. Even as we speak, someone, somewhere is calling me an asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
<NEIGHBOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're funny.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm playing Tahoe on the 15th.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLENBECK'S HOUSE - SAME TIME Hallenbeck enters and crosses the living room. A woman, forty-ish, once beautiful, appears in the bedroom doorway. Wearing a terry cloth robe. This is Joe's wife SARAH.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I thought you were in Las Vegas.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where did you sleep?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Office.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He brushes past her and crosses to the bed. On the pillow, a big stuffed cat toy smiles benignly.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Furry Tom.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He sits on the bed. Lights a cigarette. Opens the night stand and removes a speedloader for his .38. Starts to load the gun.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much did you lose?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't there to gamble. I was doing a skip trace.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much did you lose?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fifty bucks.
	</DIALOGUE>

He suddenly notices a sheet of paper on the night stand. A crayon sketch. He picks it up, frowns:
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's this?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darian's class drew holiday pictures. That was hers. Her teacher wants to see us, Joe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE ON DRAWING It's a picture of Santa Claus, except this Santa has long, stringy hair, bloodshot eyes, and grotesque talons. A little girl's severed head is clutched in one hand. Underneath, in block capitals, is written: SATAN CLAUS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Satan Claus. Kid's got some talent, don't you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's hideous.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Her voice is ice cold. Joe turns and regards her levelly.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You okay, Sarah...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm tense. I couldn't get to sleep last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmmmm. Well, I think the kid will be fine. Boys still tease her about the headgear?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you kidding? Brace Face, that's the latest. Little bastards.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(under his breath)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She'll be fucking them by the time she's fourteen.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Watch your Goddamn mouth, Joe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Christ, you let her wear enough makeup. The kid looks like a goddamn raccoon. She comes in late at night, I think, 'Christ, a burglar.' I almost shot her twice.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not funny. All the girls at that school wear makeup.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, but they don't apply it with a paint sprayer. And for your information, our neighbors think I'm very funny.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go live with them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't tempt me.

He tosses the holstered .38 on the bed. Stalks into the bathroom.

INT. BATHROOM

<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn raccoon.

<DIRECTION>
He sighs, tosses his cigarette butt in the toilet. Walks back out into the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM He kneels, looks under the bed. Frowns. Straightens and says, very conversationally:
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's the guy in the closet?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah stops dead. Spins and stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(frowns)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, that's right, you sometimes forget that I'm a detective.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(lights a cigarette)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, first I noticed how tense you were, but I let that pass. Then I noticed there was steam in the shower like someone was just in there, but meanwhile your hair is completely dry, you follow? So. Why the steamy shower Because someone else was in there, right, and since he's not under the bed you must have stuck him in the closet when you heard my key in the door a day early. Tah-dah. Please, no applause.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A silence hangs between them. Sarah just stares. Shakes her head.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, nothing changes. You're still a lunatic.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmmmm. I'm sorry, honey, I don't enjoy being observant, but someone's gotta do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's his name?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please leave. I have to get dressed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's okay, I've seen you naked. So, apparently, has someone else. What's his name?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want me to open the closet, Joe? Huh? You want me to indulge your fucking paranoia, I'll throw the door open, is that what you want me to do...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this a trick question?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll do it, Joe. Okay? And then we'll both know you're a psycho, is that what you want? Huh??
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
An awkward pause. Finally Hallenbeck scowls and says:
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. We won't open the door.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope. Door stays shut. Instead, what I'm gonna do is...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(he scoops up the .38)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I'm gonna count to three, and then I'm gonna put a bullet in there, and you can stop me anytime by speaking the truth. One.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you shoot up my house, Joe, I will make you eat that gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Two. The truth is a beautiful thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He cocks the hammer. Arm extended, hand rock steady.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call your shrink, Joe. I still have the number. Call him and tell him you're losing it, I cannot fucking deal with you like this -- !
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Three. Last chance.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe, dammit -- !
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He sighs. Starts to pull the trigger. And Sarah screams --
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, no -- !
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And grabs the gun. Everything freezes. She looks at him. He looks at her. Understanding occurs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSET DOOR swings slowly open, then... And out steps a man in a bathrobe. Compact. Wiry. Hair still soaking wet. None other than MIKE MILLER, Joe's early morning phone call. We know this because Joe says:
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Mike. Keeping her warm for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The gun barrel does not waver. Not an inch.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy, Joe. Don't do nothing dumb.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How as she, Mike? On your finger scale, how was my wife...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It just happened, Joe. It just happened.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You call me from here this morning?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She said you were in Vegas. I was gonna leave a message on the machine.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you found out I was back. Why didn't you split?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She said relax, he never stops home once he's in the office.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Normally I wouldn't.

<MILLER>
<DIRECTION>
(stares at him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You knew?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suspected. So how about it, Mike? On a scale of one to ten. How was she?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe, come on, how long we been friends, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How long? Mmm. I'd say roughly until you put your dick in my wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<MILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You gotta understand --
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I know, I know, it just happened. It was an accident. Sure. You tripped. You said, 'Whoops,' and accidentally fucked my wife. Gee, Mrs. H., I'm sorry, just isn't my week. Sure, Mike. Happen to anybody.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't gotta understand anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah speaks then. Head down. Eyes averted.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Put the gun down.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hmmm? Oh, right, the gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right, Sarah, I'm acting nuts.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls the trigger. The SHOT is DEAFENING in the closed room. Mike Miller screams and clutches at himself. The bullet goes high and wide. Over his head. On the wall is a framed wedding photo. The twin of the one in Hallenbeck's office. The bullet strikes it dead center. Blows it to pieces. Silence. The tinkle of glass hitting the floor. Hallenbeck turns. Regards his wife with hooded, lifeless eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where was Darian?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She stayed at Cindy's last night.

He nods. Turns and waves the gun at Miller.

<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's take a walk, Buddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SARAH>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY The two men come out the back door and cut through the hedge.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Miller's car, a Pontiac Sunbird, is parked at the curb. Hallenbeck stops in the middle of someone's yard. Holsters his gun. A neighbor's dog approaches, happily wagging its tail. Hallenbeck bends and ruffles its fur.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where you want it, Mike? Head or gut?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen, Joe, I --
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(stops, sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gut.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck pats the dog. Straightens. Plants his back foot and spins. Punches like a sledgehammer, into Miller's gut. Miller drops to his knees. Begins to retch. Hallenbeck takes out a cigarette. Lights it.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I see you again, I'll kill you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Miller nods weakly. Gasping for breath.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. West Hollywood at seven, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The job. Seven o'clock, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You still... want the job...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's two hundred bucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I guess it is.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He climbs to his feet, still doubled over.
</DIRECTION>
<MILLER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Joe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck says nothing. Miller turns and stumbles to his car. Hallenbeck's face betrays nothing. A dead mask. He walks back toward the hedge. The neighbor's dog runs up, a tennis ball in its mouth. Behind him, Mike Miller gets into the Sunbird. Hallenbeck takes the tennis ball. Throws it. The DOG BARKS and bounds after it. Mike Miller turns the key in the ignition. The CAR BLOWS to pieces. An ERUPTION OF FLAME. Flying glass and metal. The car becomes airborne. Engulfed in fire. Does a lazy spin. Comes down. The shockwave catches Hallenbeck. Slams him ass over teacups. Windows blow in up and down the street. Smoke and fire roll to the sky. The DOG cowers, HOWLING in fear. Beside it on the grass, the tennis ball is on fire. Hallenbeck rolls to his feet. Covered with twigs and leaves. Clothing scorched. Stares. Eyes glazed. CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - AN HOUR LATER A mobile crane hoists what's left of Mike Miller and his Pontiac. Policemen direct traffic, curb bystanders.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
OFF TO ONE SIDE a UNIFORM COP questions Hallenbeck and Sarah, who stand stiffly. Not looking at each other.
</DIRECTION>
<UNIFORM_COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did Mr. Miller visit your home this morning, Mr. Hallenbeck?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe lies easily:
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He came by to talk business. He had a case he was to busy to continue with, a routine surveillance. He farmed it out to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<UNIFORM_COP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see. Is that all you talked about?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. That's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks the Officer in the eye. Betrays nothing.

CUT TO:

<DIRECTION>
NAKED, GYRATING BODY Female, for the record. Signaling us that we are now:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. "BOTTOMLESS PIT" CLUB - NIGHT Rowdy strip club in West Hollywood. Just like the name suggests; if it's a virus, you're sitting on it. After three drinks, every girl on stage looks like your high school sweetheart. Was your sweetheart fat? Did she have excessive body hair? FUNK MUSIC, played LOUD. The Monday crowd stomps and claps. Onstage a stripper grinds away with an enthusiasm usually reserved for standing in line at the DMV. Jimmy Dix sits at the bar, hooting and whistling. Behind the bar, a black man in a wheelchair serves drinks. His name is HARP. Off to one side, a twenty-five-year-old BEANPOLE speaks into a microphone:

	<DIALOGUE>
	Flash of green buys a flash of pink, gentlemen. So reach into your pockets if you aren't there already, and reward the lovely and talented Ms. Vixen...!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The black man shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<HARP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My son. He writes his own material, he's proud of that. Some people are proud, they cured leukemia. Old guy stops beating off long enough to laugh, my son thinks he's Eddie Murphy.

Jimmy uncaps a beer and raises it in a toast.

Harp raises his own glass.

<HARP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alex the astronaut.
	</DIALOGUE>

It seems to be a common ritual between them. Jimmy drinks, thumps the bottle down. Says, resolutely:
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've had it, Harp.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Had what?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It, man. I've had it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(takes a swig)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't remember what I did last night. I'm an idiot, Harp, I act like a complete dickhead. I don't have friends. I drink too much. I fuck anything that's warm and breathing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HARP>
<HARP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay on that side of the bar.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I cheated on my girl friend again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You cheated on her? You must be crazy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe so, Harp. Maybe so.

<DIRECTION>
His gaze wanders across the crowded room, fixating on --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCANTILY-CLAD WAITRESS Who makes her way between the tables. She is beautiful. Stands out like a teamster at a gay rights rally. Supple body. Deep green eyes. Flaxen hair. Her name is CORY. She stops at a table against the wall. Puts down a Seagrams V.O. in a rocks glass. Seated at the table is a broad-shouldered man in a bad suit. The essence of boredom. Looks like he's been there three days. A cloud of smoke hangs around his head. Mr. Joe Hallenbeck, no less.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The police won't help you, huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. After I'm dead they'll perform the autopsy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess you don't want to wait that long.

<CORY>

	Guess not.

	Pat Boone? The Four Freshmen?

<CORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you, my father?

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, I'm your father. Get your clothes on.

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hate this funk shit. It's gonna be an extra hundred bucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're hilarious. Sit next to the speaker, you'll get used to it. After a while you'll be screaming play that funky music white boy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The screaming part I believe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles and moves away. Hallenbeck sips his drink. Scans the crowd with shrewd eyes.

ANOTHER ANGLE The lovely Cory approaches Jimmy at the bar. Harp looks on.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, handsome. How'd you like to buy me a bottle of champagne?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much for a bottle?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forty dollars.

<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thanks. Nothing personal, my seventh grade teacher was killed by a drunk driver.

<CORY>

	Tall guy? Sandy hair?

<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's the one.

</JIMMY>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ha-ha.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So no bottle, then?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For forty bucks I'd rather drink my own piss.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's extra.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And with that, she leans over and moulds her lips to his. Time passes. These two know each other, it would seem. Cory pulls away. Jimmy smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi, Cory. Rough night?

She slaps his face. He feigns innocence. Points to Hallenbeck.

<JIMMY>

	Who's the stiff?

	He's nobody.

<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come back soon. I want to buy you a drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She smiles and moves off, swishingly. Jimmy watches her go. His gaze wanders across the room to Hallenbeck. He frowns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE Near the stage, the would-be Eddie Murphy steps up to the mike and says:
</DIRECTION>
<EMCEE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, crowd, these ladies are fine, but let me tell you the three reasons men prefer sheep: they're always in the mood, they never bitch, and after you fuck 'em you can eat 'em.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A few chuckles. Some coughs. More coughs than chuckles.
</DIRECTION>
<EMCEE>
<DIRECTION>
(plowing ahead)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now, here's a lady that's always in the mood, put your hands together for the lovely and talented Ms. Cory...!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Applause. A syncopated DRUM BEAT kicks in. AEROSMITH'S LATEST erupts from the SPEAKERS. And then she comes on. And even Joe Hallenbeck must draw in a sharp breath.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her body is exquisite. She moves like breath. Her eyes can put you under. She is simply that beautiful.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HALLENBECK sits with his drink untouched before him. Pats his suit pockets, searching for a smoke. Removes a crumpled, empty pack, as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIMMY DIX saunters up, looking less than friendly. He looks at Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck does not look at him.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi. You're nobody.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shhh. Don't tell anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's what Cory said. She said you were nobody.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Only Hallenbeck's eyes move. He looks up, regards Jimmy coolly. They size each other up. Hallenbeck sighs.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy, Junior, I'm not raining on your parade. She's too young for me. I'm just keeping an eye on her for a few days.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I see. What are you, some kind of bodyguard?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something like that. You got a cigarette?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Is Cory in trouble?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope not. You tell me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She didn't mention anything to me.

<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmmm. That bothers you, doesn't it?

</JIMMY>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe.

	She hired you, huh? What, you in the phonebook?

</JIMMY>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Actually, she hired my buddy Mike. I'm filling in.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where's Mike?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He died.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry to hear it.

<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't be. He was a lousy surveillance man.

<DIRECTION>
Jimmy leans forward, palms flat on the table.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, friend, I don't know who you are or what's going on. But Cory is my girl friend and if she's in trouble, I want to hear about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's client confidential.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me anyway.

<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope.

	I say two words to Cory and you don't get paid, asshole.

Jimmy throws a short jab at Hallenbeck's chin. It never gets there. Joe moves, lightning quick, and suddenly Jimmy's fist is trapped. Dead stops. Fingers grinding into palm. Jimmy swears. Stumbles. Sits down hard. Hallenbeck releases him.

INT. DINGY DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Cory and Jimmy are engaged in very hot sex. This is not a love scene; this is a sex scene. Sigh. I'm not even going to attempt to write this quote-unquote "steamy" scene here, for several good reasons: A) The things that I find steamy are none of your damn business, Jack, in addition to which -- B) The two actors involved will no doubt have wonderful, highly athletic ideas which manage to elude most fat-assed writers anyhow, and finally -- C) My mother reads this shit. So there. (P.S.: I think we lost her back at the Jacuzzi blowjob scene.)

INT. BACKSTAGE CORRIDOR - SAME TIME Joe Hallenbeck is pounding an already-dented cigarette machine. No dice. It has eaten his money. He shakes his head, muttering. Looks at his watch. Looks at the dressing room door. Shakes his head again. Walks to the end of the corridor. Goes through the fire door. Out into:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS ACTION Starry, moonlit night. A chill breeze. Joe draws a breath. In front of him, on the wall of the club, is a poster: BAYNARD FOR SENATE, it reads. Above the logo, a picture of a benevolent-looking gray-haired man. Hallenbeck regards it balefully.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I didn't vote for you, you bastard.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He looks away, and suddenly notices something on the ground: A half-smoked cigarette butt. Just sitting there. Joe stares at it. Thinks it over. Starts to walk away. Stops.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a fuckin' lowlife, Joe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He bends to pick up the butt. A steel sap whistles over his head, missing by inches. Hallenbeck spins, startled. Reflexively lashes out with a flattened palm. Misses, chops the air. Two more men, behind him. Nowhere to go. A sap pops him behind the left ear. A sickening thud. The world spins out of focus. He goes down. Hits the pavement like a ton of bricks. Rolls over, staring up. Vision muddy, indistinct.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HALLENBECK'S POV

Three silhouettes hover over him, backlit by streetlamps. Their voices are fuzzy.

	There's no contract for him.

<HITMAN_3>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then do it for free. Just do it elsewhere.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The men disperse. One of them drags Joe to his feet. A stocky, crag-faced man. He jams a silenced pistol in Joe's kidney and points him toward a vacant lot nearby.
</DIRECTION>
<HITMAN_2>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Start walking. I'm right behind you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE The two other Hitmen return to their gray, late-model sedan. Climb into the car and sit, watching the nightclub. Waiting.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. VACANT LOT - NIGHT A rusty chain-link fence separates the lot from the boule- vard. Choked with weeds. Broken glass. A rusted-out car. A towering billboard looms overhead, inviting people to drink Scotch or get laid, it's hard to tell. Hallenbeck staggers drunkenly across the lot. The crag-faced man follows behind him.

	Wrong place at the wrong time, buddy, that's all it is. Just want you to know it's nothing personal.

	Oh, you did, huh? How'd you know it was my wife?

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(the hitman loses it)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like the Pillsbury doughboy, except when you poke her in the stomach, she farts. I got a buddy he's an archaeologist, organized an expedition to her chin. They got lost in her nasal hair. But seriously, her eyes are like the streets of Paris: crossed. They're so crossed when she cries the tears run down her back. She's got back-tearia.

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
From a kneeling position, Hallenbeck flings a handful of gravel at the man's eyes. The man cries out. Stumbles backward. And Hallenbeck moves like a coiled spring. Not drunk at all. He takes the broken bottle he's been clutching and cuts the guy's throat like a knife through butter. The hitman stands with a shocked look on his face. Blood bubbling. FIRES the GUN once, into the ground. Drops it from nerve- less fingers. Stares at Hallenbeck, aghast.
</DIRECTION>
<CRAG_FACE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bastard.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck meets his gaze. A savage, feral gleam in his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then some.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The guy pitches over dead. Hallenbeck kneels beside him. Retrieves his .38, holsters it. Slips the hitman's pistol into his waistband.

EXT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT Cory and Jimmy emerge from the club into the parking lot. She scans the area, shaking her head.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.

He heads for his car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE The Hitmen wait in the darkened sedan. Watching Jimmy and Cory. The driver keys the ignition. Starts the car. In his lap is an automatic rifle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BOULEVARD - NIGHT Joe Hallenbeck is running full out. Headlong down the sidewalk. Gasping for breath.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Move!!

<DIRECTION>
He slams into a man. Knocks him flat. Groceries fly. Joe doesn't care. He stumbles. Keeps going.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. NIGHTTIME STREET - SAME TIME Jimmy Dix is behind the wheel of a silver Jag. Cory is driving a spanking new Ford Fiero. Jimmy follows behind Cory, watchdogging. Humming with JOE COCKER on the RADIO. Cory comes to a red light. Pauses. Turns right onto a sidestreet. Jimmy slows, pausing at the intersection.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GRAY SEDAN passes Jimmy. Accelerating. ENGINE REVVING. Jimmy only gets one glimpse into the passing car. It's enough: Everyone inside is armed to the teeth. The SEDAN ROARS around the corner, cutting in front of Jimmy.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh God. This is a hit this is a fucking hit!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
GRAY SEDAN comes up behind Cory. Comes up fast. Rams her car. Metal crumples. Meanwhile:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIMMY frantically floors the pedal of his Jag, pops the clutch -- And stalls out. He roars with anger. Flings open the door. Leaps out and runs forward, screaming:
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cory, get out of there!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Too late. Cory is already out of her car, yelling:
</DIRECTION>
<CORY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, can't you fucking drive??
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Her eyes go wide with shock. The Hitmen burst from their car. OPEN UP on full auto. Cory is cut down. Blown backward over the hood of her Ford. Flung to the street.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh Gooood!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And without missing a beat, the Hitmen turn -- And OPEN FIRE on Jimmy. He takes a running start. Clears the hood of his Jag in a single leap. BULLETS DICE the metal behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He lands, hard. Sucks the ground. Huddled behind his car, as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO HITMEN move toward him, triggering THREE SHOT BURSTS. The kid is dead meat. Or so it seems until, without warning --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOE HALLENBECK charges into the intersection. Screaming bloody murder. He's got a GUN in each fist, and both are BLAZING. One Hitman dies immediately: Dances like a puppet, racked by gunfire. Bullets go through him. SHATTER the sedan's WINDSHIELD.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The second Hitman turns and OPENS UP on Hallenbeck. Too late. Joe rolls behind a mailbox. BULLETS chase him, blowing apart the metal box. The Hitman swears. Turns, running for the sedan. He knows when a getaway is in order. Just one problem. He forgot about Jimmy Dix. A SCREECH of TIRES. As Jimmy's Jag slews around the corner, laying rubber. Rockets toward the Hitman, pins him in its headlights -- The Hitman screams as Jimmy plows through him -- And CRUNCHES into the gray sedan.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shatters the Hitman between the two cars... And holy Christ, the guy's still alive. Pinned like a butterfly, legs broken... He raises his rifle, screaming. Jimmy dives flat on the front seat. The WINDSHIELD ERUPTS. The Hitman. Still pinned. Still screaming. He FIRES SHOT AFTER SHOT into Jimmy's car. Hallenbeck walks up behind him. Puts a BULLET in his head. He stops screaming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIMMY is still huddled on the front seat in a sea of broken glass. Hallenbeck walks up, leans in the window.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(as Jimmy looks up)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE Jimmy puts it in reverse. The car backs up. Steam pouring from the crumpled hood. The Hitman, now freed, collapses to the street. Like a sack of flour.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck limps toward him, wheezing. He stops as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOTEL MANAGER stands outside a door marked OFFICE. Holding a pump action shotgun leveled at Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck nods at the bodies in the street.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's all over, compadre.

<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(scowls)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sidewalk belongs to the government.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and looks at Jimmy. The kid is in pain. Staring at Cory's bullet-riddled body. Eyes glazed. Hallenbeck says nothing. He crosses to the shattered Hitman. Kneels down, fishes through the guy's coat pockets. Comes up with a bloody pack of cigarettes. Extracts one. Lights it. SIRENS fill the air. And Jimmy snaps out of it long enough to reach into his coat -- Takes out the vial of coke. Ditches it. Drops it down a sewer grating, out of sight. No one sees him do it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POLICE CRUISERS come SQUEALING up, flashers turning. Surrounding Jimmy, who stands, head down and motionless -- And Joe, who smokes and looks at the moon. CUT TO:

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT SERGEANT BENJAMIN BESSALO sits behind his desk, scanning a stack of typed pages. A tired-looking cop named McCASKEY lounges in the doorway. A Christmas tree in the corner sheds needles.

Through the glass window, we can see Hallenbeck and Jimmy seated outside in the squad room proper. Bessalo stops reading. Sniffs the air. Frowns:

INT. SQUAD ROOM - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Outside the office Hallenbeck and Jimmy are perched side by side on a wooden bench. Jimmy is crumpling pieces of paper and tossing them at a wastebasket. He throws with unerring accuracy. Beside him Hallenbeck frowns, deep in thought. Finally, Jimmy speaks:
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That stuff Cory fed you about a weirdo hassling her. That was all bullshit, wasn't it...?

<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It isn't. Tell me what she did at the club, besides dance.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The usual. Waitressing. Get a guy to buy you a bottle of champagne. Sit in a private booth, let the poor fuck spill his troubles. Used to say she'd make a great psychiatrist.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>

	Right. So what does she do?

<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit. This shirt cost me eighty bucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(holsters his gun)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Glad to see, at a time like this, at least you got your priorities straight.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do me a favor and shut up. You think I don't care that Cory's dead?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(rubs tired eyes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ, I feel like I been rode hard and put away wet.

<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get some sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. What stunning advice. I was gonna go hiking.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They start down the hallway, side by side.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know something, Joe, for a private eye, you sure don't go in for snappy comebacks.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's this? Fuck you and the horse that looks like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get some sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A passing PATROLMAN stops. Eyes Jimmy thoughtfully. Frowns:
</DIRECTION>
<PATROLMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look real familiar. Do I know you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy grins, shrugs. Obviously flattered.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You might. Some people recognize me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<PATROLMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got it. Peanuts Morton. Used to sell hash in Crenshaw District.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, man. I played football. Jimmy Dix, L.A. Stallions.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PATROLMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What position?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PATROLMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuckin' football. Free agents ruined the damn game.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PATROLMAN>
<DIRECTION>
He walks away. Jimmy scowls. Grumbles to himself.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We gotta cross the parking lot. You wanna borrow my sunglasses?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, snappy comeback. You a detective?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As the two cross the muster room toward the front doors, they pass the hooker we saw earlier. She is talking to her pimp. There is a heated exchange. The pimp slaps her. Hard. Suddenly, Jimmy lunges forward. Balling his fists.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That son of a bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He's ready to clean the pimp's clock when Hallenbeck grabs him, spins him bodily. Propels him out the front doors. Away from trouble.

	What the fuck are you trying to do, Tarzan?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He hit the chick.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't start a fight in a police station, dickhead. Are you really this stupid or did you take lessons?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guy shouldn't treat a woman like that, is all I'm saying. He just shouldn't, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why? Because they're weak and need protecting?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(pause, then)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He's serious. Hallenbeck starts to chuckle. Shakes his head, lights a cigarette. Laughs through the smoke. This may be the funniest thing he's ever heard. CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. POLICE IMPOUND LOT - SAME TIME Hallenbeck walks across the parking lot toward his car. Jimmy trots behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>

<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.

<HALLENBECK>

	Take the bus.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut it out. Look, you sorta saved my life. Let me buy you a beer.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not thirsty. Good night.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He approaches his battered Plymouth. Jimmy scowls.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it. Good night?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go home. Get some sleep.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you gonna do?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna get a message to the people who killed your friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the message?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That we're out of it. That whatever they're doing, they don't have to worry about us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're kidding.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe gets in the car. Says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're backing off, you're not gonna do anything? I watch T.V., what the fuck kind of private eye doesn't do anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The kind with a wife and kid. Look, it's over. My job is done.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you your job is done. We witnessed a murder, Joe!
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, it was very exciting. Tomorow I'll take you to the zoo.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanna play hero, go ahead. When you die, I'll take your closet full of eighty-dollar shirts.

<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, until this is over, I'm sticking with you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<HALLENBECK>

<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>

<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have a ncie night.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He STARTS the CAR.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't drive away, Joe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe puts it in gear. Pulls away.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe -- ! I'll tell the cops, Joe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe taps the brake. Stops. Leans out the window, says softly:
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell them what, Jimmy?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That Mike Miller was fucking your wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Only reason you're not in the cooler, tough guy, is the cops got no motive for Miller's death. When they find out Mikey was dickin' your old lady, seems to me you become suspect numero uno. I'm scared, and I'm coming with you, got it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe gets out of the car and advances on Jimmy.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You little creep, I'm gonna beat the shit out of you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go for it. Then the cops'll really love my story.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't start a fight in a police station, dickhead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You and me is not a fight. You and me is a massacre.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gosh, you're tough.

<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get in the fucking car.

</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT Hallenbeck is in a foul mood. Jimmy lights a cigarette and applies for a position as pep chairman:
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got any hobbies?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mmmm. Used to be a pretty fair ventriloquist.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ventriloquist, really? I hear Ps and Bs are the hardest.

	Man, what is this shit? Dick Haymes. Who the fuck is Dick Haymes? Jeez, you must be older than I thought.

<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck grimaces and shifts in his seat.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's the matter? Stomach problems?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ear problems.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What kind of ear problems?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The kind that won't shut up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He stops at a traffic light. Sees a torn poster on a nearby telephone pole: CALIFORNIA HAS A VOICE - BAYNARD FOR SENATE. He grumbles. Gives it the finger.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baynard, huh? What's the matter, you got some kind of beef with the guy?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You might say that.

<JIMMY>

EXT. ADULT LIVING COMPLEX - NIGHT Jimmy and Hallenbeck make their way down a flagstone walk between tiny, palm-shaded cottages. The moon casts a pale glow.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bet these places run a fortune.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me about it. I'm paying the fucking rent.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How charming. Sounds like a great girl. What else did you spring for? Clothes? Car payments?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wasn't like that. Cory could've had lots of rich guys. Me, she loved.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Love. Well, forget about it, then.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me guess. You don't believe in love.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(lights a cigarette)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I believe in cancer. I believe in love.

	What, they're both diseases?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something like that.

<DIRECTION>
Jimmy shakes his head sadly.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Man, I don't want to meet the bitch that fucked you up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sure she'd love meeting you. Probably blow you on the front porch.

EXT. MOONLIT COTTAGE The two men approach the door. Jimmy takes out his key ring.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The cops are gonna want to check this place out, so don't disturb anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, massah.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COTTAGE Jimmy opens the door. Flips on the lights. Stops in his tracks. The room has been systematically torn to pieces. A knife has been used to rip open the couch. Broken furniture, shredded clothing. Everywhere. It looks like a combat zone.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think someone disturbed some stuff, Joe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, shit. Looks like somebody beat us to it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beat us to what?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever evidence Cory was holding.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Assuming there was any. Stay here a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Bathroom. You wanna come with me? Doctor said I shouldn't lift anything heavy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll pass.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck starts inspecting the wreckage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLUTTERED BATHROOM Jimmy enters and shuts the door behind him. He scans the floor, covered with clothes, bottles, etc. Picks up a carelessly discarded can of Right Guard deodorant. Turns it upside down, and unscrews the bottom. Inside, the can is hollow and empty. The perfect hiding place. Jimmy heaves a sigh of relief. Removes a little plastic Baggie filled with white powder. Stashes it in his shorts. Starts to replace the lid. Stops. Frowns. Reaches into the can a second time -- And pulls out a yellow envelope. He looks at it, perplexed. Puts it in his pocket. Replaces the lid. Tosses the can on the floor. Flushes the toilet. Leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM Hallenbeck, meanwhile, is prowling the living room, looking at photographs on the walls. The girl in the photos seems young, beautiful, and naive. One shot depicts Cory and a friend in cheerleader outfits. On it is scrawled, GOOD LUCK IN HOLLYWOOD BABY! LOVE, JANIS Hallenbeck gazes around the devastated cottage.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looks like you made it, baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy emerges from the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>

	Find anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, there's some really nice rubble.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I may have something.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Later. Let's get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COTTAGE - NIGHT The two men emerge from the house. Joe heads for his car. Jimmy peels off toward a battered GMC Pacer parked at the curb.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where the hell are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As long as we're here, I might as well take Cory's car.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got the keys?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. I'll follow you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck starts to turn away. Jimmy gets in the car. Hallenbeck stops. Frowns.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cory has two cars?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. This one's just sitting here until she can sell it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The color drains from Hallenbeck's features.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jimmy, no!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He sprints across the sidewalk and yanks Jimmy out of the driver's seat before he can key the ignition.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ouch -- ! What's your problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE Hallenbeck kneels and peers under the car.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Swears softly as he sees two thin copper wires, glinting in the moonlight.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They used a car bomb on Mike, it figures they'd try it on her, too.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(stands)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Except they wired the wrong car.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy pales noticeably.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Shit. Oh. Jeez.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck claps him on the back.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy, kid. No harm, no foul. We caught it in time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He strolls toward his Plymouth, whistling. Cheerfully unaffected. Jimmy catches his breath. Swallows hard. Turns, and bumps into Hallenbeck, coming back the other way.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you doing?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck brandishes a pair of wire-cutters.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gotta disconnect the fucker.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa. Hold on. Um, shouldn't we call the bomb squad or something?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax, Junior, I used to do this for a living.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He isolates one wire. Turns and offers the cutters to Jimmy.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanna do it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, man, I --
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, chickenshit. Just snip the wire.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy hesitates, then takes the cutters. Reaches beneath the wheel well. Plucks at the wire tentatively. Cuts.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, shit not that one!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy screams and stumbles backward. Lands on his ass. Hallenbeck is chuckling softly. Shakes his head as he walks around to release the hood.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a fucking asshole!
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then some, Junior. And then some.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
TIME CUT TO:

THREE STICKS OF DYNAMITE - ONE MINUTE LATER have been taped to the car's ignition system. Hallenbeck removes the taped bundle. Holds it up for inspection.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>

	We'll hand this over to the cops. They can analyze it.

<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got a better idea. Let's check in with my family.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They start walking toward Hallenbeck's Plymouth. Hallenbeck tosses the car keys to Jimmy.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm tired. You drive.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. Family, huh? You got kids?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Little girl.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does she like you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not much, no. And she likes Prince, so go figure.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I like Prince.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great, you can marry my daughter. Or better yet, fuck my wife. I hear all it takes is a credit card and two valid I.D.'s.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Open the trunk.

	You're just gonna stick that in your trunk?

<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right. Let's leave it here for the neighborhood kids to play with.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy opens the trunk. As he does, however, a voice rings out suddenly from the darkness.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hold it right there, gentlemen.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They stop. Slowly they turn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TWO MEN are approaching from out of the trees. One holds a flashlight trained on Hallenbeck and Jimmy. The other carries a silenced Beretta.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it the cops?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Jimmy. It's not the cops.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Working quickly, Hallenbeck tapes the bomb to the inside of the truck lid. Slams it shut. Turns, facing the new arrivals. The MEN wear tailored suits with matching ties. One is tall and lean. The other is a bruiser, short and stout. They both have the seasoned look of professional mob hitters. The Taller Man speaks, gun held rock steady.
</DIRECTION>
<TALL_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good evening, gentlemen. Bit late for a stroll, don't you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, you two better be getting home.

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He'd like to have the pleasure.

<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell him it's not for sale.

<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He says it's --

<SHORT_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your name, fuckface?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
This from the Shorter Man, who is clearly not happy.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm asshole. He's fuckface.

<TALL_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jake, apprise Rodney Dangerfield here of his situation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
Jake slips on a pair of brass knuckles. Steps up and delivers a looping right to Hallenbeck's face. A sickening crunch. A two inch gash streams blood. Jake relieves Hallenbeck of his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<TALL_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps we can dispense with the fun and games now, yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy rushes forward, snarling. The Beretta swivels. Jimmy stops, the gun aimed at his gut.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(gasping)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy... Jim... All they want is the evidence...
	</DIALOGUE>
<TALL_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The evidence. Very smart. See, Jake, he knows when a situation is untenable.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You like that word?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Great word.
	</DIALOGUE>
<TALL_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It occurs to me that you may have the evidence in question.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(spits out blood)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Give up, Jimmy. We're dealing with geniuses.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Another fist to the head. Hallenbeck grunts. Spits more blood.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Leave him alone, you fuck!
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Back off, Jimmy.

The Tall Man turns and eyes Jimmy.

<TALL_MAN>

	Leave him alone...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whatever you say. Jake?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Short Man steps away from Hallenbeck. Turns and launches a kick at Jimmy's groin. Connects. The kid drops to the ground, retching.
</DIRECTION>
<TALL_MAN>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah, my young friend... I neglected to tell you that Jake attacks his job with a certain... exuberance.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ... I'm being beat up by the inventor of Scrabble.
	</DIALOGUE>
<TALL_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's still in a good mood, Jake. Kick him again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jake steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck speaks through cracked, bloody lips:
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You want the fucking evidence that the stripper had. I've got it. So we can play games, or I can hand it over.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then you'll let us go, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<TALL_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. We'll let you go.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(to Hallenbeck)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck meets the Tall Man's gaze. Speaks softly.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hand me the car keys, Jimmy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy stumbles to his feet. Looks at the Tall Man.
</DIRECTION>
<TALL_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walk over and hand him the keys. Slow and easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy takes out the car keys. Crosses to Hallenbeck. Gives him the keys.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The evidence is in the trunk.
	</DIALOGUE>
<TALL_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Open it. Slow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck smiles. Shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think so.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns and throws the keys as far as he can. They fall out of sight behind a cottage.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oops. I guess nobody gets it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<TALL_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You dumb bastard, you're going to pay for that. Jake, open the trunk.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jake steps forward, drawing a .38 silenced pistol. He is going to shoot open the lock.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON HALLENBECK This is what he's been waiting for. He tenses, looking to one side: next to him is a sloping hillside, angling down and away. He grips Jimmy's wrist, signalling to get ready. Jake raises the PISTOL. Take aim at the lock and FIRES. The SHOT is SILENCED. What follows is not. Because the bullet blows through the trunk -- And hits three sticks of live dynamite.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF SHOTS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck is already moving, pitching to one side, throwing himself and Jimmy down the hillside. The night lights up like a SUNBURST. A tower of fire... Climbs up and outward from the car. The TRUNK LID is BLOWN fifty feet in the air. The tires are pulped. GLASS SPRAYS for fifty yards in every direction. And, most importantly: both hitmen are engulfed in flame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SOUND. Fury. Flames, rolling skyward. TINKLE of raining GLASS. Bits of falling metal. All in all, a helluva blast, and meanwhile:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIMMY AND JOE continue to careen down the hillside. Bouncing like rag puppets. Out of control. Lurch to stop at the bottom. Covered head to toe with dirt. Bruised. Bloody. Alive. They lie side by side, sucking air -- Until they both hear an odd noise: The sound of CRUMPLING METAL. The sound is GETTING LOUDER. They both crane their necks in time to see -- The flaming car, tumbling end over end Coming down the hill. Heading straight for them.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus fucking Christ!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They both dive for cover, out of the way. Barely make it. The CAR plows past them in a shower of dirt. CRUMPLING. Heaving. Spitting fire. Finally SLAMS to a halt against a palm tree. Burns. The night is filled with SHOUTS and CURSES. The sound of DOORS OPENING. The crackle of flames.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON GROUND Joe rolls over. Looks at Jimmy. Jimmy looks at Joe.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You alive?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't know yet.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They crawl to their feet, inspecting for broken bones.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The dynamite?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Either that, or we're looking at a major factory recall.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dead guys... don't make bad jokes, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So we're alive.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Hooray.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He spits blood as SIRENS once more fill the night air, APPROACHING.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go. Get out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get the fuck out of here, I'll take the heat on this one. Rent a car. Then go home and wait for my call. Do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy meets Joe's eyes. Nods. Dashes off into the night. CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. L.A.P.D. ROBBERY/HOMICIDE DIVISION - NIGHT Sergeant Benjamin Bessalo is in the mood to kick things. A metal trashcan is booted across the room with a clang as he whirls, glaring at Joe Hallenbeck, who is seated before him.
</DIRECTION>
<BESSALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddammit, this is a police matter, you son of a bitch! I'm sick and fucking tired of sweeping up your dead bodies, Joe, and the next time I see your ugly mug I'm puttin' a bullet in it. You got that? You are off the case, buddy. Is that clear?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck stares at him. Blows smoke. Says nothing. CUT TO: INT. RENTAL CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy's at the wheel of a rented Subaru. Hallenbeck beside him. He hands Joe the envelope he found in Cory's apartment.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you thought there was dynamite in the trunk, wait'll you see this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck reaches into the envelope and extracts a photograph: Two men having lunch together on a secluded patio. Both are older, distinguished-looking. Joe suddenly looks very pale.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The guy on the left is Connie Marcon, the owner of the L.A. Stallions.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget about him. Look at the guy on the right.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sort of familiar. Who is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Senator Calvin Baynard.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy draws a sharp breath. Pause, then:
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's go back to the cops. I'm scared.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it easy, kid. It's not so bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not so bad. Excuse me, did you just say the words not so bad? You don't understand, Joe, see, if a guy vomits on the sidewalk, you don't say, 'Oh, hey, it's not so bad, there's some ham in there.' It's fucking vomit, okay? This is bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck nervously lights a cigarette. Stares straight ahead through the windshield. Begins to talk:
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I was thirty, I was on the President's personal security force. Once night I was on the way home from a late session. I'm on the highway just outside of Georgetown when I see something up ahead.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
MEMORY FLASH Another time. Another night. A younger-looking Hallenbeck. Rugged features. Clipped military haircut. He is driving. Down a turnpike, squinting through dense evening mist. Up ahead, a shape materializes out of the fog:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WRECKED CAR is lying upside down in a pool of shattered glass. He SCREECHES to a stop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE In a dream-like SLOW MOTION, he approaches the overturned car. There are two dead bodies inside. A woman. A little boy. In the window, a stuffed Garfield doll clings with suction cups to the remaining glass. The furry cat is splattered with blood.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was a high-speed collision. Both cars were totaled. The woman and the boy were dead. The driver of the other car wasn't.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
STAGGERING DRUNK is weaving toward Hallenbeck. Leaving behind his crumpled Mercedes. He wears an $800 suit. Tan Cordovan loafers. Silk tie.
</DIRECTION>
<DRUNK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuckin' bitch... She got in front of me, man. Shit. My fuckin' car. Stupid bitch wrecked my car...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He stumbles toward Hallenbeck, eyes attempting to focus.
</DIRECTION>
<DRUNK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know who I am...? I'm Louis Baynard, my father is Calvin D. Baynard, man. Call my father, he'll take care of it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The man lurches to a stop in front of Hallenbeck. Clutching at Joe's lapels. Wheezing liquor fumes. He presses a hundred dollar bill into Joe's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<DRUNK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll tell 'em what happened, right...? Bitch swerved in front of me, man. Wrecked my fuckin' Mercedes. Right...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I could smell bourbon on him, big time. He was standing there, not a scratch on him. I went a little nuts. I hit him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
In SLOW MOTION, Hallenbeck backhands the rich drunk, with a head-snapping impact that bursts lips. Breaks teeth. We see the Drunk's head slowly strike the asphalt. A sickening concussion.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The blow was non-lethal. But when he fell, his head hit the pavement funny. Put him in a coma.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
The younger Hallenbeck stands on the highway of eight years past, staring at the Drunk with fierce, blazing eyes as we -- SNAP BACK TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIMMY AND JOE - BACK TO PRESENT Driving.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Even when he came out of it, he was never right in the head. His dad fixed everything with the cops. The accident report disappeared. A week later the police found half a kilo of crack cocaine planted in my house. Acting on an anonymous tip.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The senator fucked your job.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And my pension. And my marriage. Only reason I'm still licensed to carry a gun, the man himself made a few calls. Since then I'm just playing it out. Day by day.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy is silent for a moment. Then:
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>

	Cory tumbled to some sort of deal between Marcon and the senator, and they had her killed.

<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want Baynard, Jimmy. I want to bring him down. I could use your help.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why should I help you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because if Baynard takes a fall, so does Marcon. The man who kicked you out of professional football.

INT. PLUSH BEDROOM - NIGHT A tall, thin, almost effeminate MAN is seated on a couch. High cheekbones. A shock of blond hair. Glittering, malignant eyes. He is directing a pornographic film.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PRETTY GIRL is bound hand and foot to the posts of a lavishly appointed bed. Around her, the room is filled with Kleig lights. Reflectors. Camera equipment. The girl is scowling furiously. She speaks to the director:

	<DIALOGUE>
	Milo... What the fuck is this, some kind of joke?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GIRL>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>

The hulking man pulls the starter cord. The SAW ROARS to life.

A smile twitches Milo's upper lip.

He exits. Closes a sound-proofed door behind him.

INT. WOOD-PANELED STUDY - CONTINUOUS ACTION Milo enters, all business. Crosses to a telephone with a blinking light. Stabs a button. Scoops up the receiver.

EXT. HALLENBECK HOME - LATE NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Dawn is a ghost on the horizon as Jimmy parks the rental Subaru outside. The two men emerge. Head for the front door.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So I get to meet your family, huh? What's your daughter like?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>

	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLENBECK HOUSE - CONTINUOUS ACTION As they come through the front door, Joe's daughter, DARIAN, is slumped in a big Lazy-Boy, staring sullenly at a movie on TV. Cute kid, cursed to wear ridiculous- looking dental headgear.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She doesn't bother to look up.

<HALLENBECK>

	First things first. I'm starving.

She still won't look at him. The two men cross to the kitchen. Hallenbeck opens the refrigerator, takes out some lunchmeat.

<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's pissed off because I wouldn't let her go out on a date with her friend Billy.

<DARIAN>

<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't care. You're an asshole.

</HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
Without missing a beat, Hallenbeck opens the window and heaves the ice cream outside.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's for saying asshole. God, I hate wasting food. Wanna abuse me some more? Go ahead, shock me. You know, I hardly ever hear the word asshole.

	Sure thing, you dumb fuck-up.

	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, I've had it. Go to your room. Or I will whip your behind.

<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'd probably like it.

<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck takes her by the arm and drags her out of the chair. Toward her room.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddammit, you are my daughter and you will respect me, got that? You got it? You don't ever call me a fuck-up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why shouldn't I, Mom calls you that all the time.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
That stops him. He looks at her, stricken.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your mother called me a fuck-up...? When?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On the phone to Uncle Jay.

	Uncle Jay? Ohh, Christ, I'm a fuck-up, but Uncle Jay, now there's a real stand-up guy. Shit, the bastard cheats on his tax form, I'm surprised he hasn't done time! Why don't you ask your mother why Mister Wonderful isn't in jail for tax evasion?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DARIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because he doesn't fuck up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She goes into her room and shuts the door. Hallenbeck rubs his eyes. Leans against the wall, exhausted.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, for fifty bucks you could get a guy to pull out her fingernails with a pair of pliers.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Anything that much fun, I'd want to do myself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think we could both use a drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck crosses to a cabinet, breaks out a bottle of Seagrams. Swigs. Hands it to Jimmy. As Jimmy drinks, he notices a photo on the wall: Hallenbeck shaking hands with George Bush.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. That's me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look like the dad on 'The Brady Bunch.'
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, I was a regular Boy Scout.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe starts to fix a sandwich. Jimmy takes nips from the bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. You gonna get a divorce?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't know.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He bites into the sandwich. Not really tasting it.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't like women much, do you, Joe?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(mouth full)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mike Miller wasn't the first time. Sarah has cheated on me before. Twice. I never told her I knew. At first, my opinion of women took a real dip, yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And now?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now I'm content if I like the guy she's fucking. This last one was my best friend.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Horseshit, he was a scumbag private eye.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What am I, Jimmy?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He tried to get you killed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Friends can't be perfect.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish the sky wasn't blue. I wish water wasn't wet. I wish I didn't still love my wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He eats in silence. Jimmy says:
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know what I did last night?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I went to a party and shit on a car.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Damn. You, too?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm a complete loser. Capital 'L.' All I ever wanted... was to be somebody's hero, you know it...? Now I mostly sit around. Watch T.V. Get laid. I'm a fucking slug, throw salt on me I'd curl up. Life sucks.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're wrong.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Life doesn't suck?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, life sucks. But you're not a loser. Cory loved you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, and the last thing I did was cheat on her.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why do people cheat, Joe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because it's easier than paying the tax, Junior.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ooooooh. Very deep.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So deep I don't know what the fuck it means.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It means another drink is required.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He raises the bottle.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alex the accountant.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He drinks. Hallenbeck frowns, watching him.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is Alex your accountant?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. But he could have been.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alex was my son.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was married at 19. Sweet young thing, looking to get out from under daddy's thumb. I didn't know she was a junkie. All during her pregnancy. Shooting up. There were complications. She died. Alex lived for seventeen minutes in the incubator. Fell asleep. Died before he woke up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(takes a drink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was born... He had time for one dream... and then he died. I wonder what his dream was about.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think about him a lot. I mean, who was this... guy? This little guy who only got seventeen minutes, who was he, Joe...? What was he like?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would he have been?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He would have been a great ball player. Like his dad.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(shakes his head)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. He had to die, Joe. Don't you see?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why did he have to die?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(softly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Because he came out of me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He puts aside the bottle. Scowls.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna borrow your shower.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He exits. Hallenbeck watches him go. Says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION Jimmy enters and shuts the door. Turns on the shower. Makes no move to undress. Instead, he reaches inside the waistband on his pants. Removes a vial of coke. Dips a spoon. The door opens. Hallenbeck is standing there with a handful of fresh towels. He stops. Staring at Jimmy. They freeze in tableau. Then Hallenbeck crosses the floor with two quick strides and slugs Jimmy with all his might. Decks him. The kid goes over backward into the shower, head striking the porcelain. He swerves. Claws his way out, drenched.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Not in my house, you dumb motherfucker.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe, man, you don't get it --
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shut up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He picks up the vial of powder.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is what you went looking for in Cory's apartment, isn't it? You found this when you found that envelope.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses to the toilet. Jimmy cries out.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe, please!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe drops the vial in the water. Flushes. Jimmy darts forward. Joe shoves him back.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You stupid bastard, do you know what you've done? That was a thousand bucks' worth of shit!

</HALLENBECK>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, sure, Dudley fucking Do-Right, you stand there and judge me, and, meanwhile, you never had your old lady die on you, did you, pal?? And your fucking kid?? And I said to God, 'Hey, buddy, what gives? I go to church, I give to the United Way, what is this dead wife and kid shit...?' And he didn't say nothin', Joe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs a towel. Scrubs savagely at his wet torso.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And then I lose my job, my fucking life, okay, and why...? You know why? Because I gambled. Whoa, hold on, stop the presses, Jimmy gambled, well shit, of course I gambled, everybody does, and the fucking league knows it!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He advances on Joe, trembling with anger.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, Joe? Why is there an injury report in pro football, huh...? Nobody else has a fucking injury report, but the N.F.L. does, so the fucking gamblers will know the spread! Marcon... the commissioner ... those fucking hypocrites... killed the last thing I could do, Joe...! I can't do anything... anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
And suddenly he is crying.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't save my wife... She died screaming and I couldn't do a Goddamn thing... And my baby came out... and he was so fuckin' small, Joe... He was too fuckin' small...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He collapses against the wall. Slides down to a sitting position. Huddled on the floor. Hallenbeck watches him. Says nothing. For a moment, he seems moved to compassion... Then his gaze hardens. He kneels next to Jimmy.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you're through feeling sorry for yourself, the front door's that way.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(wipes his eyes)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a total bastard.

<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You brought cocaine in my house. End of story.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy is silent. He stands. Exits into the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe's daughter, Darian, is standing there.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're Jimmy Dix, aren't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Huh?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
There is an awkward pause. Darian holds out a football card. Young, smiling Jimmy. The card is old. Tattered.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry I acted like a bitch. Would you sign my card?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck steps forward.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I told you to go to your room.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But, Dad -- !

Darian's face is a mask of confusion.

Jimmy walks past her to the front door. Stops with his hand on the knob. Turns.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never shaved points, Joe. I never did.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe is silent. Stone-faced.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you want my help, I'm at the Casa Loma Apartments on Ventura.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He exits. Shuts the door behind him. Darian goes into her room, fuming. Shuts the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe is alone. He turns. Sees his reflection in the hall mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Smile, you fuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAWN The first light of day streams through the window. Hallenbeck pushes Furry Tom to one side. Sits on the bed. Regards his sleeping wife with hooded, lifeless eyes. She is peaceful. Serene. He reaches out to touch her. Stops. Withdraws his hand. Crushes out the cigarette. Stands. Leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DARIAN'S ROOM - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck enters. Crosses to Darian's bed. She is asleep. She looks vulnerable. Helpless. He leans over and kisses her. She stirs in her sleep. Murmurs:
</DIRECTION>
<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Billy...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck recoils. Stares at her. The DOORBELL RINGS. Startling him. He mutters under his breath. Stalks out of the room.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE - FRONT DOOR Down the hall to the front door. Flings it open, pissed off.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddammit, Jimmy, I told you -- !
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
It isn't Jimmy. Standing on the porch is a tall, thin man with blond hair. The man removes a TASER GUN from his overcoat.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, Joseph.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He FIRES point-blank. The electrode hits Hallenbeck in the chest. A CRACKLE of electric current. Hallenbeck jerks spastically. The world spirals away. He plunges down into darkness. CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLUTTERED APARTMENT - MORNING Jimmy looks bad. Sprawled out on a tangle of dirty sheets. Jeans. Bare feet. Smoking. Staring at a football card. A duplicate of the one Darian showed him. He swings his legs off the bed. Stands, crushes out his cigarette. Moves into the bathroom. The Baggie of coke is on the counter. He stares at it with bloodshot eyes. Swallows hard. Acts before he can think. Grabs the Baggie. Tosses it in the toilet. Flushes. Watches as it goes down the drain.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CASA LOMA APARTMENTS - MORNING Another Goddamned day. A chill drizzle. The palm trees look forlorn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AT CORNER NEWSSTAND Jimmy buys a paper. Trudges along Ventura Boulevard. Huddled against the chill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SLEEK, BLACK SEDAN slides to the curb in front of him. Two men get out: One is Pablo, who last we saw wielding a chainsaw in Milo's snuff film; the other is an ugly piece of hired muscle who we'll call CHET. The two men flank Jimmy and walk alongside him. He looks up, startled.
</DIRECTION>
<PABLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning, Jimmy.

<CHET>

	The kid with the million-dollar arm?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PABLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit. He don't look like much. I wouldn't pay no million dollars for this bozo.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PABLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Neither will anyone else, anymore.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm growing whiskers here, guys. You got something to say, fucking say it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. Tough guy stuff. Must have caught it from his buddy Hallenbeck.

</PABLO>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who?

<PABLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't play dumb, shithead. You were with him last night at the club.
	</DIALOGUE>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Marcon sent us to teach you a lesson, Jimmy. Something about keeping your big coked-up nose out of his fucking business.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PABLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get ready, kid. This one's an E ticket.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And, with that, they grab Jimmy under the arms. Carry him across the sidewalk to a plywood fence.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, guys, don't do this... Jesus Christ, I was just her boyfriend, I swear to God, please!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They toss Jimmy over the fence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE Not a terrible fate, under normal circumstances. In this case, however -- A fifty-foot drop...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Awaits him beyond the fence. A huge, looming pit dug into the earth. Foundation for a new parking garage. Jimmy plummets like a stone. Under normal circumstances, he'd be dead. But since it rained last night, he's got three feet of water to land in. He hits with a splash. Disappears beneath the water. Surfaces, screaming in pain. Thrashes in the muddy water, and only when he looks down does he notice the splintered bone jutting out of his skin at a crazy angle.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His million-dollar arm. His throwing arm. He clutches at cracked ribs, screaming:
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, God, my arm, my fucking arm, oh Jesus Christ!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He kneels in the muddy water, rocking back and forth.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LONG SHOT - JIMMY Alone in the pit. Huddled in a pool of muddy water. His screams of pain ECHO in the chill, morning air.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LAPD ROBBERY/HOMICIDE DIVISION - DAY Ben Bessalo's office, to be precise. Bessalo reclines grumpily at his desk. Scanning reports. McCaskey hangs up the phone and calls across the room:
</DIRECTION>
<McCASKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got bad news and bad news.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BESSALO>

<McCASKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Bessalo looks up, intrigued. McCaskey continues:
</DIRECTION>
<McCASKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, according to Hallenbeck, Mike Miller came to the house early that morning to talk about a case, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BESSALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right.
	</DIALOGUE>
<McCASKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. So how come Hallenbeck's neighbor claims that Miller's car was parked there all night, in the same spot?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Bessalo sits bolt upright. Eyes glazed. Wheels turning.
</DIRECTION>
<BESSALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He lied. Why did he lie...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Realization hits him like a thunderbolt.
</DIRECTION>
<BESSALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit. Miller was fucking his wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
<McCASKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BESSALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's why the car was there, Miller was fucking Hallenbeck's wife, Hallenbeck just got back from out of town, remember?

He stabs a button on the phone. Barks into the receiver:

<BESSALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want an A.P.B. out on Joe Hallenbeck. Now. Find him and if he resists arrest, shoot the bastard.
	</DIALOGUE>
</McCASKEY>
<DIRECTION>
He slams down the phone. Stares, stricken, at McCaskey.
</DIRECTION>
<BESSALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I let him go, Mick. He wasted Mike Miller and waltzed right out of my office, I let him go, Goddammit!
	</DIALOGUE>
<McCASKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Relax, Ben. We'll bring him in. He's not that good.

And, with that, we promptly -- CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOE HALLENBECK'S UNCONSCIOUS FACE Weathered. Sallow. Dark circles under the eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAND comes INTO FRAME and slaps him. Hard. Rocks his head to one side.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ELEGANT BEACH HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER ANGLE Thick carpet. Polished, wood furniture. Window walls. Outside, the sea is angry and grey.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PABLO AND CHET are standing over Hallenbeck, who is slumped in a chair. Both hitmen wear holstered sidearms. Chet leans over and slaps Hallenbeck again. The big detective begins to stir. His eyelids flutter.
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think he's awake.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PABLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Chet's hand flashes out for a third slap -- And from nowhere, Joe Hallenbeck's hand magically appears. Intercepts the blow. Clamps onto Chet's hand and wrenches it. A cry of pain. Chet stumbles backward, cradling the wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm awake.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
His eyelids creak open. He squints, adjusting to the light. Studies his captors.
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You nearly broke my wrist, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Life's a bitch.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He starts pawing his coat pockets, looking for a cigarette. In the corner, Pablo chuckles:
</DIRECTION>
<PABLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Milo warned us to watch out for this guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Chet is seething. He glares at Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck yawns.
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck that. Look at him. He's nothin'. Guy's a piece of shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck ignores him. Sits up. Rubs tired eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anybody got a cigarette...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Chet steps forward. Grins wickedly.
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, buddy. I got a cigarette.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches into his shirt pocket. Extracts a Marlboro. Hands it to Hallenbeck. Takes out a lighter. Hallenbeck places the cigarette between his lips. Leans forward for a light -- And Chet slugs him in the face. The cigarette goes flying. Hallenbeck's head snaps back. Blood creeps from his lower lip.
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
<DIRECTION>
(guffaws)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, baby, I thought you were tough. See, Pablo, he ain't so bad.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck's eyes glint fiercely. He takes a breath. Leans forward and says:
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I seem to have dropped my cigarette. May I have another?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Chet turns, meets his gaze. The grin falters a bit.
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
<DIRECTION>
(unnerved)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. Sure thing, buddy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHET>
<DIRECTION>
He hands Hallenbeck another smoke. Hallenbeck puts it between his lips.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>

<DIRECTION>
A pregnant pause. The challenge hangs in the air. Slowly, Chet takes the lighter from his pocket. Pablo looks on, a smile twisting his features. Hallenbeck leans forward for a light. Chet extends his arm -- And slugs Hallenbeck in the face again. Rocks him. Chet howls with laughter. Pablo grins.
</DIRECTION>
<CHET>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baby! Two for two!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The laughter continues. Hallenbeck takes a deep breath. Stands up. Strikes with a flattened palm. Breaks Chet's nose. Drives it up into the brain. Chet stands, pole-axed. Blinks once. Pitches over dead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And suddenly Pablo isn't laughing. He stares at Hallenbeck, incredulous. Stares at Chet, lying on the carpet.
</DIRECTION>
<PABLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus Christ.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(draws his gun)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You son-of-a-bitch. Jesus Christ!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He rushes to Chet. Kneels beside him. Hallenbeck calmly returns to his seat.
</DIRECTION>
<PABLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You killed him! 'Fuckin' A, you killed him, he's fuckin' dead!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment, a door opens, and Milo enters. Slick. Well-dressed. Utterly composed.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is there a problem?
	</DIALOGUE>
<PABLO>
<DIRECTION>
(still dazed)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He killed Chet, Milo. The mother- fucker just killed him!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Milo looks toward Hallenbeck. Hallenbeck says nothing. Instead, he calmly leans forward and picks up Chet's lighter from the carpet. Lights his cigarette. Blows smoke.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A tense moment... and then Milo does something un- expected: He starts to laugh. Advances into the room, chuckling.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, my. Oh, Goddamn. Joseph, Joseph, you don't disappoint me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He draws a Walther PPK and approaches Hallenbeck. Smiling and cheerful.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You seem to have killed one of my men.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I needed a light.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Milo nods as if this makes perfect sense.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You took an awful risk. Pablo here could have shot you dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you wanted me dead, you'd have already killed me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, that's true.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sits down)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I suppose introductions are in order.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(waves his hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck it. You're the bad guy, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. I'm the bad guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And you've got the gun, and I'm supposed to tremble in fear, something like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Something like that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine. I'll start trembling in a minute. Mind if I have a drink first?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't see why not. Pablo, please take Chet's corpse into the other room, and then fix Mr. Hallenbeck a drink.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly a voice rings out from the doorway:
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Make that two.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck turns toward the new arrival.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, look who's here. Connie Marcon himself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sure enough, CONRAD MARCON saunters in, just like he owns the place. Which, by the way, he does. Tall, strong, Texas-tough. Dressed in a Saville Row suit. He frowns at Hallenbeck:
</DIRECTION>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Careful, son. Only my friends call me Connie.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got friends? When did this happen?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARCON>
<DIRECTION>
(chuckles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll give you one thing. You're pretty calm for a man in your position.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're pretty calm for a man whose team is three and six on the year.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're having some problems.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They stink.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Marcon's composure falters, but only for a moment.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm glad you're here, Joe. We got a few things to discuss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
He takes a moment to gather his thoughts.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For starters, I'm sure you're aware that professional football is changing, and not for better.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(lights a cigar)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Used to be, you went to the local stadium come Sunday, you saw heroes. Guys who fought for their hometown. Anymore, no one gives a shit. Ever since Sonny Werblin paid $400,000 to Joe Namath back in '66, the sons of bitches just got greedier. Playing only for themselves. Giving nothing back to the game.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pablo hands him a double bourbon.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This year, the final blow: the N.F.L. votes to decertify the Players Organization. Eliminates the draft, reduces all athletes to free agents. Reduces football, once and for all, to commerce. To greed, you follow?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When do I say the Pledge of Allegiance?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Marcon looks directly at Hallenbeck.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know how many ratings points Monday Night Football lost this year? Per week? An average of two point eight.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, for Chrissake. You're telling me this whole thing is about TV ratings?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	People have stopped watching, Joe! Everybody's turning the channel, they're still looking for heroes, you follow? Guys like you. Milo here tells me you took a bullet for the President, jumped in front of a sniper rifle.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck reacts, startled. Looks at Milo.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We took the liberty of researching your background.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How about it, Joe? Is it truth or hype?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got the rifle in my closet as a souvenir.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There you go, that's what I'm saying. The public wants real heroes. Not a bunch of football prima donnas, jumping from team to team with their fancy lawyers.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In fact, Joe, and this is my point, there's only one reason left nowadays to watch pro- football. Can you guess?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
It begins to dawn on Hallenbeck.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gambling.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCON>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly. Gambling.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(puffs his cigar)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just one problem: football gambling is illegal in all but two of the fifty states. And that, Joe boy, is where I come in.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(sudden realization)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, that's what this is about! You're bribing United States senators. Paying them to pass legislation --
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCON>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	-- Legalizing football gambling in all fifty states. Exactly.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Attendance goes up again. TV ratings go up again.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You got it, son. The networks are happy. I'm happy. Everybody's happy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before we get too fucking happy, let's get a couple things straight: first, I'm not your fucking son, and second... why am I still alive?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Marcon stops pacing. Sighs and sits down facing Hallenbeck.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's like this, Joe: everything was going great until a couple weeks ago, and then I hit a snag: Senator Calvin Baynard.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(takes a sip of bourbon)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't get it. What's the snag?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I offered him the bribe and he wouldn't take it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck actually does a spit-take. Sprays bourbon.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLEBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baynard? Are you nuts? The guy's so crooked he shits slinkies.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Allow me to clarify: I offered him the bribe, and he turned it down because he wanted more money.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs with relief)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank God. For a minute there I felt hell freezing over. Did he ask for more than a million?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLEBECK>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does the Pope shit in the woods? He wants two million or he'll blow the lid off my whole plan. I don't feel like paying no two mil, so basically that good ole' boy's gotta die.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Taking off a U.S. senator, that's pretty ballsy. Even for an asshole like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm not going to kill Baynard, Joe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who is?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Marcon says nothing. Just looks at Hallenbeck and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He rubs tired eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm the perfect fall guy. Everyone and his uncle Max knows I hate Baynard.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARCON>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything goes wrong, all the heat lands on you, Joe boy. My hands are clean.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck scowls.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any particular reason I should go along with this prize-winning scheme?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARCON>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just one.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He motions to Milo, who disappears through a doorway. Reappears a moment later. He's got Joe's wife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON HALLENBECK He stands. Face contorting. Fists clenched. Rage courses through him like an electric current. Marcon cocks his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sit down, Joe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A moment. Joe stands, smouldering. On fire. Sarah speaks:
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do what he says, Joe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe sits. Breathing shallowly. Eyes locked on Milo.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you alright, Sarah?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a temporary condition, Joseph. As you may be aware, there are distributors in Mexico who positively crave snuff films. And unless you do every fucking thing Mr. Marcon tells you... your wife will make her motion picture debut.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He meets Joe's murderous gaze... and smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Jimmy is seated, shirtless, on a metal examining table. His ribs are taped. His arm in a cast. Two men loom over him, sour expressions on their faces: Sergeants McCaskey and Bessalo. Jimmy shakes his head, exasperated:
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I'll say it again for the cheap seats: I don't know anything and I can't help you. Okay? Can I go now?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Bessalo grimaces in disgust.
</DIRECTION>
<BESSALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let me get this straight: you're walking along, minding your own business, when two guys you never met jump you and throw you in a ditch for no particular reason. Is that it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BESSALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're full of shit, kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell me where Hallenbeck is.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How the fuck should I know? Try his house.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BESSALO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We did. Where is he?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	For Chrissake, I just met the guy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, Sergeant. I don't give a shit about Joe Hallenbeck. I just busted my throwing arm and I'm in a real pissy mood, so you got two choices: either charge me with something or let me the fuck outta here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He glares defiantly at Bessalo. CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CASA LOMA APARTMENTS - DAY The grey day wears on. Jimmy trudges stiffly down the walk toward his apartment unit. Pulls up short, staring ahead --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DARIAN HALLENBECK Slumped outside the door to his apartment. Asleep. A crumpled piece of paper clutched in her hand. He kneels beside her. Touches her shoulder.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. Wake up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She stirs. Awakens, looking at him. Her eyes are puffy and red from crying. Her hair is a tangled mess. She hands him the piece of paper, and promptly bursts into tears. Buries her head in his chest, sobbing. He cradles her with his good arm. Awkwardly unfolds the crumpled paper and reads: MOMMY AND DADDY ARE WITH US. CALL THE POLICE AND WE'LL KILL THEM BOTH. He stares at the note, dumbstruck. CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BEACH HOUSE - DAY A savage wind sweeps in off the ocean. Gulls wheel overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FORTY FOOT YACHT is tethered to a wooden dock outside the beach house. Milo and his crew prepare to cast off. Meanwhile:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PABLO approaches along the dock, looking lean and mean in an Izod shirt. He stops in front of Sarah and Joe Hallenbeck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They are seated on the dock. Each handcuffed to a metal railing. Pablo kneels and unfastens Joe's cuffs.
</DIRECTION>
<PABLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go fuck yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pablo delivers a savage kick to Hallenbeck's ribs. Hallenbeck gasps in pain.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I meant that... in a good way...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pablo hauls him to his feet. Props him against the railing.
</DIRECTION>
<PABLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Time for a little payback, Joe. Call it a service to dear departed Chet.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He slams a fist into Hallenbeck's middle. Sarah cries out in alarm.
</DIRECTION>
<PABLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's that feel, fuckhead?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(weakly)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm asshole... she's fuckhead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And with that, Pablo lets him have it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Rains punches on his chest and gut. Slams an elbow into his kidneys. Drives a knee into his groin. Joe hits the deck. Milo calls out from the boat:
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Easy, Pablo. I want him conscious.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pablo is kicking Joe's prone form.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn you, stop it!! Oh, Jesus, leave him alone!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pablo gives Joe a last swift kick. Spits on him. Hallenbeck vomits. Lies bleeding on the dock. Sarah crawls over to him. As far as the cuffs will allow. Cradles his head in her lap.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't... look at me...
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shhh. It's okay, Joe. I'm here, it's okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(strokes his hair)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you, Joe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck looks at her like she's just grown three heads.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I get the shit beat out of me... puke all over myself... and now you love me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never stopped loving you, Joe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ, you slept with three guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You knew about the others?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I knew.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You never said anything.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Figured... you needed them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe, Goddammit, why didn't you say something?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like what? 'Fuck you, Sarah'?
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes. Fuck you, Sarah! Anything to show that you... that you had some pride left.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. Then Hallenbeck heaves a sigh.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry... I'm fresh out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm scared, Joe. Get me out of this.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Must be my trick ear. Sounded like you said, 'Get me out of this.'
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can take these guys, Joe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got cracked ribs and a concussion.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Save me, Joe. Be a hero.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't believe in heroes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's no excuse.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He stares up at her for a moment. Then, through bloody lips:
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you, Sarah...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And he smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, Milo signals from the boat. Seeing, this, Pablo approaches the couple again.
</DIRECTION>
<PABLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right, lovebirds, break it up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He yanks Sarah to her feet. Lets his gaze roam up and down her body.
</DIRECTION>
<PABLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice tits.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He rips open her blouse. Roughly fondles her breasts. Hallenbeck. On the ground. He growls with fury. Starts to push himself up.
</DIRECTION>
<PABLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stay down, fucker. Don't you move.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
At that moment, Milo comes striding down the dock. Whistling cheerfully.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Careful, Pablo. We don't want to get Mrs. Hallenbeck all excited in front of hubby.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He squats next to Joe.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello, Joseph, guess what? Time to go, and remember: you follow orders, or the missus pays the price.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're gonna kill us both anyway.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Perhaps. But there are ways to die, and then there are... ways to die. Capisce? You determine your wife's fate.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He yanks Hallenbeck to his feet. Propels him toward the boat. As her husband is being led away, Sarah calls out:
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Joe...!
	</DIALOGUE>
</PABLO>
<DIRECTION>
He stops. Turns. Looks at her. Boys and girls, there is, within Joe Hallenbeck, a spark: Tiny. Fizzling. Almost gone. But now, looking at his wife, that spark unexpectedly kindles -- And eight years melt away. Just like that. The old Joe Hallenbeck looks his wife in the eye and says, with deadly calm:
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll be back.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a promise.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Milo clubs Joe in the head with his pistol.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're wasting my time, Joseph. Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck turns. Dirty. Tired. Unshaven. Bloody. He looks at Milo... and grins:
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you touch me again... I'll kill you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They stare into each other's eyes. Hallenbeck does not give an inch. Milo hits him again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. TOPANGA CANYON HOME - DAY Remember Jimmy's friend, Henry, who we met briefly near the opening of the film? Of course you do, you're a highly-paid reader or development person. Well, Henry is seated in a big, lived-in den watching football films. The walls around him are adorned with hunting paraphernalia. Rifles. Trophies. There is a KNOCK at the door. He gets up. Crosses to the door. Opens it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And Jimmy Dix is there. He gets right to the point:
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I need to borrow a gun, Henry.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. EXPENSIVE, WOOD-PANELED OFFICE - AFTERNOON Conrad Marcon sits behind a huge teak desk. Surrounded by football paraphernalia. Paintings. Trophies. The PHONE CHIRPS. He picks up the receiver. Stabs a button.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Marcon.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
INTERCUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SHIPBOARD - MILO
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's Milo, sir. We're now underway and should be lying off Catalina within two hours.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good boy, Milo. The commissioner's party starts at six. I'll put in a token appearance around six-thirty.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Very good, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any problems with Hallenbeck?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, we're getting along famously.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Glad to hear it. No fuckups, Milo. I want him deep-sixed.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I assure you, neither he nor the senator will see another sunrise.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ, Milo, how come you always have to talk like a fruit?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If it annoys you, I could always adopt a Texas drawl, though I'm afraid I don't know any stories about fucking pigs. Sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cows, Milo. Never pigs.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll remember that, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He hangs up. Marcon replaces the receiver and chuckles.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddamn fruitcake.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns, and suddenly we realize he's not alone in the room: a STRANGE MAN is seated in the shadows off to one side. His face is obscured... Marcon addresses him:
</DIRECTION>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So far, so good.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Man in the corner nods, then speaks. As he does, we notice he has a speech impediment; it sounds like he's talking with his mouth full.
</DIRECTION>
<STRANGE_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've worked too hard, Con. There's no margin for error.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take it easy, buddy. We're covered.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MARCON>
<STRANGE_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're using the first team, yes?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Actually, I have no choice.
	</DIALOGUE>
<STRANGE_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How's that?

<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuckin' Hallenbeck killed the second and third teams.

EXT. LONG BEACH BOAT YARD - AFTERNOON A sign reads, BOAT RENTALS: DAY AND WEEK. Jimmy moves briskly down a concrete ramp toward a Hatteras sport charter. He is obsessed. Determined. Darian trots along behind him. She's holding up pretty well, considering.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you need a boat for?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna crash a party out on Catalina. Marcon will be there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He swings a bag of gear onto the boat. Starts to store it.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe... we should call the police.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, honey. Not now. There's some big shots involved in this mess, and it's my word against theirs. If I blab to the cops, your mom and dad will disappear and they'll never find the bodies.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, Darian.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DARIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(about to cry)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So... what do we do...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What I do... is confront Conrad Marcon and threaten to go to the cops, unless he gives them back.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is that gonna work?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beats me, but I think it's what your dad would do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm scared.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me, too, honey.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
His gear stashed, he turns to Darian. Tries a smile.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So... why'd you come to me, anyhow?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know. I thought you'd... know what happened, know what to do...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I mean, you were one of my dad's big heroes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy almost chokes...
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When I was little, he used to talk about you all the time. Best football player in the game. Great this. Wonderful that. You shoulda seen him when you got busted.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy stares straight ahead. Takes a deep breath.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll get them back, kiddo. I'll get them back.

EXT. CATALINA ISLAND - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT The island sits beneath a dark, cloud-filled sky. Fog nestles in the foothills, rolling in off the ocean.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CATALINA FERRY slices through the murk, filled with light, laughter, MUSIC.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON SHORE Boats are arriving at a private dock. A steady stream of guests. Tuxedoes and evening gowns. A parade of phony hair and phony boobs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All mounting the stairs to a huge chalet. Inside, a dinner party is in progress.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OPULENT LIVING ROOM - PARTY in progress. People with six-figure incomes. Pretending they're important. Mingling. Schmoozing. At a raised bar, Conrad Marcon bends the ear of a Japanese businessman. A lot of laughter. Back-slapping. A sudden commotion near the front door. FLASHBULBS POP. People crane their necks. Marcon turns to look, as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SENATOR CALVIN BAYNARD enters the party, surrounded by an entourage of men in Armani suits. Seeing this, Marcon's face changes. Gone is the affable Texan. In his place, a ruthless murderer. He smiles. CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AUTOMATIC RIFLE as a thirty-shot clip is snapped into place.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. FORTY-FOOT YACHT - CABIN - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Milo is preparing the weapon. He works the action. Pumps a round into the chamber. Looks up at Hallenbeck, who is bound hand and foot. Seated across from him in the boat's cabin.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your wife's very pretty.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you, cocksucker.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My, my. Little testy this evening.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He pulls a switchblade out of his Windbreaker.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not very polite, you know, calling someone a cocksucker. A lot of hard Ks. Very abusive sounding.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck says nothing.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would you do, Joseph, if someone called you that? Would you cut out one of his eyes...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nope.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would you do?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd go off and suck some cock and leave him the fuck alone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Milo studies Hallenbeck the way a museum curator might study a new species of fish.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It occurs to me, Joseph, that I would very much like to hear you scream.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come again?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're so cool, aren't you? So... if you'll pardon the expression... hard-boiled. I'd like, just once, to hear you scream in pain.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Play some rap music.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Milo chuckles, shakes his head.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fascinating.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When do I kill Baynard?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(laughs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come now, Joseph, did you really think that I'd hand you a loaded gun?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not really going to kill anyone.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He leans forward.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're going to be framed for the senator's murder... when they find your corpse at the scene of the crime.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PRIVATE DOCK - NIGHT Boats, lots of them. Sportfishers. Yachts. Floating boats. Money, money, everywhere, and plenty of drinks to drop.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HATTERAS SPORT BOAT PURRS quietly into the harbor. Jimmy at the rudder. Nudges up to the dock. In the chalet above, the party rages.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SERIES OF SHOTS - JIMMY'S PREPARATION
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy lashes the boat. Goes below. Grabs a tuxedo from the closet. Stands, dressed, in front of the mirror. Opens a box. Removes a 9 millimeter Baretta. Works the slide. Jacks a bullet into the cylinder. Stashes it in the waistband of his pants: In back. Concealed by the tuxedo. Studies his own grim face in the mirror.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, hot shit, let's do it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DECK - NIGHT Jimmy emerges from the cabin. Heads for the rail. A voice calls out:
</DIRECTION>
<DARIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nice tux.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns, and sees Darian Hallenbeck. Peeking her head out from under a tarpaulin.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddammit, I told you to go home!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you, I stowed away. They're my parents, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy shakes his head. Exasperated.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine, whatever. Just stay here. With the boat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARIAN>
<DIRECTION>
Darian starts to protest. He throws her the keys.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Anything funny happens, get the fuck out of here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Darian takes the keys. Frowns, says:
</DIRECTION>
<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look terrible.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I feel terrible.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you really a drug addict?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was. I kicked the habit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This morning. Stay here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He swings over the side, onto the dock.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't let them break your other arm.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, kid. You're a fuckin' inspiration.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DARIAN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MILO'S YACHT - CABIN - SAME TIME Milo speaks to Hallenbeck. Clipped. Businesslike.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	At eight-fifteen, Senator Baynard will leave the party, hopefully unobserved. He and his entourage will board a fast boat, and rendezvous with us at sea.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus. He thinks he's geting his two-million-dollar payoff.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Milo nods. Points to two identical suitcases in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Baynard will not leave his boat. One of his men will board us, and inspect the contents of the suitcase. This suitcast.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He opens one of the cases. Hallenbeck stares.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS Twenty thousand of them, to be precise. Neatly bundled.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then we pull a simple switch. When the man returns to his boat, he's carrying this suitcase.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He points to the identical twin.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Plastics?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MILO>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Detonation upon opening. Enough to kill the passengers, not enough to sink the craft.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(smiles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And when we place your charred corpse amidst the wreckage, the police will draw the inevitable conclusion: a down-on-his-luck P.I. makes a suicide strike against the man who cost a career.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That sounds lovely, but how is my body gonna get charred?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
With a flourish, Milo pulls aside a tablecloth. Under the table is a five gallon can of gasoline.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe I'll get to hear you scream, after all...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, one of Milo's crew sticks his head in the door.
</DIRECTION>
<CREW_MEMBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You better get up here, we got a problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. YACHT - ON DECK - NIGHT Milo's yacht is anchored about a half mile offshore. Island lights blink in the distance. Fog rolls in. Milo emerges from the cabin onto the deck. Crosses to the railing, looks down at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FISHING BOAT bobbing in the water about thirty yards away. A FISHERMAN is waving his arms. Hailing them. Beside him, his wife and seventeen-year-old son.
</DIRECTION>
<FISHERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Buddy, I got a cracked engine casing, I'm dead in the water! Can I get a tow?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Milo swears under his breath. Calls out:
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, sir. This boat is Island Security, we're under strict orders to stay within this sector.
	</DIALOGUE>
<FISHERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aw, shit! Look, it'll take ten minutes!
	</DIALOGUE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm sorry, we can't help you.
	</DIALOGUE>
<FISHERMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddammit, now I gotta call the Coast Guard!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Milo's crewman steps up to the rail. Speaks urgently:
</DIRECTION>
<CREW_MEMBER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Milo, he's gonna bring the Coast Guard down on top of us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Milo ponders for maybe three seconds. Then he calls out:
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me. Sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Fisherman turns. His family beside him.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches under his Windbreaker. Pulls out an Ingram model MACHINE GUN. OPENS FIRE. The entire family is blown away. WOOD SPLINGERS POP and fly. GLASS SHATTERS. The bodies topple like broken toys. Milo ceases fire. Turns to his crewman.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Problem solved. Get over there and put the bodies below where they can't be seen.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He saunters away as if nothing unusual has occurred.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARTY HOUSE - NIGHT Jimmy is strolling along a hedge behind the house. Looking for a back entrance. He hears VOICES, approaching. Pulls up short. Ducks into the shadows. Senator Baynard goes by, with two bodyguards. Brisk. Businesslike.
</DIRECTION>
<SENATOR>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Christ, I can't believe I agreed to this dog and pony show. Let's get it over with.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The head for the boats. Jimmy stares after them, mind racing. Makes a decision: heads for the boats. Following Baynard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT./EXT. JIMMY'S BOAT - NIGHT Jimmy casts off the lines. Heads for the cockpit. Darian is inside.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gimmee the keys, kiddo.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where are you going?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The Senator's here, and he's leaving by the back door. I'm gonna follow him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He keys the ignition.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get off the boat.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you, man. No way.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Darian, Goddammit --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
She runs below decks.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not coming out!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy looks up: The Senator's boat, a sleek, powerful Marlineer, is even now pulling out of the cove.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Shit. Okay. Easy. Shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He throttles forward. The Hatteras pulls away from the dock. CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SKY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sound of THUNDERING ROTORS, as a refitted Bell Cobra HELICOPTER cuts through the night sky over Catalina. Banks sharply, cruises offshore.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. COCKPIT - SAME The PILOT works the stick while the CO-PILOT searches the water below through infra-red binoculars. He speaks into a microphone.
</DIRECTION>
<CO_PILOT>

<MALE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)

INTERCUT WITH:

<DIRECTION>
MILO'S YACHT - SAME TIME Milo is at the other end of the connection. Beside him, two crewmen.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Roger, Air One, over and out.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(replaces the mike)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Up anchor, gentlemen, we have a go.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(points to Hallenbeck)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gag him and stash him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As Milo goes topside, one of the men tapes Joe's mouth. The other opens a cramped storage compartment. They stuff him inside. Shut and lock the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT About two miles offshore. The Senator's Marlineer cuts through the waves, converging with Milo's yacht. The two boats pull up alongside. The lines are made fast. One of Milo's crewmen greets Senator Baynard's AIDE, a slick-looking Italian in a $1,000 overcoat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Baynard's man hops from one boat to the other. Boarding Milo's yacht. Meanwhile --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OFFSHORE WATERS - IN FOGBANK Jimmy Dix is clearly lost. He bangs his fist in frustration.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Goddammit, I lost him. I can't see a fucking thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See if this boat has sonar.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah, little Miss Know-It-All.

<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you.

They're clearly having no fun. CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MILO'S YACHT - CABIN - SAME TIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The payoff is in progress. One of Milo's crewmen carries the suitcase over to the wall. Places it on a built-in counter. Underneath the suitcase is a half-finished jigsaw puzzle. Off to one side is a half-empty coffee container. The case is opened. Greenbacks galore. Baynard's Aide whistles softly. Examines the stacks of bills. Nods, satisfied.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. We're cool.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Just then Milo enters the cabin. Adopts a harsh New York accent as he angrily barks:
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey! Any of you stupid fucks bother to frisk this goombah?
	</DIALOGUE>
<CREWMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sir, we didn't think --
	</DIALOGUE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Exactly, you didn't think! Goddammit, that's two million bucks there, now frisk the fuckin' guy!
	</DIALOGUE>
<AIDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, baby, I'm clean, take it easy --
	</DIALOGUE>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck easy. Against the wall, spread 'em!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
As Baynard's man assumes the position -- Milo hits a concealed button. It happen in less than a second: the built-in counter rotates into the wall, only to be replaced by an indentical counter. Identical half-finished jigsaw puzzle. Identical coffee cup. And, of course, the identical suitcase. The indignant Aide turns around, pat-down concluded.
</DIRECTION>
<AIDE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay? Satisfied?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Milo smiles apologetically.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're cool, baby.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He hands over the suitcase.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TOPSIDE Baynard's man emerges onto the deck, carrying the suitcase. Steps over the rail, crossing to the Senator's boat. Gives a thumbs up to the men waiting there. They cast off the lines. Freeing the two boats. INT. MILO'S YACHT - BRIDGE Milo watches, tense. As the lines are freed, he says:
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hard to starboard, get us out of here. Back off a hundred yards and wait for the blast.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MILO>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SENATOR'S CABIN - SAME TIME The go-between heads below deck, carrying the suitcase. Senator Baynard puts down his wine glass. Looks up, expectant. The Aide flashes an "A-Okay" grin. Sets the suitcase on a table. Meanwhile --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. JIMMY'S SPORT BOAT - BRIDGE Jimmy has had about enough. He sighs with frustration. Stares ahead into the fog.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All we're doing is burning gas. Sorry, kid, I'm turning back.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The words are barely out of his mouth when he hears a throbbing NOISE, growing louder... Darian looks up puzzled.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you hear that -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And with that --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AIR ONE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
bursts from the fog. Directly in front of them. Hovers like an avenging angel, TURBINES SCREAMING --
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy fucking shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Rotor wash sprays in every direction. The noise is deafening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. AIR ONE - COCKPIT The PILOT grabs the mike and shouts into it:

INT. MILO'S YACHT - BRIDGE Milo snaps his head to one side, hearing this. Grabs the mike:

<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE Jimmy's BOAT ROARS out of the fog... And suddenly he's in a world of shit. Less than fifty yards to port is Milo's yacht. Fifty years to starboard is the Senator's Marlineer.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, wow. We're fucked.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He GUNS the ENGINE. Spins the wheel, banks to port.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AIR ONE screams past, cutting across the bow, nearly taking off the roof -- Jimmy, wrestling the wheel, and meanwhile --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BAYNARD'S CABIN The Senator actually has his hands on the suitcase to open it, when one of his MEN yells:
</DIRECTION>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit! Something's going on.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BAYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Another boat. It's a fucking setup!
	</DIALOGUE>
<BAYNARD>

	Get us out of here, now!

EXT. HIGH SEAS Baynard's Marlineer surges forward. Full throttle, heading for shore, as --

INT. STORAGE COMPARTMENT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck's face goes through various stages of shock. It's nothing compared to when he hears:
</DIRECTION>
<CREWMAN>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's a little girl with him!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
With that, he goes berserk. Draws his legs back, thunders them against the compart- ment doors. Kicks with all his might. Over and over like a crazed horse, as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TOPSIDE Air One does a flyby, circling, awaiting instructions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON DECK Milo grabs the hand mike and says:
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Air One, Air One, follow the Senator, roger? I'll take the sport boat, you take Baynard, over.
	</DIALOGUE>
<AIR_ONE>

(V.O.)

	<DIALOGUE>
	That's a roger. Over and out.

	Okay, let's go. Full throttle.

<DIRECTION>
INT. YACHT - SAME TIME With a final, resounding crash, Hallenbeck kicks open the compartment. Topples out onto the cabin floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Works his bound hands over his knees so they're now tied in front of him. Everybody's topside; for the moment, at least, he is forgotten. He half crawls, half lurches over to the kitchen nook. Worms beneath the table... awkward, desperate... Drags out the can of gasoline. Tries to unscrew the top. No dice. Can't get a grip. Finally, in frustration, he tips the can on its side. Brings his legs up in the air -- Slams them down on the can. Over and over until, with a metallic pop -- ! it bursts. Floods gasoline over the carpet, meanwhile:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TOPSIDE Milo's yacht is plowing ahead, gaining on Jimmy's Hatteras. The crew members take up positions on the prow. OPEN FIRE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WITH JIMMY As he throws Darian to the deck, shields her with his body. The wheelhouse is RAKED by GUNFIRE. He grits his teeth. Reaches beneath his tux. Yanks out the BERETTA and returns FIRE, BAM -- BAM -- ! and meanwhile:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. YACHT CABIN Hallenbeck is opening a box of kitchen matches with his teeth. Dozens of matches fall scattered on the carpet. He releases the box. Bends. Picks up a single match in his teeth. Presses his face to the wall. Gives his neck a wrench -- Lights the match. He drops the match on top of the GAS CAN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A WHOOSH of combustion. It bursts into flame. Joe swivels around. Balancing on his backside. Thrusts his legs into the fire. Strains. Pulls. Sweat runs in rivers. Until the ropes binding his legs snap. He lurches to his feet, lets free. Now there's only one problem: He's on fire. The legs of his pants are soaked with gas. Flames race up his legs. He plunges headlong up the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON TO DECK where he hurtles toward the rail, dives -- into the sea, swallowed by the waves. A CREWMAN suddenly screams:
</DIRECTION>
<CREWMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fire in the hole!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Fire, indeed. It's a rapidly-spreading blaze. The pursuit is momentarily forgotten as the crew races to put out the fire, and meanwhile:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HALLENBECK surfaces, gasping for air. Trying to swim with his hands tied.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DARIAN spots him first. Sees her father bobbing like a cork in the ocean, screams:
</DIRECTION>
<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Daddy!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy whirls around, startled.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit. I don't believe it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do something! Hurry!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy spins the wheel. Banks hard to port. Brings the boat around in an arc. Yells to Darian:
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep the wheel like this! Don't let it move!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She grabs the wheel. Jimmy bends down. Opens a compart- ment. Takes out the boat's anchor. Metal hook, attached to seventy yards of chain. He hefts it like a grappling hook.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Third and long, baby, lets' go...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And, sure, his left arm isn't his good arm -- But, boy, does he heave that anchor. It soars through space, chain playing out behind it... Hits water, thirty yards past Hallenbeck -- Who turns, sees the anchor skimming toward him over the waves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MILO'S YACHT Milo, meanwhile, has also spotted Hallenbeck. He growls in rage. Hefts the Ingram machine gun, as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE Hallenbeck thrusts forward, hooks his bound hands around the passing anchor and whoosh -- !
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He is catapulted forward, jerked like a rag puppet. BULLETS CHOP the water where he just was. He skims over the waves. Bounced. Battered. Trailing behind Jimmy at fifty miles an hour. Jimmy and Darian begin to haul him in. Struggling. Straining. The boat rushing headlong, driverless. With a last, desperate surge of energy -- They drag Hallenbeck over the side. Into the boat.
</DIRECTION>
<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dad...!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She collapses, weeping, atop her father. Hugs him for all she's worth.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the hell's she doing here??
	</DIALOGUE>
<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I stowed away...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
GUNFIRE splits the air. Reminds them they're not out of the woods.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILO'S YACHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is behind them again. The fire is out. The chase is on. It steadily cuts the distance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIMMY'S BOAT Hallenbeck staggers to his feet.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get below, Darian. And stay there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He stumbles into the wheelhouse. Dazed. Barely conscious.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got any ideas?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. Go really fast and hope they don't catch us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, shit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fog bank, dead ahead. Hang on.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Into the fog they go, and, folks -- This is really scary. Because you can't see a foot in front of your face. They plunge through the fog at fifty miles an hour. Hallenbeck sweats, eyes glued to the windshield.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And then a shape materializes off to port: Milo's yacht. Running alongside. Drawing closer. Hallenbeck wrestles the wheel. No dice. The yacht draws ever closer... men on deck... machine guns... Joe looks over... and his face tells the story:
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're dead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Except, just then, a strange thing happens: Milo's yacht veers off to the left. Away from Hallenbeck. Jimmy stares, dumbfounded.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the fuck? They're peeling off. Why?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A pause... then it hits Joe like a thunderbolt:
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	'Cause they got sonar, that's why! Hard to port!
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Port?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Left, Goddammit.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The boat slews to the left, as, from out of the fog --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Catalina ferry looms right in front of them.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit fuck piss!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They almost make it. As it is, they avoid a head-on. Instead, they hit broadside. A sickening CRUNCH -- ! Jimmy and Joe are thrown from their feet. A momentary glimpse of faces rushing past -- Horrified tourists -- And then the ferry is behind them. Jimmy gets up. Staggers to the controls. Pushes the throttle. The boat lurches forward -- Then SPUTTERS. Fizzles. He swears violently.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're on half power, we lost an engine!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. FOG BANK - SAME TIME The crippled boat chugs through the mist.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIMMY swears again. Bangs his fist.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're sitting ducks. They got sonar. They can find us.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill the running lights and radio the Coast Guard.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy flicks off the lights. Grabs the mike. As he does, a VIBRATING RUMBLE fills the cockpit, causing him to pause... and then stare in shock as their boat emerges from the fog -- And Air One hovers directly overhead.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The two men watch, helpless, as the helicopter descends, the Co-Pilot taking aim with a LAWS rocket.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get down!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
They both hit the floor. Hands over their heads -- And then the pilot makes a costly error: He descends right into the path of Milo's yacht. With no warning whatsoever, the boat comes bursting out of the fog -- PLOWS right INTO the HELICOPTER. Second number one: The boat pierces the chopper, rips it to shreds. Second number two: The whole boat-slash-chopper mix erupts in a shower of wood and fiberglass. Turns night into day.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JIMMY AND JOE are still huddled on the floor. Pause. They look up. Bewildered. There was a big light... Big noise... Why aren't they dead?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE They move like sleepwalkers to the cockpit window. Stare in disbelief. Joe looks at Jimmy. Jimmy at Joe. Debris rains down. CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. CRASH SITE - MINUTES LATER Jimmy, Joe and Darian are on deck, chugging through the wreckage. Darian clings to her father's arm, in shock. Hallenbeck sees something in the distance. Squints:
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy looks: A bright object... going in circles...
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Baynard's boat!
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It can get us to shore faster than this one, don't you think?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He starts to turn away. Notices something in the water. Speaks over his shoulder to Jimmy.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hand me the pole.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy hands him a long, wooden pole with a hooked end. He fishes in the water. Snares a large, floating object. Swings it aboard. Drops it at Jimmy's feet. The suitcase.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Birthday present.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He turns away. Jimmy bends to open the suitcase. Joe heads into the cockpit, Darian beside him. Steers the boat away from the crash site. Toward the senator's boat. Chugs forward on half an engine. O.S., Jimmy suddenly yells:
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Holy fucking shit!!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BAYNARD'S BOAT - SAME TIME The once-mighty Marlineer runs aimless circles in the mist. Half the cockpit is blown away, probably by a LAWS rocket. The Hatteras pulls up alongside, and Hallenbeck steps to the rail, carrying the Baretta.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He swings aboard the senator's boat. Gun cocked. Ready.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SENATOR'S BOAT - COCKPIT Enters the cockpit. What's left of the roof is bullet- pocked. The navigator is dead. Slumped over the controls. Joe pulls him off the panel. KILLS the ENGINE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MAIN CABIN Joe bursts inside. Hard and fast. Gun leveled. No need. It's a slaughterhouse. The walls are perforated. Baynard and his men are dead. The suitcase's evil twin lies unopened on the table. Hallenbeck walks over to Baynard's lifeless body. Stares into the wide-open eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, Cal. Life in the big city.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO: EXT. LONG BEACH BOAT RENTALS - NIGHT The senator's boat pulls up to the dock. No one is around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOCK - SAME TIME Hallenbeck crouches next to Darian, looks her in the eye.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen carefully. I'm gonna go get your mom back, okay? You're gonna go in the Denny's restaurant and stay there. Talk to the waitress but don't mention me. Mom and I will come pick you up later, got it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DARIAN>
<DIRECTION>
(crying)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	They're gonna kill you...!

	Are you kidding? I do this for a living.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Buy me an ice cream. I'll be back.

	I love you.

She throws her arms around him. CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. RENTAL SUBARU - DRIVING - NIGHT All business now. Deadly serious. Jimmy and Joe stare ahead through the windshield. Grim. Tense. In the back seat sits the coveted suitcase.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your prints are all over that boat. What happens when they find the bodies inside?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Quit being a fuckin' killjoy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He cuts the headlights. Cruises to a stop behind a road- side dumpster.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on. We've got some things to pick up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HALLENBECK'S HOUSE (WEST L.A.) - NIGHT They creep across a suburban lawn, hugging the shadows.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Across the street, Hallenbeck's house is dark. Deserted. Truly a sight: Jimmy, in a white shirt and tuxedo pants, nursing a broken arm; and Joe, drenched to the skin, pants hanging in scorched tatters. Joe suddenly puts up a restraining hand. They stop. Crouched behind a eucalyptus tree. Joe points:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THEIR POV A late-model Buick is parked just up the street from his house... There is a man slouched inside. Smoking.

(clears his throat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I forgot to tell you. The police want you for killing Mike Miller.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck shoots him a withering look. CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. COASTAL WATERS - NIGHT A Coast Guard cutter is circling the site of the boat/ chopper crash. A uniformed ENSIGN shines a light on the dark waters.
</DIRECTION>
<ENSIGN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I got someone! Four o'clock!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
MILO is draped over a piece of wooden wreckage. Half his hair is burned away. His face is blistered. He looks up, pleading, at the Ensign, as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE He hides the Ingram beneath his body, cocked and ready. CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. PARKED BUICK - NIGHT The sour stakeout cop reaches for a job necessity: the pot to piss in. He undoes his fly. Pees into an old Maxwell House coffee can. Opens the door to dump it out. A hand reaches in, lightning quick. Grabs the can, throws it back in his face. As he jerks backward, blinded, the hand knocks him cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BUICK - SAME TIME Hallenbeck drags the unconscious cop from the car.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's get him inside and tie him up.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you crazy? That's a cop! You don't punch cops!
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I forgot. Hurry up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLENBECK'S BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER The cop is bound and gagged in the corner. Unconscious. Hallenbeck moves hurriedly. Not a second to waste. Pulls a dark turtleneck from a drawer. Rips off the sleeve. Throws it to Jimmy.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wear that.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He strips off his own shirt. Crosses to the closet.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know how to use a gun?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The trigger's the little black thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Here.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He hands Jimmy a shotgun and a box of odd, black cylinders.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Use these. They're shredders. Equipped with an explosive charge. When you fire the gun, they spray on impact. Take out anything within ten yards.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are you gonna use?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A little souvenir...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He reaches into the closet. Pulls out a sniper rifle. The rifle. The one responsible for the puckered scar on his chest.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Go bring the car around.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HALLENBECK'S HOUSE - SAME TIME Jimmy emerges, starts across the lawn. Pulls up short. Stares ahead at:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV - TWO BLACK SEDANS parked at the curb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE He starts to cry out -- And a dark figure looms behind him. Clubs him in the head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLENBECK'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME Hallenbeck snaps a full magazine into the rifle. Stuffs extras into a black Windbreaker. Hears a NOISE. Looks up, expecting Jimmy -- Draws a sharp breath:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PABLO AND ASSORTED GOONS standing in the doorway. All of them have guns. Pablo grins, shakes his head:
</DIRECTION>
<PABLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Face it, pal. You're fucked by God.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PAD AND PAPER as they're placed in front of Hallenbeck. He is seated on the bed. Three guns covering him. Beside him sits Furry Tom, grinning his stuffed-toy grin.
</DIRECTION>
<PABLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you a literate man, Joe?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I got a subscription to Jugs magazine.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PABLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's good. See, Joe, what you're gonna do, you're gonna write a little story.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A GOON sticks his head in the door.
</DIRECTION>
<GOON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We've got Jimmy Dix in the trunk.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PABLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get him out of here. Take him to Mr. Marcon. I'll follow you as soon as my business here is finished.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Goon departs, leaving Hallenbeck with Pablo and two others. He studies them. Calculates the odds. Verdict: Bad.
</DIRECTION>
<PABLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, you're gonna write a little story, Joe. About how guilt- stricken you are over Senator Baynard's death, which is all over the air waves, by the way. Yeah... you're so guilty about paying those hitmen to kill him, that you're gonna kill yourself.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, who's writing this story? You're doing all the good parts.
	</DIALOGUE>
<PABLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, and, Joe...? Don't forget to include how guilty you are over that cop you murdered.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What cop?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pablo draws his pistol. PUMPS TWO SHOTS into the unconscious cop in the corner.
</DIRECTION>
<PABLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That one.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You son of a bitch...!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pablo is making a big mistake, but he doesn't know it. He is fueling Joe Hallenbeck's rage. Pity the fool. Hallenbeck regards him with dead, lifeless eyes. A thoroughly unnerving stare.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Joe does something very odd. He says, softly:
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We don't like Pablo very much, do we, Furry Tom...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
There is a pause... And then, incredibly -- Furry Tom answers. A high-pitched, squeaky stuffed cat voice.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(as Furry Tom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, Mr. Hallenbeck, we think Pablo is a motherless fuck who takes it up the ass.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Dead silence. Pablo is completely thrown; so are we, for that matter... and then it hits us: Joe is doing ven- triloquism.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
And the funny thing is, he's really good. Pablo overcomes his shock.
</DIRECTION>
<PABLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, is he doing that?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck's face remains cold. Expressionless.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Furry Tom, tell Pablo what I'm gonna do to him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(as Furry Tom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're gong to make Pablo eat all his teeth, Mr. Hallenbeck.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Pablo can't help it. He bursts out laughing.
</DIRECTION>
<PABLO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's amazing, man!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck picks up Furry Tom. Inserts his hand, makes the furry head bob back and forth.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(as Furry Tom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Mr. Hallenbeck, they're laughin' at me. That's not very nice.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
By now, all three hoods are in hysterics.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you mad, Furry Tom?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(as Furry Tom)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't get mad. I get even.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And, with that, Furry Tom's mouth opens -- And EXPLODES, showering stuffing. One of the goons is still laughing when he realizes half his throat is gone... And Furry Thomas BELCHES FIRE again, and the second goon goes down in a spray of blood, and if you haven't guessed already -- Joe has a gun hidden inside Furry Thomas. Pablo is a little sharper. A little quicker. He dives forward, knocks the puppet from Joe's hand. Joe drives upward, into Pablo's gut. They reel across the room. Locked in combat. Lamps topple. GLASS BREAKS. Pablo slams Joe's head into the wall. Leaves a dent. Does it again, a sickening impact... Starts to strangle Joe -- And the truth is, Joe's not thirty anymore. He's not going to make it. The world swims away. Then, as if through a tunnel, Joe notices something beside him... something hanging on the wall. Fights to focus. Breath gone. Strength gone. Identifies the object:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
His Presidential Medal of Valor. Shiny medal. Shiny ribbon. His name... It hits him quite suddenly: The medal has sharp edges. With the last of his strength, he plucks it from the wall. Drives it into Pablo's throat. The big man stumbles backward. Eyes wide. Gurgling. He thrashes, the red-white-blue ribbon flapping obscenely from his gushing neck. Drops to the dusty carpet. Dies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck takes a deep breath. Eyes wide. Insane. He is surrounded by corpses. He takes another deep breath. Picks up the sniper rifle. Slings it over his shoulder. Heads for the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CONRAD MARCON'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Jimmy Dix is on the floor, and Marcon is kicking him savagely. Pointed alligator boots lashing out. Again and again.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCON>

Jimmy curls up in a fetal ball. Marcon paces, shaking his head.

Marcon raises the poker. Brings it down on Jimmy's broken arm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT Hallenbeck leaves the rented Subaru by the side of the road. He is dressed in combat black. Government issue. Rifle over one shoulder. Hunting knife in a hip scabbard. Like an angel of death, he moves into the brush. Heading down the canyon.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MARCON'S HOME - SAME TIME An armed sentry patrols the grounds. Below him, nighttime L.A. stretches to the Pacific. Joe Hallenbeck emerges like a wraith from the trees. Clamps a gloved hand over the sentry's mouth. Drives the hunting knife into his back.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME Marcon stirs the fireplace logs, stoking the blaze. Replaces the poker. Crosses to his desk and sits. Jimmy is on the carpet, delirious. Out of it. Marcon presses a button. An armed HARDGUY appears.
</DIRECTION>
<HARDGUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Marcon?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's nothing, he can't hurt us. Take him somewhere and kill him.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HARDGUY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Hardguy crosses the room. Grips Jimmy by the shoulders. With a soft SPIT of sound, his forehead blooms crimson. He collapses, lifeless. At his desk, Marcon whirls, stunned, as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JOE HALLENBECK steps through the French doors behind him. He resembles nothing human. A demon in black. Eyes burning. Gun held loosely. An extension of his arm. Marcon reaches for the button to summon help.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He jams the rifle barrel into Marcon's throat, nearly crushing his larynx. Hisses:
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The gun is silenced, I'll fuckin' kill you. Where's my wife?
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I... I don't remember, I...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe shoves on the gun. The barrel chokes him.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Grabs a pen. Shoves it in Marcon's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The address. Now!
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's... Milo's film studio...
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Write it down, dumbfuck.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He speaks over his shoulder:
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jimmy, you okay...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy stirs.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hurts like hell.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Marcon finishes writing. Hallenbeck snatches up the address. Stows it in his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Connie, you're gonna walk us out of here, nice and easy, got it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you walk, Jimmy?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah... I think so -- Joe, behind you...!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Too late. A revolver is cocked a foot from Joe's head.
</DIRECTION>
<STRANGE_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drop it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
It's the same odd voice we heard earlier. The man with the speech impediment.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You drop it, asshole, or I kill Marcon.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The Strange Man chuckles.
</DIRECTION>
<STRANGE_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, but that won't work. I don't care if he lives or dies, now drop the gun.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. Once more, Joe calculates the odds. No dice. He places the rifle on the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<STRANGE_MAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walk over there by your friend, Joe.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck turns around... and, for once, his jaw drops. He's looking at a man he never thought he'd see again. A man who suffers from facial paralysis ever since his head bounced off the Georgetown turnpike eight years ago.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOUIS BAYNARD Son of the late senator. The right side of his face doesn't quite match the left. The muscles don't work. Hallenbeck recovers his composure. As Jimmy climbs to his feet, Joe walks over and stands next to him. Two gunmen appear behind them, covering the rear.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, Goddamn. How's the head, Lou?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BAYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
(STRANGE MAN)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Aside from permanent facial neuralgia, just lovely.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Next time, Lou, just say no.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit. This is the drunk guy you slugged, look what you did to his face!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Marcon, meanwhile, is positively livid. He snaps at Baynard:
</DIRECTION>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You son of a bitch, you were gonna let him kill me!
	</DIALOGUE>
<BAYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing more or less than you'd do for me, Conrad.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(turns)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I never thought I'd see you again, Joe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Speaking of which, what the fuck are you doing here?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BAYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Call it a financial partnership. For a price, I agreed to connect Mr. Marcon to the necessary people in Washington.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In other words, you dropped your father's name a bunch of times.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<BAYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
(ignores him)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But imagine my delight this morning, Joe, when Mr. Marcon informed me of a golden opportunity: a chance to kill my father and frame you for the crime... What can I say, inherit a fortune and humiliate you in the bargain, who could resist?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do I also have you to thank for dragging me into this mess?
	</DIALOGUE>
<BAYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
(sighs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It was I, unfortunately, who bought a forty-dollar bottle of champagne... spoke a little too freely to that hooker.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She wasn't a hooker, dickhead.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He should know, Jimmy. With a face like that, he's gotta be paying for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<BAYNARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can die fast or slow, so watch your mouth.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy chimes in:
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We'd rather watch yours. It's goofy-lookin'.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Marcon has had enough. He pounds his fist on the desk.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill them, Goddammit, waste 'em both!
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Any bright ideas, Joe?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gimmee a minute.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, could you give him a minute? He's trying to think of a way out of this.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BAYNARD>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them, the two hardguys COCK their GUNS. Jimmy sweats. He's scared shitless underneath. Hallenbeck clears his throat:
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know of course, Connie, that you're a dead man.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Marcon holds up his hand.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wait.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The gunmen lower their weapons.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's humor this asshole. What are you talking about?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing much, just that I made a phone call from the boat on the way in.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You called the cops? Fuck it, they can't prove a thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, but I didn't call the cops. I called the mob.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Marcon stares at him. Blinks.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, Connie, every year, the mob rakes in two and a half billion from football bookmaking. If you succeed in making gambling legal, all that money goes to the government.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't be surprised if they put out a contract on you. Of course, I might be able to call it off.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Marcon stares him down. A pause. Then Marcon smiles:
</DIRECTION>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's bluffing. He's not connected to the mob, what a load of horseshit. Nice try, asshole.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(waves his hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(plowing ahead)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then there's the matter of two million dollars. Or didn't you know that watertight suitcases float...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He once again looks Marcon in the eye.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've got your money, Connie. Stashed in the back of a rented Subaru. We'll take you to it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARCON>
<DIRECTION>
(laughing)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jesus, I don't believe it. This guy's a riot.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
(sotto)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't think it's working, Joe. Try another one.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell, I'm fresh out. You wanna try one, kid, go for it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. Then, without warning, Jimmy turns -- And slugs Hallenbeck with his good arm. Decks him.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fuck you, Joe, I'm not just gonna stand here and die. Mr. Marcon, he's lying. We do have the money, but it's not in a car, it's in a storage locker. I have the key on me. I'l hand it over if you let me go.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck stares in disbelief. The kid's actually trying something.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where is the key, Jimmy?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's stashed in my shorts.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARCON>
<DIRECTION>
(nods)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	All right. Slow and easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure. Slow and easy.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy reaches inside his jeans. Slowly, cautiously pulls something out, concealed in his fist. We see, but Marcon doesn't: It's a shredder shell. He holds it in his fist.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Promise you'll let me go.
	</DIALOGUE>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hell with that, son. Hand it over or I'll have you kneecapped.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah? Well, that's too bad. See, it's one of those new plastic keys. The kind that melt...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
And, with that, he hurls it into the fire. So fast that nobody can see just what he threw.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess nobody gets the money.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
The two hardguys rush to the fireplace.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pull it out of there!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
One of them grabs a pair of tongs -- and the SHREDDER EXPLODES. Sprays the two hardguys. Cuts them to ribbons. Then, several things happen at once: Everybody goes for a gun. Hallenbeck lunges, scoops up a fallen pistol -- As Marcon draws his GUN and FIRES, missing -- Joe RETURNS FIRE, BAM-BAM -- ! Catches Marcon in the shoulder, and meanwhile --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Baynard draws down on Jimmy, who picks up a flaming log and hurls it, knocks the SHOT wild, as: Marcon darts out the French doors, into the night, so Hallenbeck spins, FIRES at Baynard -- Blows him backward in a bloody spray. Baynard sags against the mantel. Collapses, dead. ECHOES. Silence. Jimmy and Joe are alone with three corpses. Jimmy snatches up a pistol. Joe slings the sniper rifle over his shoulder. Stares at Jimmy:
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Plastic keys...? The kind that melt?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey. Short notice, best I could do.
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You did fine, junior.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Learned it from a pro. Come on.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MARCON'S HOUSE - NIGHT The wooden garage DOORS EXPLODE outward, bursting to splinters, as a Ford BRONCO DRIVES right THROUGH them, Conrad Marcon at the wheel. He careens off into the night. Makes a getaway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GARAGE - SAME TIME Jimmy and Joe come racing out of the house, just in time to see Marcon's taillights disappearing up the canyon.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son of a bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forget about him. Let's get my wife.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He crosses to a parked Mercedes. SHOOTS open the door. Gets in. Pops the ignition package. Hotwires it. The CAR ROARS to life.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get in.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He's so slick, it's scary.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. MARCON'S HOUSE - SAME TIME The Mercedes barrels out through the splintered garage doors. BURNS RUBBER down the hill.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR - DRIVING They stare straight ahead. Tense. Breathless.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On my way, honey, on my way...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT Conrad Marcon, meanwhile, is rocketing along the winding road, heading up the canyon, when he sees something ahead:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HIS POV - JOE'S RENTAL SUBARU sitting abandoned in the roadside brush.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BACK TO SCENE Acting on a sudden hunch, he SLAMS ON the BRAKES. Stops the car. Gets out, crosses to the rental. Peeks in. A two-million-dollar suitcase sits, pretty as punch, on the back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<MARCON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, Joe Boy, you wasn't bluffing...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He draws his gun. Blows out the glass. Reaches in. Opens the car door. Snatches up the briefcase. CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOWNTOWN HOLLYWOOD - NIGHT A block of seedy-looking brick buildings. Off Sunset. Not many people at this hour.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MERCEDES slews around the corner races down the street, running without headlights. Lurches to a halt near the mouth of an alley. Jimmy and Joe burst from the car, guns in hand. Hellenbeck is grim, purposeful. Jimmy is nervous.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm new at this, Joe. How do we do it?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We get in, we get out. Shoot anyone who's not my wife. Check that: Don't shoot me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He jacks a fresh clip into his rifle. CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOCKPICK inserted in the latch of a back door. Hallenback finds the tumblers. Springs the lock in seconds.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jimmy and Joe. Side by side. Walking. Expressionless. They round a bend in the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SENTRY seated outside a wooden door. .38 special in a shoulder rig. Sees them, leaps to his feet, gun clearing leather -- Joe blows him out of his socks. TWO-SHOT BURST. Silenced. Guy hits the wall. Paints it with blood. Flops, dead. Jimmy and Joe step over him. Joe braces himself. Draws back his foot. Kicks the door, as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STUDIO - SAME TIME The door flies open. Doesn't hit the wall. Something stops it. Joe doesn't blink. He puts the rifle against the panel. FIRES three SHOTS through the wood. Keeps going. A body falls out from behind the door. Joe doesn't even look. The body sits up. Not dead yet... Jimmy comes through the door. SHOOTS him. Follows Joe.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
One more door to go. Thick. Soundproofed metal. It isn't locked. Joe yanks it open. Steps inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MOVIE SET Lights. Camera. The wrong kind of action.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARAH on a bed, naked. bright lights on her. Around her, a director. A cameraman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MAN with a chainsaw.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
and he's standing right over her. Jimmy BLOWS down the two artistes. Joe takes the actor.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He throws the hunting knife. It pierces the guy's neck. The chainsaw clatters to the floor. He does the funny little dance peculiar to those with pierced necks. Falls. Dies. And then, mercifully, it's over. Joe crosses to the bed, puts out an arm, and Sarah collapses against him, shaking with sobs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He strokes her hair. Speaking softly. Quietly. Speaking to the only woman he's ever loved:
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm here... it's all right... I'm here...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He cradles his wife in the middle of a slaughterhouse. CUT TO: EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT Sarah is now dressed, as Joe supports her across the sidewalk toward the stolen Mercedes. He turns to Jimmy. Hands him a set of keys.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Drive one of their cars. They won't be needing them.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where do you want me to go?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The two million bucks is still in the Subaru. Parked on Mulholland above Marcon's house. Go pick it up and bring it to the office. We're gonna go get Darian.
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, massah.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He moves off into the parking lot. Hallenbeck says to Sarah.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll take you and Darian to the office. You can sleep there.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why can't we go home?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There's four corpses in the bedroom.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
It's a very tiny "oh." ESTABLISHING SHOT - JOE'S OFFICE in the shadow of the freeway. The night wears on. From the billboard, Gorgeous continues to entice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. HALLENBECK'S OFFICE - SAME TIME Darian is asleep, cradled in her mother's arms. Her mother is awake, cradled in Joe's arms.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jimmy should be here any minute. Then we gotta talk to the cops.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah nestles into the crook of his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will the police catch Marcon?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe. He's probably in some secret crash pad, packing to leave town.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A pause, then Sarah says:
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I remember when we got married... My friends would talk about their husbands. They'd say, 'Oh, my husband is a big-time publisher,' or, 'My husband is a brilliant lawyer...' I used to say, 'My husband can stand over a shotgun victim and eat a ham sandwich without puking.'
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't knock it. It's a skill.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She turns. Looks into his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I want to try, Joe. Do you still want to try?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
A pause. He leans in and kisses her tenderly. And, with typically swell timing, a set of headlights rakes across the window, accompanied by the strobing light of a police flasher.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ahh, shit. Looks like the local constable has come to chat.
	</DIALOGUE>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shall we invite him in?
	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Stay here. I'll deal with it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He gets up, throws on a jacket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. JOE'S OFFICE - NIGHT Joe exits the office, starts across the lawn toward the vehicle with the flashing light. Realizes with a sudden shock: something's wrong.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not L.A.P.D....
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
HALLENBECK'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
the insignia on the door panel reads LONG BEACH SHORE PATROL. In the same glance, he sees there's a dead cop slumped in the passenger seat, and worse, much worse than that: Milo is in the driver's seat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
WIDER ANGLE Milo, who steps out of the car and promptly OPENS FIRE on Joe.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son of a bitch!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He dives for cover, the turf erupting all around him, as:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. OFFICE - SAME Sarah sits bolt upright. Eyes panicked. Terrified. Darian comes awake, screaming:
</DIRECTION>
<DARIAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mommy, what's happening?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Sarah leaps off the couch, cradling Darian and meanwhile --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. OFFICE - SAME Hallenbeck spins behind one of the billboard support legs, as BULLETS CHOP it to splinters.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MILO advances. changing clips. Methodical. Precise. Like a robot. He is obsessed. All vestige of sanity gone.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You fucked up my face, Joseph!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe starts to climb. Scales the wooden structure. Swings himself onto the raised platform. Flattens behind the billboard.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't try to hide, Joseph. I've got all night, you fucked up my face.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He sprays a BURST of GUNFIRE up at the billboard.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HALLENBECK huddles behind the billboard as the bullets stitch upward. Through the wooden frame. A hot SLUG RIPS through Joe's arm. An eruption of blood. He hisses in pain. Rolls away from the gunfire. Looks around. Desperate. Sees a painter's bucket lying nearby. He counts to three.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DOWN BELOW Milo calmly changes clips. Hallenbeck bursts from cover. Hurls the bucket down at Milo, dashes across the front of the billboard, hard and fast -- BULLETS CHOPPING the board right behind him, blowing holes in Gorgeous's derrierre -- And then Joe does a risky thing: He sprints to the end of the billboard, running full tilt, and he leaps out into space, what the hell is he doing?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He's trying to make the freeway. It's a good fifteen feet. Try it sometime. He flies through open air -- Milo's GUN CHATTERING below, seeking him out -- And just does make it. Hits the freeway surface and collapses forward, screaming as he rolls on his injured arm... Looks up --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EIGHTEEN WHEEL TRUCK
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
is headed straight for him, bearing down...! He rolls aside just in time. It THUNDERS past. Staggers to his feet, frantic -- and Milo is climbing the billboard. Hallenbeck looks for a place to hide. There isn't any. He's going to have to run through traffic. He shifts from foot to foot, searching for an opening, and meanwhile --
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SUBARU - DRIVING Jimmy Dix is actually on the freeway, driving, when he looks across the center divider and sees Hallenbeck.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't fucking believe it.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He swerves over to the side and meanwhile
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HALLENBECK watches in dismay as Milo climbs onto the platform... Walks across the front of the billboard. Toward the freeway. Toward Joe. Snarling. Joe grabs a broken bottle off the ground. Heaves it. Milo puts up an arm, catches a glancing blow. Blood flows. All it does is piss him off.
</DIRECTION>
<MILO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You ruined my flesh!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck dives flat to the road as Milo opens up again, a chattering BURST of GUNFIRE. The muzzle flash is blinding. The windshield of a passing car SHATTERS -- The driver panics, the car spins out of control -- Slews across the road in the middle of traffic. COLLISIONS. CRUMPLING METAL. EXPLOSIONS of GLASS. SCREECHING TIRES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAR slides straight toward Hallenbeck.

He dives aside, rolls to his feet -- And he's right in Milo's sights. My friends, the fat lady just sang. Except another lady says different: A single GUNSHOT SPLITS the air. Milo's chest explodes with bubbling blood. He shrieks. Turns, staring in disbelief at
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SARAH HALLENBECK below, on the lawn. She aims Joe's service revolver and says:
</DIRECTION>
<SARAH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You just fucking die.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
She FIRES again, and Milo reels backward. Leaves a bloody smudge on the billboard. She DROPS the HAMMER again and again. Empties the gun. Milo jerks and twitches. Racked by gunfire. Paints a bloody stripe across the billboard, making Gorgeous's bloody buns even bloodier -- Clutches himself. Looks over at Hallenbeck.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's something, isn't she?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Milo pitches forward. Falls to his death.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HALLENBECK stares, dumbfounded at Sarah. She look up at him. A moment passes between them. Around Hallenbeck, a sea of crumpled cars. HORNS BLARING. Amidst it all, he stands. Beaten. Bloody. Bullet-scarred. Jimmy winds his way through the cars. Walks up to Joe. They stand in silence for a moment, then Jimmy says:
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The car's over on the other side. C'mere, I want to show you something.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. 405 FREEWAY - SOUTHBOUND LANE - NIGHT Jimmy and Joe stand in the breakdown lane next to the rented Subaru. Jimmy points to the shattered window.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Somebody broke in and swiped the suitcase from the back seat. Had to be Marcon, right?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
There is a pause. They both stare at the car. Two million. Down the drain. Except, after a beat... they begin to laugh. First chuckling, then chortling.. Now it's go-for-broke. Jimmy hoots. Joe howls. Jimmy pulls out a key and opens the trunk -- You can guess what's inside.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Son of a bitch got the wrong one!

<DIRECTION>
AUTOGRAPHED FOOTBALL on the dresser of a fancy penthouse suite. Signed by Joe Montana, no less.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CONRAD MARCON bustles back and forth, shoves the last of his needed possessions into a travel bag. Hefts it. Puts it near the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Crosses to the bed, where the other suitcase lies. Looks at it. Smiles, contented. Can't help himself. He reaches out. Flicks the latch. Opens it. There is a note taped to the inside:
</DIRECTION>
<FUCK_YOU>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOWNTOWN SKYSCRAPER - 32ND FLOOR - NIGHT Marcon's flaming corpse is BLOWN OUT through the glass, along with his earthly possessions. He plummets like a meteor. CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EAST L.A. SIDESTREET - NIGHT Two ten-year-old black boys are walking down the street. Out strolling in the poverty that exists in the shadow of the skyscrapers. Quite suddenly, without warning -- A football drops out of the sky. Hits and bounces, very high -- Comes down. Settles. Rocks, back and forth. The kids look up, puzzled. Searching the sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The ball sits there. Only slightly scorched. Tentatively, almost like he's afraid of being caught, one of the boys bends down... looks both ways... Picks up the ball. Smiles. Then, as if by some unspoken agreement -- The other boy starts to run. Slowly at first, then faster... faster still... A slant pattern, heading for the mailbox... And at 12 midnight on December 22nd, the San Pedro Street quarterback throws an absolutely perfect pass. Their laughter is joyful. Innocent. Fervid. They will grow up to be sports heroes. DISSOLVE TO:

INT. BESSALO'S OFFICE - L.A.P.D. - MORNING Hallenbeck sits impassively while Bessalo paces, fuming.
</DIRECTION>
<BESSALO>

	</DIALOGUE>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck smiles.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>

Bessalo looks at him like he's grown a tail.

<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
Hallenbeck frowns. Opens the case. Reaches in -- And plucks out two crisp $100 bills. Stuffs them in a pocket. Jimmy stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
<DIRECTION>
(shrugs)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My fee.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He shuts the case. Shoves it toward Jimmy. Jimmy leans forward, eyeing the suitcase.
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit, Joe... I got all the money I need.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He shoves it back into the center. Joe nods.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>

	Think you could handle that for awhile?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I maybe could handle that. For awhile.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
He pours a drink. Raises his glass on high:
</DIRECTION>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alex the detective.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JIMMY>
<DIRECTION>
He drinks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CANCER RESEARCH CENTER - DAY A uniformed man is emptying the PLEASE GIVE jar when he notices a suitcase lying against the wall. Under a poster that says THE GOAL: A CURE IN OUR LIFETIME. He bends down. Opens the suitcase. When the money is counted, there will be $1,999,800. A note is taped to the inside: SO HURRY UP ALREADY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PALM-LINED L.A. STREET - DAY Jimmy and Joe walk side by side. Away from us. Slightly drunk. Palms wave lazily. A sweaty Santa rings a bell.
</DIRECTION>
<HALLENBECK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	See, Jim, the thing is, life sucks. But you still can't be hangin' around Satan Claus, you know why...?
	</DIALOGUE>
<JIMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why?

FADE OUT.
