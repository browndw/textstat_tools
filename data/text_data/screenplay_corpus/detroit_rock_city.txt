:SC: INT. MRS. BRUCE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Decorated in Carol Brady chic. When it's not gaudy, tacky, and loud, it's blander than toast. Colors like lime green and sunshine orange should be reserved for popsicles only.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MRS. BRUCE, late 30's, enters looking exhausted. She carries a glass of wine in one hand and a book in the other, Erma Bombeck's The Grass Is Always Greener Over The Septic Tank.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HUMMING "We've Only Just Begun," Mrs. Bruce crouches next to her wildly-ancient entertainment center complete with 8-track. She flips the first record forward on her Ronco Record Mate. Album after album flaps forward. Olivia Newton-John, Neil Diamond, the Osmond Brothers. She stops on the Carpenters and sighs at the serene cover art. Just what the doctor ordered.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Placing the vinyl on the turntable, she CLICKS the dustcover closed and FLICKS "Play." Reclining in her Lazyboy, she sips her wine, opens the book and awaits the mellow tones of Karen Carpenter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, her eardrums are hammered by machine gun GUITAR. Caustic ROCK 'N' ROLL assaults her senses. She jumps, spilling her wine all over herself. This isn't the Carpenters...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
IT'S KISS!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Racing to the entertainment center, she turns the volume control knob so violently, it comes off in her hand. The music is even louder now.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Flustered by the awful noise, she tries lifting the dustcover. It's stuck. She screams and covers her ears. This is Hell. Running to the rear of the huge console, she stretches to reach the plug, but can't. Fingertips millimeters away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the cacophony POUNDS she shakes the entire stereo with all her frantic might.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SCREEEEEECH! The needle scrapes across the vinyl with a shrill, finally coming to a stop. Whew, silence!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, POP, the dustcover opens unceremoniously. Shaken, she grabs the record with trembling hands and reads the label...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
KISS - LOVE GUN, SIDE TWO

Mrs. Bruce's blood boils.

:SC: EXT. LEX'S HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A small, two-story house amid a suburban neighborhood of other two-story houses. Uninspired architecture. Spindly trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Two-car garage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A faint yellow glow emanates from a cellar window across which shadows frantically dart. Over the CRICKETS, we hear MUFFLED, BADLY-RENDERED ROCK 'N' ROLL. SCRATCHY, GUTTURAL, inhuman.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA MOVES to the cellar window. Inside we see four TEENAGE BOYS who are to blame for the racket. Band practice.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. LEX'S BASEMENT/BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
An inner-sanctum of KISS devotion. Faux-wood paneling is plastered with countless KISS posters, pictures, fold-outs. The ceiling is wallpapered with more KISS posters. KISS dolls, magazines, records, comic books clutter the shag-carpeted floor. Fast food wrappers heap over the KISS garbage pail.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The four high schoolers rock their hearts out as they blast a familiar tune offensively off-key.

<DIRECTION>
They stink, but they sure are trying hard. Meet the band "Mystery." Concert tee-shirts, holey jeans, total burn-outs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
HAWK, a scraggily-haired, disenchanted youth, strains his vocal chords on the microphone as he SCRATCHES at his rhythm guitar. Hawk is sort of the brains of this operation, but knowing the others, that doesn't say much.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LEX POUNDS a bass with earnest determination. Lanky with bad posture, Lex is already sporting worry lines. He takes everything way-too-seriously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TRIP STRUMS lead guitar like he's hammering nails. All id, Trip is slightly out of his mind. But, is it the chemicals or just his chemistry. He always wears a knit cap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
JAM, a sensitive kid (but no wuss), BASHES on his drums like a madman making the bass drum pulsate like a spastic heart. The big drum bears the word "Mystery" painted on its skin with a lightning "S" just like the KISS logo.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They bring the classic tune to a shrieking conclusion and thrust their hands over their heads in the KISS symbol. Hawk screams into the mike at their imaginary audience.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Cleveland! You're a great crowd. But after three and a half hours of kick-ass rock and seven encores on top of that, I'm sorry to say that this time we really gotta get back to our hotel rooms and fuck some groupies.

LEX'S POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A baby-shit green, Ford station wagon with fake wood sides SCREECHES into the driveway. Mrs. Bruce gets out and STOMPS toward the house. Lex gasps at the sight.

<LEX>

Lex quickly throws a KISS towel over a TV tray hiding a bong, cigarettes, overloaded ashtray. Trip kicks half-empty beer bottles under the bed. Hawk sprays Lysol frantically around the room as Jam shovels gum into his mouth.

KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK! Mrs. Bruce pounds on the cellar window crouching to see in. She looks like a crazed, underlit psycho.

The sun's early morning rays beam through the KISS "Destroyer" poster taped onto a window shade. The phone RINGS. Jam bolts upright, his profile blocking the poster. He has just awakened under the only other decoration in his room: a crucifix.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Still dressed in last night's clothes, a plain black tee- shirt and blue jeans, Jam leaps out of bed unwittingly planting a foot in the handle of a Bullworker (a piece of exercise equipment comprised of a powerful spring with two handles on either end) whose other handle is stuck under one of the bed's legs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jam runs to a phone on his dresser, drawing the Bullworker's powerful springs out to maximum tension. No sooner does he pick up, when he is yanked to the floor and dragged across it as if tied to the bumper of a speeding car. Despite the Bullworker pulling him back toward his bed, Jam does manage to get the phone to his ear.

Then, one of Jam's drumsticks rolls off the desk and onto the floor. Beth quickly reaches down to grab it for him just as he bends to get it too. THUD, they bash heads.
</DIRECTION>
<JAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oof!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry.

</JAM>
<DIRECTION>
Rubbing her head, she smiles and hands him the drumstick.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No problem.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<JAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAM>
<DIRECTION>
He stuffs his drumsticks in his socks pulling his pantlegs down. Jam and Beth stare at each other. There's a mutual crush, but both are apprehensive about making the first move. Both want to speak, neither does. They awkwardly go back to their notebooks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mustering the nerve, Jam breaks the ice and whispers...
</DIRECTION>
<JAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beth?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAM>
<DIRECTION>
Beth spins too quickly. Her pen flies out of her hand.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes?

</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
BOINK! The pen hits Jam in the eye.
</DIRECTION>
<JAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ow!

</JAM>
<DIRECTION>
Feeling awful, Beth moves in to help. The teacher looks up sternly.

<STUDY_HALL_TEACHER>

</BETH>
<DIRECTION>
Jam points to his eye.
</DIRECTION>
<JAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a little pink eye. No reason to panic.

</JAM>
<DIRECTION>
Unamused, the teacher goes back to grading.

	<DIALOGUE>

Suddenly, Beth is rudely interrupted by HIGH-PITCHED FEEDBACK coming from the P.A. The PRINCIPAL'S VOICE ECHOES over it.

<PRINCIPAL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jeremiah Bruce, come to the office immediately...

:SC: INT. WAITING AREA - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Bruce sits next to a stand-up ashtray in the high school's waiting area. Scowling, she fans the KISS tickets out with one hand. Jam sits across from her, one leg jittering anxiously.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They sit for an uncomfortably long time until... Mrs. Bruce pulls a cigarette and lighter out of her purse.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I made an appointment with Father Phillip McNulty at St. Bernard's. We're to see him directly where he will register you on the spot.

	You mean, you're sending me to... b- b-boarding school?

</JAM>
<MRS_BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What else can I do? Oh, records and magazines and comic books are one thing, but tickets? TICKETS? Jeremiah, do you realize what this means? That you're no longer content merely hearing their awful songs or looking at photos of their horrific faces! Now you want to see the devil in the flesh. You want to reach out and touch pure evil... and in Detroit no less!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_BRUCE>
<DIRECTION>
She flicks the lighter, not yet lighting the cigarette.
</DIRECTION>
<JAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom, three of those tickets don't even belong to me. They're for the guys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAM>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Bruce holds the tickets over the lighter's flame.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And if the "guys" have parents who truly love them, they will elevate me to sainthood for getting rid of these blasted things.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_BRUCE>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Bruce lights her smoke with the flaming tickets, then drops them in the ashtray where they burn for a cruel eternity. Jam stares semi-catatonic through his mom's sour expression.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's been a long time coming, son, but you're finally going to get the kind of discipline you deserve.

She stands and pulls him out the front entrance by his arm.

REVERSE ANGLE ON NEARBY CORNER

Hawk, Trip, and Lex peek around it, their heads forming a totem pole. One-by-one they pull back.

<DIRECTION>
They slump against the wall devastated.

Suddenly, a caustic voice BLURTS from down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you rodents have hall passes!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The boys whip their heads around to see a potbellied, yellow- toothed, security officer with long sideburns and slicked back hair at the far end of the hall, fists on his hips. Meet ELVIS.

<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, Elvis HUFFS and PUFFS up a flight of stairs arriving at a set of swinging doors. He goes to push one in, but it swings out at him with a vengeance knocking him backward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From behind it pops Hawk wielding a fire extinguisher. BLAST! A hail of foam covers Elvis's face. Hawk shoves the extinguisher into the man's arms and pushes Elvis backwards down the stairs. He topples ass-over-head till he hits the landing.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're way out of your league, Elvis.

Elvis rises and shakes the CO2 off like a wet dog. Looking up, he sees the door gently swinging in and out. No sign of Hawk.

Hawk bursts into the bathroom.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're clear, dudes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
They run to exit. Hawk first. Suddenly, Hawk backs up again into Trip and Lex as if a swarm of killer bees was out there.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A skirt just came around the corner.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk, Trip, and Lex run back and pile into the last stall. All three stand on the toilet bracing their arms against the walls for balance.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A FOXY GIRL hurries into the stall next to theirs. We see the top halves of three heads peek over the stall's partition. The three boys don't make a sound as they watch her sit down.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As she glances up, they recoil fast. They whisper super-quiet.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's Sherry VanHafton.

<LEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been in love with her since the second grade.

Then, a SOUND OF TINKLING. They all throw their hands over their mouths to stifle the giggles. Suddenly, POOT! She lets out an ECHOED FART. The boys are awestruck.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa... she just farted.

Pause.

	Peeeyeewww! That stinks!

</TRIP>
<DIRECTION>
Just then, the SOUND OF CRACKING PORCELAIN, as the toilet they're standing on breaks into pieces with a SMASH. They topple over pulling the stall walls down with them exposing the foxy chick sitting on the can. Water GUSHES everywhere as she screams bloody murder, getting doused ruining her Farrah-do.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They bolt out the door slipping and sliding across the torrent of toilet water. Lex turns and shrugs to the traumatized girl.

Except for the tinkering NOISES that are heard as the STUDENTS work on their projects, there is silence in Electronics Class.

The teacher, MR. JOHANSEN, sips from a coffee cup and reads a newspaper, his feet on the desk. The headline says: "Mass Suicide in Jonestown. Cyanide in the Kool-Aid." Above him is a long banner reading: "Sorry, Absolutely no bathroom breaks".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk, Trip, and Lex sit before a half-built radio on a work bench, sheer desperation etched on their faces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lex solders two copper wires together. Hawk attaches a dial. Trip absently plays with a squeeze pump attached to a long plastic tube. He blows air into his face repeatedly with it.

Mr. Johansen still sits with his feet up, reading. The next page's headline reads: First Test Tube Baby Born.

<TRIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jeezis, I'm taking a leak in my pants!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRIP>
<DIRECTION>
We now see Trip is squeezing the pump from before. He holds it behind him feeding water into the tube running down the back of his pants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The stain travels fast, hitting Trip's knee in a nanosecond. In a state of shock, Mr. J. slowly opens a long forgotten drawer on his desk, finding a cobweb and dust-covered pad of bathroom passes. He tears one off and dust flies everywhere.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He holds the pass out to Trip like it was a cross he was holding before an advancing vampire.

	Well, Jam is in absolute trouble. He couldn't get any deeper into shit if he was a fly sitting in a horse's ass. You know as well as me he'd give his right arm just to see Peter Criss's drum solo, never mind a whole KISS concert, check?

	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk points across the cafeteria and sure enough Elvis has just entered. Luckily, he hasn't noticed the boys yet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elvis swaggers to a table of CHEERLEADERS, puts his leg on a chair and starts a one-sided conversation with them. They promptly push their trays away, having lost their appetites.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, back at the condiment tray, Hawk and Trip each grab a big handful of ketchup packets and head to a table. Lex reluctantly follows suit grabbing a big handful of ketchup packets too. All three of them put their trays down and sit.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>

	Five second rule, boys. See you on the other side.

</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk approaches the exit door, glances either way, then leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trip and Lex look at their watches for five seconds. Then Trip heads for the exit door also.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lex still stares at his watch. After five, he looks at Elvis, who stops talking to the cheerleaders. As if possessing some sixth sense, Elvis turns quickly and looks STRAIGHT INTO CAMERA.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ELVIS'S POV -- He spots the swinging exit door and an empty table with three full lunch trays sitting on it.
</DIRECTION>
<ELVIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, ladies.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELVIS>
<DIRECTION>
Relieved he's gone, the cheerleaders start eating again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elvis moves through the cafeteria in SLOW MOTION toward the exit door. The hunter in action.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HALLWAY - DAY

Elvis pushes through the door and into a hall, dead-eye stare focused up ahead where the hallway turns sharply. He catches a glimpse of Lex. Smiling like the devil, Elvis bolts.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. OTHER HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lex catches up with Hawk and Trip just as Elvis swings around the corner and marauds after them CACKLING maniacally. A mad chase ensues. Down hallways. Around corners. Upstairs. Down ramps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk, Trip, and Lex scramble as fast as they can to escape the clutches of their sideburn-clad nemesis.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the boys pass a classroom, a NERD comes out pushing a projector on an AV cart. Thinking fast, Hawk grabs it out of the nerd's hands and pushes it down the hall at Elvis.
</DIRECTION>
<NERD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I'm responsible for that!
	</DIALOGUE>
</NERD>
<DIRECTION>
CRASH! Elvis bashes face-first into the rolling cart. He and the projector go tumbling. Not wasting a second, Elvis is back on his feet and after them again. The nerd grabs his hair in horror at the sight of the smashed projector.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
AROUND A CORNER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Elvis SKIDS around the corner and trips on a fire hose stretched across the floor from its glass box to a water fountain pipe. He slides on his belly along the polished floor unable to stop.

	</DIALOGUE>

Suddenly, a screaming Elvis slides into the open door on his stomach and bowls Miss Hibbs over like a Brunswick. He clamors to his feet and shoots out the room leaving everyone stunned.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. HALLWAY - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pausing at the corner, Elvis takes a breath and leaps around it. He smiles at what he sees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Up ahead, Hawk, Lex, and Trip stand on a 3-stair stoop, desperately pulling at a locked door. Elvis smiles. They GULP.
</DIRECTION>
<ELVIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	KISS concert? Kiss my ass morelike. A nice, fat detention oughta put a crimp in this evening's plans.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELVIS>
<DIRECTION>
Elvis takes his key ring off his belt and begins twirling it. The boys turn and face him. He savors the moment.
</DIRECTION>
<ELVIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Looking for something, rodents?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ELVIS>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, Elvis...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk's brow furrows as he pulls about fifty ketchup packets out of his pocket. Trip and Lex do the same.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	..Your ass on a lunch tray.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Elvis laughs and lurches forward -- the boys' cue to drop the ketchup packets at their feet and...
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	On your marks and...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Trip and Lex ready themselves, then...
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fire!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
They start stomping on the packets, squirting Elvis's face and torso with tomato-based condiment causing him to let out a scream that lasts the rest of the scene. Ketchup spatters across his body in SUPER SLOW MOTION. A shot hits him in the mouth and he COUGHS it back out in mid-scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys stomp relentlessly, mercilessly, blasting their nemesis with hideous cafeteria red as Elvis throws his arms back, body quaking at every splat. It's kind of like the scene in "The Godfather" where Sonny gets it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beaten and spent, his scream now dried up to a hoarse GASPING, Elvis slips on some ketchup at his feet. He hits the floor with a THUD right in the goop. He lays there letting out DRY SOBS looking like a bunless wiener.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk jumps off the stoop. Taking Elvis's key chain away, he hops back up and unlocks the door letting Trip and Lex out. Hawk whips the keys back at Elvis, hitting him in the head, then flashes a pearly Error Flynn smile.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Elvis, you ain't nothin' but a hot dog.

Hawk bolts out the door. Elvis tries to get up only to slip in the muck again and fall back down twice as hard.

Mrs. Bruce and FATHER McNULTY stand outside his office. The door is open a tad. Jam sits just beyond it, but all we see are his corduroyed legs which shake. Jam is one nervous kid.

<MRS_BRUCE>

	Again, many thanks and praise to you for seeing Jeremiah on such short notice.

The priest enters, SLAMS the door shut, startling Jam, and sits in front of a painting of the Virgin Mary on his wall. The name plate on his desk reads: FR. PHILIP McNULTY.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_MCNULTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Before enrolling you, Jeremiah, let me just say it would be greatly appreciated if your career at St. Bernard's was an uneventful one. Some students believe they can get expelled through disobedience and recklessness. What they don't understand is even after God's vengeance is meted out, He forgives. That His devastating anger is followed by His nurturing compassion. In a nutshell, St. Bernard's may punish you even for the slightest digression, but will never cast you out, even for the largest. So here you are, Jeremiah... here to stay!

Father McNulty sticks the pencil into an electric pencil sharpener and it makes the same NOISE a DENTIST'S DRILL does when burrowing into a molar. Jam shudders.

Mrs. Bruce exits the building and approaches her car. She stops when she sees the '78 brown Volvo parked behind her. It's empty. She shrugs and gets into her car, driving off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Inside the Volvo Hawk, Trip, and Lex poke their heads up. The coast is clear so they can sit straight again. They stare up at a second story window where they see part of Jam's profile.

The nun exits and a second later Hawk enters wearing Lex's baseball cap pulled down over his eyes.

The priest swivels his chair around and unlocks a box labelled "Donations." While he looks for cash, Hawk gives Jam a discreet kick in the shin. Jam looks up and recognizes Hawk. He then looks out the window seeing Trip, Lex, and the Volvo below.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
For the first time we see what Jam looks like with a big, fat, shit-eating grin on his face.

</FATHER_MCNULTY>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell the Big Guy not to mention it.

Hawk takes the ten, tips the brim of the baseball cap and leaves, giving Jam a cautious wink as he goes.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_MCNULTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And not a moment too soon. I'm famished. I hope you brought a lunch for yourself.

<FATHER_MCNULTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well! It finally speaks. There's one barrier we've broken through.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_MCNULTY>
<DIRECTION>
Father McNulty smiles, taking a big bite. Jam smiles for an entirely different reason. The priest mumbles with a mouthful.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_MCNULTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You know, your coming here reminds me of a gospel called The Prodigal Son.
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_MCNULTY>

Jam grins a bit feigning interest.

<FATHER_MCNULTY>

Father McNulty GAGS sticking his pizza-covered tongue out. He pours himself a glass of wine and sucks it down looking concerned for the moment. Finally, he BELCHES.

The Father has undergone a metamorphosis. He's redder than a boiling lobster, his eyes bulge and he's laughing the deepest laugh a man can without risking psychological evaluation.

Jam watches fascinated as the priest tries to finish the story. It's not every day you see a holy man tripping on shrooms.
</DIRECTION>
<FATHER_MCNULTY>
<DIRECTION>
(in mid-guffaw)

	<DIALOGUE>
	So then, the younger one says, "But dad... I've been helping you on the farm my entire life!

	You never once slaughtered the fatted calf for me!" And then...

<DIRECTION>
(more belly laughter)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive me, Jeremiah, it's just that... I've been telling this gospel for years and... I just now realized it's the work of some comedy mastermind! The Prodigal Son is a barrel of fucking monkeys!
	</DIALOGUE>
</FATHER_MCNULTY>
<DIRECTION>
Father McNulty belly laughs so hard this time, he slides off his chair hitting his chin on the edge of his desk. He is in pain only momentarily, then laughs again, this time at his own pratfall. He hoists himself back into his chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk, Trip, and Lex suddenly barge into the office, followed by the outraged nun.

He lets out a belly laugh as the shocked nun runs from the office. Father McNulty laughs even louder at her behavior, POUNDING his fists on the desk, tears rolling down his cheeks, until...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He suddenly glimpses at the painting of the Virgin Mary and abruptly stops laughing. What appears to be extreme contrition washes over his face as he moves closer to the painting.

Jam spots her and beams. Their eyes lock. She waves and starts to yell something, when... suddenly... BANG!

<DIRECTION>
The boys chomp on their pizza slices and chug cans of Hawaiian Punch. Another raucous KISS tune BLARES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Behind them, a car horn starts HONKING rhythmically. Hawk looks into the rearview mirror and sees two guys and two girls in a tailgating Trans Am.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The guys have 90 M.P.H. haircuts, tacky, wide-collared shirts, and massive amounts of jewelry on their necks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The girls wear 10-layer make-up, mega-jewelry, and hair teased so high, it touches the car's roof.

The speakers BLAST a DISCO SONG to which the four passengers sing. KENNY, the driver, HONKS to the disco beat.

They're slightly older than our heroes and very full of themselves. Kenny and his best girl CHRISTINE sit in the front. BOBBY and BARBARA are in the back. It's a double disco date.

:SC: EXT. TRANS AM - DAY

<DIRECTION>
Just as the DISCO TUNE playing in the Trans Am hits the next chorus, a fistful of pizza SPLATTERS across the windshield. Freaked, Kenny swerves and zigzags all over the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Righting himself, Kenny's entire family might as well have been insulted.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stop singing... NOW!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
He turns off the stereo and floors the accelerator, swerving into the left lane and passing the Volvo. Bobby is just now noticing the mess on the windshield.

He starts to laugh.

<KENNY>

Hawk rolls up his window. Kenny yells, VOICE MUFFLED, and points to Hawk who pays absolutely no attention whatsoever.

<JAM>

<DIRECTION>
The Trans Am muscles the Volvo into the breakdown lane. Parking the ass end of the Pontiac out a bit, Kenny blocks the Volvo in. Kenny and Bobby climb from their car and storm over to the boys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk opens his door just as Kenny's hairy-knuckled hands pull him out through the window. He grabs Trip, yanking him out too. Bobby opens the back door and does the same with Lex and Jam.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With a kid in each hand now, Kenny and Bobby SLAM the four boys against the Volvo in a line. The size difference between the burnouts and the guidos is painfully obvious now. Kenny and Bobby are Neanderthals.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>

	DO YOU?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Trip, Lex, and Jam clutch their faces in pain. Hawk looks merely disenchanted as Kenny pokes a muscle-bound finger at his chest. Getting in Hawk's face, Kenny yammers loud and fast.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>

	Lemme paint you a friggin' picture ahright? Imagine if you will a 1978 Pontiac Trans American in pristine condition.

	An appealing portrait, nesspah?

</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk starts to say "yes."
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	BUT WAIT! What's that spec on the windshield? Could it be a wad of melted mozzarella, tangy tomato sauce, and various friggin' meat products?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk is unimpressed.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>

Kenny looks at Bobby and they exchange moronic grins.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a smart little homo, aren't you, hippie girl? But, while astounded at your nimble, friggin' insight, I still detect an issue hanging fire, namely: where does a sharp-witted faggot like yourself get off doing such a dopey thing like that there?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk figured out that any answer he gives will be incorrect and has decided to wait till Kenny's done.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No really, I'm perplexed. I mean, could you have done stupider if you were born without a FUCKIN' HEAD?!

	Don't get me wrong, we'd love to stand here and get shit on by the cast of Saturday Night Fever, but we're also on a schedule. So step on it.

</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Cold silence as Kenny replays Hawk's insult over in his head.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you gettin' wise with me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, I'm dumber than a goddamn slug. Now can I please clean your windshield and leave without further ado?

<BOBBY>

Kenny's temper's rising faster than the price of gasoline. Hawk on the other hand is cooler than an Otter Pop.

<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, you're dumb all right, you hairy ass punk. But please, allow me to clean the friggin' windshield. I insist.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
And with that, Kenny grabs himself a fistful of Hawk's long hair and pulls him over to the Trans Am. He wipes the pizza off with Hawk's hair, tugging Hawk's head up and down, back and forth. Hawk GRUNTS with each wipe, but doesn't give Kenny the satisfaction of hearing him scream.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trip, Lex, and Jam watch helplessly, trapped under Bobby's dull-witted, but equally threatening gaze.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny gets the last of the big chunks off his windshield and looks at his handiwork.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There. Nice and clean.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
He throws Hawk to the ground and smiles at Bobby. Then, he suddenly hears the KISS tune coming from the Volvo. Uh-oh!
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, no, no, no! It's the fag band!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny clenches his jaws and walks up to the Volvo, reaching in the driver's door. Suddenly Jam grabs his wrist.
</DIRECTION>
<JAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa! This is about pizza! Let's leave KISS out of it. Please.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAM>
<KENNY>

Kenny pushes Jam away.

<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's it, Kenny! I'm leaving!

Christine gets out of the car and starts walking down the highway, exiting the scene.

Kenny meanwhile has his arm in the Volvo.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kool and the Gang, now there's real music.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny takes the 8-track from the car...
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But this... is crap!
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
He flings it into the highway, where it is summarily smashed to bits under the wheels of a passing semi.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOLLOW a chunk of cartridge and a strand of mangled tape streaming from it as it sails back toward the side of the road, landing at Jam's feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TILT UP to Jam's face. He raises his eyes and turns to the CAMERA, a single tear rolling down his cheek, just like the Indian in that "Keep America Beautiful" litter ad.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk rises and Kenny comes face-to-face with him.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So. All that having been said and done, I believe we are ready for the final topic of discussion. Namely: Have you learned your lesson yet, puke?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk pulls a cigarette from his pocket and lights it. He blows some smoke in Kenny's face.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, let's recap, shall we? You slapped all of us, yelled at me, used my head for a rag, threw me on the ground and tossed our LOVE GUN 8- track under the wheels of a passing semi.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(puffing on cig)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, if the lesson was that you're a dick with ears and a really bad haircut, then, yes... I'd say we learned it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<KENNY>

(beat, in disbelief)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Excuse me, I'm a little deef-a- hearin'. Can you repeat yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay. Ahem! You. Are. A. Dick. With. Ears. And. A. Really. Bad. Haircut.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, yeah...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Out of original material, Kenny goes for an old stand by.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's not what your mother said last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Trip, Lex, and Jam exchange "uh-oh" glances. Meanwhile, Hawk's eyes glaze over.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not, huh? Well, then, tell me...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out his mostly empty can of Hawaiian Punch, holding it discreetly at his side.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...what exactly did my mother say last night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny draws a blank, not being prepared for this one.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You heard me, prick. What did my mother say last night?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Kenny chuckles and looks at Bobby. They have a good little laugh... the homo's got balls! Then Kenny turns back to Hawk.
</DIRECTION>
<KENNY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, fagmo... I'll tell you what your mother said last night.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She said that I was the fuck of her life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk is a little mad now. He tosses his cigarette to the ground and squashes it like a bug under his sneaker.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
(very Clint Eastwood)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How would you like a nice Hawaiian Punch?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
(smirking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KENNY>
<DIRECTION>
Quick as a shot, Hawk SLAMS the bottom of the can into Kenny's nose, crushing it flat against his face. Hawaiian backwash spews from its tab hole like blood as Kenny falls backwards from the impact. He hits his head on the ground.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Taking this as a cue... Trip whips out his wallet on a chain... Lex rips off his KISS belt... And Jam yanks out his drumsticks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As if choreographed, Trip swoops the wallet at Bobby's feet, snagging him around the ankles tightly with the chain. Lex THWAMS Bobby in the face with his big KISS belt buckle leaving a reversed, red, KISS logo branded in his forehead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trip yanks the chain pulling Bobby off his feet. When he hits the ground, Jam's right there DRUMMING his balls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Bobby shrieks.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, Hawk advances on Kenny who tries to get the can off his face, but it's stuck on looking like a pig's nose with fruit punch for snot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk raises both his hands in Kenny's face, then executes the final insult... Hawk messes Kenny's hair. Kenny lets out a scream that comes from the bottom of his vanity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk grabs Kenny by the ears and brings the guido's head swiftly against his kneecap. Kenny falls to the ground, unconscious on top of Bobby. Their heads collide knocking Bobby out cold.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Terrified, Barbara leaps from the Trans Am and is cornered.

Kenny, Bobby, and Barbara are now tied to the guardrail with Jam's white corduroy pants, geeky belt, and plaid shirt. Kenny and Bobby rest their unconscious heads on each of Barbara's shoulders.

Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam look down at the two guidos and the stella, snickering.
</DIRECTION>

Hawk grabs a cinderblock off the side of the road, walking up to the Trans Am.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Right, stella, and we'll deserve it. But let's really make it worth their while.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk puts the rock on the Trans Am's accelerator letting the engine WHINE in protest. (Again we are cautious not to show the guidos' faces.)
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	By the way, when Kenny wakes up could you give him a message for me. Tell him, quote, Kool and the gang bite my bag, motherfucker, unquote.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
He throws the Trans Am into drive.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All who are conscience listen to the brief SCREECH, then watch the Trans Am as it barrels without a driver into the woods skirting the highway.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It races into ditches, bounces off trees, and SPLASHES through ponds, all Smokey and the Bandit-like.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The disco-mobile ramps off the edge of an embankment, tumbles down a steep, rocky incline breaking apart along the way, and finally, BOOM! It explodes on final impact.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The boys all look at each other and shrug. Hawk walks back to the Volvo and gets in. Trip, Lex, and Jam follow suit and pile in as well. Lex shouts back to Barbara.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, thanks for letting us draw from your ample make-up supply. You must have the entire Revlon factory in your purse!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON KENNY, BOBBY, AND BARBARA.

We now see them from the front. Lo-and-behold, Kenny has been made-up like Gene Simmons, Bobby like Paul Stanley. Whoever finds them is gonna get the wrong idea about their musical taste... and kick their asses all over again.

Hawk slows down, turning into the breakdown lane, travelling about two miles per hour. Christine doesn't notice as they edge closer to her.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, Joe Burnout, let's get one thing straight here. As far as I'm concerned good tunes is good tunes, be it disco or rock or polka or whatever have you, regardless of the category. True, if I had to choose, I'd pick the category labelled disco because I happen to enjoy dancing. Disco is just easier to dance to.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me.

Christine processes this remark.

<CHRISTINE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now there's an intelligently biting remark wrought with wit and irony.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Trip looks confused, then smiles thinking she paid him a compliment.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, if you don't like that one, maybe you'll think it's funny when we throw your ass out the goddamn car!

All, Christine included, pause to think about what that comment was supposed to mean. Lex takes a hit off the joint.

<LEX>
<DIRECTION>
(holding in smoke)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That last remark fell about 30 yards away from making any sense whatsoever.

Hawk and Trip immediately bust into the giggles and it doesn't take long for Lex and Jam to follow suit.
</DIRECTION>

	Hey, you're right. "Bend over you're looking right at it?!"

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that supposed to mean anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHRISTINE>
<DIRECTION>
Christine succumbs to the contagious giggle epidemic and the whole car gets a great laugh for a while.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They finally calm down again and wipe tears from their eyes. Lex still has the joint now as Christine looks at it.

COBO HALL, where thousands of fans in KISS tees gather, waiting for its doors to open.

Unbelievable traffic stretches to an intersection at which stand four key landmarks... a cathedral, a convenience store, a parking lot, and a male strip joint. They face one another, each on its own corner.

A gigantic sign on the auditorium's facade flashes the commandment, "YOU GOTTA LOSE YOUR MIND IN DETROIT ROCK CITY" over and over again.

The sun hangs low on this day as the Volvo sits in traffic, passing Cobo Hall. Movement is nearly impossible.

KISS FANS cram every square foot of open macadam, pushing through the jammed cars. STREET VENDORS hawk KISS souvenirs from tee-shirts to pennants. Some are in stands along the sidewalk. Others come right up to car windows.

SIMPLE SIMON strikes a pose before a full-length mirror in a glittery-back Gene Simmons tee-shirt, silver pants, and very high heel boots. He has a huge Afro and bushy moustache. He turns when he hears Hawk.

Looking at the footage counter on the tape player, he slows down at a certain point and lets the boys listen to this: The CLICK of a phone being answered.

Hawk, Trip, and Lex cringe.

COBO Hall looms up ahead.

Hawk, Trip, Lex, and Jam enter the sidewalk. A thickening CROWD of KISS fans continually meander by.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On their way to the car, they suddenly hear a WOMAN'S VOICE bellowing through a megaphone from somewhere down the street. After a moment they see the voice's source.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A GROUP OF WOMEN has congregated about forty feet ahead and their LEADER, her back toward the boys, yells to the group through her bullhorn. Flying above them all is a large banner reading: "MATMOK, Mothers Against The Music Of KISS."

	Here's a suggestion. Let's stop worrying about the concert for the time being and get the cops in on this Volvo situation.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wake up, Lex. This is Detroit. The cops aren't gonna waste city dollars looking for a Swedish car. Face it, the Volvo's on a cutting board as we speak getting sliced, diced, and julienned by Christine, the chop shop gourmet.

Hawk, Trip, and Lex split up, leaving Jam alone. He starts walking in the opposite direction, passing MATMOKS. The leader is still on a roll, yelling through the megaphone.
</DIRECTION>
<LEADER>

	Look around you tonight, mothers! Look at all the young faces! They smile and laugh but their eyes have lost all hope! Not one among them appears to possess the love and fear of God... This satanic group KISS has stolen their souls.

<DIRECTION>
The leader's gaze finally falls upon Jam. He lets out a GASP. Yes, the leader is Mrs. Bruce. So this was her church meeting.

<JAM>

Mrs. Bruce quickly hands the megaphone to another MATMOK member, who picks up where Mrs. Bruce left off.

Jam looks around for someplace to run and hide, but it's too late. Mrs. Bruce slices through the crowd of KISS fans and grabs Jam by the ear. He yelps.

<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Jeremiah Bruce from school. He and his mom just went into that church. He must be in Detroit for the concert. Can I go say good-bye to him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>
<MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beth, I am not letting you wander the streets of Detroit after dark.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MOM>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm not going to wander. I'm just gonna go over there.

Beth points to St. Sebastian's.

<BETH>

	He's with his mom.

<DAD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Fine, as long as we know where you are. But don't be long. We need to be getting back on the road.

Beth is already out the door and halfway across the street. Dad pats mom's shoulder.

:SC: EXT. IT'S RAINING MEN STRIP JOINT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk walks down the sidewalk badgering everyone passing by for a ticket, getting the same stock answer: "Suffer, dude!"
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops and sits on a curb, lighting a cigarette. Behind him stands the marquee for IT'S RAINING MEN, the male strip joint. A DISCO SONG comes from inside. Just when it looks like Hawk's given up, a VOICE is heard above.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, chief? Need a ticket?
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk can't believe his ears. He looks up at a greasy-looking hybrid, part porn star, part used car salesman, the SCALPER.
</DIRECTION>
<SCALPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Second row center, seventy-five clams.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCALPER>
<DIRECTION>
Trying to act confident, Hawk takes out his money clip showing the scalper twenty-five dollars.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dude, this is all I got.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<SCALPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sorry, man, no can do. But I'll be here for a while if you scare up the extra gravy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCALPER>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where the hell am I gonna scare up that kinda gravy in one hour?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<SCALPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The easy way.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCALPER>
<DIRECTION>
The scalper points over his shoulder and Hawk turns to see three GIGGLING WOMEN exiting the strip joint. None are under forty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A sign below the bar's logo reads: Amateur Night Giveaway! Guys Over 18 Only! Bare It All And Win 75 Bucks!
</DIRECTION>
<SCALPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You look a little scrawny, but it's worth a shot.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCALPER>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't just walk in and take my clothes off. It's embarrasskin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<SCALPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guess you don't want to see the greatest show on earth. And in Detroit no less. Well, take care, chief.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCALPER>
<DIRECTION>
The scalper turns and Hawk grabs his arm.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dude, if it were dancing the way Fred Astaire did it, I'd give it my best shot. I'd learn the steps and practice in my spare time. But this... tribal, ritualistic bullshit, it's way-too-spontaneous for me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<SCALPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, you're probably too young anyhow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCALPER>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, I invented fake I.D.s, alright. That's not the problem... They're playing disco music in there, man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<SCALPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Chief, here's a little secret. Drink heavily, your feet will know what to do. Now shit or get off the pot. Do you wanna dance or do you wanna see KISS only on their album covers?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCALPER>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk gets a look of resolve on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<SCALPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You sure you'll have a ticket for me?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCALPER>
<SCALPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You have my solemn oath as a public servant.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCALPER>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk turns and walks up to the door, hesitating before opening it. Rummaging through his pockets, he pulls out a handful of expired driver's licenses.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Choosing the one he thinks best suits himself, he walks in with trepidation. The scalper sees someone else coming up.
</DIRECTION>
<SCALPER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, chief, you need a ticket? Second row center, seventy-five clams.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SCALPER>
<DIRECTION>
It's Trip.
</DIRECTION>
<TRIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No thanks, dude. I'm beating my ticket out of some poor, defenseless chump.

:SC: INT. IT'S RAINING MEN STRIP JOINT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk enters your average, everyday, male strip joint. A crowd of LUSTY WOMEN cheer on a STRIPPER IN A FIREMAN'S SUIT. He dances on a lighted, tile stage under a spinning, mirror ball.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk shows the MAN AT THE DOOR his fake license and the man nods him in. He approaches the bar in the early stages of being very intimidated.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The BARTENDER, a man dressed only in tight, black, tuxedo pants, shirt cuffs, and a tie, comes up to Hawk.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
(voice cracking)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Like to sign up for the contest.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
The bartender gives Hawk the once over.
</DIRECTION>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're a little scrawny, but thanks to the concert we're low on amateurs. Name?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hawk.

</HAWK>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Pick a song, Hawk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Got any KISS?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You kidding? This is Detroit. Drink?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, a man's drink...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk squints at a name tag on the bartender's tie.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	...Dickey.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Dickey goes to the bottle rack on the other side of the bar.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
(to himself)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm gonna need all the help I can get tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Dickey returns with the drink and Hawk pulls out his money clip.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at the drink)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You mean you never seen a Jack Daniels on the rocks before?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk looks at the unfamiliar drink again trying to play it cool.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sure, I have. But not one with ice in it, that's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
(seeing money clip)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Save your money, stud muffin. The lady at the end of the bar sends her love.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
Dickey points to a WOMAN sitting at the end of the bar. Mature and sexy. She's a knock-out. Every teenage boy's fantasy. Hawk's eyes pop at this "Mrs. Robinson" before him.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa... she is a killer.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<BARTENDER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Amanda Finch. Her ex is one of the wealthiest businessmen in Detroit. Play your cards right and you could hit paydirt. She like 'em young.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(leaning in)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	And since you look a little new at this, let me give you three words of advice. Hard to get. Think it, act it, know it, be it. Nothing a woman loves more than when you beat her at her own head games.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
Dicky pats Hawk's shoulder and leaves. Hawk looks away from Amanda and scans the room. He glances back at Amanda. She's still gazing at him the way queens of yore must have eyed particularly cute knights. She winks and toasts Hawk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk raises his glass smiling nervously. They both sip at their drinks. She licks her lips suggestively at him. And, Hawk proceeds to COUGH up his mouthful of Jack Daniels, SPRAYING it all over the bar.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Your typical 70's convenient store. Out front two SIX YEAR OLDS in Star Wars tee-shirts play tug-o-war with a Stretch Armstrong doll.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trip stomps over grabbing them by their mini shirts. When he tries to act tough, it's pathetic. Even six year olds aren't afraid.
</DIRECTION>
<TRIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, you little twerps, gimme your KISS tickets or I'll pop your fuckin' faces in.
	</DIALOGUE>

	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, KISS sucks!

</SIX_YEAR_OLD_2>
<TRIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I oughta kick your asses for sayin' that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRIP>
<DIRECTION>
He grabs the Stretch Armstrong and stuffs it in his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<TRIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But I'm in a hurry so I'll just take this instead. Now scram.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRIP>
<DIRECTION>
The kids run away.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. SMILEY MART - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The store is crawling with KISS FANS, some reading the comic books, others playing pinball against a far wall, still others looking at the poster section. Trip enters on a mission.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks around catching the eye of a pretty CASHIER. She's a rocker, wearing a Who tee-shirt, a mood ring, and just a little too much make-up. She smiles at him. Trip returns the smile with a feeble wave. Her mood ring turns from blue to pink.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Concentrating on the layout of the store, Trip peers all the way to the back to a darkened corner... where he spies a LITTLE KID wearing a KISS tee-shirt playing a KISS pinball machine.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trip smiles. The eagle has spotted a fuzzy, little bunny. He moves in for the kill, walking past a crowd of kids at the magazine rack, past the Hostess aisle, past the dairy cooler and into the darkened corner.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stands behind the little kid, relishing this moment. The kid is actually pretty good. We also see now the little kid has his face painted like Ace Frehley.
</DIRECTION>
<TRIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, little kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRIP>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly distracted, the kid loses the ball.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit! You just skunked my last ball, you...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_KID>
<DIRECTION>
Trip clamps a hand over the little kid's mouth.
</DIRECTION>
<TRIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, booger, your KISS ticket or your life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRIP>
<DIRECTION>
The little kid says something but Trip's hand muffles his words.
</DIRECTION>
<TRIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hunh?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRIP>
<DIRECTION>
The kid says what he said before, but it is utterly incomprehensible, once again thanks to Trip's hand.
</DIRECTION>
<TRIP>
<DIRECTION>
(looking at his hand)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh. Okay... But scream and you'll never live to see puberty. I'll pop your fuckin' face in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRIP>
<DIRECTION>
Trip pulls his hand away.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please sir, don't beat me up. I do have a KISS ticket, but not on me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_KID>
<TRIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A likely story. Hand it over, kid.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRIP>
<LITTLE_KID>
<DIRECTION>
(bottom lip quivering)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No really. My brother's hanging onto it for safe keeping. Please, let me get him for you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_KID>
<DIRECTION>
The kid turns and yells into the store before Trip can stop him.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, Chongo!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_KID>
<DIRECTION>
A titanic guy at the comic book rack looks up from his issue of "Thing" when he hears his name. CHONGO has a very low forehead and the expression of an angry bull plastered onto his face.
</DIRECTION>
<TRIP>
<DIRECTION>
(getting scared)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, kid, that's okay. I don't wanna see KISS that ba...

	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't try to run, maggot. Chongo's an all-state track star in every event.

	<DIALOGUE>
	What do you want?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRIP>
<LITTLE_KID>
<DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	A tag on your toe. Nobody threatens me and lives.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, you can have my wallet...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRIP>
<LITTLE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's not nearly enough, punk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_KID>
<DIRECTION>
Chongo is getting ever-closer with his tree trunk legs, his barrel chest and hydraulic biceps. He is joined by TWO BUDS.
</DIRECTION>
<LITTLE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Besides, I was gonna take your wallet anyway. After Chongo and his friends crush your ribcage like a pack of Luckys.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_KID>
<DIRECTION>
Chongo arrives eyeing Trip with distaste. Trip goes white.
</DIRECTION>
<CHONGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This fairy givin' you shit, bro?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHONGO>
<LITTLE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was gonna mug me for my KISS ticket.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_KID>
<TRIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Me? Mug? That's nuts. I said, do you know where I can take a piss.
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRIP>
<DIRECTION>
Chongo and his two buds laugh. Then, without a second of warning, Chongo belts Trip in the gut. Trip doubles over and falls breathlessly to his knees.
</DIRECTION>
<CHONGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, pimple dick, you've got the option of walking outside with us or gettin' dragged out. Either way you're comin' with us.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHONGO>
<DIRECTION>
Trip catches his breath.
</DIRECTION>
<TRIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Please, sir, don't kick my ass! I'll do anything to get out of a beating!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRIP>
<LITTLE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Say, Chongo, perhaps we could use some extra cash for tasty snacks at the KISS concert our weasly friend won't be attending.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_KID>
<DIRECTION>
Chongo scratches his head.
</DIRECTION>
<CHONGO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How much cash do you figure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</CHONGO>
<LITTLE_KID>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take five for a minute, Chongo. Let me do the math.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LITTLE_KID>
<DIRECTION>
The little kid taps his finger on his chin and the theme from "JEOPARDY" begins. While the kid thinks, Trip looks nervously up at Chongo and his buds. Chongo reaches into his denim vest pocket and we hear a CRINKLING NOISE. He comes back up with two walnuts, putting them between his bicep and forearm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trip watches in horror as Chongo makes a muscle and the walnuts are shelled between two walls of iron-hard flesh. CREEEAAAACK! Chongo eats the walnuts, shells and all.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The full-to-capacity parking lot is patrolled by a couple of SECURITY GUARDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lex cautiously makes his way to the edge of the parking lot and looks at the back side of Cobo Hall just beyond the chain link fence that surrounds the lot.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He crouches down and walks between two cars parked against the fence, looking both ways. Seeing a guard's flashlight beam, he sits stock still until the beam sweeps past, then SIGHS eased.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
<DIRECTION>
(whispering to self)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't believe I'm actually entertaining the notion of sneaking in. I oughta have my cranium examined.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
Lex finds a vertical break in the chain link. He lays on his back, slides through, then stands on the other side of the fence. He's at the edge of a weedy, littery field that also happens to be poorly lit.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa. Danger Will Robinson.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
Spooked, he lays down again intending to slide back through when a flashlight beam hits his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<SECURITY_GUARD_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey you! Get back in here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECURITY_GUARD_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Lex sees the guard standing about fifty feet away on the other side of the fence. Panicking, he bolts deeper into the field.
</DIRECTION>
<SECURITY_GUARD_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're not getting far, kid!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECURITY_GUARD_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Lex double-times it as we hear the guard yelling into his walkie-talkie.
</DIRECTION>
<SECURITY_GUARD_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We got one just ran into the field from the north lot!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECURITY_GUARD_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The field gets darker as Lex closes in on Cobo Hall's well- lit loading dock, where ROADIES empty the remaining bits of KISS's monstrous set from an 18-wheeler. Other huge trucks are parked nearby. There's a bustle of last minute activity.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: EXT. LOADING DOCK - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lex scurries from giant speaker box to a stack of lights to huge trunks, keeping well hidden. He dodges roadies and avoids being seen by OTHER GUARDS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He slithers along side the 18-wheeler and nears the loading bay. Up ahead some auxiliary speakers, drum kits, and scaffolding wait their turn to be carried into the building.
</DIRECTION>
<SECURITY_GUARD_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There he is!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECURITY_GUARD_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Lex spins. The security guard, flanked by two others, barrel right for him.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shit!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
He dives rolls under the 18-wheeler. The three security guards leap for the pavement and crawl under the semi after him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SEMI
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The three guards scramble to their feet and grab a SCRAWNY BODY. They spin him around roughly.
</DIRECTION>
<SECURITY_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright, wiseguy, you are so outta here!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECURITY_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
They suddenly realize they've got the wrong man. It's a roadie.
</DIRECTION>
<ROADIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, what the fuck?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROADIE>
<DIRECTION>
The roadie holds up his all-access laminate angrily.
</DIRECTION>
<ROADIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Keep your paws to yourself, ya dumb fuckin' apes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROADIE>
<DIRECTION>
The security guards look around frantically for Lex as other roadies join in to defend their comrade.
</DIRECTION>
<SECURITY_GUARD>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Where'd he go? You see him?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECURITY_GUARD>
<DIRECTION>
No one pays attention as a bass drum is carried past the guards and up the loading dock ramp. They don't notice Lex crammed inside contorted into a shape befitting a yoga master.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Praying he won't be spotted, Lex holds his breath as he's carried into the building and disappears.
</DIRECTION>

JAM IN A JAM / KISS THIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. ST. SEBASTIAN'S CATHEDRAL - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jam sits in the front pew, head buried in his hands as Mrs. Bruce and the priest talk on the alter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Beth moves quietly in the back, unseen and unheard. She looks overwhelmed by the architecture, the detail on the stained glass windows, the icons carved into the columns that support the extravagantly decorated ceiling.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The priest catches a glimpse of Beth meandering in the back.
</DIRECTION>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh, next mass isn't until tomorrow morning, young lady. Run along now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<DIRECTION>
Beth smiles nervously and heads back toward the front door passing a confessional booth. She throws a glance back at the priest and Mrs. Bruce who have returned to conferring, their backs to her. She stealthily ducks into the booth.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now it's been a while since my boy had holy confession. Could you...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_BRUCE>
<PRIEST>
<DIRECTION>
(smiling)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Consider it done.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<DIRECTION>
Mrs. Bruce looks down at Jam and sees his drumsticks poking out of his socks. She immediately takes them out and stuffs them into her jacket. Jam doesn't even move.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's about time you gave up on that stupid dream once and for all. No son of mine is going to be a career musician.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_BRUCE>
<DIRECTION>
Jam is stung. Mrs. Bruce and the priest head back down the center aisle exiting through the gigantic front doors. She eyes Jam.
</DIRECTION>
<MRS_BRUCE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you, Father. I'll be back for him before you know it; after I take care of some unfinished business.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MRS_BRUCE>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just knock loudly, sister.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<DIRECTION>
He lets her out and locks the door, leaving the keys in the lock, and walks over to Jam.
</DIRECTION>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come along, son. Get into the booth.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<DIRECTION>
He helps the despondent Jam up. They walk to the booth and Jam reluctantly gets inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
:SC: INT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jam kneels on the board and a mere two feet behind him, Beth sits on a bench shrouded in darkness. Her posture is that of someone with a crate of nitroglycerine on her lap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We hear the SHUFFLING noise of the priest getting into his own compartment next door. A moment later the small, eye- level door SLIDES open. The priest's face is barely visible on the other side of the thick screen, but he's there.
</DIRECTION>
<JAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. This is my first confession in... well... a really long time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAM>
<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Prepare to receive the Act of Penance. How many sins have you committed since your last confession?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PRIEST>
<JAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just one, Father, but boy was it a doozy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JAM>
<DIRECTION>
Beth leans forward slightly and listens to Jam's confession.

Hawk's at a bar stool gulping sloppily and woozily from a rocks glass. Four more empty rocks glasses sit in front of him. He stares at the sexy woman who smiles back, blowing him kisses from the other side of the bar.

	Look, people undress in public because, A, they're exhibitionists, B, they're nutcases, or C, they need the money. I can tell you're not A, and I hope to hell you're not B. So my suggestion is, think about why you're a C and let your body party, shake your groove thing, boogie oogie oogie till you just can't boogie no more.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BARTENDER>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk thinks about it, then downs the rest of his drink. He grimaces at it's taste, then opens his eyes with new resolve.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're right, Dicky. I gotta do it for KISS. Gotta put a bag over its head and
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(hiccup)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do it for KISS.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk swivels his bar stool to the right and gets off, forgetting to stand when his feet hit the floor. He proceeds to fall flat on his face. Dicky looks down concerned, but Hawk stands with a little difficulty and heads for the stage. The crowd of women parts down the middle for him and checks him out as he walks by. They seem to like what they see. Hawk looks nervously at the carnivorous faces leering at his package first, his ass after. What the hell is he doing?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk reluctantly climbs onto the stage and the gals start CLAPPING to the song. He faces them and starts gyrating his drunken hips at them, feeling no confidence whatsoever, until...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The CHEERS start to ECHO and the pulsing lights begin to hurt his eyes. Hawk watches the world proceed to spin faster than the disco ball above his head.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stops gyrating and clutches his stomach. BELCHING. Uh-oh.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk spots an almost-empty beer pitcher one of the CHEERING- IN-SLOW-MOTION women holds above her head. He runs up to the edge of the stage, grabs the pitcher, and PUKES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cheering and music come to a grinding halt. You can hear a pin drop as Hawk yacks his guts out into the beer pitcher. It goes on for an excruciatingly long time, then finally stops.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk looks up at the hundreds of astonished eyes staring at him. He wipes his mouth, then a look of ease washes over his face.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Wow. I feel a hundred times better!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
He hands the vomit-filled pitcher back to the shocked woman.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
He looks over at the emcee, who gazes at Hawk from the DJ booth.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maestro? As you were.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
The emcee stands perfectly still, jaw agape.
</DIRECTION>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Come on, dude, we got a bunch of frisky felines waiting for some entertainment! The show must go on!
	</DIALOGUE>
</HAWK>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk starts gyrating even though the music is still off. The emcee shrugs, re-cuing the song. It starts again as Hawk faces the crowd, dancing with new-found bravado.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The women come out of their dumbstruck comas and reluctantly start CLAPPING again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk pulls off his jacket and twirls it over his head Roger Daltry style. Then he pulls it back down and tosses it into the crowd. The women actually fight over it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Encouraged, Hawk then peels off his KISS Army tee-shirt and hurls it at the women, who SQUEAL with delight. Sure, he may be scrawny, but they don't mind. This lad's got personality.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Adrenaline pumping, confidence building, Hawk starts playing the crowd of very responsive ladies.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He unbuttons his jeans first. Then, leaving them on, he does an "air guitar" medley: Chuck Berry, ZZ Top, Angus Young from AC/DC, and Elvis Costello in six easy steps.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk finishes off with a Pete Townshend windmill, shaking his ass at his audience in mid-strum, then licks his finger and touches one of his cheeks: "hot stuff" (he does this in a manly way of course).
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then Hawk pauses to adjust what looks to be his underwear bunching up in his crack.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The women WHOO-HOO.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He segues into a Mick Jagger rooster strut and the ladies go ga-ga. He makes the sign of the horns with each hand and wiggles a protruding tongue like Gene Simmons. The gals scream in orgastic joy.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, Hawk goes for the gold. Yes, he does the Fonzie dance! The women are now overcome by sheer animal lust. Hawk's whipped his audience into a frenzied pack of bitches in heat. Amanda smirks and sucks from her little drink straw suggestively.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At long last Hawk figures he has to give them what they want.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He puts his fingers to his fly, pauses, then unzips. His Brittanias fall to his ankles, revealing a pair of bony legs sticking down from some KISS boxer shorts. The ladies go batty.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unfortunately Hawk has neglected a cardinal rule of disrobing. Never pull your pants down without taking your shoes off first. He tries to kick off his shoes. The left one goes flying across the bar and THWACK, beans a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN in the face. She flies backwards over a chair.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Trying to kick the other shoe off, Hawk loses his balance and falls backwards, hitting his head on the edge of the bar.

More techies jump out of the way as the wayward drum heads right for a closed set of double doors. The roadies are just about to grab it before impact, when...

The door unexpectedly swings open. The FOXY GROUPIES on the other side scream at the sight of the careening drum heading straight for them.

The big drum hits the landing hard, tips over, then spins like a quarter getting faster before it stops.

<PRIEST>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, this is a unique confession to say the least, son. And not exactly the most interesting one I've ever heard either. You sure you don't want to talk about... oh, carnal knowledge with a neighborhood girl or impure thoughts about the new student teacher maybe... or how about finding a box of magazines under your dad's bed?

	No.

<PRIEST>

	Well then, I suggest you have a seat on the bench behind you and think of something a little juicier to confess than losing KISS tickets. I realize this is Detroit, but I personally find, what that rock and roll band is all about, to be boring as Lucifer's kingdom. I'll return in a little while.

The priest SLIDES the door shut again. Jam is all but shrouded in darkness, but can make out the time on his watch. It's getting late. He resignedly sits on the bench behind him... right on Beth's lap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jam yells, but Beth throws her hand over his mouth. His eyes bulge. He can't believe what he's seeing. He climbs off Beth and sits next to her.

Beth gives him the biggest, wettest, sloppiest kiss in recorded history. She pulls away finally wiping her mouth.

He starts hearing voices in his head. We see SUPERS of his friends' faces hovering around him.

Trip puts a hand in his pocket and takes one last look at Stretch Armstrong before stuffing the action figure back in so it looks like he's got a gun. He takes three deep breaths and discreetly pulls his knit cap down over his eyes, revealing it actually as a semi-ski mask that covers the top half of his face.
</DIRECTION>

Just then, the man with the coat puts the magazine back and pulls something over his own head.

Trip whirls around pointing Stretch-in-his-pocket at the cashier...

Just as the man in the coat, now masked with a stocking, pulls the biggest shotgun ever made from under his coat, pointing it at the cashier as well. The cashier shrieks. So does Trip.

A big-haired HIPSTER in mirrored sunglasses KNOCKS on the dressing room door. It opens, but Lex can't see inside. The hipster stands in the doorway talking to whoever is there.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lex cranes his neck to see around the door jamb. Desperate for a glimpse of his idols, he leans out too far.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the entire duct collapses. Breaking loose of the ceiling, Lex hurls to the floor clutching the duct. Backstage goers leap for cover as SMASH... he hits the ground in a shower of plaster and dust.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hipster protectively pulls the dressing room door shut as two SECURITY MEN jump in front of it.

Instantly, huge, burly hands come down on Lex's shoulders. Before he can react, a slew of OFFICERS have him off his feet and carry him away, a stunned expression frozen to his face.

Lex is thrown into a heaping garbage dumpster by the scruff of his neck. The security officers laugh and pat themselves on the back as they hurry back in.

Lex peeks out the lid. The alley is dark and spooky. He jumps out of the trash and comes face to face with the biggest GERMAN SHEPHERD that has ever lived. Its teeth are bared and its black, wolf-like body is coiled, ready to spring. GRRRRRRR!

Lex jumps backward hitting the dumpster. A GROWLING PITBULL walks out from the shadows and joins the Shepherd.

Then, a GROWLING DOBERMAN with a spiked collar emerges from the darkness on the other side of the alley, its solid, muscular form making the brick building nearby look like jello.

Lex starts SLAPPING himself on the face.

	Wake up, Lex! Wake up, man! This part's gotta be a nightmare!

	So. Is it true that Gene Simmons had a cow's tongue grafted onto his real one? Y'know, to make it so long?

</JAM>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My dad's company is relocating him. We're moving. That's why I was acting so freaky in school today. I thought it was the last time I'd ever see you. Anyway, open the box. I would have given it to you this morning, except... like I said, I was freaking out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BETH>

Jam opens the box and his jaw drops. It's a black tee-shirt with the "Mystery" logo printed in white on the chest. Jam holds it up. It's gigantic.
</DIRECTION>
<BETH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I pass by this really cool tee-shirt shop on my way to school every day and I know you wear those black tee- shirts all the time. You look like a size thirty-five, but all the sizes were in Roman numerals. So I got you an XXXL. That's thirty-five, isn't it?

Touched, Jam kisses her for a long time. He starts putting on the shirt when suddenly they hear the SHUFFLING of the priest entering his booth. Jam grabs his clothes and sits back on the bench. Beth starts getting dressed at his feet.

	Oh, this is terrible... Please go on.

Still trapped by the GROWLING, BARKING pack of dogs, Lex searches nervously through the garbage behind him.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, okay, you're pissed off. I can see this. So... Maybe what we need... ah-ha.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
Lex holds up a worn-out, old frisbee.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Play some frisbee, poochies?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
The pack just glares and SNARLS. He tosses the frisbee over the packs' heads, but the dogs don't even acknowledge it. They just keep BARKING and GROWLING.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Meanwhile, an unnoticed dog at the rear of the pack, a mangy Basset Hound, turns its flat head to see the frisbee land on the ground behind him. His tail starts to wag.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
<DIRECTION>
(exasperated)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Alright! I give up! I hearby and forthwith defer my destiny to you mutts. I may be an intelligent, upright, walking, homo-fucking sapien, but you fleabags are a force of nature. So, I'm just gonna sit here and wait for you to decide. If you let me live, I thank you. If you bite my head off, I'll die knowing I did all I could. It's up to you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
Lex waits before the GROWLING, SNAPPING canines. Suddenly, the Basset Hound runs up in front of the pack and drops the frisbee at Lex's feet. Lex looks down at the floppy, wrinkly dog, who wags its tail and PANTS furiously.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, how do you like that?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
Lex starts to pet the hound, and one-by-one the rest of the dogs shut-up. Shocked, Lex picks the frisbee up again and throws it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This time the entire pack bolts after the Whammo product.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Lex smiles, watching them fight for it in the air... in SLOW MOTION... as the theme from "CHARIOTS OF FIRE" begins.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The black Shepherd finally grabs the frisbee in its mouth and runs back toward Lex. It's soon joined by the rest of the pack. That's right about when Lex realizes they aren't going to stop.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Whoa! Whoa!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LEX>
<DIRECTION>
The dogs plow into Lex full-force knocking him into the garbage. They surround him licking his face. Lex bursts into unstoppable laughter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Pulling himself up, he pets the dogs as they jump around him wagging their tails and PANTING.
</DIRECTION>
<LEX>

<DIRECTION>
Lex stops. He hears TALKING coming from inside the windowless, brick building on the other side of the alley. He steps in front of the pack and puts his fingers to his lips. They obey, quieting instantly. He then tiptoes to a thin crack in the brick wall. The dogs quietly follow.

Lex puts his eye to the crack and peers in.

	Amanda, as ironic as this is gonna sound, I can't take any money for... I'm no Midnight Cowboy, y'know. It would only cheapen the whole deal for me.

	I'm gonna be spending the next two years of my life at St. Bernard's Boarding School, remember?! I'm gonna be outta your hair till I'm a legal adult, remember?! That way, all you have to do is go to church, light a candle, pray to a little statue for me, and voila! All is forgiven and forgotten, right mom?!! Then, you can spend your days in guilt-free pursuit of more constructive activities like telling everybody else how screwed up their lives are! That way you no longer need the patience and understanding required to communicate on some normal level with your own child!!! And that way you don't even have to think about how tough it was for you when you were growing up, and it's a good thing too. Cause if you did, you'd realize what a LOUSY, GODDAMN, SHITTY- ASS, PARENT YOU ARE!!!

	Whoa! Whoa! WHOA! That better not be the last ticket! I hope you have another one for me!

</HAWK>

The scalper sees Hawk and bolts down the street disappearing around a corner. Hawk stops. He's lost him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Hawk sulks to the now-familiar intersection where all four landmarks meet. He takes one more look up the block at Cobo Hall. Nearly all the KISS fans are inside. The streets are almost deserted.

	Fuck me!

He sees someone out of the corner of his eye across the street. It's Jam. Lex approaches the other corner. Trip comes up to the forth corner. They all stop when they see each other. Each standing on his own corner. They're all pissed. They meet in the middle of the street as last minute CONCERT GOERS hurry by.

Suddenly, a commotion up the street. A SURLY MOM yanks four 12 YEAR OLD BRATS dressed like KISS by the scruffs of their necks. She's furious, they're CRYING.
</DIRECTION>
<SURLY_MOM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	How dare you sneak out of the house like that! You had me worried to death! Don't you know this is Detroit! And for a degenerate band like KISS! They're sick, sick, sick and oughta be in jail with their vile antics!

Jam, Hawk, Lex, and Trip turn and look at the crumpled wad at their feet. It's an envelope. An ANGELIC SPOTLIGHT FROM ABOVE highlights it.

</LEX>
<HAWK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nah. Couldn't be.

</HAWK>

They all shake their heads in unison resolved that it isn't. Then, unable to control themselves, they dive for the envelope. Jam tears it open. His trembling hand reaches in. All their eyes focus like lasers on what's inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jam pulls out four KISS tickets. Their jaws drop. Their eyes bug.

<JAM>

	It's a miracle! A miracle!

The boys are practically moved to tears. It's Divine Intervention at its finest.

Elvis stuffs all four tickets in his mouth and chews crazily. In seconds, GULP. Elvis explodes into unhinged laughter as he runs away zigzagged down the street.
</DIRECTION>

Our boys are left dumbstruck and speechless. After a really long pause...

</JAM>
<DIRECTION>
They stand and think for a moment. Hawk's mouth curls into a devilish grin.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, he lets out a gigantic "AIEEE!!! and slugs Jam. The four boys brutally pummel one another in the middle of the intersection. Punching. Kicking. Headbutting.

Trip points into the crowd of fans inside the auditorium foyer.

	It was those assholes! They even stole my wallet!
	</DIALOGUE>
</TRIP>
<DIRECTION>
The ticket takers turn to see the little kid, Chongo, and their two buds just going in. The ticket takers signal two security guards who proceed to stop the four stunned kids and confiscate their tickets. They find all the stolen dope and Trip's wallet.
</DIRECTION>
<TRIP>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Inside that you'll find my KISS Army picture I.D. and a hundred fifty bucks cash.

The security guards see he's right and break out the cuffs.

The little kid for once is speechless.

Then the ticket taker extends his arm in SLOW MOTION into COBO Hall as if to say "Entrez Vous." The four friends pause.
</DIRECTION>
<JAM>

DETROIT ROCK CITY

:SC: INT. COBO HALL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The lights are out. The lighters have been lit. The CROWDS' ROAR is deafening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jam, Hawk, Trip, and Lex plow their way through the throngs and head straight for the front row just as Simple Simon takes the stage.
</DIRECTION>
<SIMPLE_SIMON>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You wanted the best! And you got the best! The hottest band in the world... KISS!!!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SIMPLE_SIMON>
<DIRECTION>
Simple Simon runs from the stage just as the opening chords to DETROIT ROCK CITY BEGIN.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
On the beat, BOOM, FIREWORKS shoot from the floor alighting the place. KISS takes the stage descending on hydraulic elevators.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ON JAM, HAWK, TRIP, AND LEX
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
They're seeing God!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The show is spectacular. The costumes. The make-up. The blitzkrieg of pyrotechnics. The flashing KISS sign. Ace's smoking guitar. Gene's spewing fire. Paul's rockin' vocals. Peter's kick-ass beat.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then, something really weird happens.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The crowd behind the boys heaves forward. Jam is pushed like a twig in a flood and over the shoulders of those in front of him. Purely by accident, he is thrown onto the stage landing on his stomach between Paul and Gene. Just before Peter's drum solo is about to start.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Gene, Paul, and Ace silence their instruments. Peter throws his drumstick into the air intending to catch it when it comes down. But the sight of Jam landing on the stage distracts him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
All is mute as Peter misses the drumstick. It hits the outside edge of one of the drums.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Thinking fast, Jam grabs one of his drumsticks out of his sock and tosses it to Peter. It tumbles through the air in SLOW MOTION with a LOW, WHOOPING, HELICOPTER SOUND. We see the word "Mystery" clearly as it twirls.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Instantly, it's caught in Peter Criss's hand and he brings it down on his drum not missing a beat. The song resumes with all its fury as Peter's drum kit ascends on a hydraulic platform.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Jam scrambles from the stage and leaps back into the audience barely missing the claws of some security guards.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The four friends pound on each other with unbridled, teenage exuberance. Will it ever get any better than this?
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FREEZE FRAME.

<DIRECTION>
FADE TO WHITE:
