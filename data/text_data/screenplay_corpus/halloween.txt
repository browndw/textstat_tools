EXT./INT. MYERS HOUSE - NIGHT - SUBJECTIVE POV (PANAGLIDE)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
It is night. We move toward the rear of the house through SOMEONE'S POV. CAMERA MOVES UP to a Jack-O-Lantern glowing brightly on a windowsill. It is a windy night and the curtains around the Jack-O- Lantern ruffle back and forth. Suddenly we hear voices from inside the house.
</DIRECTION>
<SISTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My parents won't be back till ten.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SISTER>
<BOYFRIEND>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOYFRIEND>
<DIRECTION>
Then LAUGHTER.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The POV moves from the Jack-O-Lantern down to another window and peers inside. We see the sister's bedroom through the blowing curtains.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Into the bedroom comes the SISTER, 18, very pretty. She GIGGLES as the BOYFRIEND jumps into the room. Alan, 18, he wears a Halloween mask and a costume.
</DIRECTION>
<BOYFRIEND>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.; cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We're all alone, aren't we?

<SISTER>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael's around someplace...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SISTER>
<DIRECTION>
The boyfriend grabs the sister and kisses her.
</DIRECTION>
<SISTER>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.; cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Take off that thing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SISTER>
<DIRECTION>
The boyfriend rips off his mask. He is a handsome young man underneath. They kiss again, this time with more passion. The boyfriend begins to unbutton the sister's blouse. She responds to him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The POV swing away from the window and begins to restlessly pace back and forth, agitated, disturbed. We HEAR THE SOUNDS of the sister and boyfriend inside the bedroom growing more and more passionate.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally the POV moves back up to the window. Inside through the moving curtains, we see the sister and the boyfriend on the bed, naked, making love.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The POV springs back from the window and stalks quickly down the side of the house, past the Jack-O-Lantern, around to a door. Quickly the door is opened and the POV moves inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The POV glides silently through the house into the kitchen, up to a drawer. The drawer is opened. A large BUTCHER KNIFE is withdrawn.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then the POV swings around and moves to the kitchen door. We look down a hallway to the front door. The boyfriend steps out of the bedroom door, buttoning his shirt. The sister stands in the doorway, a sheet wrapped around her.
</DIRECTION>
<BOYFRIEND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOYFRIEND>
<SISTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Will you call me tomorrow?

</SISTER>
<BOYFRIEND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOYFRIEND>
<SISTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Promise?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SISTER>
<BOYFRIEND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BOYFRIEND>
<DIRECTION>
They kiss again and the boyfriend walks to the front door. The sister watches as he leaves and shuts the door behind him. Then she turns and steps back into the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The POV moves slowly down the hall to the bedroom door and peers around inside. The sister sits at her night-table brushing her hair. She is still completely nude.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly the POV moves into the room. Suddenly we move down to the discarded Halloween mask on the floor. The POV bends down and picks it up. Then suddenly the POV is covered by the mask and we see through the eye-holes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The POV moves up behind the sister. Sensing a presence, she spins around and stares at the POV, covering her breasts quickly.
</DIRECTION>
<SISTER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael...?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SISTER>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the POV lunges forward. The sister continues to stare incredulously. There is a RAPID BLUR as the POV drives the butcher knife into the sister's chest and out again almost before we've seen it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The sister looks down at the blood forming at her hands, then back up at the POV with an astonished disbelief.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then in a WILD PAROXYSM the butcher knife blurs continuously in and out of frame, slashing the sister mercilessly. She begins to SCREAM, trying to fend off the blows with her hands, then suddenly falls out of frame to the floor.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The POV moves back away from the sister's lifeless body, spins around and careens out of the bedroom.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At top speed the POV races through the darkened house, to the front door, out the door, down the steps and rapidly up the street. The CAMERA careens along in frenzied flight, up the sidewalk, up a small side alley, down someone's back yard, then to a sudden, abrupt halt in front of MOTHER and FATHER just coming out of a neighbor's house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Mother and Father stare at the POV, at first in puzzlement, then slow, growing horror.
</DIRECTION>
<MOTHER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Michael?
	</DIALOGUE>

<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - MICHAEL - CRANE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The father's hand reaches up and rips off the Halloween mask, revealing MICHAEL, 6, underneath, a bright-eyed boy with a calm, quiet smile on his face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing the blood-stained butcher knife in his hand, then further back. CRANING UP past his parents standing there, up from the neighbor's house to a HIGH SHOT of the neighborhood as the sounds of POLICE SIRENS rise in the distance.

The baack seat is separated from the front by a wire-mesh screen, much like a police car. MARION, 30, drives. She is dressed in a crisp, white nurse's uniform. Next to her in the passenger seat is SAM LOOMIS, a clinical psychiatrist. He is a tough-looking man in his forties who flips through pages in a manila folder.

Loomis glances at Marion as she lights a cigarette. She shoves the matches into the pack and tosses it on the dashboard. Loomis stares at the cigarette pack. The pack of matches reads: "The Rabbit in Red Lounge -- Entertainment Nightly." Loomis turns his eyes back to the rain-slicked road.

Through the rear window we see a SHAPE spring up out of the darkness, streak through the rain and LEAP UP ON THE REAR OF THE STATION WAGON.

Marion stops and rolls down her window to look outside. Loomis opens his door and steps out. Suddenly he is HIT IN THE FACE by a powerful fist from the roof. Loomis staggers backwards and falls by the side of the road.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Marion starts the react. SUDDENLY A HAND REACHES IN THROUGH THE WINDOW and lunges at her.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE FINGERS GRAB HER HAIR. She SCREAMS. The fingers tighten around her hair and the hand pulls Marion roughly to the window.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Twisted around in the seat, Marion's foot jams down all the way on the gas pedal. The station wagon ROARS foreward.

The highway disappears off into the distance. There is an old weatherbeaten sign that reads:

Just above the horizon huge clusters of clouds, dark and ominous, are blown along by the wind.

The playground is filled with CHILDREN just getting out of school for the day. Some are dressed in HALLOWEEN COSTUMES, some carry pumkins and orange and black streamers, some carry Jack-O-Lanterns.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy Doyle comes out of the door carrying a very large pumkin. He is followed by three BOYS, RICHIE, KEITH, and LONNIE, who are laughing and PUSHING him.

Tommy turns from them and starts to run away. Richie sticks out his foot. Tommy trips and falls to the concrete, SMASHING his pumkin beneath him. The other boys run away GIGGLING and SCREAMING with delight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
PLAYGROUND ENTRANCE - GATE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As the boys race out of the playground, Richie barrels through the gate and RUNS RIGHT INTO THE DARK SHAPE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We don't see the shape's face, just his lower body. He is dressed in pants and a shirt that look too big for him. He grabs Richie and holds him back at arms length.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A large OBJECT falls out of his pocket. Richie quickly stares down at it. The shape lifts his foot and SMACKS it down over the object to hide it. Quickly, Richie and the other boys run around the man and on down the block.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shape lifts his foot. Underneath it is a LARGE BUTCHER KNIFE. He quickly picks it up and shoves it into his pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly, the shape turns and walks away from the playground gate, CAMERA TRACKING WITH HIM. Across from him in the playground we see Tommy get to his feet, wiping the demolished pumking off his shirt and pants.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We TRACK WITH the shape to a station wagon. On the side of the door is a STATE EMBLEM.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. STATION WAGON
</DIRECTION>

The shape gets in the station wagon. We still don't see his face. Separating the front and back seats is the wire-mesh screen. It is Loomis' vehicle. The shape starts the engine. He pulls away from the curb.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
POV FROM WINDOW

<DIRECTION>
Slowly, the station wagon moves down the street. We see Tommy hurrying along the sidewalk, still rubbing off the pumkin splatter. Tommy turns off the side walk and cuts up a side alley.

The wagon picks up speed and continues on down the street.

The old Myers house looks ominous and forboding silhouetted against the dark, whishing trees. CAMERA TRACKS behind the hedge where Loomis sits waiting.

Suddenly, there are noises from the street. Loomis parts the hedge in front of him and stares.

<DIRECTION>
LOOMIS' POV - STREET

Three boys, Keith, Richie and Lonnie (from the playground) creep up to the edge of the sidewalk in front of the old house. They stare fearfully at the dark, tomb-like structure.

	I watched him for fifteen years, sitting in a room staring at a wall, not seeing the wall, seeing past it, seeing THIS NIGHT. He's waited for it, inhumanly patient.

The shape drives the knife deeply into Bob's chest with a SLAMMING THUD, the other end of the knife stuck through the wall.

<LAURIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lock the door! Lock the door!
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURIE>
<DIRECTION>
The shape moves for her, slowly now, but relentless, the knife glistening.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
There is a CLICK as the bathroom door is locked. Laurie leaps away from the door and circles around the bed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shape keeps coming.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laurie dashes to a clothes closet and ducks inside.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CLOTHES CLOSET
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laurie pulls the sliding doors closed and crawls back into the small, dark interior of the closet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly the doors begin to buckle as the shape pounds on them.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON LAURIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She reaches up and grabs a wire hanger from the top of the closet. She rips off the shirt and begins unhooking it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON CLOSET DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door buckles inward as the shape SMASHES against it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON LAURIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She twists the top of the hanger, unwinding the wire.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON CLOSET DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The door BREAKS IN. The shape steps inside, pushing aside the clothes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON LAURIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She unhooks the hanger and bends it out straight.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON SHAPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shape leans in, peering down at Laurie in the corner, raising the knife.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON LAURIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Holding the hanger with both hands she thrusts it forward with all her might.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON SHAPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The wire hanger flashes into the shape's right eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He leaps back in pain, dropping the butcher knife, grabbing his eye with both hands.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON LAURIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She grasps the butcher knife with both hands and jabs it upward.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON SHAPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The butcher knife plunges into the shape's mid-section, right down to the hilt. The shape stumbles backward out of the closet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON LAURIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
She just sits there in the corner of the closet. There is a THUMP from the bedroom, then silence.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly Laurie crawls around and peeks out of the closet doors.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LAURIE'S POV - SHAPE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shape lies on the floor by the bed, the butcher knife protruding from his stomach.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BEDROOM
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laurie emerges from the closet and carefully crosses the bedroom, avoiding the shape's body. She goes to the bathroom door and knocks softly.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tommy, it's me. Open the door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURIE>
<DIRECTION>
There is a silence, then the door opens. On the other side are Tommy and Lindsey, looking utterly terrified. Laurie bends down and shields them from the sight of the shape.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURIE>
<DIRECTION>
(cont'd)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now, I want you to walk to the door, down the stairs and right out the front door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURIE>
<LINDSEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're coming with us...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LINDSEY>
<LAURIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Listen to me. I want you to walk down the street to the MacKensie's and knock on their door. You tell them to call the police and send them over here. Do you understand?
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURIE>
<TOMMY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Laurie, you come with us...
	</DIALOGUE>
</TOMMY>
<LAURIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No! Do as I say.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURIE>
<DIRECTION>
She stands up and carefully guides the children across the bedroom to the door and ushers them outside. She watches for a moment as they walk down the stairs, then slumps down against the door frame in an exhausted heap.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOYLE HOUSE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Tommy and Lindsey run out of the house and down the walk to the sidewalk. They rush up the street. As they leave frame we see Loomis on the other side of the street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON LOOMIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He watches the children with a puzzled frown.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOOMIS' POV - TOMMY AND LINDSEY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shrieking with fear, Tommy and Lindsey run up the sidewalk.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON LOOMIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares at them for a moment, then moves for the Doyle house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DOYLE HOUSE - ANGLE THROUGH BEDROOM DOOR - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We see through the bedroom door. In f.g. sits Laurie, slumped against the door frame, staring out at nothing, tears streaming down her face. In the b.g. lies the shape.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly Laurie begins to pull herself together once again. She gets up to her knees and begins to pull herself up to her feet.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Her back is to the shape. As she starts to stand THE SHAPE SITS UP, the head turning to Laurie.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - LAURIE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laurie rises into frame, holding herself erect by grasping the door frame.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BEHIND HER THE SHAPE RISES UP INTO FRAME, quickly, silently.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laurie just hangs there on the doorframe. An exhausted, ironic smile comes over her face.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, kiddo. Some Halloween...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURIE>
<DIRECTION>
Slowly the shape moves for her, his hands outstretched.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Just as he is about to grab her, Laurie manages to step out the door.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE IN HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Unaware he is behind her, Laurie limps toward the stairs. Suddenly the shape jumps out of the bedroom and grabs her, hands around her neck.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Laurie SCREAMS. She twists and squirms and claws at him, her fingers ripping at his mask. She pulls it off over his face, wriggles out of his grip and turns around.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CLOSE SHOT - MICHAEL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The shape, Michael, stares at her with his one eye. He has a dank, white face with blond hair. There is something completely unhuman about his features, the open mouth, the dark staring eye.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE IN HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael lunges at her again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly there is a THUNDERING EXPLOSION and Michael is blown off his feet. Laurie falls back against the wall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON LOOMIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Standing at the top of the stairs is Loomis, gun in his hand. He moves forward down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE IN HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael slowly gets up to his feet, still refusing to die. Loomis stops and takes aim. BLAM!BLAM!BLAM!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael is hit three times, each bullet throwing him backward further down the hall until he hits the window at the end and SMASHES through it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOYLE HOUSE - UP ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael falls from the second story right down into CAMERA with a CRASH!
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE IN HALL
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Loomis rushes to Laurie and bends down beside her. For a moment she just cries in his arms, sobbing hysterically.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Then she looks up at him with a glazed, wild expression.
</DIRECTION>
<LAURIE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It WAS the bogyman...
	</DIALOGUE>
</LAURIE>
<DIRECTION>
Loomis looks down at her, then up at the shattered window at the end of the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<LOOMIS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	As a matter of fact it was.
	</DIALOGUE>
</LOOMIS>
<DIRECTION>
He walks slowly down to the window and peers out.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOOMIS' POV - BACK YARD
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He looks down at the spot where Michael shoud be, but there is nothing there, just a TRAMPLED PATCH IN THE GRASS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANGLE ON LOOMIS
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
He stares down with growing fear, then looks out from the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LOOMIS' POV
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The back yard, the neighboring yards, the street, all are empty, quiet, dark. There is only the SOUND of the wind swelling in the trees.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Michael is gone.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE TO BLACK.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROLL END TITLES.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
</DIRECTION>
