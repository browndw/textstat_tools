CAMERA SOARS, DIPS, WINDS its way SLOWLY DOWN, DOWN, bringing us IN OVER the city as we: SUPER MAIN TITLES. TITLES END, as we -- SPIRAL DOWN TOWARD a lush, high-rise apartment complex. The moon reflected in glass. CAMERA CONTINUES TO MOVE IN THROUGH billowing curtains, INTO the inner sanctum of a penthouse apartment, and here, boys and girls, is where we lose our breath, because -- spread-eagled on a sumptuous designer sofa lies the single most beautiful GIRL in the city. Blonde hair. A satin nightgown that positively glows. Sam Cooke MUSIC, crooning from five hundred dollar SPEAKERS. PASTEL colors. Window walls. New wave furniture tor- tured into weird shapes. It looks like robots live here. On the table next to the sleeping Venus lies an open bottle of pills ... next to that, a mirror dusted with cocaine. She rouses herself to smear some powder on her gums. As she does, we see from her eyes that she is thoroughly, completely whacked out of her mind... She stands, stumbles across the room, pausing to glance at a photograph on the wall: Two men. Soldiers. Young, rough-hewn, arms around each other. The Girl throws open the glass doors ... steps out onto a balcony, and there, beneath her, lies all of nighttime L.A. Panoramic splendor. Her hair flies, her expression. rapt, as she stands against this sea of technology. She is beautiful. On the balcony railing beside her stand three potted plants. The Girl sees them, picks one up. Looks over the balcony railing ... It is ten stories down to the parking lot. she squints, holds the plant over the edge.

EXT. BENEATH THE PIER NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FOUR TOUGH-LOOKING DOCK WORKERS are camped out under the pier, warming themselves around a small bonfire, laughing loudly. Christmas decorations dangle above them from the pier, and empty beer cans litter the sand around them. CAMERA PUSHES IN to discover an old collie tied to one of the pilings. Then we realize that the dog is being tor- mented by the dock workers. They flick lighted matches at him. Shake their beers and spray him in the face. These guys are not rocket scientists. The dog cowers, tugging bn the rope. Tries to get away. All to the great amusement of its tormentors. One of them turns, laughing -- As a shadowy FIGURE strides calmly up to the fire: Long hair. Cigarette dangling from-lower lip. Shirt-tails hanging loose below the waist. Nothing threatening in his manner as he plops down beside the men, smiling. They are immediately on their guard.

At which point, appropriately enough, Punk #4 shakes a beer and sprays it in the old collie's face. The DOG pulls away, WHINING. Riggs leans forward.

	This your dog? Nice dog.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIGGS>
<DIRECTION>
And then, he proceeds to do a peculiar thing: He starts to talk to the dog -- in what seems to be the dog's own language. Very weird, folks... He coos, snuffles, barks softly, then withdraws, listening, his ear to the dog's muzzle. Riggs nods. Frowns. The others look on, puzzled. Then Riggs looks at each of the four dock workers.
</DIRECTION>
<RIGGS>

</DIRECTION>
<RIGGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay.

And once again, begins to confer with the dog. Listens intently, piecing together what he is hearing.

	Get this: He wants me to beat the shit out of you guys.

</RIGGS>

Everything stops. A cloud passes over the assembled faces and a pin-dropping silence ensues. Riggs, completely heedless, once again attends to the dog:
</DIRECTION>
<RIGGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's that ... ? The one ... in the middle... .is a stupid fat duck.... What ... ?

He looks up, shakes his head.

<RIGGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Boy, this dog is pissed.

The one in the middle grabs Riggs by the collar. Hoists him to his feet. Gulp. Stands, staring down at Riggs, whose eyes are completely neutral, like a snake's.

	Buddy, you.re shortening your life span.

He flicks open a mean-looking switchblade. Riggs is dead meat. So why then, does he choose this moment to execute a Three Stooges. routine, consisting of nose tweak, eye gouge, and rotating fist that bobs the dock worker on the head... ? He's nuts or something ... Riggs steps back and adopts a neutral fighting stance. The others begin to circle. The DOG BARKS. Riggs turns to the dog, but his eyes never leave his grinning attackers.

Something inside Riggs is gearing up ... the others can perhaps sense it, their smiles falter a bit, they crouch, combat-ready... Riggs, eyes blazing ...

We know from the look in Riggs. eyes he's nuts. He wants the fight, badly, all four of them at once ... And then Punk #1 springs... Big mistake. Needless to say, mincemeat is made of the four meddlesome dog-torturers. The beach is littered with their writhing forms as Riggs does, finally, what he set out to do: Unties the dog. Starts to go. As he does, he pats his shirt ... Pats his jeans ... Realizes his wallet has flown free during the fracas. Scoops to retrieve it from its resting place on the sand, where it lies open, and as it lies open, yes, folks, that is a badge we see. Riggs, we realize, is an officer of the law. He lights a cigarette and notices the collie, seated. Frowns:
</DIRECTION>
<RIGGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, skeezix. Go on. Get outta here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIGGS>

He begins to walk away. The dog remains close at his heels. Following him.

<RIGGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, no. Don.t follow me. I.m an asshole. Go away.
	</DIALOGUE>

The dog sits obediently and Riggs walks away. He can.t help it, looks back over his shoulder... Sees the dog watching him with a beseeching expression. Pitiful.

Martin Riggs and three lot employees are gathered around the liftgate of a truck bearing a load of Christmas trees. The truck shields them from the view of customers picking out trees in the lot.

Riggs ducks, allowing Drug Dealer Two to take the full force of the .blast in the face. Riggs rolls in the sawdust FIRING his BERETTA. Dealer Four takes a bullet between the eyes. Dealer Two now has an AUTOMATIC RIFLE in his hand. It CHATTERS in Riggs. direction. Sawdust and pine needles fly in the air -- but Riggs is able to blow him away. One more Drug Dealer left. Riggs can.t find him. His eyes dart in all directions. Where is he?! Behind Riggs, that's where! He presses a revolver to the back of Riggs. head, taking Riggs. Baretta from him and tucking it into his belt. Thats when:

FIVE NARCOTICS OFFICERS

The narcotics officers don't know what to do. They are frustrated. Helpless. Immobilized. Riggs sees the van looming up. The van means defeat. The van means disgrace. The van means victory for the bad guys, and we know that Riggs would rather die than be the instrument of the Dealer's escape.

The Dealer is so freaked now that his grip on Riggs slips momentarily -- and Riggs sees his opening. He spins. Kicks the Dealer in the groin. Dislocates his arm -- sending the gun flying. Riggs retrieves his Baretta from the Dealer's belt and shoves the barrel into the Dealer's face. Riggs' entire body quakes with rage. His finger begins to squeeze back on the trigger. He wants to kill the guy so bad he can taste it... and yet, he doesn't do it. The other officers arrive and step between Riggs and the Dealer. Riggs turns away. Breatliing hard. Adrenalin pumping. He tucks the Baretta into his belt, then notices that his hand is covered with the spilled blood of one of the Drug Dealers. It gives Riggs pause. For a moment, he just looks at it. HOLD ON Riggs. VERY CLOSE. And the look in his eyes.

Behind him in the door frame we see a fat cop pass by down the hall, walking backwards; a beat, and then he is followed by four more cops singing the world's shittiest rendition of “It Came Upon a Midnight Clear.” It sounds like pigs mating. Burke approaches Murtaugh:

Murtaugh slings on a jacket. Turns to go. Notices Riggs.

Riggs resembles a bag person. Unshaven, limp dirty hair, grimy leather jacket.

	Oh, perfect. Can I trade in my life for a new one?

At which point, across the room, Riggs removes the hol- stered gun and hefts it, curiously. Suddenly all hell breaks loose:
</DIRECTION>
<MURTAUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Gun !!
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURTAUGH>
<DIRECTION>
He bolts like a cheetah. Cops dive for cover, a secretary shrieks, and Murtaugh goes plowing through the squad room like an express train, blowing people out of the way -- Cops grabbing for their holsters -- Riggs, meanwhile, looking around frantically, he's trying to find the guy with the gun who is, of course, himself. Murtaugh takes a flying leap sails across the desk, going for the glory And Riggs, in the blink of an eye, simply ducks and flips Murtaugh neatly over one shoulder. There is a hideous crash of BREAKING GLASS and OVERTURNING FURNITURE. Ouch... McCaskey, meanwhile, screams to Burke:
</DIRECTION>
<MCCASKEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What the shit is going on?

As down they plunge, all ten stories -- Tumbling and falling -- MacCleary shrieking like a lunatic ... And suddenly, BAM -- ! They land in a firemanÒs net. Bounce a few times.

And so on, screaming and ranting -- As a uniformed cop cuts Riggs free with a set of clippers. Riggs stands shakily. Steps away from the net. And there is Roger Murtaugh. Visibly upset. Did I say upset? I meant enraged. He grabs Riggs, slams him against the wall. Tries to grab his collar. RiggsÒ hand shoots out. Lightning fast. Stops MurtaughÒs hand. Stops it cold. They stare into each otherÒs eyes.

Riggs smiles, takes the gun without missing a beat. Puts it to his head. CLICK -- ! The hammer is cocked. Murtaugh and Riggs stare each other down. Tense. Reading each other.

Meanwhile, in the b.g., pedestrians are diving for cover. Murtaugh and Riggs are oblivious. Riggs puts the gun under his chin.

	Under the chinÒs just as good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RIGGS>
<DIRECTION>
They stare at each other. RiggsÒ finger begins to tighten on the trigger. Turns white with pressure. It looks like heÒs going to do it. At the last second, Murtaugh jams his thumb in front of the hammer, and CLICK Jesus ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The hammer thuds against his thumb. Murtaugh grabs the gun. Stares at Riggs, wild-eyed.

The rich guy does not hold it right there. In fact, he has already snatched up the SHOTGUN. He triggers a BLAST, BLOWS OUT GLASS next to Murtaugh. Murtaugh dives, rolls, comes up in a combat crouch. BAM --- The rich guy takes it in the shoulder. Spins around. The gun clatters to the ground. Riggs and Murtaugh approach, guns drawn. The rich guy writhes on the ground, clutching his shoulder. Murtaugh says to Riggs:
</DIRECTION>
<MURTAUGH>

	See how easy that was? Boom. Still alive. Now we take the gun away ...

Unfortunately ... as Murtaugh speaks, he does not see the man on the ground has a hideaway gun tucked into his waistband. As Murtaugh talks, oblivious ... The guy takes out the gun with his good arm -- and aims dead center-at MurtaughÒs back. Riggs, however, notices. And springs into action. Before the rich guy can fire ... RiggsÒ foot flashes out like a pile driver. CRACK! The guy flies backward. Lands on top of the pool tarpaulin. Oops. It promptly surrounds him in a sucking, vice-like grip. Murtaugh dives forward and extends his hand. Too late. The vinyl surrounds the screaming rich guy, sucks him below the surface. Smothers him. Drags him to the bottom. Murtaugh looks on, wild-eyed. On the bottom of the pool is a vinyl tomb. Murtaugh dives in. Swims to the bottom. Yanks, and strains, but we all know itÒs no fucking use. The vinyl stops moving. Murtaugh stares... and then he gives up. Surfaces at the side of the pool, gasping and wheezing. Riggs kneels down beside him.

Everyone is gathered, eating. Incredibly homey and domestic- looking. For Riggs, who eats ravenously, it is the first taste of warmth in many a long year.
</DIRECTION>

ACROSS THE TABLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
We notice something kind of neat: Rianne simply cannot take her eyes off Riggs. She stares at him, in a trance. Her brother NICK nudges her in the ribs. She pulls a face.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MURTAUGH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Has also noticed his daughterÒs attentions, and you can bet heÒs not all that happy about it.

Riggs makes no reply. He just looks at Murtaugh over the rim of his beer can.
</DIRECTION>
<MURTAUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I donÒt get you, Riggs. WhatÒs the problem? We got one dead girl and one dead guy. Dead guy killed the dead girl and we killed the dead guy Ñcause he wanted us to be dead guys. Seems pretty easy to me.

Riggs has wandered over to the instrument panel. He in- spects the switches and gauges.

Murtaugh fumbles with the switches in a futile effort to turn off the engine. But Riggs knows exactly which switch to flip.

Murtaugh looks down sheepishly at the can of beer in his hand. Riggs grins to himself.

<MURTAUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>

</MURTAUGH>
<DIRECTION>
Riggs shakes his head, smiles and starts to climb off the boat.
</DIRECTION>
<RIGGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah. We resolved that your wife takes out the garbage. Your daughter smokes pot, which is illegal but shouldnÒt be - - that you donÒt know from boats, and you got one hell of a family, guy.

EXT. SUNSET STRIP - NIGHT

Martin Riggs cruises along in his battered pickup truck past all-night dives and porno houses. The streets are nearly deserted. Except for a young HOOKER on the cor- ner. Real young, maybe seventeen. Riggs sees her and pulls over to the curb. The Hooker approaches.

The house is dark and quiet at this hour. Roger Murtaugh fixes a sandwich in the kitchen. Rickles the CAT PURRS, rubs against his leg.
</DIRECTION>
<MURTAUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey.

</MURTAUGH>
<DIRECTION>
He kicks it aside. Notices a package on the counter, together with a scribbled crayon note:

<DIRECTION>
HAPPY BIRTHDAY SERGEANT MURTAUGH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The gift is a 99c special, right off the rack at Pic NÒ Save: The TUFF NÒ READY Police Action Playset; Tiny plastic gun, made in Taiwan. Tiny plastic badge. Murtaugh smiles. Notices another package next to it. Frowns. Its label reads: ROGER MURTAUGH: POLICE EVIDENCE.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LIVING ROOM

He opens the package. Two things: a high school year- book; also a videocassette. Takes it, slides it into a VCR machine. Turns on the television.

INT./EXT. RIGGSÒ TRAILER - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The Hooker watches TV -- really enjoying the Three Stooges. Riggs stands apart from her. HeÒs not watch- ing TV; heÒs watching her watching TV. He wears a melancholy expression. The world is full of happy families like MurtaughÒs, but he has to get by like this. His eyes shift to a photo of his wife. He picks it up and views it sadly.

They know they got it wrong, but theyÒre pleased with themselves just the same. The Hooker hugs Riggs impul- sively. Riggs looks uncomfortable. HeÒd like to show her some platonic affection, but he knows thatÒs impossible.
</DIRECTION>

He gently unwraps her arms from around his neck.
</DIRECTION>
<RIGGS>

SAME PLACE - LITTLE BIT LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Murtaugh is in front of the TV. On his lap is a high school yearbook. Open to the middle. He glances down, sees - - a photograph of Amanda Lloyd. Senior picture. Smiling. Young. The girl most likely to. He looks up up at the television. On the screen Amanda Lloyd is writhing in ecstasy. Smiling. Murtaugh continues to watch. Lights another cigarette. There is a sad, faraway look on his face.

Very late now. Murtaugh walks down the hall to a bedroom door. Opens it a fraction. Inside -- His daughter Rianne is asleep. A shaft of moonlight falls across the bed. She is more beautiful than weÒve ever seen her. Murtaugh crosses to the bed, leans down, and kisses her forehead. She stirs in her sleep, smiles like a cat, and whispers:

INT. MURTAUGHÒS BEDROOM

He takes off his robe, drapes it on a chair. Gets into bed silently next to his sleeping wife. Lies awake, staring up at the ceiling. The RAIN BEATS on the window, throwing odd shadows across his face. He drifts toward sleep. As he does, we ever so slowly ...

Riggs steps to the line. Draws the Beretta, fires off a full clip. Three-shot rhythms, two in the chest, one in the head, two in the chest, one in the head. Removes the magazines lovingly snaps in a new one.

<DIRECTION>
Murtaugh steps to the red line. Stretches. Cracks his neck. Shifts from foot to foot. Finally steadies him- self. A moment then: He cross-draws with lightning swiftness. -- BANG -- ! The REPORT is DEAFENING. The target grows a neat third eye. Perfect shot. Dead center. Murtaugh grins, holsters his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<MURTAUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey-hey. WouldÒja look at that? Pretty good for an old man.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURTAUGH>

Riggs shrugs. Draws. FIRES. He isnÒt even looking. Nonetheless. -- He puts a magnum round right through the hole made by MurtaughÒs .38. The hole gets .60 inches wider. Murtaugh scowls.

EXT. WEST L.A. STREET - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MurtaughÒs car glides up to the curb. In front of a row of neat frame houses. Old neighborhood. Late model cars. A LITTLE black KID playing on the sidewalk. The two cops get out, stride toward a cottage set back from the street. They pass the Little Kid who is playing with a plastic bucket and a headless Star Wars figure.
</DIRECTION>

</RIGGS>
<DIRECTION>
They mount the steps to the walk. As they do -- The HOUSE suddenly EXPLODES. It BLOWS APART concussively. There is a flash of light, a loud, flat BANG --! And the thing tears to pieces. Glass blows out. Wood sprays. Flying shrapnel. A wall of flame. Riggs hits the dirt, smothering the Little black Kid. Murtaugh dives for cover behind a telephone pole. A piece of shrapnel imbeds itself; right next to his head. Carnage. Noise. The tumult slowly begins to fade. Echoes. Flames rage to the sky. Smoke rolls. Beams collapse. The cottage is no more. Murtaugh climbs to his feet, dazed; stares at the rubble. Looks over toward Riggs, who is getting up off the Kid. The Kid is shaken, but unhurt.

A sprawling, expensive villa nestled on the side of a bluff overlooking the ocean. Terraces, verandahs, gazebos. Architecture that merits three syllables. The ocean looks cheap by comparison. A memorial service is in progress. A group of people, mostly young, friends of Amanda Lloyd; all are dressed in funeral black.

Martin Riggs is collapsed in a lawn chair, smoking and looking thoroughly out of place. Seeing the girl, he frowns ... puffs on his cigarette, and rolls a quarter over his knuckles like a stage magician. Nimble, trained fingers. A thoroughly unconscious habit.

Murtaugh relaxes visibly. And that's when two things happen. The picture WINDOW GLASS suddenly COLLAPSES. Falls TINKLING into a million shards. And the carton of milk in Lloyd's hand pops, spurting milk all over the front of his black suit. He frowns. Stares at the dribbling milk. Blinks. And his eyes snap open wide, as blood seeps out of his shirt, spattering the floor.

With his dying breath, he leaps in front of Murtaugh. Takes the SECOND BULLET. The one meant for Murtaugh. It blows him into Roger, takes them both to the floor in a breath- crushing impact. More BULLETS CHOP thkitchen. China PLATES BURST into a glassy spray. Food spatters and gushes, staining the walls. Murtaugh rolls free, then, a man possessed: Screams out the window:

Murtaugh's voice is far away. Riggs looks up from his lawn chair. Notices two things: One: Everything seems normal. Nobody has heard the shots.

moving at a dead run, now, gun out ... at the edge of the cliff. People all around him, confused, I mean Jesus, what the hell is all this shooting about, and Riggs can't get a clear shot ... He's sweeping the gun, back and forth, bodies crossing in front of him...all the wrong bodies, Goddammit...! Moving forward, shouting:

<DIRECTION>
Murtaugh, springing hell bent for leather -- and folks, grab your hats ... because just then, a BELL COBPA HELI- COPTER crests the edge of the bluff. An explosion of sound... As it rises like an avenging angel ... Hovers, shattering the air with turbo-throb, sandblasting the hillside with a roto-wash of loose dirt, tables, chairs, everything that's not nailed down ... Screaming, chaos, frenzy. Three words that apply to this scene. And in the midst of all this -- Joshua steps onto the chopper and is hauled inside. No expression.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The total professional. And then, my friends, it's bye-bye time. The CHOPPER ROARS like a behemoth, tilts -- slips over the side and plummets away ... Slick. Very slick. Except Martin Riggs it not impressed. He's still running, you see ... Dives flat at the edge of the cliff, nearly flings himself over the damn edge ... GUN extended like it's part of his arm... Finger flat on the trigger ...Blowing SHOT after SHOT at the retreating chopper ... BAM-BAM-BAM His face contorted in a rictus of animal concentration...And he wings the chopper, even. POP spray of fiberglass, but nossir, no cigar... cause the damn chopper flies away. And Riggs dumps his magazine, stuffs in a new one ... and Jesus Christ he keeps FIRING. As Murtaugh walks up beside him. Stares down. Gun held loose at his side. Riggs still FIRES, BAM-BAM-BAM doesn't know it yet ... Until his MAGAZINE CLICKS empty. He lies flat. Stares. People screaming, running away. Murtaugh standing over him, staring down at this animal with a gun, who even now refuses to look away from the retreating chopper, whose gun even now continues to follow its course out over the sea. Hands, clutching the barrel. Finally, they relax. Riggs shuts his eyes. Murtaugh stares, and a silent It's over, but he

As he does -- He notices a reflection in the silver lighter. Two pinpoints of light. Moving. He throws away the cigarette. Spins, drawing his gun. HEADLIGHTS, as a car comes barreling out of the darkness. Bearing down on Riggs at fifty miles an hour. Riggs FIRES. The WIND-SHIELD SPLINTERS. No dice. The car keeps coming. Riggs FIRES again, sprints for cover -- As a mercenary leans out of the car window with a pump SHOTGUN. Triggers THREE BLASTS at Riggs. The first two blow out chunks of scenery. The third takes Riggs in the chest. Blows him backward through a store window. GLASS SHATTERS. He hits the ground in a heap. The CAR SHRIEKS off into the night, LAYING RUBBER.

Murtaugh's CAR SCREECHES to the curb. Hops the sidewalk, jolts to a stop. The two cops are out and running in a dead heat toward the front door. Murtaugh flings open the door. Stops. On the carpet beneath the mail slot is a tiny envelope with SEASONS GREETINGS emblazoned across the front. A note is attached with a paper clip. One side reads DETECTIVE ROGER MURTAUGH. On the other side is a message in block capitals.

Murtaugh tears open the envelope, afraid to breathe. Inside is a Polaroid snapshot. The audience may get a glimpse of it, or they may not. Either way, the effect it has on Murtaugh is devastating. He drops the snapshot like a live snake. Backs away, stumbles into the wall. Shakes his head.

At which point, my friends, a light flickers on behind Riggs' eyes. We see grim determination, sure ... But we also sense something else, oddly enough: Anticipation. Riggs is a machine ... and the machine is, well ... revving up. He looks at Murtaugh:

INT. MARTIN RIGGS' TRAILER - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The apartment is dark, illuminated only by a tiny lamp. Riggs crosses to the window, peers out through slatted blinds. On TELEVISION a group of carolers sings “TIDINGS OF COMFORT AND JOY.” Riggs looks at the wall calendar: December 22. The CLOCK TICKS. The REFRIGERATOR HUMS. He goes to the closet. Opens it. A cloud of dust billows out. Reaches in, removes a weathered cardboard box. Sits in the center of the room, takes a shot of bourbon. Opens the box. Inside is a set of desert fatigues. He takes them out. Underneath a wicked-looking hunting knife. He takes that, too. Holds it up near his face, and it positively sparkles in the dim light ...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
TIME CUT:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER ANGLE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Riggs stands, fully dressed. Colt .22 in an ankle holster. Combat webbing. Desert boots. Beretta .9 millimeter, riding the right-hand thigh. Scans his appearance in the mirror. Breathes: in, out...in, out... Glances at the photograph of his wife on the wall. Wedding gown. White lace-and-satin ruffles. Beautiful. His face is craggy. Weathered. Covered with desert paint. Surely he was never married ... not this demon...

The desert floor shimmers with stored heat, bathed in relentless sunlight. A lone car, plowing along toward the horizon. Looking lost and utterly alone beneath the clear December sky.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CAR - ROGER MURTAUGH
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Driving. Relentlessly onward, his face locked in a mask of contained fury. Dust billows past the windows. Wind. He keeps driving, straining his eyes ahead, focusing through the hundred-degree shimmer... Noticing, finally a series of shapes...dim mirages... silhouettes maybe, possibly men...possibly the men...The mirage resolves. Mercs. Standing next to a black sedan. Murtaugh stiffens. Leans forward, punches the cigarette lighter, and as he does -- he whispers into his hidden microphone.

It happens in the blink of an eye: The trunk pops open, and out rolls Martin Riggs. Yanks a rope. The trunk slams shut. Riggs hits. Rolls. Comes up, combat- crouched, hunkers off at a dead heat. He is clad in his desert fatigues. Magnum sniper rifle slung over one shoulder.

Murtaugh waits. Sweating. Hands in pockets. And out comes Rianne, followed by the vicious Merc. He holds a knife squarely at her throat. Murtaugh's eyes fill with tears. Relief that she's alive..

Riggs does not respond. Stares into space. Kendo leans over the tub, reaches in -- And that's when we find out Riggs has been faking. His eyes focus. No longer hazed. He snaps his hand forward to the end of the chain. Grabs Kendo by the hair. In the blink of an eye, he slams the man's head down against the porcelain tub. Kendo's nose shatters. The Oriental topples over into the tub. The battery drops to the floor. Riggs is a fucking machine: he flips the chain around Kendo's neck and wrenches. Hard. He goes limp. Riggs is not through yet. He begins to heave and thrash, thrusting against the chains -- Maneuvering the corpse on top of him. Shifting it. Moving Kendo's pants pocket within reach. He reaches in. Slowly, carefully, brings out a shiny silver key ...

Rianne screams. Murtaugh shouts. Strains. The chair thumps up and down, creating an insane, staccato rhythm. The General laughs. Rianne shrieks. Harrowing. Terri- ble. A scene out of Hell. And then the Devil comes in and kicks the door off its hinges. Okay. Okay. Let's stop for a moment. First off, to describe fully the mayhem which Riggs now creates would not do it justice. Here, however, are a few pointers: He is not flashy. He is not Chuck Norris. Rather, he is like a sledge-hammer hitting an egg. He does not knock people down. He does not injure them. He simply kills them. The whole room. Everyone standing. Except for- -the General, who ducks out a side door and escapes ... Riggs' chain moves like a live thing. Snapping here. Striking there. Mercs try to draw their guns -- And suddenly their hands are shattered wrecks. One merc draws a bead on Rianne, almost gets off a shot, because Riggs is across the room. Without missing a beat -- Riggs throws the chain. It wraps the guy's neck and kills him instantly. Ouch ... He goes down, FIRING useless ROUNDS into the ceiling. Plaster rains. Riggs spins, dives. Scoops up the baseball bat. Comes up beside an armed merc -- Swings the bat with hurricane force. A sickening impact. The bat breaks in half. Riggs spins, combat-ready. Scans the room. No one left to kill. Using only the element of surprise, he has taken out an entire room in hand-to-hand combat. He steps in front of Murtaugh without missing a beat. Cuts him loose with a borrowed knife.

Riggs FIRES through the wall, BLAM -- ! A corpse falls into view. They keep moving. Downstairs. Around another corner. Moving, moving. The three of them keep moving. Rushing headlong toward a sign marked EXIT. They may actually make it...Or not. For at that moment, Mr. Joshua looms up behind them and tosses something in their direction. Ducks back out of sight. It's a live grenade. The grenade hits the floor. Clatters. Riggs stops instantly. He knows the sound. Spins. Dives. Scoops up the GRENDADE and chucks it with all his might. It bounces downstairs and EXPLODES at the foot of the steps.

His GUN CLICKS empty. He tosses it aside. Pulls another from his waistband. The car. Far away. FIRES FOUR more SHOTS. Collapses in the street. Nearly' unconscious. Crawls forward after the car, blood streaming from his broken nose...Going on sheer guts. Finally gives out. Slumps in a heap. Riggs kneels beside him as a police CAR ROARS up to them, flashers spinning. Riggs is a man possessed. We PANA-GLIDE with him as he runs forward. M-16 in one hand. Badge in the other.

He takes off after the Joshua's car. On foot. Someone better tell this guy to lighten up. The car is far ahead, racing onto a freeway on-ramp. Riggs runs. Sweat pours off him. Seeing the car on the ramp, he changes direction. Starts running an intercept course. Leaps out into the street--Spins, as a TRUCK BLARES out of nowhere, BRAKES SQUEALING, HORN SHRIEKING. Somersaults over the hood.Lands. Keeps moving. Barrels across the street. Faster now. Even faster than before. Feet pounding. Gun swinging. Dashing out onto the freeway overpass. Where, without stopping, he promptly jumps the guardrail. Drops through space ... And lands, thump -- ! Atop the big green freeway sign. Swings like an acrobat. Dangles from the sign, twenty feet above the ground. Levels the M-16 one- handed, switches it to full auto. Waits ...

Joshua's CAR comes SCREAMING through the underpass, doing eighty. Riggs unleashes the GUN. It BLAZES with cruel FIRE. STRAFES the back of the car. Sure enough, BLOWS out both TIRES -- Throwing the VEHICLE into a deadly SKID-- Slewing across the freeway--STRIKING the GUARDRAIL at sixty-plus. It slides for a full hundred yards, sending up a shower of sparks. The back tires disintegrate in a trail of burning rubber. The CAR GRINDS to a halt. The door opens and Joshua rolls out. Riggs FIRES. Kicks up a cloud of cement near the merc. Joshua RETURNS FIRE.

They are separated by perhaps two hundred yards. Joshua snaps his rifle to his shoulder. Eyes glued to the scope. Riggs swings his own rifle into position -- and we've got the showdown at the O.K. Corral. A battle of wits. Each one scanning through the scope. Looking for a clear shot, as CARS SWERVE around and between them. The crosshairs sweep the freeway. Perfect concentration. Riggs. Joshua. Two soldiers. And suddenly, the shot is there: Joshua sights in on Riggs' position. Only problem is, Riggs' rifle is pointed right at the CAMERA. He is sighted in on Joshua. Simultaneous. They FIRE at the exact same moment. TWO SHOTS. Two distinct RIFLE CRACKS. Riggs takes it in the shoulder. Blown backward. Joshua goes down, winged. Riggs. Joshua. Each looks like shit. They struggle to their feet ... And that's when a car backs up into Riggs at thirty miles an hour. Broadsides him. Sends him flying.

There is no reason for Murtaugh to be standing. He is a walking testament to man's ability to bloody himself. And he's pissed... The Merc sees him, snarls-- punches the gas. Murtaugh holds his ground. He can barely stand. And then he does a peculiar thing: He examines his hand. No question. A definite tremble. Scowls. Stretches. Cracks his neck. Shifts from foot to foot, steadying himself. He has one shot. The numbers are falling, it's all coming down -- And he's ready. The van comes barreling in. Doing fifty. Now or never...

Murtaugh steps out of the way. Deadly calm. As the van careens past -- He salutes the General. Watches, expressionless...The CAR SLAMS into a telephone pole and rolls over. GRINDING METAL.

Joshua spins, triggering the UZI.- STRAFES the car. A withering FIRE. Empties an entire clip at the front WINDSHIELD, dicing it to SMITHEREENS. Waves the gun like a WAND, STRAFING X patterns, FIRING all the while, completely EXTINGUISH- ING the car and all life within. Stops. Silence. Floating debris. Joshua lowers the gun. Breathing hard.

He launches himself at Joshua. Joshua strikes, scores a minor point, breaking Riggs' collarbone, except Riggs doesn't care,nosirree Bob... ‘Cause he just hit paydirt: Joshua's knee. Boot-strikes, BAM -- ! Shearing the knee, maybe bursting the cap ... Joshua shrieks, but then again, so would you. And he promptly jack-knives his fist right into Riggs' broken arm. Three times. Riggs bellows. Refuses to quit. Slams his head into Joshua's busted nose. Pop ... Does it again. Joshua, hammering the broken arm. Pow.(Scream) Pow.(Scream) ... Until, son of a bitch... The pain is simply too intense... nothing human can withstand it, they fall away, staggering, wrenching to a shaky halt, facing one another, standoff ... Exhausted, limping, hardly able to speak...

Pulling up now, cops stumbling out, guns clearing their holsters as Murtaugh waves frantically, screams:

spits, gazes straight at Joshua. Joshua stares back. Two soldiers. This close to collapsing. Until, breaking the silence -- comes Murtaugh's voice:
</DIRECTION>
<MURTAUGH>

	Martin.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURTAUGH>
<RIGGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.

</RIGGS>
<MURTAUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Kill the motherfucker.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MURTAUGH>
<DIRECTION>
A moment...and then, my friends, Riggs does a peculiar thing: He smiles then. Damned if he doesn't. And rises up ... Standing. Standing straight. There is no way he should be able to do this. And then he speaks, and it's like the voice of doom, and all of a sudden we know that this guy is a fucking legend, we know why the V.C. en- forcers whispered his name at night in the foxholes ... He is Riggs. And no one can touch him. No one.

</RIGGS>
<DIRECTION>
He steps forward. Stands. Joshua springs -- thunders his foot into Riggs' hip, separating the bone at the joint ... And Riggs doesn't blink. His hand comes out. Lightning quick. There is a sick-sounding CRACK -- And Joshua is dead before he hits the ground. Riggs hovers over the corpse... breathing spastic, saliva dripping from his lips... takes a handkerchief, wipes his hand, and says:
</DIRECTION>
<RIGGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You lose.

</RIGGS>

At which point, he collapses like a sack of grain.

MURTAUGH

is running forward, tears in his eyes by this time, falls to his knees, cradling Riggs in his arms, while the assembled cops look on in thoroughly stunned silence, what they have just seen is beyond their wildest imagining ...

Riggs looks at Murtaugh. Murtaugh looks at Riggs.

EXT. LONG BEACH BAR - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Christmas carolers sing outside at roadside. A big banner screams MERRY CHRISTMAS to passing cars. Christmas lights. Tinsel. Murtaugh and Riggs stand on the sidewalk, huddled against the chill. Riggs stands, braced on one crutch. Arm in a sling. Their breath plumes out in front of them.

He walks off down the street. Murtaugh watches him go. Pause. Turns up his collar against the chill, takes a few steps ... And a man steps in front of him. The same Punk who Riggs beat the shit out of at the very beginning of the film.
</DIRECTION>
<PUNK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hey, old man, got any money?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PUNK>
<DIRECTION>
Murtaugh stops. Stares. Blinks. And proceeds to kick the shit out of him. A kick. A punch. The Punk lies on the sidewalk, semi-conscious. Murtaugh scowls and says:

EXT. CEMETERY - DUSK (SAME DAY)
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
RAIN pours down. Martin Riggs stands over a lone grave. There are dark hollows under his eyes. The wind tugs at his hair. The tombstone reads:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
VICTORIA LYNN RIGGS.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
BORN: 1953.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
DIED: 1984.
</DIRECTION>

He reaches beneath his overcoat and removes a bright green Christmas wreath, which he places atop the grave. Kisses his fingertips. Presses them to the moist earth.

Carpenters are at work, patching and repairing. The Christmas lights still shine defiantly. A car pulls up.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
CUT TO:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FRONT DOOR
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
As a hand knocks softly: The door opens -- and there stands young Rianne. Adorable. She looks up at the visitor... It is Martin Riggs.

He hands something to her. She takes it. The bottle of pills. It has a red ribbon tied around it.

Rianne blushes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Riggs begins to walk away, into the rain... Until Roger Murtaugh appears from inside the boat on the trailer hitch. He stands on deck and looks down at Riggs. Riggs stops. They stand there in the rain for a moment. Then Murtaugh looks him square in the eye and says:
</DIRECTION>
<MURTAUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sucker, if you think I'm gonna cut the world's lousiest Christmas turkey all by my lonesome, you're nuts.
	</DIALOGUE>

Riggs nods. A moment passes. Then:

<RIGGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think your daughter kinda likes me.

<MURTAUGH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You touch her, I'll kill you.

</MURTAUGH>
<RIGGS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll try.

He smiles. Murtaugh smiles. The rain falls, as they enter the house together, and we

FADE OUT:
