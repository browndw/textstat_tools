I don't give a damn what Spike says, Tarantino is right. Nigger is just a word. If Dirty Ole Bastard can use it every other word so can I.

<DELACROIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've done a lot of soul searching and once again you are right. In my previous work it's been all surface, superficial. I have never really dug deep. Not anymore. As Mark Twain fully understood satire is the way. Race has always been a hot button in this country's history and it needs to be pushed harder. If we are ever to live side by side in peace and harmony. It's about promoting racial healing.

	I know you're familiar with minstrel shows. They came about at the turn of the 19th century. It was a variety show in which the talent was in blackface - singing, dancing, telling jokes, doing skits. Dunwitty, I ask you when was the last time there was a good variety show on the air. Carol Burnett? HeeHaw?

	Now I'm privileged?! Why? Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare? Because I didn't call home a cardboard box? No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too. Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.

INT. DUNWITTY'S OFFICE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DELACROIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I strongly feel that a Negro should direct this. This kind of satire is a high wire act in a gale storm. One misstep and we're doing "Amos and Andy." Only a Negro will have the sensitivity and cultural awareness to navigate this dangerous terrain.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELACROIX>
<DUNWITTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To hire someone solely on their ethnicity, gender or religion is not right. It's un-American. I will hire someone who is most qualified for this particular job.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNWITTY>
<DELACROIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was hoping to perhaps direct some episodes myself, if not the pilot soon after.

	You're telling me some white boy is gonna direct this pilot?

	Besides, what does he know about Negroes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DELACROIX>
<DUNWITTY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Probably nuthin', but that's why it's such a sexy way to go. Sometimes an outsider has a fresh new outlook, a different unique perspective. A black director, y'know what he's gonna do given the subject matter? With this kid, the possibilities are endless.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DUNWITTY>
<DELACROIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What are his qualifications besides being a white male and directing a hot new sexy freaky Madonna video?

	If Spielburg can direct "The Color Purple" and "Amistad", our whiz kid can direct the Mantan pilot.

<DELACROIX>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's exactly my point. Has he even directed actors before in anything?

	Because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. Gary, I have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when I get mad. No one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.

She would answer "I don't care what's on that idiot box. No MAN is on the MOON." Well, there are a lot of your Negroes just like my Aunt Sister. Face up to it. The world has changed and if you don't adapt, change with it, you will be left behind. This show is a parody. Are you telling me that nobody can use some humor, have some laughs in their lives?

	Before we begin, I want to thank you for coming on my show for your first television interview. You could have chosen Mike Wallace, Barbara Walters, Jane Pauley, whatnot but you're here.

	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm more comfortable around my people.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANTAN>
<TAVIS_SMILEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's jump right into it. Your show has sparked a world of controversy, provoked a tone of dialogue. How do you see all of this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAVIS_SMILEY>
<MANTAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yo, Tavis, check it out. This is the two-one, the 21st century and it's all about the money. Like my man Mase says, "it's all about the Benjamins."

</MANTAN>
<TAVIS_SMILEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Money and nothing else?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAVIS_SMILEY>
<MANTAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Money makes the world go round. It ain't no joke being poor. I know whatI'mtalkin''bout. Y'knowwhatI'msayin'? I've lived on the street. I've been homeless. I've learned how to play the game, work the game, be in the game.

<TAVIS_SMILEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is it inevitable that the game plays you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAVIS_SMILEY>
<MANTAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No if you go with the flow, Tavis. That's what a lot of Negroes don't understand. Protesting isn't gonna do a damn thing. If people don't like our satire in our number one hit show then don't watch it. Or better yet write your own show. Do it better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MANTAN>
<TAVIS_SMILEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you feel that is a simplistic retort?
	</DIALOGUE>
</TAVIS_SMILEY>
<MANTAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know what a retort is, but it's simple. Mantan - The New Millennium Minstrel Show is UNIVERSAL. It's not just for Negroes in Compton or 125th in Harlem. This is America. Our ancestors helped build this country, we got a right, just like everybody else. I'm not gonna box myself in. This show makes people think, and they're laughing at the same time.

INT. FACTORY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Each Mau-Mau has a 9mm and is firing it at the feet of Manray. They scream "Faster!" and "Dance!" Manray is hoofing. He's never tapped this fast, at this breakneck pace, ever. But it's evident his dance is one of defiance. He's not dancing to stay alive.

Manray somehow manages to right himself and starts to dance again. The Mau-Mau's can't believe it.
</DIRECTION>

He dances like his life depends on it. Despite the fact his feet are a bloody mess.

EXT. FACTORY - CONTINUOUS

The Mau-Mau's come out of the factory high as a kite. Each has a big fat joint or a 64 oz. of DA BOMB. They're also doing a free-style rap about their execution.

</BIG_BLACK>
<DIRECTION>
What follows is a horrifying display of firepower. All the Mau-Mau's bodies are doing the Bonnie and Clyde Sonny Corleone Dance of Death as bullets tear into them and the Suburban. Not one of them is able to get a shot off. The shooting stops. The twitching stops. All's quiet. 1/16th Black comes out with his hands up.
