The door marked EMPLOYEES ONLY swings open and Joe appears, measuring his effect on the customers and his fellow employees as he crosses the sterile white dining room, observing the drab details of the life he has left behind - garbage on greasy dishes, limp food in steam table trays, coffee-soaked cigarette butts, caked mustard and ketchup on formica table tops -- two pimply high school girls slurping suggestive noises after Joe through the straws of empty coke glasses. O.S. a Tiomkin-tradition chorus sings, "From this valley they say you are going -- we will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile for they say you are taking the sunshine..."

Joe sits at the front, opposite the driver, cracking his gum as he watches the huge billboards streaking by, promising him power, happiness and beautiful women if he chooses the right breakfast food, hair oil or automobile. Joe listens to the humming tires, the roar of the engine, shaking his head.

Ignored by the driver, Joe rises and walks back to his empty double seat, glancing around to see what impression he's made on his immediate fellow travelers -- an OLD LADY in front of him -- a hostile young sailor with acne behind him -- two teeny-boppers flirting with Joe hysterically -- a PALE BLONDE directly across the aisle, smiling at Joe weakly.

Joe realizes that her eyes are closed. Mildly depressed, he stretches himself across both seats and turns on his radio, finds only static and snaps it off. Further depressed, he examines his reflection in the bus window, squeezes a black head and runs the comb through his hair, picks a piece of tobacco off his tooth and lights a cigarette, watching the flame die in reflection, forgetting to discard the burnt-out match as he stares out at a vast lonely prairie, a solitary cowboy in the distance, a row of sharecropper shacks apparently deserted, a barefoot little girl motionless at the roadside, watching the bus pass. Through this, leading into the next scene, Sally Buck sings softly "... if that mocking bird don't sing, Grammaw gonna buy you a golden ring..."

Joe is alone again. The Salesman has disappeared. The bus is dark, most-passengers trying to sleep. Only one reading light still burns, over the head of the old-Lady in the seat ahead of Joe.

Joe sets his radio on the dresser, his suitcase on the bed, then turns to examine his new home -- as anonymous as his Texas hotel room -- but boasting a coin-operated television set. Fascinated, Joe inserts a quarter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... the love song continues over a television talk Show featuring a POODLE WIGMAKER defending his profession against a Joe Pyne-type PANEL HOST, "...well, I perform a real service, there's a need, so many people, you know, really live in their pets, I mean, lonely, I grant you, but their feeling is real. They want to lavish as much love, give them as much, yes, pamper them like they were really human children or whatever..."

<DIRECTION>
As a fairy godmother's magic wand removes sticky hair spray from a pretty model's head, Joe's quarter runs out and the screen goes blank. At the same moment, the love song is cut off by a singing station break "W-I-N-S NEW YORK" Joe rises, flipping the dial of the radio to a cultured woman's voice reading "...the Dow Jones averages, brought you by Morgan Vandercook. Up your income with sound investment counseling..."
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Up yours, lady.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
... but Joe leaves the lady on, savoring the expensive sound of her voice reading the stock quotations. Joe seats himself at the desk, pleased to find a postcard photograph of the hotel. He picks up a ballpoint pen, counts ten floors up from the street and marks a huge X -- THIS IS ME, then turns the card over, pen poised over the address blank.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PARK AVENUE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe's heels drag as he walks a deserted block of luxury apartment houses. O.S. The torchy woman's voice sings Joe's love theme in counterpoint to the blasting horns, a siren, a fire bell, a screech of brakes. Joe's spirits rise as he hears the tic-tac-tic of high heels overtaking the heavy click-clack-click of his boots. He adjusts his pace to arrive at the corner at the same time as a smart and -- in Joe's eyes -- very RICH LADY. Joe grins boyishly, holding his Stetson over his heart.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beg pardon, ma'am, I'm new here in town, just in from Houston, Texas, and looking for the Statue of Liberty.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
The delicate profile gives no signs of hearing. Joe follows her to the parkway in the middle of the avenue. There she stops and turns, neither friendly nor hostile.
</DIRECTION>
<RICH_LADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Were you looking? About the Statue of Liberty?

</JOE>
<RICH_LADY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why, that's perfectly dreadful. Aren't you ashamed of yourself?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RICH_LADY>
<DIRECTION>
A twinkle of amusement and sympathy reveals the age lines at the corner of her eyes. Then she continues on quickly, just as the light turns. Joe's view is blocked for a moment by traffic, then he sees...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... the Rich Lady, newly aware of her flanks as she climbs the steps of a brownstone and searches for her key. Still from Joe's viewpoint, he sees himself move into frame and follow the Rich Lady up the steps. The love theme swells O.S. as the Rich Lady leads him into the house and closes the door...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... leaving Joe standing alone on the parkway island, surrounded by towering wealth. The love theme continues over...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LEXINGTON AVENUE - DAY

</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Beg pardon, ma'am. I'm brand spanking new to this town, come from Houston, Texas, and hoping to get a look at the Statue of Liberty...

INT. APARTMENT HOUSE ELEVATOR - DAY

Cass holds the DOOR OPEN button till Joe enters the elevator, then the doors close with a soft expensive little kllooosh and Cass turns with the smile of a very tiny girl...
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hi.
	</DIALOGUE>
</CASS>
<DIRECTION>
... her lips closing on Joe's as the poodle yaps shrilly at their feet. Superimposed, almost subliminally, a golden dollar sign appears, halating like a star, and the bell of a pinball machine rings O.S.
</DIRECTION>

INT. CASS'S APARTMENT - DAY

A princess telephone is ringing on a gold and white desk. Cass runs to grab it...
</DIRECTION>
<CASS>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello?
	</DIALOGUE>

... as Joe steps from the elevator, which opens directly onto Cass's penthouse. Cass beckons him toward her, hooks a finger into his neckerchief and pulls his mouth toward hers while she talks on the phone.

Cass holds the phone toward the yapping poodle, twisting herself against Joe as she wriggles out of her dress, passing the phone from one hand to the other.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, old goosie? Now lookie, when do you want me to meet you? Whatever you say. I'll take a nap, watch TV, you know, kill time. Okay, but just one, a big wet one.

Cass hangs up. The poodle yaps hysterically, disentangling himself from her tumbling dress -- hops onto the couch glances off and flees again as an overturned lamp crashes O.S.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. CASS'S BEDROOM - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The poodle bounces onto the bed -- remaining long enough to establish a TV REMOTE CONTROL TUNER lying on the satin coverlet -- then leaps down in panic as he hears Joe and Cass explode into the bedroom, laughing lustily...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... the remote control tuner buried suddenly under the full flesh of Cass's hip, activating...

<DIRECTION>
... a twenty-five-inch television screen, blasting at full volume...

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe turns away from a small terrace, buckling his belt, glancing off toward the sound of Cass in the shower. He flicks the TV remote control, enjoying his power, ignoring the silent images on the screen -- battle casualties, a pretty girl recommending aspirin, a man's stomach flashing animated pain, starving war refugees, a dog eating pzazz -- flicking it off to concentrate on the costume jewelry and perfume bottles on Cass's dressing table.
</DIRECTION>
<CASS_S_VOICE>

Sobbing suddenly, she throws herself on the bed. Joe stands bewildered by the vastness of her grief.

	Hey. Hey, Cass. Did you think I meant that? Christ, would I be asking you for money with a wad like that riding on my hip?

Joe waves his wallet at her, but she only cries louder. He hands her a kleenex. She clutches it to her face, wailing. Joe leans over the bed, whispering in her ear:

Joe tucks a twenty-dollar bill into her bosom, tilts his Stetson and starts out. Cass blows her nose, looking after him. O.S. chorus sings, "From this valley they say you are going -- we will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile..."

	That is one hell of a shirt. I bet you paid a pretty price for it, am I right?

Ratso spits as JACKIE leans on the bar next to Joe -- a feminine young person, heavily made-up, hair teased, wearing earrings and a lace-trimmed blouse over shocking pink levis.

Joe hurls the crumpled package into a DON'T BE A LITTERBUG basket as he emerges from the subway, his radio at his ear.

Coughing, eyes tearing, Ratso empties his pockets on the counter, finally producing: sixty-four cents, a few sticks of gum, an almost empty cigarette package, a book of matches and two pawn tickets. He raises his eyes, somehow ashamed. Joe kicks the toe of Ratso's loafer.

Ratso fills a saucepan from the tub-sink, sets it on a Sterno stove. Joe sits himself on the mattress-bed, pretending to test it, weeks of exhaustion and tension overwhelming him suddenly, his only immediate problem being the effort to restrain a large, comfortable yawn.

Joe slams his heel down. The coconut shoots out from under him and he lands on his ass.

<RATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>

INT. LAUNDROMAT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Wearing only his boots, Joe sits like an Indian chief, wrapped in a blanket -- angle widening to show Ratso, spotting Joe's jacket, slacks and shirt with cleaning fluid -- his eyes on a very pregnant Italian lady. As she starts to load a coin cleaning machine, Ratso intervenes solicitously, speaking in Italian...

INT. SUBWAY ARCADE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The rhythmic duet of boots and loafers follows Joe and Ratso - checking coin boxes and telephone booths -- till they reach a shoeshine stand, locked for the night. They loiter till a young couple has disappeared, then Joe kicks loose 'the padlock on the equipment drawer, mounts one of the chairs and Ratso goes to work on his boots with furious expertise, flourishing double brushes, snapping the rag like a jazz drummer.
</DIRECTION>

Ratso demonstrates a chimpanzee walk. Joe laughs. Ratso turns back in panic as another man takes a chair next to Joe. Ratso is about to retuse when a cop takes the third chair, swinging his handcuffs around to the front, tapping his shoe with his night stick. Ratso quickly drops a rag over the broken padlock, cursing under his breath as he starts working on all three customers at the same time.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Stupid bastard coughed his lungs out breathing that resin all day. They buried him with gloves on. Even the fag undertaker couldn't get his nails clean.
	</DIALOGUE>

As if by conditioned reflex, Ratso chokes on the cigarette in his mouth, coughing painfully. He crushes it out, opens the window to spit, shivering, then slam it and turns back to remove the towel from Joe's neck.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe performs his ritual as he speaks, but more relaxed, faintly laughing at himself with Ratso. The wall mirror has been added since we last saw the flat, along with a legless overstuffed chair with burnt-out cushions, a tasselled table cover, pinups, calendar girls and several new Florida tourist posters, Ratso moves to Joe's side, arranging the neckerchief, nodding.

	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe slaps his hat on Ratso's head, tilts it, hooks Ratso's thumbs in his jeans and shoves a cigarette into the corner of Ratso's mouth. Ratso laughs till he chokes -- for one instant, self-consciously, mimicking Joe -- then removes the hat and reaches for his threadbare black raincoat.

Joe and Ratso peer down through a basement bay window, into the office of THE PERFECT GENTLEMAN ESCORT SERVICE -- endorsed by leading travel agencies and credit clubs offering discreet companionship and personal guided tours in any language. A large-busted matron, on a French phone, fills out a memo and hands it to an immaculate young ESCORT, who slips the memo into his topcoat pocket as he comes from the office and hails a cab. Ratso darts forward, limping exaggeratedly, holding the door, lifting the memo as he brushes off the Escort's topcoat. The young man waves him away with out a tip. Ratso slams the door and bites his thumb after the cab, unfolding the memo as he joins Joe on the sidewalk.

	Few dozen cooties won't kill me, don't guess.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe hands Ratso his own comb. Ratso swipes at his tangled hair angrily until two teeth break in the comb. He hands the comb back, tugs at his hair with his fingers, pats it in place, then looks back into Joe's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<RATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay? I look okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATSO>
<DIRECTION>
In a moment of silence, distant sounds can be heard -- a siren, the grinding teeth of a garbage truck, the twang of an electric guitar upstairs at the party -- then Ratso makes a quick gesture of impatience and starts up the stairs, pulling himself on the bannister.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MACALBERTSONS' LOFT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A bank of lights blinds Joe and Ratso as they enter -- electronic rock blasts their ears -- a bearded cameraman on a step-ladder photographs them as they stand confused -- facing a monstrous collage of tabloid photos blown up, showing the murder of a hippie known as Groovy -- in-huge black letters, LOVE WAS GROOVY -- GROOVY IS DEAD. Joe shouts over the amplified music.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Better get a hold of someone and tell them I'm here.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Ratso points to his ear -- he can't hear -- following Joe across the room. The huge loft is crowded with a random selection, gathered to serve as dress extras in an underground film. The party is the scene. The MacAlbertsons merely supply the ingredients and allow it to happen, with cameras strategically placed to record the happening...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Hansel with tape recorder, Gretel with hand-held camera drifting through the crowd -- catching words and images in a detached, whimsical fashion. Gretel turns her camera on Joe and Ratso as they approach.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I made it. This here is Ratso Rizzo and I...
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<RATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Rico. Rico Rizzo.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATSO>
<DIRECTION>
Gretel smiles without recognition. Hansel gestures vaguely.
</DIRECTION>
<HANSEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you need anything? I mean there's beer and so forth. Whatever your thing is...
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANSEL>
<DIRECTION>
The twins move away together, pausing to confer with the operator of a tripod camera -- focused on an emaciated flower girl with long hair and dirty feet, stretched in a sarcophagus, clutching a dead daffodil, her eyes glazed. Scrawled in huge letters on the wall over her head -- LOVE!
</DIRECTION>
<RATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If you want the word on that brother and sister act, I'll give you the word. That Hansel's a fag and Gretel's got the hots for herself. So who cares, right? Load up on the salami...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATSO>
<DIRECTION>
Ratso heads for the refreshment table. Joe starts after him but pauses, intrigued by an alcove under the balcony where a light show is in progress -- surreal images of naked bodies projected against abstract currents of color and strobe light...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... a bored fat lady in a muu-muu, squatted like a Buddha at a low table, rolling joints for the guests. She lights a joint and offers it to Joe as he wanders in to watch the show. Joe laughs delightedly when he realizes what it is...
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shee-it, this is one helluva party!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
... glancing around at the others, imitating their techniques -- the quick inhaler, who follows with sharp gulps of air - the deep inhalers who draw air as they inhale -- the stylist who lets the smoke drift out and inhales through the nostrils -- Joe puffing himself slightly dizzy, starting to laugh at the silent flick effect of the strobe light -- the action around him slowing almost imperceptibly, overcranked -- a veil of smoke hanging over the fat woman's face, transforming her into a laughing witch -- a similar veil around Joe's head, relaxing the self-conscious tension of his face, spontaneously curious about the play of light on his hand, grinning at...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... a serious young technician handling the light show, scattering psychedelic stars across a sky of magenta flesh...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Joe reaching for the stars as he rises and wanders back to the crowded loft, fascinated to see...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... a crew with cameras and lights, on the balcony at one end of the loft, photographing the scene below...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... a dark-haired lady by the name of SHIRLEY -- chic in the style of a gangster's moll -- drinking beer from the bottle, predatory eyes searching the crowd...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Ratso surreptitiously stuffing his pockets from the buffet table, glancing nervously over his shoulder, unaware of Gretel and her hand-held camera, photographing Ratso as he steals, turning away casually, disinterested...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Joe laughing as he dances for a moment with a tall black girl -- the lights swinging around them -- faces swimming...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Shirley in fleeting close-up, gone in an instant, reappearing...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MACALBERTSON BATHROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... her face in the mirror smiling in a dark, provocative way -- Joe standing at the bathroom door, forgetting to be embarrassed as Shirley turns away from the mirror, unhurriedly, running her fingers through her hair, boldly meeting Joe's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<SHIRLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can tell, can't you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHIRLEY>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, oh yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SHIRLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What'll we do? Leave now or what? Your place or mine? Oh God, the second I looked at you I knew. Did you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHIRLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Joe grins, watching Shirley's lips move, unable to keep her in sync, startled to hear Ratso's voice.
</DIRECTION>
<RATSO_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She's hooked...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATSO_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MACALBERTSONS' LOFT - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe realizes he is back at the party, Ratso whispering hoarsely.
</DIRECTION>
<RATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... I'd say she was good for ten bucks, but I'll ask for twenty...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATSO>
<DIRECTION>
But Joe is watching with terrible fascination as Hansel and Gretel lift the flower girl from her sarcophagus.
</DIRECTION>
<SHIRLEY_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you know? We were going to make it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHIRLEY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe glances down to see himself flanked by Ratso and Shirley.
</DIRECTION>
<RATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You really want to do business?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATSO>
<SHIRLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's he? Oh God! Don't tell me you two are a couple -- ?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHIRLEY>
<DIRECTION>
The flower girl, hypnotically dazed, accepts a broom dipped in black paint and smears a huge X across LOVE. Joe laughs.
</DIRECTION>
<HANSEL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why are you laughing, Joe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANSEL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Hansel holds a microphone toward Joe, who shrugs, grinning at Ratso and Shirley. Gretel's camera moves down Joe's body.
</DIRECTION>
<HANSEL>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you for real, Joe?
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANSEL>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, I ain't a f'real cowboy, but I'm one hell of a stud!
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Shirley glances at Ratso, who nods, whispering in her ear.
</DIRECTION>
<RATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	A very expensive stud. And I happen to be his manager.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATSO>
<DIRECTION>
The scene -- from Joe's viewpoint -- becomes increasingly confusing and fragmented, dialogue and image moving in and out of focus, cameras and lights surrounding him, keeping the center of attention in his own blown mind...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Shirley's eyes unnaturally bright, inspecting his body, lingering on his thighs, moistening her lips...
</DIRECTION>
<SHIRLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's too much -- to come face to face with a walking talking sex fantasy -- to buy a man's -- God!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHIRLEY>
<DIRECTION>
... the tall black girl dancing in stroble light, starting to remove her clothes -- Gretel following her with a camera...
</DIRECTION>
<SHIRLEY_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can't wait to tell my man Monday. I should be taking notes. Look at my arm!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHIRLEY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
... Shirley's talon-like fingernails caressing the gooseflesh on her tanned arm...
</DIRECTION>
<RATSO_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gotta sit down. I feel crummy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATSO_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Ratso stretched out on a Victorian love seat -- the flower girl walking unsteadily, passing out dead daffodils, placing one in Ratso's hand Gretel photographing his reaction...
</DIRECTION>
<SHIRLEY_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Eat it -- a man in your line of work has to keep his strength up...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHIRLEY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
... Shirley bringing Joe a massive sandwich on a paper plate, watching him bite into it...
</DIRECTION>
<SHIRLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's fantastic, now I know, everything you do has sexual implications. If I you know, bought it -- could I take pictures of you naked? That's part of it, isn't it, kinky kinda things?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHIRLEY>
<DIRECTION>
... the tall black girl and a few others are trying to promote an orgy. A scrofulous old wino dances spastically, working his toothless gums, preparing to expose himself to two girls dancing together...
</DIRECTION>
<HANSEL_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We want you, Joe. You've been chosen.
	</DIALOGUE>
</HANSEL_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
... five youths stand beside the sarcophagus -- two sailors, two cycle freaks, a weight-lifter -- waiting to be pallbearers. Joe joins them. All lights and cameras are turned on the slow funeral procession, carrying the flower girl out of the loft to the tune of "Moonlight and Roses". Strobe light adds to the unreality of the scene...
</DIRECTION>
<SHIRLEY_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I had a thing for him. Before I knew. Why should knowing make it more of a thing?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHIRLEY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
... Shirley talks to Gretel as she photographs the funeral.
</DIRECTION>
<SHIRLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Naturally I'll have to ask myself why a cowboy? And why a cowboy whore? But not tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHIRLEY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. MACALBERTSON LANDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Shirley is pulling her coat out of the pile on the bannister.
</DIRECTION>
<SHIRLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Incidentally, how much is this going to cost me anyway?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHIRLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Joe turns to Ratso, whose attention is fixed on the coats.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Tell her, Ratso.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<RATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty bucks...
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATSO>
<SHIRLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sold. Let's go.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHIRLEY>
<RATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... and taxi fare for me.

</RATSO>
<SHIRLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Get lost.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHIRLEY>
<RATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I agree. And for that service I charge one dollar taxi fare.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATSO>
<DIRECTION>
She takes a dollar from her purse and hands it to Ratso, takes Joe's arm and starts down the stairs. Ratso lingers, starting quickly through the coats, frisking them for loose change.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. LOFT BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
At the foot of the stairs, Shirley kisses Joe violently.
</DIRECTION>
<SHIRLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your name's Joe. Which is fabulous. Joe could be anyone. Kiss me, Joe, move over, Joe, go away, Joe. It's just perfect.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHIRLEY>
<DIRECTION>
They glance up as Ratso appears, swinging down too rapidly on the bannister. He misses a step and falls -- a clown's fall, unable to stop but apparently not hurting himself. Shirley and Joe are laughing when Ratso lands at the foot of the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<SHIRLEY>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)

	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he all right!

<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, if you're awright, why you hanging on the bannister. Can you walk or not?

</JOE>
<RATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Walk? Naturally I can walk.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATSO>
<SHIRLEY>

Joe and Shirley are kissing. Shirley rolls away, flushed, fanning herself. Joe rolls down the window.

EXT. VILLAGE STREET - NIGHT

Joe leans out of the taxi window, waving his Stetson, bellowing at the snow.

</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LOFT BUILDING - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Ratso makes his way slowly from the building to the curb, whistling between his teeth sharply, hailing a cab. The cab slows to a stop. Then the driver sees Ratso, shifts into gear and drives on. Ratso bites his thumb after the cab, rests for a moment on the lamp post, then starts painfully inching his way along the deserted street.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SHIRLEY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe lies on his back, staring fixedly at a fragile mobile hanging from the ceiling, stirring listlessly.
</DIRECTION>
<SHIRLEY_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That happens. Don't worry about it...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHIRLEY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Shirley leans on one elbow, looking at Joe sympathetically, fighting an almost irrepressible desire to laugh. Still avoiding Shirley's eyes, Joe finds a cigarette on the side table, searches for matches.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, that's something never happened to me before, you can bet your bottom dollar. Uh, where's the matches, ma'am?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<SHIRLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Top drawer. Maybe if you didn't call me ma'am, things would work out better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHIRLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Joe finds the matches, lights up and lies back, staring at the mobile as he smokes, still not looking at Shirley.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	First goddam, time it ever quit on me. Fact.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
The repressed laugh finally breaks through. Shirley stifles it quickly as Joe sits up, looking at her.
</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	No. Of course not. Just something struck me funny...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHIRLEY>
<DIRECTION>
Close on Joe -- watching Shirley closely, reacting.
</DIRECTION>
<SHIRLEY_S_VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I just put myself in your shoes. I had this image of a bugler without a horn, a policeman without a stick, etcetera, etcetera and I...

(giggles)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think I'd better shut up, I'm making it worse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHIRLEY_S_VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
Shirley composes her face, reaching out to touch Joe. But that doesn't help either. He reacts sharply.
</DIRECTION>
<SHIRLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe we should take a little nap, see what happens?
	</DIALOGUE>

</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
... camera pulling back to show Joe concentrating on a game, spread out on the sheet, consisting of nine dice lettered on all sides, the object being to build as many words as possible, Scrabble fashion, while a sand timer counts the seconds. Shirley watches Joe's efforts to think with sympathetic amusement. The only word Joe has composed so far is MAN.
</DIRECTION>
<SHIRLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's pretty Freudian, Joe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHIRLEY>
<JOE>

	If you didn't talk so much, maybe you could think more.

Joe spells out MONY, down from the M in MAN.

</SHIRLEY>
<JOE>

Shirley slyly trails the tips of her fingernails across Joe's chest as she leans over to study the game, breathing softly into his ear as she speaks.
</DIRECTION>
<SHIRLEY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It can end in Y day, pay, lay -- hey, pay lay!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SHIRLEY>
<DIRECTION>
One predatory hand rests on his knee -- as if by accident - disarranging the sheet, talon nails lightly brushing his thigh.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Cut it out. That's cheating, teasing me so I can't think. Just one bitsy Y word and I gonna beat you!

	I show you what problem --
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
But the end of his sentence is swallowed by Shirley, taking his kiss in her open mouth, crushed by its impact, an animal noise snarling deep in her throat -- the agonized alley cat wail of pleasure -- Joe's problem is solved. Joe's love theme swells triumphant. At the same time, Shirley half-rises, trying to force Joe's head down, her own on top. The issue is joined. Shirley has named the game. Her objective is to force Joe onto his back. Joe's objective is to retain his initiative. Camera ignores the classic action on the central front, concentrating exclusively on peripheral tactical maneuvers...
</DIRECTION>

INT. MEN'S STORE - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

INT. X FLAT - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... Ratso huddled in the overstuffed chair -- wearing the stolen sheepskin coat -- wrapped in blankets, his teeth chattering, in spite of the sweat on his forehead. Joe stops abruptly, his mood shattered by Ratso's alarming condition. They simply stare at each other for a moment, then Joe turns away to see soup heating on the Sterno stove. Joe tosses one of his paper bags onto Ratso's lap...
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>

	See what you think of that crap. I'll pour your soup. Got some of that junk you like to swill, too. Mentholatum. Aspirin. All that shee it...

Ratso opens the paper bag, trying to control his shivering, pulling out the socks and a suit of long underwear. He sees Joe watching him for a reaction. The best Ratso can do is a slight shake of his head.

Towny's dialogue moves out of sync. Towny's eyes seem to look into camera -- from Joe's viewpoint -- but slightly past it.

Towny hurries across the room to the bedside table. Beside the telephone is a picture of a prosperous pioneer woman wearing a hearing-aid. Towny tries to conceal his movements as he takes a wallet from the drawer, lifts out a bill and tucks the wallet back and turns -- terrified to see Joe close behind him -- almost knocking the lamp off the table in his fright. Pressed against the table, protecting but calling attention to his wallet, Towny holds out the bill.

Towny clutches the table, staring at Joe, shaking his head like a bad little boy. Joe backhands him angrily. Trying to duck the blow, Towny stumbles and slips to the floor, but grabs the table in his arms, watching Joe out of the corner of his eyes, whimpering. Joe grabs his hair, turning his face up.

Joe threatens, swings the lamp down, but stops short of hitting Towny. Towny shrieks -- eyes rolling back as he falls limp -- loosing his grip on the table, leaning on the bed, laughing and crying hysterically. Joe has to step over him to reach the wallet in the drawer. He takes all the money -- probably twice what he needs -- desperate to get out of the room.

... past his reflection, a group of young men on their way to work, carrying lunch pails, dressed exactly as Joe is now dressed...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... then Joe lowers the blind and seats himself. Ratso nods slightly, his voice practically inaudible.
</DIRECTION>
<RATSO>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thanks, Joe.
	</DIALOGUE>
</RATSO>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Shee-it, you know, I got this thing all figured out, Ratso. I mean Rico. When we get to Miami, what I'll do, I'll go to work. I gotta do that, 'cause see, I ain't no kind of a hustler. I ain't even any goddam good as a bum. I'm a nothing, that's what I am. So reckon I'd better go to work and get me a goddam job. Okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
Joe glances at Ratso, but there is no response. Surreptitiously, Joe takes out a cigarette, turns his face away from Ratso and lights it, hiding it cupped in his hand as he smokes.
</DIRECTION>
<JOE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah, guess that's what I'm gonna do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
They ride for a moment in semi-darkness, Joe smoking, looking at the other people on the bus, brighter without the shades down. Joe turns, checking the blanket around Ratso, noticing that Ratso is sitting in a peculiarly stiff, awkward position. Joe leans over to straighten Ratso's head, blocking our view for a moment. Then Joe leans back, frowning, thoughtful. We still do not see Ratso's face. Joe rises slowly, starting forward in the bus...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... passing an older couple, a schoolgirl, two ladies with straw hats, a young man trying to read, pausing when he reaches...
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
... the DRIVER, staring out at the Sunshine Parkway with the Driver, leaning over so he won't have to speak too loudly.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, sir?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My friend's dead in the back seat.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Your friend's what in the back seat?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dead. Dead as a doornail.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is this some kind of...
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
He glances at Joe, then pulls off the road and stands up.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, folks, everything's fine. Nothing to worry about.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
The passengers crane their necks as Joe follows the Driver to the rear of the bus. The passengers at the rear are staring ahead, trying not to see what is going on. The Driver touches Ratso, straightens, touches his hat, but doesn't remove it.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is he kin to you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Joe nods no.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't you want to close his eyes?
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Close them?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just reach over and close them. That's all.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
Joe closes Ratso's eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I guess we'll just drive on, right? Nothing else to do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<JOE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No, sir. Not till Miami. I'll see to burying then.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOE>
<DIRECTION>
The Driver moves to the front and turns to the passengers.
</DIRECTION>
<DRIVER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just a little sickness, folks, nothing serious. We'll be in Miami...
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(looks at watch)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	... in forty minutes.
	</DIALOGUE>
</DRIVER>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GREYHOUND BUS - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Joe sits stiffly, very frightened, as the bus starts on. Then he glances at Ratso, frowning, reaches out an arm and puts it around Ratso, settling back, staring straight ahead.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END
