:SC: LIFE AS A HOUSE
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
FADE IN:
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A clock alarm SOUNDS over TITLES on BLACK. We HEAR someone clearing congested lungs, coughing up phlegm; a slight crash STOPS both the cough and the alarm.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GEORGE'S BEACH SHACK - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The cottage is a tiny, peeling paint rat-trap set dead center on a small ocean front cul-de-sac, surrounded by four massive post-modern mansions.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GEORGE'S BEACH SHACK BEDROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
GEORGE NELSON, 42, squints and shivers as the spotty morning light and ocean breeze enter through an open window. Bold waves crash against the cliffs outside the room. A five-foot wide stack of hand hewed beams are piled pyramid style, making movement in the room next to impossible. George stands shirtless in underwear and coughs again. He steps over a pile of tools and stands at the window, facing the sea. A happy sounding tune by Guster, "WHAT YOU WISH FOR," begins with the lyrics: 'Woke up today, to everything gray and all that I saw just keeps going on and on...'
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. WEBBER'S HOUSE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The post-modern house is three-levels of concrete and glass.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAM WEBBER'S BEDROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
SAM is sixteen with spiky black hair, a nose ring, two earrings and painted black nails. The song continues with: '...sweep all the pieces under the bed, close all the curtains and cover my head.' Sam looks wasted as he climbs out of bed and rummages through his dresser, retrieving an empty bottle of prescription drugs; he tosses the bottle. He walks to a desk where a half-built model of a house sits unfinished and squeezes glue into a plastic bag and sniffs it. Sam enters the closet and digs into a pile of dirty clothes, pulling out the tie to a robe; he knots it around the closet pole and then twists it once to form a noose. He slips his neck through the noose and lowers his body; though we don't see exactly what he's doing below his neck, it's evident through his jerking arm that he's masturbating.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. BECK'S OCEAN FRONT MANSION - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
COLLEEN BECK, George's next-door neighbor, is a well maintained blonde in her late thirties. She walks out of the angular concrete mansion, grabs the paper and walks back in.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BECK'S KITCHEN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
This is a minimalist kitchen, with pored concrete walls and stainless steel cabinets. Colleen drops the paper on the table and walks to the sink to wash her hands. The SONG CONTINUES: '...If this serenade is not what you want, it's just how it is...' Colleen appears distracted for a moment. She walks outside onto the terrace with wet hands, then bolts back in, breezing through the kitchen with purpose.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. ALYSSA BECK'S BATHROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ALYSSA is sixteen and perfect with strawberry blonde hair and white teeth; her head is partially out the bathroom window. Colleen bursts in, eases Alyssa aside and with effort, sticks her head out of the same high open window.
</DIRECTION>
<COLLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is ridiculous!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLLEEN>
<DIRECTION>
We must not see exactly what they see, but out the window and almost beyond view, a stream of urine arks out from George Nelson's beach house bedroom, into the pacific ocean some twenty-feet below. The piss stops. Colleen bangs her head trying to get it back inside the house.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WEBBER'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ROBIN WEBBER is George's ex-wife, still beautiful at forty. She herds two boys, RYAN (8) and ADAM (7), down the hall.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>

Robin stops and KNOCKS on a bedroom door.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope you're showered and ready for school!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<DIRECTION>
A loud CRASH stops Ryan and Adam at the top of the stairs.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAM'S ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robin rushes in and glances around the room for her son.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sam?!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<DIRECTION>
INT. SAM'S WEBBER'S CLOSET - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The closet pole and a long line of clothes have been felled by Sam's dangerous whack-off technique; he's on the floor with the robe tie still around his neck and a pile of shirts sprawled over him. The song continues: '...come out come out, wherever you are, would you do it all over right from the start, and what you wish for won't come true, you aren't surprised to love, are you?'
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robin stops at the door, trying to figure out why her son is sitting in a pile of his own clothes. Ryan and Adam join her, looking equally perplexed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GEORGE NELSON'S CUL-DE-SAC - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George's dog, GUSTER, is doing his business on the lawn of a modern day robber baron, DAVID DOKOS, who exits his house with a briefcase. He hops into his Mercedes and proceeds to chase Guster straight across his well-manicured grass. Guster easily escapes death and runs off. George walks out of his shack as David hops the curb, flips him off and drives away. George waves goodbye.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Stick it up your ass! Have a nice day.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(glancing around)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Guster!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Guster runs to his side as Colleen rushes out of her house.
</DIRECTION>
<COLLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This has got to stop!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLLEEN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He escaped. He's going back in.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<COLLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year-old daughter?
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLLEEN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	There are no windows facing my...exposure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<COLLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	George, this is the third time.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLLEEN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The plumber's due out on Friday.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<COLLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You'll have to explain that to the police.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLLEEN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<COLLEEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I did warn you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</COLLEEN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My life is a warning. I just can't figure out for what.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Colleen shies away from George's stare; he finally turns and walks toward the house but stops short as he turns back.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Colleen, how hard was it for you to get your head outside that window far enough to see my dick?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
This stops Colleen for a moment; it was difficult. George walks back to the cottage and locks Guster in before stepping into an old Ford truck and driving off. Colleen watches him drive off, then turns to her house and stares.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. WEBBER'S DINING ROOM - MORNING
</DIRECTION>

INT. COMMUTER TRAIN - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George is resting his head against the glass window as he stares out at the blighted landscape leading to downtown Los Angeles. A sudden pang tightens his face; he presses his hand against his stomach and closes his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. LAGUNA BEACH HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is alone at the back of the parking lot, sitting on the hood of an old Saab, smoking as two boys, JOSH and MAREK, both seventeen, park a Porsche and pull Alyssa Beck (George's peeping neighbor) and another girl out of the backseat.
</DIRECTION>
<MAREK>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Dude, nice look.
	</DIALOGUE>
</MAREK>

Sam simply nods as Marek and the other girl laugh at his all black garb, earrings and eye shadow.
</DIRECTION>
<ALYSSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I saw your dad this morning.

Sam drops his cigarette and stomps it out as he stands; his face lightens as Alyssa waves before walking away.

	<DIALOGUE>
	They consider that a hatchback or a station wagon? Oh, that isn't yours anyway, is it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSH>
<DIRECTION>
Josh raises his eyebrows and smiles before walking away. Sam faces the Saab and kicks the bumper as hard as he can. Suddenly, a boy (COREY) bolts up from the back seat.
</DIRECTION>
<COREY>

	I was in total REM, man!
	</DIALOGUE>
</COREY>
<DIRECTION>
INT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES HIGHRISE - LATE MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The architectural firm of Benson and Feinsilber occupies the entire fortieth floor; George Nelson is their sole model maker. Rather than offices, most of the space is open, segmented only by portable low walls. Along the outer walls, below the long line of windows, is a shelf filled with amazingly intricate models. George is alone in a cubicle of his own, cutting polystyrene with a hot wire. STEVEN GARDNER rounds a corner with a velocity that makes George flinch.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Done...close to done?

George simply stares as Steven nods and leaves.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL CAFETERIA ATRIUM - LUNCHTIME
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is by himself, his eyes closed, listening to music through headphones as Alyssa stops to stare; she visually scans him head to foot, appearing slightly perplexed as a friend passes.
</DIRECTION>
<FRIEND>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wouldn't make a habit of it.
	</DIALOGUE>

The friend walks on; after a beat, Alyssa does too.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. TOP OF THE WORLD PARK - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the distance, the sun colors the sky a blinding orange as it sets. A Range Rover with blackened windows is parked behind a Porsche. 'TINTED WINDOWS,' an up-tempo tune with a hand clapping by the Pansy Division, begins: 'A bed would be a treat/But all we've got is this backseat/Tinted windows are a beautiful thing.'
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Through the front windshield, we can see Marek sitting in the passenger's seat with his eyes closed.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
ANOTHER VIEW
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Josh, Marek's friend, is sitting on a bench in the park behind the cars. 'A dark secluded spot/In a deserted parking lot/Tinted windows are a wonderful thing.'
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Suddenly, the passenger door on the Rover opens and Marek climbs out, brushing his hair with his hands before casually checking his zipper. He closes the door and the car speeds away. Josh walks to Marek and wordlessly they climb into the Porsche and drive off.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GEORGE NELSON'S BEACH SHACK - DAY
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George is shirtless in his front yard, hand hewing a twenty foot beam. One strong, long pull and a thin shaving flutters to the ground; Guster nabs it and starts to chew.

Nothing. George tries the door - it's locked. Frustrated, he walks back down the hall and down the stairs.

INT. WEBBER'S KITCHEN - AFTERNOON

Outside, the boys are engaged in a raucous version of Marco Polo. Robin is at the sink; she holds her hair back with one hand and splashes water on her face with the other. George walks by outside, carrying a ladder.

<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why does he have a lock on his door?

</GEORGE>
<ROBIN>

The boys line up against the edge of the pool and watch George extend the ladder against the house and climb.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're too late for heroics, George.

George lops a leg over the railing and steps onto the bedroom balcony. He peers into the room through the sliding glass door and tries to open it (locked) before removing the screen to the small open window beside it. He climbs in.

INT. SAM'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is asleep on his bed in his underwear, wearing headphones. On the floor is an aerosol can of whipping cream. George picks up the can and tosses it in the trash. He focuses back on his son with his nose ring, earrings, blue eyeshadow and thin, pale white body. Sam is soundly asleep. George gently removes the headphones from his son's head; drum heavy music surges from the small, padded speakers.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>

A KNOCK on the door stirs Sam more than his father's voice.

Sam's eyes are still closed as he shifts onto his side. George opens the door; Robin is weak and weepy.

INT. SAM'S ROOM - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam rushes over to the window and stares down at the screen and ladder. Ryan, Adam and their friends are still in the pool, holding onto the coping, staring up at Sam. Sam slams the window shut and searches for the can of whipping cream. He gets down on his knees to search under the bed. Standing and making one more pass of the room, he notices the can in the trash. He instantly focuses all his rage at the closed door.

EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - MORNING

The traffic is thick and loud and the sky is a blanket of brown as George makes his way down a sidewalk mixed with professionals and panhandlers. Suddenly sick, George rushes to the side of a building and vomits.

INT. BENSON, KIDDLER, FEINSILBER AND ASSOICATES - MORNING

George wipes a clump of wet paper towel against the vomit stain on his cuff as he walks through the pockets of cubicles to a large enclosed office. A SECRETARY smiles as she stands up from her desk and opens the door.

Bryan grabs a trashcan and holds it up; George tosses the ball into the trash and sits down.

Bryan is rattled by George's blank stare. He takes his glass of orange juice and sits back in his chair, taking a sip, all the while keeping an eye on George.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My wife left me because I wasn't...very emotional. I kept trying to explain that my father sucked all the emotion from me. Drunks do that, sometimes. Make their kids afraid. Make them unwilling to express themselves.

Relieved and not understanding anything about irony, Bryan stands and extends his hand. George shakes Bryan's hand without malice.

	I've got one favor to ask.

</GEORGE>
<BRYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What can I do for you, George?
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRYAN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I built my first model here when I was twenty. There are hundreds of them on shelves around the office. Twenty years of my life. I was wondering if I might be able to pick a few to keep, to take home? Only the ones that really mean something to me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Bryan recoils slightly from the request.
</DIRECTION>
<BRYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work. I could maybe ask them if you could choose one. But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours. They're a part of this firm. They inspire me. I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed. It amazes me. I would miss that too much.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRYAN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<BRYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Well, it's the least I can do.
	</DIALOGUE>
</BRYAN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yes, it is.

George nods and leaves. Bryan looks lost and guilty again.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. BENSON, KIDDLER, FEINSILBER AND ASSOICATES - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George walks around the maze of cubicles back to his own. He finds an empty box and starts to pack. Against a wall, a large rack is filled with spools of architectural plans. George pulls one of the plans down, rolls it out and detaches the wooden spool. Without warning and with a fury hard to fathom, he proceeds to bat and smash a shelf of beautifully rendered models. Heads pop up in other cubicles as George walks out of his own and armed with a frightening rage, methodically attacks model after model resting on shelves just below massive plate glass windows that frame downtown Los Angeles. Steven Gardner, who asked for his model without grass, rushes to within feet of George as he witness his creation deconstruct into shards of cardboard and plastic.
</DIRECTION>
<STEVEN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mother of God! Not my house!
	</DIALOGUE>
</STEVEN>
<DIRECTION>
George stops for a second to focus on Steven, but Steven is smart enough to run. George continues on with the business of disassembling his work.
</DIRECTION>
<VOICE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, please, please, no!
	</DIALOGUE>
</VOICE>
<DIRECTION>
The plea is instantly followed by a pathetic low whine. George works up a sweat as he whacks model after model; portions of plastic walls or window splatter the office as though bombed in war. Bryan Burke's secretary inches as close as she dares.
</DIRECTION>
<SECRETARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Uh...Mr. Burke would like a word with you, George.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECRETARY>
<DIRECTION>
George lowers his stick as he faces her.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh...okay.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<SECRETARY>
	<DIALOGUE>
	In his office. When you're able.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SECRETARY>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
With that, George finishes what he began only minutes prior: the complete and utter destruction of every model displayed on every shelf in the office, save one. Workers huddle together, collectively moaning and moving en mass from the mayhem. George picks up the sole surviving model in his arms and cradles it carefully as he walks into Bryan Burke's office.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

Bryan cowers behind his desk as George enters with his model in one hand and the long wooden stick in the other.

</DIRECTION>
<BRYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Thank you.

George walks around the desk and bashes in a model hidden on the floor, one that Bryan had obviously wanted to save.

	Oh, fuck!

<GEORGE>

George closes the door behind him. Bryan stares down at the remains of the model; he gets down on his knees and carefully gathers up the pieces.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George is sweating as he walks with his box of personal items under one arm and the model under the other. Dizzy, he stops for a moment and tires to orient himself, glancing one way, then the other before staggering back and pressing himself against the building for support. Sweat beads and drops from his nose and chin as the song, 'ACROSS THE UNIVERSE' begins by The Beatles. George sets the box down but clings tightly to the model as he closes his eyes.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
'Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my open mind, possessing them, caressing me...'
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George drops face first to the cement, crushing the model beneath him.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
MONTAGE AS THE SONG CONTINUES
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George is probed and poked by doctor after doctor. An ultrasound test followed by a CT scan, followed by a MRI results in more tests.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A flexible tube is slid down George's throat as dye is shot into his body. 'Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open view, inciting them, inviting me...'
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
A long blunt needle is shoved into George's side for a biopsy of his pancreas. X-rays are lit and highlighted as doctors ponder the specks, the disease.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Finally, George is opened up; nearly bloodless slice through skin, muscle and fat reveals death. 'Limitless undying love, which shines around me like a million suns, which calls me on and on across the universe...'
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George is wheeled down a long hall to the critical care unit. 'Nothing's going to change my world, nothing's gonna change my world...'
</DIRECTION>

Sam dismisses his father without a word - he simply adjusts his face back to the sun. George walks away. A sudden spray of water drenches Sam, forcing him to his feet in a cold panic. George stops the hose water pelting.

INT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George is shirtless in shorts, boiling pasta on a portable stove as he heats a sauce in the microwave. A dresser topped with plyboard serves as a countertop; other than a sink being across the garage near the toilet, this is a fairly well equipped makeshift kitchen.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you want garlic bread?!

George waits a bit to make sure no response is no response. Then stuffs a hunk of garlic bread into the toaster oven.

Sam is sitting on the edge of a cliff that drops twenty feet to the ocean; Guster is whining for attention behind Sam.

Guster is lapping up the dinner, bread and all as Sam calls out again. In a bit of a panic, Sam runs from the cliff.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - EVENING

The traffic is heavy as Sam runs against it. Without a sidewalk and with parked cars blocking a reasonable path, this is a dangerous trek North.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. ALISO CREEK BEACH - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam runs to the edge of the water and anxiously waits for his father to emerge from the sea. A jogger startles Sam - he steps into a wave that soaks his shoes. George floats on a wave into view and stands in waist high water, only to be knocked way back down. He rises and falls and rises before making his way to the sand and Sam.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>

George twists around in bed to face Sam. After a beat, he tosses the sheet back, climbs out of bed, pulls back on his pants, slips on his shoes and walks out of the garage.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GEORGE'S SHACK - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George is up on the roof, hacking through the shingles and beams with a chain saw. A huge dumpster set on the lawn receives only about half the throws George makes. Sam is near the ocean in a chaise lounge, listening to music through his portable CD player.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you got sunscreen on?

George is back with the chain saw, hacking away at the roof. Sam is hesitant as he lies down on his stomach. Alyssa kneels and squeezes lotion on his back. She works it in, starting at his neck, working her way down to his pants. She squirts Sam's arm and as she rubs close to his pit, he squirms.

INT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>

Sam glances out the window to check on his father, then quickly rummages through every drawer and cabinet looking for what he finds: a prescription bottle. It's Vicodin. He checks on his dad through the window again, then opens the bottle and takes out five pills. He fills a glass with water and swallows two, saving three for later. He sets the bottle back where he found it before he drops on the bed with a grin.

Guster is in a full out run for a rubber ball. Sam is shirted, sitting at the patio table. With the ball gladly returned, Sam tosses it again. George walks out juggling two plates of sandwiches and two Cokes and sits down.

He doesn't wait for an answer; as he walks away, Guster follows. George takes Robin's slice of pizza and drops it on the cement; that's all it takes to turn Guster around.

INT. ROBIN'S KITCHEN - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robin is sitting alone at the table, doing nothing. The TV is on loud in another room. Adam walks into the room in his pajamas. He sits down across from his mother at the table. Robin smiles at him. He smiles back as he scoots his chair closer to the table and extends his arms straight out across the top. Robin extends her arms and they lock hands near the middle. Without a word, they hold hands. Adam lets go and climbs on top of the table, scoots across it with a kiss for his mother before he's gone, sliding off the table on his rear and running back to the TV.

George is on the patio, bending a thin piece of copper tubing. Sam storms out of the garage, fuming.

<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No one would blame me if I left!

</SAM>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I can promise you complete privacy.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You can't promise me anything! You don't have anything to promise! You live in a garage! You don't have cable! You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer! You don't have a job!
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
George finishes bending the copper into a circle. He stands and holds the copper circle out for proof of privacy.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This will save you from prying eyes.

</GEORGE>

Sam dismisses his father with a shake of his head. He heads back into the garage.

<DIRECTION>
INT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - EVENING

Sam quickly heads to where George's prescription bottle was hidden under a pile of underwear. He steals two more pills and swallows them before grabbing a towel and walking out.

INT. ALYSSA'S ROOM - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is slowly making his way around the room, taking note of everything: some dried flowers; a yearbook; a cabinet full of CD's; dirty clothes stuffed in a hamper. He walks into the bathroom before walking back out and making one more round.
</DIRECTION>

INT. ROBIN'S FAMILY ROOM - EVENING

Robin is sitting between her sons on the sofa, watching a movie. Peter enters the room, carrying his jacket.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Bro, I need you tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>

Sam bumps an elbow against the glass as he opens the shower door enough to look out. Josh is sitting up on the marble countertop.

	I locked the door.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>

Josh holds up a tiny screwdriver.

EXT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The round copper tube is braced and nailed to the side of the garage; on it hangs a shower curtain. George is making noises inside the curtain as he showers.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Ah! Oh....
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<KURT>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>

George pulls back the shower curtains just enough to see Kurt standing by in his police uniform.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	No hot water.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
George is shivering as he closes the curtain back up.
</DIRECTION>
<KURT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mr. Dokos called to complain that you and a boy are squatting illegally in the garage of your house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURT>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Check the permits. It was built as a guesthouse. It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Without warning, the copper tubing holding the hanging curtain falls to the ground. George turns the water off and grabs a towel. Unfortunately, his ass is not what the towel covers.
</DIRECTION>
<KURT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Now that should be illegal.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURT>

The only thing keeping Sam from staying is Josh, who jerks him out by the shirt.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With Kurt in the only chair, George hands him a cup of coffee and sits down on the pullout sofa, which is pulled out.
</DIRECTION>
<KURT>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm surprised he hasn't left.
	</DIALOGUE>
</KURT>

Sam is gone in a flash. Kurt studies George for a second.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>

Kurt nods; agreed, he's not.

INT. ROBIN'S KITCHEN - EVENING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robin arranges an attractive plate of food, which she sticks in the microwave. Peter walks in wearing different clothes but the same personality.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I hope your ex-husband is equipped for the havoc of Sam, because it seems absolutely blissful here tonight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
He sits down at the table, opening up a newspaper as Robin stares at him.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Should I?
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It would worry me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<DIRECTION>
Peter glances up from the paper, focusing on Robin.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd be you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<DIRECTION>
The answer bothers Robin enough that Peter can't concentrate back on the paper.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll do it if that's what you want.

INT. JOSH'S PORSCHE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam and Josh are parked on a street that overlooks the Valley East of Laguna Beach. They share a joint as Josh explains the specifics of the job.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't have to do a thing. Just get in and get out. As quick as you can. Close your eyes and think of whatever.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSH>
<DIRECTION>
Sam hands the joint to Josh.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What's your deal with Alyssa?

</SAM>
<JOSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't even...I'm there.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSH>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wasn't sure.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<JOSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	She wouldn't even fucking go out with until she was sixteen. I mean, that's not even a rule, just her own thing. She like figures things out on her own and then that's it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSH>
<DIRECTION>
A black Mercedes Benz pulls to a stop a ways down the street. Josh hands Sam a cell phone.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSH>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	If this rings, run.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSH>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is scared and it shows.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSH>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He already knows everything about what he can't do. You can tell him not to even look at you, if you want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSH>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm thinking it's too weird now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Josh pulls a baggie of grass and holds it out for Sam, who takes it and stuffs it in his pants pocket.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It beats working.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSH>
<DIRECTION>
Josh hands Sam the joint.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSH>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Inhale and get out.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSH>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is quick to inhale, but slow to get out. Josh takes the joint and Sam steps out. He walks slowly to the Mercedes, opens the door and climbs in. Josh turns the CD on to Guster's "ALL THE WAY UP TO HEAVEN." Sam closes the door to the Mercedes. 'He said to only look up, he said to never look down, down is where we came from...' It's an odd song sung in a happy tempo; a whistling refrain overtakes the lyrics as Josh inhales. 'He said to hope for the best and take a load off my chest. Soon, I could be happy, and go all the way up to heaven and go all the way back home.'
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With the music loud, Josh misses the police car as it stops behind him without the lights. Too late for a getaway, he fumbles for his cell phone and tosses the joint out the open window. The OFFICER approaches the Porsche with his hand on his gun.
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you toss into the brush?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
Josh furtively presses send on his cell phone as he faces the officer with a guilty face.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Nothing.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSH>
<DIRECTION>
'He said I might need his help, no one gets high on themselves. I just seem so lonely; he's just trying to be nice and spread around his advice. I could be happy...'
</DIRECTION>
<OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Turn off the music!
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
As the music stops, the door to the Mercedes opens and Sam hops out with his pants around his ankles. The officer notices and walks towards the Mercedes. The parking lights flash red as the car starts and flees the scene. Sam yanks up his pants and leaps down the hillside, falling and rolling in the brush as the officer yells for him to stop. Josh starts his car, but the officer dissuades him from leaving by removing his gun. Josh turns off the engine.
</DIRECTION>
<JOSH>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, it's working now.
	</DIALOGUE>
</JOSH>
<OFFICER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did you toss into the brush?
	</DIALOGUE>
</OFFICER>
<DIRECTION>
Before Josh can feign innocence again, the brush starts to smolder. Busted.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. HILLSIDE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is spotted with weeds and dirt as he continues his way down the steep hillside holding up his pants. After he's sure he's safe, he sits down and rests his head in his hands. He starts to shake, frightened by his actions. He drops onto his back, buttons and zips his pants as he starts to cry. Slowly, he stops crying, but keeps staring up at the sky, which is loaded with stars and a full moon. Mesmerized by the brilliant night, Sam can't stop staring.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GEORGE'S SHACK - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George is removing the last of the windows, carefully prying it out of the casement as Robin pulls up in her Range Rover. She steps out dressed in Levi's, boots and a t-shirt, carrying a large bag.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Lunch.

<GEORGE>

<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.

George isn't quite sure how to take her comment. Finally, he points to the Garage.

<GEORGE>

George stares at Robin for a second before he nods.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You were wrong about the first year, you know?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
It takes Robin a second to understand he's saying he loved her when they married.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I've been wrong a lot in my life.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<GEORGE>

Robin glances around, assessing the best use of her time.

<GEORGE>

</GEORGE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>

Robin picks up a pile of splintered board and tosses them in the garbage bin. George nods...he's not.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
LATER
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Robin and George carry a twelve-foot beam from inside the shack and set it down on cinder blocks. Both look exhausted as they head back in for another beam. Sam saunters out of the garage in shorts, sits down on the patio chair and opens the sack his mother had packed for lunch. He pulls out a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and starts eating as George and Robin emerge from the shack with another beam.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Good morning.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Robin and George set the beam down and turn to Sam as they both wipe sweat off their faces. Sam chews his sandwich, ignoring them both.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>

Robin walks close to Sam, trying to capture his attention.

<DIRECTION>
Sam glances up at his mother, just long enough to let her know he hates her, then drops the sandwich and walks back into the garage. A city inspector's car pulls to a stop on the street and BOB LARSON steps out with a clipboard. Robin passes him as she walks back to her Range Rover.

<DIRECTION>
George jerk starts the chain saw again and fashions a small opening above the toilet, ripping through the studs, wire mesh, tar paper and stucco - fine dust invades the space like a storm. Bob coughs as he writes in his book. George kills the chain saw and sets it down as he surveys his work.

	I was holding for someone. That wasn't even mine.

</SAM>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	The game was to make me smaller than he was. No matter what. He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller. So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football. If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough. If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho. I never won the game. Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...

Tears well in George's eyes. Sam is caught up enough in what his father has to say that he has to feign his lack of interest.

<GEORGE>

	You know that great thing, though? Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one. It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.

	<DIALOGUE>
	Or it can just blow you away. Make you something different in an instant. It happened to me.

The sun is fierce, low on the horizon with a heat that distorts the distance. George is sweating and shirtless as Sam walks out of the garage with the gloves on and stands staring at his father. After a beat, George notices him.

George picks up a sledghammer and hands it to Sam. Sam hoists the hefty hammer and with some true effort, slams it on a sideboard. He slams again and again as George picks up a slightly smaller sledgehammer.

<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Don't. I don't want it.

George YELLS as he lands the hammer into the wall again. Sam is alarmed by his father's blatant rage.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do whatever you want with it. I don't care. All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	We haven't build shit. You're just tearing down your father.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Try it. It feels good.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
George strikes another blow to the house joined with a MAD WAIL. Sam starts low, a whisper of a scream, but quickly builds, soon rivaling George in volume as he pounds away. This soul letting, cleansing ritual is both impelling and frightening to watch. Tom and Barbara, Colleen and her maid step out of their houses, drawn and perplexed by the guttural noise.

George is knocking away the forms used to pour the foundation. Sam walks out of the garage with a towel; he shields his eyes from the morning sun as he watches his father work. Without make-up or a nose ring and with the black dye gone from his hair and the polish from his nails, Sam is a handsome kid. George looks happy, laying bare the foundation that will hold his home. Sam walks to Alyssa's house, unseen by his father.

George is prying off the last of the boards when he's hit with a pain that takes him to his knees. He drops the crowbar and sits down in the dirt as Guster walks over to comfort him. George takes deep breaths and closes his eyes as he tries to gain control over the pain.

Sam is anxious. Alyssa takes off her t-shirt and pulls down her panties before grabbing a towel; she hands it to Sam as she forces her way into the shower. Barely visible through the frosted glass, Alyssa wets her hair as Sam stares in her direction. The towel drops to the tiled floor.

MONTAGE

A BLINK 182 SONG BLASTS from the boom box on the patio table. Ryan and Adam slather paint remover on five old painted doors. They work with gloves and brushes and appear meticulous in their application. Alyssa and Sam nail and bolt the corner posts to the rim joist as Robin and George work on the stick framed door deck. While George is moving a little slower than usual, it appears that the pain is nearly gone. As the song ends, Robin rushes toward the radio.

Robin's body moves slightly to the music as she smiles. George grins. The boys aren't sure what to make of the advice. 'You are the beautiful love (my lover), I am the distant shore (so far away). There is so much to uncover (love's hiding). What is this distance for? What is it for?

<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Who's up for a dance?

Robin glances around for any takers, finally focusing on George.

<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(O.S.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Just don't hug me too tight.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
Adam walks to his mother and they hold hands as they dance. Sam sits down to watch. George wears a smile that wipes the last of the pain from his face.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	That's all you get. I'm busy today.

Adam backs away and grabs his paintbrush. Robin stops dancing as she focuses on George.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Let's see if you've gotten any better.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Oh, I'm worse. Much, much worse.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Robin waits to see how worse. George finally walks to her and takes her in his arms. He must have been better than this. The waltz smooths out as they dance closer, holding tighter. "We fill the air with silent stares. But still, no one there, we are strangers." Alyssa decides it's time to go.
</DIRECTION>
<ALYSSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'll see you tomorrow.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALYSSA>
<DIRECTION>
Sam watches Alyssa walk away, but he's quickly drawn back to his mother and father dancing. Ryan appears anxious, unsure of the music and George.
</DIRECTION>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When did you fall in love with my dad?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<DIRECTION>
The dance stops. George lets go of Robin as she focuses on Ryan.

<ROBIN>

	When I found out I was pregnant with you.

INT. GEORGE'S GARAGE - NIGHT
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is on the pull out bed, listening to music through head phones. We HEAR a flush, the armoire doors open and George walks out of the cabinet, washes his hands, turns off the light and drops into bed. A nightlight stuck in a socket above the bed casts a dull blue light over the room. Sam takes the headphones off. After a long silence:
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I took some of your Vicodin.

George turns onto his side to face his son.

	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
George drops back onto his back. He takes his time to answer.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment. But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He's got nothing to do with me.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you. So, I didn't. He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.

George turns onto his side to face Sam again.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I wish you had told me then.

</GEORGE>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'm telling you now.

</SAM>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I gave up on you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What would you be doing now?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Getting high, I guess.

<GEORGE>

	Don't be. And hide whatever that new drug is you have. I like it.

</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
Sam turns away from his father and puts his headphones on. The music bleeds through the headphones in a muffled rumble.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I put a gun to my father's head once.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
George's voice is soft - there's no chance Sam can hear.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever thought like that? I've been thinking...watching you work. How much do you hate me?
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	He was passed out. Just screaming at my mother before. About nothing. Under-cooked meat. I went back to my room... put the barrel close to his ear and chickened out again. Not my dad. Hid in my room. Not even me.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Of course it was a BB gun. But it still would have hurt like hell.

Sam notices his father's mouth moving and takes off the headphones.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you talking?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I was just thinking about my mom. She wouldn't leave him. I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses. I mean it was dark outside and in. But we never talked about it.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Sun glasses?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	To hide a black eye.

</GEORGE>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Why wouldn't she leave?

</SAM>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I would have killed him.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Everything would have been better if you had. You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother. I remember reading about her in the paper. They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you ever wish you had done it?
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>

George thinks about that for a second.

<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I loved him too much.

<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	After everything.

EXT. DAVID DOKOS' HOUSE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Guster is squatting on the lush lawn of the mansion taking a dump. David bursts out from his house, rushes to his black Mercedes and tries once again to run over Guster. No such luck. Guster moves on to another lawn as Mr. Dokos drops over the curb and drives off down the street.

EXT. GEORGE'S BEACH SHACK - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
In the late June afternoon, with a clotted cloud sky, Robin, Adam, Ryan, Sam, Alyssa and George work at building a house. Adam and Ryan are staining the interior doors they stripped days earlier. George and Sam carry large wood beam to the foundation and slip it into the pocket mortise of the laminated beam that spans from pier post to pier post. Robin grabs a drill and screws the cast-in tie down to the wood beam. Alyssa is sawing a rafter in half as her mother walks across the grass with a huge basket of food.

</ADAM>

</ADAM>
<GEORGE>

</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
It's a quick response that draws Robin's attention. Sam lightly bops Adam on the head.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So put your plans of my room in the trash.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<ADAM>

Sam and George stand at exactly the same time and walk back to the house. Without a word, they work together as they continue to frame the house. Suddenly George turns back to the pack of people at the table and loudly proclaims:
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I love you!
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
That's it. He goes back to work as Sam glances at him, amused. Adam and Ryan are surprised and it shows on their faces. Robin smiles.

<PETER>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So am I, Robin. I'm working at something, too. I'm even talking. Do you want to be around for it?

Peter is intense, close up, not giving her breathing room.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I don't know.

Robin whispers her answer. Peter pulls away and settles down on his back. Robin doesn't move for the longest time. Finally, she eases onto her back and turns out the light.
</DIRECTION>
<PETER>

Silence finishes the conversation.

EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
With an extended plate and overhung rafters, the frame takes its form; rooms are roughed in; windows are framed; two gable dormers distinguish the common-rafter roof in the front and a frame for a balcony juts out over the ocean in back. Robin and Adam are locking in and hoisting the sheets of plywood on a pulley system up to Ryan and George, who are stripped down to shorts - George is thinner than ever.

<ALYSSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?

Sam stands still, unsure of his next move.

<ALYSSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Have you ever even kissed a girl?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALYSSA>
<DIRECTION>
Sam appears shocked she would even ask; he hasn't, but she's not supposed to know that. Alyssa makes the move, closes the distance and kisses him. Apart, it appears to be something they enjoyed. Sam wraps his arms around her, presses himself against her and kisses her again. After a few seconds of making out, Sam jerks once, then again as he backs away. Alyssa grimaces as she glances down.

George and Sam are on ladders, reinforcing a window opening on the second floor with a 2x4 spline. Ryan and Adam are flat on their backs on the grass with Guster between them, dog-tired. Robin is at the grill with hamburgers as Alyssa prepares the table for dinner.

<GEORGE>

	How much time do they get to spend with their dad?

<ROBIN>

	What is it with this? They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here! He has no time!

Robin walks away, then back - she's frustrated.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us? She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing! What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there! He's not there! And when he is, he isn't!
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George. I'll stop coming. But it won't be because of Peter. It'll be because you asked me to stop. Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.

<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I'd rather you not be here.

</ROBIN>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	What did I say?

</GEORGE>
<ROBIN>

</ROBIN>
<GEORGE>

	That was the truth.

</GEORGE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You've never said that before.

	It sounded like a pick-up line.

</ROBIN>
<GEORGE>

</ROBIN>

George wants to answer quickly, dismiss the impossible and move on, but emotion catches him off-guard. He forces a smile.

<GEORGE>

	Let's not do this, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>

Robin is surprised by the question. She nods her head.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Absolutely. There's not a doubt in my mind that through all my anger...my ego, I was faithful in my love for you. From seventh grade on.

</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Robin raises her eyebrows - what a revelation.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(CONT'D)

	<DIALOGUE>
	That I made you doubt it, that I withheld it...that's the greatest mistake of a life full of mistakes.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	But the truth doesn't set us free, Robin. I can say it as many times as you can stand to hear it. And all that does, the only thing, is remind us that love isn't enough. Not even close.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>

Tears well in Robin's eyes as she stands.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>

George is slightly out of it with oral morphine; he tires to sit up, but settles for propping up his head.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Can you keep Sam straight?
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<ALYSSA>
	<DIALOGUE>

	I want you to try something with me, okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALYSSA>
<GEORGE>

	I've taken a lot of morphine. Oral morphine...for my back. Can I wait till I can say no and sound convincing?

</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Alyssa leans forward and kisses him; it's a real kiss that lasts a lot longer than it should. And when it's over:
</DIRECTION>
<ALYSSA>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Did you feel anything?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ALYSSA>
<GEORGE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb. Why did you do that?

</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
They both stare up at the ceiling.

INT. COLLEEN'S BEDROOM - EVENING

Josh looks as though he's been struck by a hammer as he lay on his back with his mouth slack. Under the sheet, low down, Colleen is swallowing her pride and showing off her technique. A sudden blaring noise, AN ALARM, pierces Josh's throaty groan. Colleen jumps off the bed, the sheet still haunting her head.

The ocean drowns the sound long enough for Robin to kiss George's chin; and in that instant, the instant where everything but the touch washes away, George kisses Robin with such punch that it knocks them onto the bed. They continue to forget everything as they roll with the punch.

George is too quick with his hug. Josh is stiff as a board. Sam looks pissed as he walks away from the second story window and resumes screwing the floorboards. George sets his eyes on Dale as he opens his arms wide.

Robin stands. George stands because Robin's standing. Without warning, Robin begins to cry again. Ryan and Adam stop playing ball. Sam studies her before finally lowering his eyes. With her kids looking on, George stands still, hesitant to comfort her. There's a moment where all that there is, where the only thing seen or heard is Robin's pain. After an awkward amount of time, she wipes her eyes, wipes her nose, crosses around the table to Sam and kisses the top of his head, then his cheek. Without a word, she walks to her car and climbs in; Ryan and Adam quickly join her in the car.

</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>

</DIRECTION>

	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>
<DIRECTION>

	I love red! That's my favorite color!
	</DIALOGUE>

</DIRECTION>

	<DIALOGUE>
	You don't look like you.
	</DIALOGUE>
</PETER>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Either do you.
	</DIALOGUE>

INT. GEORGE'S HOSPITAL ROOM - AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
George's bed is empty, stripped of everything. Robin is still sitting in a chair beside the bed, a letter resting on her lap. A NURSE stops at the door.
</DIRECTION>
<NURSE>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Are you sure we can't call anyone?
	</DIALOGUE>
</NURSE>
<DIRECTION>
Robin shakes her head "no". The nurse moves on.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
From the outside, the house is finished: windows in, doors on, roof shingled. The sun drops behind the house, causing a halo of bright light to envelop it.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Most of the workers have gone home, because most of the work is done. All the floor are hand-scrapped cherry; huge beams and wood planks lend a strength to the ceiling. The kitchen cabinets are in; the bathrooms are complete. Sam, Ryan, Alyssa, Adam and Peter are the only ones left. Outside, we hear a car pull to a stop.
</DIRECTION>
<ADAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Mom!
	</DIALOGUE>
</ADAM>

</ADAM>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	It's so beautiful.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<DIRECTION>
Adam and Robin are staring at the house. Ryan can see the strain on his mother's face.
</DIRECTION>
<RYAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Is George okay?
	</DIALOGUE>
</RYAN>
<DIRECTION>
All Robin can do is shake her head "no".
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
INT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam backs away from the window. Peter turns to face him. Standing straight as he can, being as brave as he can, tears well in Sam's eyes as he softly shakes. Peter walks to Sam and wraps his arms around him.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I always thought of myself as a house. I was always what I lived in. It didn't need to be big. It didn't even need to be beautiful. I just needed to be mine. I became what I was meant to be. I built myself a life. I built myself a house.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
Sam clings to Peter, completely lost in sorrow.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

Robin is driving with Sam beside her in a low-middle income neighborhood in Santa Ana. Sam is holding the letter.
</DIRECTION>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You're sure about this?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Yeah.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	You could keep it and rent it out?
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	This is what he wants.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<ROBIN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	I read the letter. You read the will. He wants you to keep it. To live in it some day.
	</DIALOGUE>
</ROBIN>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for.
	</DIALOGUE>
<DIRECTION>
(beat)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Maybe it's what I want.
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
It's clear to see that Robin's proud of Sam's decision. She checks an address on a piece of paper and pulls to a stop. Sam steps out of the car, holding the letter.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. SANTA ANA APARTMENT BUILDING - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is shaking slightly as he walks up the cracked concrete walk to the door. He RINGS the bell.
</DIRECTION>
<GEORGE>
<DIRECTION>
(V.O.)
</DIRECTION>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Twenty-one years ago, my father crossed a double-line. He changed my life and the life of a little girl forever with that mistake. I just can't stop thinking about her.
	</DIALOGUE>
</GEORGE>

A WOMAN in her mid-twenties opens the door in her wheelchair.
</DIRECTION>
<WOMAN>
	<DIALOGUE>
	Hello.
	</DIALOGUE>
</WOMAN>
<DIRECTION>
Sam is very nervous as he reaches in his pocket and pulls out a set of keys.
</DIRECTION>
<SAM>
	<DIALOGUE>
	My father built you a house...
	</DIALOGUE>
</SAM>
<DIRECTION>
The woman is confused as Sam holds out the keys.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - MORNING
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
The house is majestic in its setting among the trees and grass, on the jagged just of rock that accepts the constant crash of ocean against it with a solid permanence. This is where, if you were a house, you would want to be built.
</DIRECTION>
<DIRECTION>
THE END.
</DIRECTION>
